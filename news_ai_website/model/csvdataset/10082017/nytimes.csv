5A: Hi, kids! I wasn’t around for ADLAI Stevenson’s presidential campaign either, but I got this and I’ll explain how I did it.

In the mid-20th century, it was apparently fashionable among campaign slogan writers to try to make their slogans rhyme, primarily because it would have been considered laughable at the time to suggest that the candidate might want to have a beer with anyone who wasn’t at least a governor. Slogan writers would sit in small, smoke-filled offices with long lists of words that rhymed with their candidate’s name (“Badly for Adlai?” “No. ...” “Sadly for Adlai?” No!”), and they were released only when they hit on something that was not terrible and could fit on a campaign button. My point is, if you see a clue like “‘Madly for ___’ (1952 campaign slogan),” you have enough information to know that you should be thinking about a midcentury candidate whose name rhymed with “madly.”

42A: The holy Kaaba is a CUBE-shaped mosque in the town of Makka.

49A/57D: It’s unusual to see two words that are so close in current meaning in the same puzzle (YEARN and YENS), especially when they are clued so similarly. The etymology of the two words is different, however, so it’s allowable.

67A: “Even Homer NODS” is an idiom that means that even people who are the best at something can make mistakes during a momentary lapse in concentration. It’s an allusion to the epic poet Homer’s work, which apparently contains errors in continuity.

25D: This is not a comment on SEURAT’s mental health. “Artist who went dotty?” is a comment on his use of pointillism.

“Take Me Apart,” the title song from Kelela’s debut album, is a spiraling, labyrinthine seduction. “You don’t know my bed/well tonight you might find out,” she sings quietly. Within moments a muffled beat has quickened into a thudding double time pulse as she commands “Take me apart.” She backs off, “afraid of fallin’,” only to get swept up again. There’s a swerve, abetted by a jazzy close-harmony choir of Kelelas, as she notes she’s been up late writing a song, then gives a mandate — “Don’t say you’re in love/Until you learn to take me apart” — on the way to another burst of double time and a dreamy, satisfied coda.

Desire and distance, heat and cool course through Kelela’s album. It’s a digital phantasm, a matrix of synthetic sounds enfolding countless tracks of Kelela’s vocals. Yet for all its electronic metamorphoses, the goal it achieves is intimacy, as Kelela whispers and coos about all the shifting modalities of getting close to someone. She makes sure that virtuality leads back to physicality.

The album arrives after lengthy preliminaries. Alongside performers like FKA twigs, SZA and Tinashe, Kelela (whose last name is Mizanekristos) was part of a wave that was called future R&B when she released a mixtape in 2013, “Cut 4 Me.” It announced her alliances with producers associated with the Night Slugs label in England and the similarly minded Fade to Mind label in Los Angeles, who favor subterranean bass tones, abstract syncopations and gaping spaces. Her 2015 EP “Hallucinogen,” with Björk’s frequent collaborator Arca joining her production stable, was more supple but no less spooky.

With “Take Me Apart,” instead of moving from the clubby fringes into commercial pop, Kelela remains stubbornly in between. There are more layers in the tracks, especially of her voice — how many times did she sing these ahs and ohs? — while some obvious signposts of pop structure are concealed. Foregrounds and backgrounds often overlap; verses and choruses aren’t always clearly demarcated. The songs are intricately plotted to give the illusion of being impulsive and obsessive, buffeted by shifting emotions: by turns sensual and wary, vulnerable and guarded, leisurely and urgent.

In “Enough,” the singer is in a triangle, watching her lover’s attention waver between her and his girlfriend. It’s a symphony of instability, with a sputtering beat that comes and goes and cascades of vocal harmony as Kelela swings from euphoria to loneliness to giving the guy another chance to deciding, “It’s not enough.”

Kelela has held on to Arca and her Night Slugs and Fade to Mind collaborators while adding others: Romy Madley Croft from the xx; Mocky, who has often worked with Feist, and Ariel Rechtshaid, the producer and songwriter whose credits include Adele, Usher and Solange. Where all their disparate musical impulses align with Kelela, on “Take Me Apart,” is in their appreciation for Janet Jackson in her “Velvet Rope” era, purring erotic thoughts over state-of-the-art slow-dance grooves.

But in the 20 years since “The Velvet Rope,” pop attention spans have shortened, information has multiplied and the state of the art has gotten more intricate and more mercurial. The tracks on Kelela’s album have multiple sections and transformations, while the lyrics often doubt themselves, testing ambivalences and changes of heart.

“Better,” written by Kelela, Mocky and Ms. Madley Croft, has some hallmarks of the xx. It begins as a somber ballad set to basic minor chords. But its feelings are tangled. She’s singing to someone who, she had decided, “gave it their best/but you still gotta roll”; six months later, that ex is visiting and she has to insist, “We’re better off as friends/Baby you can’t stay.” But memories linger, along with a question: “Aren’t we better now?”",Kelela’s ‘Take Me Apart’ Is R&B That’s Intimate Inside and Out,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/arts/music/kelela-take-me-apart-review.html

5) 9:30 A.M. Farm to Mouth

A morning trip to the trznice (markets) — sprawled across multiple squares behind the Cathedral of St. Nicholas — is a rite of passage. The search for the day’s most important meal begins with a tour of the indoor meat and fish sections. Then sidle up to the locals between the outdoor, umbrella-covered stalls bearing crates of seasonal and local fruits and vegetables. Don’t be shy — haggle for produce, honey, cheeses and nuts under the covered arcade.

6) 11 A.M. Ocean Views

Edibles aren’t Ljubljana’s only homegrown products. For longer-term keepsakes, cross the Triple Bridge and the city’s main piazza, Preseren Square. The internationally acclaimed Marjeta Groselj — look for the G above the door — has been designing one-of-a-kind, handmade leather clutches, purses and bags (500 euros on average) in the same shop for 51 years. After, head to Zoofa, a riverside boutique housing a cooperative of 12 Slovenian designers. A swirl of colors and fabrics, dresses, shirts and jewelry fills the minimalist white space with arched ceilings and hardwood floors.



7) 1 P.M. Local Genius

The architect Joze Plecnik, who died in 1957, still drives the city’s aesthetic. Dozens of landmarks found life on his design table, including the Triple Bridge and National Library. Learn about the enigmatic genius’s process with a tour of the Plecnik House (6 euros), where he lived and worked — pencil stubs, spectacles and packs of cigarettes remain in place — for nearly four decades. Then walk five minutes north to the Krakovo neighborhood for lunch at Pri Skofu. It doesn’t get any more local than this 25-year-old restaurant, where the owner, Maja Pitarevic, makes dishes like gnocchi with arugula and prosciutto (10 euros) from scratch and harvests salad ingredients from community gardens.

8) 4 P.M. Metelkova museums

Perhaps no place in Ljubljana epitomizes the city’s creative repurposing like the Metelkova district. Once a 19th-century Austro-Hungarian army barracks, over the last two decades the complex has found new life as the Museum Quarter. The Slovenian Ethnographic Museum, the National Museum of Slovenia and the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkovashare a quad and provide a convenient way to embrace a far-reaching slate of permanent and rotating exhibitions. For a more unfettered cultural experience, Metelkova Mesto (city), behind the quarter, has driven the alternative scene in the capital for nearly 30 years and is a go-to spot to party. Today the graffiti-strewn collection of studios and bars hosts around 1,500 yearly events, ranging from lectures and workshops to D.J. soirees.

9) 7 P.M. Dinner and Shopping

Slovenia is small, about the size of Massachusetts, but has three wine-growing zones. Take a one-minute walk from Town Square, Mestni trg, for a pre-dinner tasting at Dobrote Dolenjske, where some 350 products, including liqueurs, cheeses and wine — line shelves from the southeast Posavska wine region. For dinner, continue up the brick-lined avenue as it winds past Stari trg (Old Square) to Gornji trg. Secure a table at Repete, a bistro that hosts live jazz sessions. Check the chalkboards for daily specials — like smoked trout on baby spinach and sour cherry pie for dessert — based on what the owners scored at the market. A dinner for two with a bottle of rosé from Sveti Martin, in southwest Slovenia, costs around 50 euros.

10) 11 P.M. Final Exam

Round out your wine education with a final exam at Wine Bar Suklje, where vaulted ceilings shelter some 300 labels (half from Slovenia), filling the bottom floor of a building constructed in 1619. Relax along the river and order a flight of favorites — the wine card changes monthly — or take a blind-tasting pop quiz to see how well your studies have progressed. If you need a cheat sheet, check out the menu’s rock-music-to-wine mood scale, complete with easy-to-read icons next to each bottle.

I have been writing about North Korea since 1992, when President George H. W. Bush’s administration held the United States’ first meeting with Pyongyang since the Korean War to discuss what was then an incipient nuclear program. I had long wanted to visit. What made it possible now is that North Korea, the world’s least transparent country, has decided to embark on a charm offensive, inviting major American news organizations on separate visits this year to learn more about its economic and political goals.

Our trip has not been without some risk, given the way the American student Otto Warmbier, who was detained in Pyongyang after allegedly trying to steal a poster, fell into a coma under circumstances that remain mysterious and died days after being returned to the United States. While I and the other Times journalists were invited by the Foreign Ministry (The Times paid all expenses), the diplomats don’t control the security services, and our attempts to report have been a balance between trying to get the most authentic information we can (a struggle) and not running afoul of security. Two government minders accompanied us except when we were in our rooms.

We were allowed to visit a silk factory, the science and technology complex (computers are connected to an internal intranet, not the internet), an elite high school and an anti-American war museum, as well as an amusement park, restaurants and a dolphinarium — evidence of Kim Jong-un’s efforts to allow citizens of Pyongyang, where the elite live, opportunities for fun. Our requests to see the three remaining American detainees were refused. Despite such controls, there have been some moments of spontaneous humanity. After dinner one night, a senior official led me briefly in ballroom dancing on the sidewalk outside a restaurant.

I most wanted to learn whether the North Koreans were open to nuclear talks with the United States and what it might take to get a deal. In the 1990s, the two sides reached an agreement that froze the North’s plutonium program for eight years and made progress on missile limits. But these initiatives fell apart in the George W. Bush administration, and today North Korea has at least 20 nuclear weapons and missiles that may soon be able to reach the continental United States, a level of technological prowess that Mr. Trump has said he won’t tolerate.

In Mr. Choe’s telling, North Korea was driven to become a nuclear power in self-defense against America’s “nuclear blackmail,” sanctions, history of confrontation, and affront to the sovereignty and dignity of the state. The North must establish “a balance of power” to hold Washington at bay, finally replace the Korean War armistice with a permanent peace treaty and focus attention on economic development, he said. Therein seemed to be the answer to my question of whether and under what circumstances the North would be open to talks. Only when Washington makes a “bold decision” to end its military exercises with South Korea, halt sanctions and cease moves that diplomatically isolate North Korea can a dialogue between the two countries bear fruit, he added.

Our interviews have persuaded me that it is also imperative for Washington to ease up on the rhetoric. Mr. Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month crossed a line for many North Koreans because it made the fight deeply personal, disparaging Mr. Kim as “rocket man” and threatening to “totally destroy North Korea,” a country of 26 million people.

The Trump administration insists there can be no talks until the North halts missile and nuclear tests for an unspecified period. Hence, stalemate, and a dangerous one. Allowing the shouting match and muscle-flexing on both sides to gather momentum can come to no good.",Seeing the North Korean Stalemate From the Other Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/opinion/sunday/north-korea-stalemate.html

Moonee is six. She lives in the shadow of Disney World, in a stretch of central Florida dominated by cheap thrills and off-brand amusements. Home is a room in a motel called the Magic Castle, one of many garishly painted stucco-clad palaces whose names represent either false advertising, honest aspiration or brutal irony. This is an unmagical kingdom, a zone of tawdriness and transience, of strip clubs and strip malls, knockoff souvenir shops and soft-serve ice cream shacks.

But for Moonee (who is played by an uncannily poised and resourceful young actress named Brooklynn Prince), the Magic Castle and its surroundings are a land of endless enchantment and nonstop adventure. Mischievous and fearless — heroically bratty; devilishly cute — Moonee may remind you of Eloise, who tries the patience of the grown-ups at the Plaza Hotel in that immortal picture book. Their situations are different, of course. Moonee’s mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite), is not jetting around Europe leaving her daughter in the care of a stressed-out nanny. She’s very much a presence in Moonee’s life, perhaps more big-sisterly than maternal, but doing whatever she can to keep them housed, clothed, fed and entertained.

Video

What “Eloise” shares with “The Florida Project,” Sean Baker’s risky and revelatory new film, is the ability to tell its young heroine’s story from two perspectives at once. Moonee’s free-range existence looks like a lot of fun, and she and her friends — mostly a boy named Scooty (Christopher Rivera) and sometimes a girl named Jancey (Valeria Cotto) — run wild with an exuberance that adult viewers can only envy. Moonee and Scooty are like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer; the service road is their Mississippi River. They cook up pranks and follow their whims, heedless of the consequences.

But of course the viewer who experiences vicarious delight in their capers — ice cream tastes so much sweeter when you have conned some tourists into paying for it — is simultaneously conscious of an undertow of sorrow, anxiety and dread. We are well aware of the possible consequences, and also of the grim circumstances that grant Moonee her freedom. She is in every sense a child at risk. We watch her Little Rascal antics increasingly sure that something terrible is going to happen.

To balance joy and desperation as gracefully as Mr. Baker does — to interweave giddiness and heartbreak — is no easy feat. “The Florida Project” could easily have been cruel and exploitative, punishing its characters for their wildness and the audience for enjoying it. But the director, who wrote the script with Chris Bergoch, avoids the traps of condescension and prurience that ensnare too many well-meaning movies about poverty in America. Like Mr. Barker’s earlier features “Starlet” and “Tangerine,” this movie insists on meeting people on both sides of the screen where they are, on suspending judgment and extending compassion without abandoning its ethical grounding.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

“I want you to know that you are a model of triumph,” he wrote. “And when you triumph you become a threat to people who would rather you fail.”

He continued, “If they can’t keep you down by discrimination, then they have attempted to keep you down by terror, by instilling fear in you, in me.”

The decision by Senate Republican leaders may prove to be a milestone in the decades-long fight over health insurance in the United States, suggesting that the Affordable Care Act had gained at least a reprieve and perhaps a measure of political acceptance.

Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the panel, have been working on legislation to stabilize insurance markets and hold down premiums in the next couple of years. Both said on Tuesday that they hoped to resume those efforts.

Millions of people who buy insurance on their own face sharp increases in premiums next year, and Trump administration officials have taken a number of steps that have already undermined the operations of the health law.

And health care is sure to be an issue in next year’s midterm elections.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said the concept behind the Graham-Cassidy bill would help Republicans define their differences with Democrats in the campaign season.

“Single payer, socialism — or federalism, returning power to the states to make decisions,” Mr. Thune said. “I think that’s a great contrast for us, and I think that’s an argument eventually we can win.”

For their part, Democrats have tried to use health care as a bludgeon against the few Senate Republican targets they have next year, mainly Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

“We know Republicans like Dean Heller and Jeff Flake won’t stop until they force Americans to pay more for less, and we will make sure voters hold them accountable for it,” the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said in a statement this week.

The Graham-Cassidy bill would have taken money provided under the Affordable Care Act for insurance subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid and sent it to states in the form of block grants.

The bill’s demise was welcomed by consumer groups, doctors, hospitals and insurance executives who mobilized opposition to the proposal. The Congressional Budget Office said Monday that the bill would have reduced projected federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over a decade, added millions of Americans to the ranks of the uninsured and eliminated consumer protections for some people with pre-existing conditions.

Senate Republicans tried in July to approve a repeal bill, but that attempt ended in defeat when Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, gave a thumbs-down, killing that version of the legislation.

This time, Senate Republicans were trying to pass a different proposal, and a deadline was fast approaching: They had only until the end of this week to pass a repeal bill using special budget rules that shield it from a Democratic filibuster.

Mr. McConnell had planned for a vote before that deadline, but he could afford to lose only two Republicans. By Tuesday, three members of his party had already gone public with their firm opposition: Ms. Collins, Mr. McCain and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.

None of the three senators seemed likely to change their minds. Mr. McCain detested the hasty, partisan process used to push the bill; Ms. Collins had broad concerns about the legislation’s effects on health care; and Mr. Paul objected to the fundamental architecture of the bill, which in his view constituted “fake repeal.”

Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he saw no reason for the Senate to vote.

“If you don’t have the votes,” he said, “I don’t see why we would waste the time of the Senate.”

And other Republican senators might have opposed it had party leaders moved forward. In a statement released after Senate Republicans decided not to do so, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted against the last repeal attempt in July, denounced what she described as “a lousy process.”

“The U.S. Senate cannot get the text of a bill on a Sunday night, then proceed to a vote just days later, with only one hearing — and especially not on an issue that is intensely personal to all of us,” Ms. Murkowski said, without saying which way she would have voted.

Mr. Cassidy was blunt: “We don’t have the votes,” he said, adding, “Am I disappointed? Absolutely.”

And Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, was left fuming.

“I am kind of disgusted that after nine months, the self-interest is still outweighing the national interest in our caucus in some ways,” he said.

But Mr. Graham still held out the hope that the repeal proposal would pass — just later, after Republicans tackle taxes, and when Republicans can consider the repeal plan in a more deliberative fashion.

“There are 50 votes for the substance,” Mr. Graham said. “There are not 50 votes for the process.”

But that could be months away — if not years.

The tax effort will probably occupy Congress through the remainder of this year, and into next year.

After tackling the tax overhaul, Republicans could make another attempt at passing a health bill without needing any Democratic votes. But such an undertaking would require passing yet another budget blueprint, in order to protect the bill from a Democratic filibuster, and it would put health care front and center as lawmakers head into the midterm elections.

Even as Republicans shift their focus to taxes, pressure is building for a bipartisan response to the problems of the health care system. The Alexander-Murray stabilization package has two main elements: money for subsidies paid to insurance companies, to reimburse them for reducing out-of-pocket costs for low-income people, and more freedom for states to revamp their insurance markets.

Democrats see the cost-sharing subsidy payments as essential. But many Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have described them as a bailout for insurance companies that would prop up the Affordable Care Act.

“I think most of the members would suggest they really don’t know that they can stabilize the product at this stage of the game,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota. “I think there’s a number of them that are going to be very hesitant to try to put more money into a system that they are convinced is going south.”

Earlier Tuesday, with little hope of success in the Senate, Mr. Trump expressed his displeasure.

“At some point there will be a repeal and replace, but we’ll see whether or not that point is now or will it be shortly thereafter,” he said at the White House. “But we are disappointed in certain so-called Republicans.”

The failure in the Senate was also a disappointment to Republicans in the House, who managed to pass a repeal bill in May after their own struggles.

“We’re a little frustrated that the Senate has not acted on a seminal promise,” said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.

Then he returned to talking up the need for a tax overhaul.",Senate Republicans Say They Will Not Vote on Health Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/politics/mcconnell-obamacare-repeal-graham-cassidy-trump.html

They wait on a platform at the Milan train station in 1970, their many suitcases secured with rope, their bags filled to the brim. A box of panettone, a Milanese holiday specialty, accompanies this family of travelers, suggesting Christmastime. Dressed for the cold, the family of five — parents, children, and an older woman wearing black from head to toe — gaze to the right, pondering perhaps their unknown destinies. We see them in Gianni Berengo Gardin’s photograph, shot at mid-distance from above, a portrait of Italy as a migrant nation.

I know these people.

Photo

No, they are not my family, but they could be. My parents left their respective mountain towns for New York City two decades earlier than those in the photo, fleeing the destruction, the penury and the hopelessness of post-World War II Italy.

The family on the platform could have easily been one of the multitudes of migrating Italians I encountered on trains when I lived in Milan and Bologna in the mid-1970s, traveling between their hometowns and northern Italian cities, Switzerland, Germany, and other enchanted places of drudgery, sacrifice and desires, temporary stops along an unending journey toward security.

Indeed, Italians keep leaving now, not with the same desperation of the undereducated masses that changed the course of nations in North and South America beginning in the 19th century, but with college degrees and smartphones in hands, grasping for opportunities their country remains incapable of providing.

These images from the mid-20th century capture the ubiquity and possibility of travel and escape, from the gaggle of scugnizzi (street urchins) hitching a ride on the back of a Neapolitan tram to a couple cuddling in their bathing suits, nestled between train tracks. I know them too, having met them in my own travels across the peninsula, heard about them in family stories on both sides of the Atlantic, and encountered them through the countless viewings of films by the likes of Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni.

Photo

The 31 black-and-white images displayed in the London gallery exhibition of Gardin’s work, “The Italians,” are, for the most part, those he made in the midcentury, when Italy hovered between agrarian provincialism and an internationally touted cosmopolitanism. The meta-image of an Asian tourist posing for a photographic portrait against a Mediterranean backdrop highlights Italy as destination, in stark disparity to the fleeing migrant family.

Contrasts are a leitmotif for Gardin, as seen with the seven girls in communion whites delighted by a dark-haired dog before them, or the jangle of men on a train, caught in mirrored reflections. The pairing of Italy with style and leisure is found in the photos of an elegantly veiled woman in sunglasses and pearls aboard what appears to be a Venetian water taxi, and the portly man in bathing trunks beatifically splayed on an outcrop, the sea below a resounding swirl.

Photo

Gardin is a master of the patterned panorama, vistas of startling beauty shot from above: In one image a donkey-driven plow cuts a billowing swath across an astonishingly stark landscape and in another, two men scurry across a plank in a flooded Piazza San Marco. These are captured flashes of haunting revelation.

His images are not merely of the real, the documented — they are also reveries of the imagination. Lovers, clothed but barefoot, embrace on a beach. A blanket, a pair of shoes and vinyl records in the foreground.

I know them, too.

Valedictions are few, and after a long and brilliant career, it is surely churlish to begrudge the need for one. But when Philip Roth revealed, in 2012, that he had written his last novel — with multiple interviews, the preparation of papers for his biographer and later a documentary — it was hard not to compare his exit style to that of his contemporary, Alice Munro. The Nobel laureate simply slipped her intention into her last story collection, “Dear Life,” writing in a preface to the final four “not quite stories” that they were “the first and last — and the closest — things I have to say about my own life.” What followed had the quality of something long distilled but freshly reconsidered. It was a return to origins, to the fox farm and the mother who wanted more, recounted with the ambiguity and the long-view-down-the-telescope temporal shifts characteristic of Munro’s work. If it was the end, it was a fitting one, the kind that makes you want to begin reading her all over again.

Film actors, preserved whole body at specific ages and available on instant download, have an especially complex relationship with public memory. Most of us do not know Daniel Day-Lewis, nor is he the sort of person to be photographed at the Malibu Country Mart, but we have an impression of him from his choice of characters and what he brings to them: a puckish charisma and a scene-devouring devotion to craft, but also, in his less adrenalized performances, something finer. I will remember especially his Cecil Vyse, the pompous, pince-nezed aesthete wrongly engaged to Lucy Honeychurch in “A Room With a View,” the Merchant Ivory adaptation of E.M. Forster’s novel, and the vulnerability he found in a comic and deeply coded character.

Forster himself stopped publishing novels at the peak of his career, after “A Passage to India” came out, in 1924. Only 45, he must have been weary, one can’t help but think, of all the coding. He died in 1970, leaving behind the manuscript for “Maurice,” a love story between two men. “Publishable — but worth it?” read a note found attached to the manuscript. The novel, with its happy ending, found its own a year later.

WRITING IS THE MOST private performance of all, and while we respect the productive literary recluse, the Pynchons and Dickinsons, we are troubled by those who seem to crumble under the weight of their own success, such as Harper Lee, who never finished a book after “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Art doesn’t come without great effort, and it’s easy to underestimate the burden of expectation. Stephen King has found retirement so relaxing he’s written more than a dozen novels since he announced he would stop in 2002.

For some authors of the 20th century, narrating a self was a mode of survival. I think of Edna O’Brien’s extraordinary 2012 memoir, “Country Girl,” which is both a celebration of a life vibrantly lived, filled with legendary love affairs and photographs of her backlit in diaphanous skirts — and also a horror story about the personal costs involved in pursuing her work. It ends with the image of a room “readying itself for a last banquet,” a promise she’s lived up to, publishing a novel at 84, as well as an edition of her collected stories, reminding us, not that we needed to be reminded, of her greatness.

To announce a retirement is on some level a way of stage-managing one’s own legacy; it’s not unlike attending your wake and getting to hear what everyone has to say. Of course, many retirements don’t stick. Generally there are no hard feelings about this, because the only thing we love more than a “new voice” is a comeback, especially when it’s someone like David Lynch, returning for more “Twin Peaks” wizardry after 10 years without a feature film. Some retirements are transparently hiatuses-as-publicity-stunts — Quentin Tarantino, Jay-Z — while others are a blatant critique of the industry the leave-takers have made their career in, like Steven Soderbergh, who has turned to less studio-dependent projects.

For women in Hollywood, retirement is rarely of their own choosing. Here I think of the Amy Schumer sketch in which Tina Fey and Patricia Arquette toast Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s “last f-able day,” sending her off in a rowboat with a cigar. That they are, in fact, the exceptions who have managed to keep working made it easier to laugh.

To flee the spotlight at the height of one’s powers takes a certain kind of courage. Even Greta Garbo, that genius of myth creation, a recluse at 36 in the wake of “Two-Faced Woman,” the 1941 film she referred to as “my grave,” seemed to find retirement a little lonely.

In the art world, pulling a Garbo may be especially risky. It can fall a little flat, as when Marcel Duchamp gave up art for chess, only to baffle everyone with “Étant Donnés,” an elaborate secret final piece two decades in the making that involved a heavy antique door and a diorama of a nude holding a lamp sprawled on a bed of twigs. Lee Lozano broke into the 1960s New York art scene with phallocentric paintings of tools and machinery, but began to withdraw in 1970, the year of her solo show at the Whitney — rare for a woman artist of her time — retiring for good with “Dropout Piece.” “Artist, critic, dealer and museum friends, in fact, almost everybody: I still smell on your bad breath the other people’s rules you swallowed whole so long ago,” she had written in her journal. She faded into obscurity. The influential contemporary sculptor and installation artist Cady Noland, who effectively dropped out of the art world in 1999, has taken to writing disclaimers that she does not approve of the exhibition of her work when it occasionally appears in galleries and at art fairs. Disavowal is the purest commentary, but it’s not a very satisfying one.

And yet creativity isn’t always in infinite supply. Some rage on against the dying of the light, like Iris Murdoch or Willem de Kooning, despite diminishing returns. For every Lucian Freud, who painted his pending mortality into his late portraits of friends, creating masterpieces through his 80s, there’s a Norman Mailer, the author who claimed that the inner lives of great novelists were comparable to those of heavyweight boxing champions, and perhaps himself went a few rounds too many.

Perhaps we could all take a page from our master of solitude, Annie Dillard, who stopped writing in the last decade and took up painting when she no longer could carry the book around in her head, as she told David Remnick in a 2016 interview: “We’re here under conditions, and you either accept them or fight them, but the conditions aren’t going to change at all . . . so you might as well accept them.”

Art freezes time. Day-Lewis’s repressed Edwardian, Munro’s young women too smart for their own good. Immortality is, perhaps, what every artist wants. To be told that those who reflect our existence are merely human reminds us that we are, too.",What Does It Mean When an Artist Retires?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/t-magazine/art/artist-retire.html

In an email, Mr. Guglielmi said the punishment was consistent with that in “other cases in which officers engaged in potential political activity while on duty and in uniform.” This year an officer was reprimanded for displaying a “Make America Great Again” hat in a squad car, he said.

“Police officers must serve and protect people on both sides of any given issue,” Mr. Guglielmi said. “They can’t effectively do that if they are perceived to take one side over another. So when officers are on duty and wearing the uniform, there are no sides, just service to anyone who needs them.”

Asked whether that meant the officers who posed with Ms. Clark would not have been reprimanded if they had taken the photo while off duty and out of uniform, he said, “Absolutely.”

The photo was particularly resonant in Chicago, a city where the Justice Department found in January that the police had frequently violated civil rights; where civil rights groups filed a lawsuit in June alleging police abuses; where protests erupted over the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald; where an officer was convicted in August for shooting two black teenagers in a car that was driving away from him. The city’s police and politicians have been trying in various ways to gain residents’ trust.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters on Tuesday that he supported the decision to reprimand the officers, and that the Police Department’s policy was consistent. But he acknowledged that the officers “were somewhat betwixt, between two different aspirations”: the desire to follow department rules and the desire to improve relations between the police and the public, The Sun-Times reported.

Kneeling took on popular significance as a form of protest in 2016, when the National Football League player Colin Kaepernick did it during the national anthem. But when President Trump denounced it last week, what had been isolated actions exploded into a national display of defiance, with players from New York to Indianapolis to Los Angeles dropping to their knees on the sidelines of their Sunday games.

More than that, boy, you’re risking everything.”

This “Strange Interlude” won’t be the longest straight play staged in New York in recent years — that honor belongs to Elevator Repair Service’s eight-hour “Gatz.” It’s certainly not the longest solo, clocking in at only a quarter of the length of Taylor Mac’s “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music.” But it is an occasionally lurid interwar ragout of sex, death and boat races. It is also probably one of the last times anyone decided to name a dashing romantic swain Gordon. Censored in New York and banned in Boston, the play nevertheless became an unlikely Broadway hit.

O’Neill joked that if the play were a sandwich it would be “a four-decker with nothing but ham.”

Mr. Greenspan has been chewing on that for a while now. In the summer of 2013, he, Transport Group’s artistic director, Jack Cummings III, its dramaturge Krista Corcoran Williams and a couple of associates met for an artistic residency in upstate New York. They’d all enjoyed working together on “The Patsy.” Now they wanted a project “to go deeper and further with,” Ms. Williams said.

So Mr. Greenspan read “Strange Interlude” aloud, which took him seven or eight hours. And the company agreed to produce it. Mr. Greenspan has been rehearsing ever since.

The published script runs 190 pages. Mr. Greenspan worked through the acts one at a time, putting in four to five hours a day, five to six days a week even while rehearsing, performing and touring other plays. Last year, Mr. Cummings gave him a cameo in his William Inge double-bill just to keep Mr. Greenspan around and on salary while he worked. This summer, while appearing in “Minor Character” in Connecticut, he requested a rehearsal space as part of his contract. “I had to memorize Act 8,” he said.

Mostly, Mr. Greenspan works at home, in the small one-bedroom in Westbeth Artists Housing that he shares with his partner, the teacher and painter William Kennon. He moves their furniture around to replicate the set and takes breathers to feed their two cats and one German Shepherd. Sometimes he borrows Mr. Kennon’s painting studio.

On a good five-hour day, he can learn perhaps two pages. But often it’s less. “Line by line,” he said. “Sometimes you learn just a few words, sometimes a sentence. It’s very deliberate.” Ms. Williams, who has often observed him, described the process as “mind-numbing and thrilling in kind of equal measure.”

Mr. Greenspan prizes accuracy. In rehearsal he scolded himself for missing “and” in one sentence, “the” in another. But for him, memorizing means more than rote learning or brute-force drills. It means discovering in each line “what the intentions are, what the feeling is, what the state of being is, what the emotional state is,” he said.

He tries to make his characters as full and real as possible, figuring out how they move, how they think, how they sound. From there he develops a map of each act, “like making up a dance in a way,” he said, a dance he then fine-tunes with Mr. Cummings and his team.

Sitting in the rehearsal room, he cycled though some of this choreography. He stuffed his hands into his pockets for Ned, then gave his neck a sensual stroke as Ned’s lover, Nina, then knit his fingers as Nina’s forbidding father, Professor Leeds. Each character was conjured with what looked like minimal effort and eerie, easy grace. Then Mr. Greenspan stood and played the bit where Ned hands the prescription to Sam. One man moved to offer it; another snatched it away. The effect was delightful, and also unnerving.

Ms. Williams said that watching the full production can feel “like you’re either on drugs or experiencing some kind of religious reckoning.”

“There is something that happens when you’re in the room that long with one person doing something this audacious,” she continued.

For Mr. Greenspan, the effects are mellower. When he finishes a run-through he feels “good afterward,” he said, “neither tired or exhilarated.” And if there is lingering excitement “a little herbal tea will, I think, handle that.”","A Eugene O’Neill Marathon: 1 Actor, 1 Script, 5 Hours",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/theater/david-greenspan-eugene-oneill-marathon-performance.html

Americans are deeply split along demographic lines, but there aren’t many demographic characteristics that embody America’s cultural divide better than gun ownership.

In the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday, the polling firm SurveyMonkey published a pair of maps from its 2016 presidential election exit polls. It showed the electoral maps for voters who said they had a gun in their home, and for those who said they did not.

In every state but Vermont – perhaps the most liberal state in the country, but one where many, including Bernie Sanders, support gun rights – voters who reported living in a gun-owning household overwhelmingly backed Donald J. Trump.

The opposite is true for voters who said they did not live in a home with a gun. In all but one state that could be measured, voters overwhelmingly preferred Hillary Clinton. (The exception was West Virginia; not enough data existed for Wyoming.)

Over all, gun-owning households (roughly a third in America) backed Mr. Trump by 63 percent to 31 percent, while households without guns backed Mrs. Clinton, 65 percent to 30 percent, according to SurveyMonkey data.

No other demographic characteristic created such a consistent geographic split.

Comparable to the Racial Divide

American politics is deeply divided by race, and the gap between white and nonwhite voters is similar to the gap between households with guns and those without. But Mrs. Clinton won white voters, often by a wide margin, in 10 states and Washington, D.C., worth 139 electoral votes in all. And Mr. Trump may have been competitive among nonwhite voters in a few conservative states, like Oklahoma. (The poll data among nonwhite voters is sparse in several small states and subject to a considerable margin of sampling error.)

Nonwhite voters White voters

The split among white voters without a college degree and the rest of the country is also distinct. But Mr. Trump would have probably won without white working-class voters in several states, particularly in the Great Plains, according to the SurveyMonkey data.

Everyone but working-class whites Working-class whites

This is not to say that gun ownership is a bigger divide in American politics than race or the combination of race and education, or a bigger driver of America’s political divide. After all, part of the reason gun ownership splits voters so starkly is because gun owners are more likely than Americans generally to be white, less educated and living in a rural area. Over all, 83 percent of gun household voters were white in 2016, according to the SurveyMonkey data.

But it might not be merely demographics. Mr. Trump appeared to fare better in the SurveyMonkey data among gun-owning households than non-gun-owning households even after considering the voters’ race and education. He won white voters without a degree who lived in gun-owning households by 74 percent to 21 percent. He even won college-educated white voters in gun-owning households, 60-34, and fared better among nonwhite voters in gun households, losing, 61-34. Mrs. Clinton won nonwhite voters over all, 75-21.

Even so, education, race and religion tend to do a better job of predicting an individual’s presidential vote choice. It is probably fair to say that gun ownership embodies America’s partisan divide more than it drives it.

The Urban-Rural Divide

Urban voters Rural voters

For that same reason, density also comes close to approximating the divide between households with guns and those without. Not only does it correlate with gun ownership, but it also correlates with race and education.

Marriage

Unmarried voters Married voters

Marriage rates are also correlated to today’s political divide. Unmarried adults are likelier to be young and nonwhite, and concentrated in urban areas. But it’s not as strongly tied to a political issue. In this respect, gun ownership is unique among the demographic or household characteristics considered so far.

Other categories that blur the line between demographics and issue politics – like religion, union membership and military service – don’t yield such a pronounced split.

Religious divisions

Non-evangelical voters Evangelical voters

Atheist or nothing in particular Protestant or Catholic voters

Seldom or never attend church Attend church at least once a week

Religiosity – how often someone goes to church – has been a strong predictor of party affiliation, with frequent churchgoers much more likely to be be Republicans. The political preferences of more religious Americans yield a deeply red map, with religious voters from just three (relatively large) states – California, New York and Maryland – preferring Mrs. Clinton. Nonwhite voters most likely represent a disproportionate share of Democratic-leaning religious voters in many of these states.

On the flip side of this relationship are the religious “nones,” a large and growing group of voters who are atheist or do not identify with a religion. These voters tend to be younger than the overall electorate, one reason they strongly preferred Mrs. Clinton in 2016.

Tricky Clues

A lot of the nonthemed clues in this puzzle had clever twists, which I think increase the difficulty and the enjoyment of solving a big Sunday grid.

15A: “Gasoline may make it go” turned out to be a pretty grim type of combustion, ARSON. I ran through a long list of vehicles and yard and garden tools before this became apparent.

22A: “Change of locks?” had to be a pun, as indicated by the question mark. Looking back, I don’t know why I starred this clue as a toughie since NEW DO is such an apt entry, but that’s often a sign that a clue is just elegant.

95A: I don’t stay up on my Disney much, so when I saw “Big 2016 film set in Polynesia” I searched my recent memory for a serious movie. I figured out MOANA through a few crosses and had a “D’oh” moment because of course in New York you can’t go a day without hearing about some insane accomplishment by Lin-Manuel Miranda (who co-wrote this movie’s music). So really this should have rang a lyrical bell.

96A: I worked on “Cab alternative” by trying to think of rivals to Uber, with three letters. Instead I should have been looking for alternatives to Cabernet, similarly shortened — in this case, ZIN.

106A: I was misdirected by this clue, “Consider it done”; since the entry appeared in quotations, I took it for a theme answer and left it until later in the game to fill in. It finally finished as I SHALL, which almost made the grade since there is an actual state concealed in there (ALabama). But the other rules of this theme are broken here, and it’s actually pretty hard not to use any of the 50 two-letter state abbreviations in nonthemed answers in a puzzle. Pulling that off would’ve been pretty amazing.

15D: “Firmly in place” was one of a handful of straight clues I didn’t get, for some reason. I guess I gravitate toward more chicanery on a Sunday and managed to fixate on some variation of tongue in cheek, but this was simply ANCHORED. I struggled with the across clues that furnished the first two letters of this answer, and a couple of other crosses were a bit tricky (including TD BANK, one of those entries that makes sense but makes for an illogical fill until it’s completed).

42D: The radio led me astray when I got to this clue, “Part of a recovery effort.” Too many disasters at once — hurricanes and earthquakes — had me racking my brain for something like “search and rescue” that would fit the grid. Instead the puzzle was hinting at a more personal cataclysm, and it took a while for me to fill out “AA MEETING”; another example of a clue with gnarly, unusual twinned letters to make you doubt yourself when solving.

52D: I got this in its entirety only from crosses, and still looked at it skeptically until checking out its etymology; TOP HOLE just made no sense to me for “First-rate, in British slang.” Turns out that it’s very similar in origin to top notch, both of them finding their roots in horse-jumping, where the best horses soar over the highest bar or rail of a fence, which is held in place by pegs in either a hole or a notch, sort of. I mean, pish posh, folks. Maybe you use “top hole” every day, but in my defense this is only the third usage in the puzzle since 1965. If you knew it then top hole, old chap!

65D: I consider this clue, in retrospect, to be the yin to 42-Down’s yang. “Getting help getting clean” made me think of renting a power washer before being IN REHAB.

All that British slang research brought to mind this little gem from our own archives. If you haven’t seen it already there are some top-hole touches:

FRIDAY PUZZLE — TGIF, everyone! What a way to kick off the weekend; Damon Gulczynski has returned for his seventh themeless puzzle this year, and like all the rest of his work, it’s chock-full of pizazz.

Themelesses by their nature have numerous longer entries, and they show off overall vocabulary as opposed to an interesting theme, with a few fun nuggets of surrounding fill. However, there are many different styles to actually creating a themeless that should be noted. Some constructions are focused on a formidable-looking grid that has super smooth fill and a low word count. Other grids are less open, yet their longer answers are much flashier and thus allow the solver to overlook any dull, shorter fill.

Today, Mr. Gulczynski presents us with a hybrid of this concept: at 70 words total, he hasn’t quite reached the maximum allowed for a themeless (72), and yet the grid doesn’t appear very open. However, every answer of eight or more letters ranges from good to phenomenal: PHALANGE, I DARE NOT, GARY HART, SODA JERK, TELEKINESIS, OVER THE HUMP, HOVERBOARDS, IT’S NO BIGGIE, GIVE ME A RING, PABLO NERUDA, GENDER-BINARY and JOLLY RANCHER. That’s a ton of juicy fill.

As I said above, with so many marquee entries, the shorter fill usually suffers. But today? I pored over this grid post-solve, as I do when working with Will and Joel on submissions, and I couldn’t find more than three — maybe five, if I’m being super nitpicky — subpar answers. Can you guess which ones they were?

Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

Mr. Nadella said that immigrants — and not just those with highly valued skills — help improve competition. He said he himself had benefited from “enlightened” immigration policy that allowed him to study and work in the United States.

“That’s what makes America exceptional, both being the place where the talent comes and also being the beacon of hope for the people who need hope,” said Mr. Nadella, who early in his employment at Microsoft had given up his green card for a temporary H-1B work visa that allowed him to bring his wife, Anu, to the United States from India.

Mr. Nadella also addressed a series of business flops — including a disastrous acquisition of the phone maker Nokia and Microsoft’s late start in development of cloud computing services — that pushed it out of the top tier of white-hot tech companies like Facebook, Apple and Google.

But recently, Microsoft has regained traction, making some of the most innovative personal computers in the industry, experimenting with artificial intelligence and augmented reality and testing autonomous vehicles. Microsoft’s share price has more than doubled during Mr. Nadella’s tenure as chief executive.

Amazon and Microsoft, based a short drive apart in Washington State, compete for both talent and business. But the two companies recently paired up to integrate Amazon’s Alexa voice-controlled digital assistant with its Microsoft counterpart Cortana.

The schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, said Monday that, in response to last week’s fatal stabbing at a school in the Bronx, the Education Department would focus its training for teachers on how to defuse behavior crises and make sure that bullying was reported.

Last Wednesday, Abel Cedeno, an 18-year-old student at the Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation, brought a switchblade to school and stabbed two classmates, killing one, Matthew McCree, 15, and leaving another, Ariane Laboy, 16, seriously wounded. The police have said that Mr. Cedeno told them that he had been bullied since the start of school, though not by Mr. McCree and Mr. Laboy, who were said to be throwing pencil bits and balled up paper at him during class. Parents have said that the school’s administration failed to address complaints about bullying.

On Monday, in a conversation about school safety with invited parent leaders from throughout the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Ms. Fariña emphasized that crime in schools was at its lowest level on record and said they were making investments in mental health programs in schools and in so-called restorative justice, which replaces punitive approaches to behavioral problems with discussion and mediation.

“Even though we’re all feeling a lot of pain right now, we know that these approaches are taking us on the right path,” Mr. de Blasio said.

Ms. Fariña said that all schools would use time on Mondays designated for teacher professional development to discuss bullying and de-escalation techniques for at least three weeks. A spokeswoman for the Education Department, Toya Holness, said the department would share more information with schools this week and that the training would start this month.

In response to a parent who asked if the department would consider hiring more school psychologists, Ms. Fariña said that she would instruct superintendents to examine whether the schools they oversee needed more resources or needed to share resources differently with other schools.

“Certainly we are looking at more guidance counselors,” she said.

Some parents in the room said they believed that schools were not doing enough to confront bullying or more generally to address disorder.

My first themeless grid with this seed entry was submitted in July of 2016.
He noted it was best not to go above 12 for a themeless grid.
After numerous back and forths using a grid of Jeff’s design we submitted a revised grid a few weeks later.
And, from Crack Teammate #2, J.C.:I like trying multiple dozens of versions of every region within a themeless.","27A: Botanical clues cannot come often enough for me, and I do keep reading about how extremely trendy the horticultural arts have gotten, so the Venn diagram of puzzlers and gardeners really should be enormous. (Anyone? Anyone? Gertrude Jekyll?) But I had no idea that “flame” in Greek meant PHLOX. This is a great crossword word, no? Also a pretty plant if you can see beyond the mildew.

53A: Since this puzzle was solving fairly straight, I wasn’t at sufficient goofball level to see how “become lightheaded” could mean GO BLONDE. I figured it out after a few crosses but I think this is also a total gem of a clue.

58A: The first challenge for some of us when encountering “Dress-up at a comic con” might be figuring out the ol’ comic con part. Is this term widely known at this point? New York’s goes back to 2006 and it looks like the San Diego Comic Convention started in 1971. The art of dressing as featured characters is COSPLAY, a term coined in Japan in the ’80s. I would say something about nothing new under the sun, as we’ve been playing masquerade as a species for millenniums, but these costumes are really something else. New York’s con is in less than a week, guys! Come to think of it, maybe Sam has sequestered himself in his sewing room.

23D: Like the above example, this clue, “Secondary personas in role-playing game lingo” called for some knowledge of the way the kids talk. I knew this had to be “avis,” in this case pronounced with a short a, cute and short for “avatars,” and I was wrong. This grid calls for ALTS, and uses a new clue for a chestnut entry.

37D: Who’s been on the cover of British Vogue more than anyone else? One of their brand new contributing editors, natch, and Naomi Campbell didn’t fit. KATE MOSS did.

39D: I couldn’t really wrap my head around the grammar and meaning of “Track prize” for the longest time. At first I was looking for a verb, something like following one’s dream. Then I switched to a trophy or some such award, and it took forever to realize that in this case track was a racetrack, and we were talking about horse races, which get run as STAKES. This seems to be a grande olde worde from when betting folks in the Middle Ages stuck their wager, maybe a fat chicken or cute child, onto a stick and tried their luck.

Constructor Notes

From Crack Teammate #1, M.L.G.:

My seed entry for this themeless was the RIJKSMUSEUM, a place I hope to see in person someday. It was inspired by my visit to a special exhibit at the Dayton Art Institute, Rembrandt and the Golden Age of Dutch Art: Treasures from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. My first themeless grid with this seed entry was submitted in July of 2016. I received a rejection in August noting that Will really liked some of the grid fill including this seed entry, but there was too much crosswordese. I asked Jeff for his assistance in reworking the grid. He pointed out I had too many three letter entries. He noted it was best not to go above 12 for a themeless grid. After numerous back and forths using a grid of Jeff’s design we submitted a revised grid a few weeks later. We received an email in November accepting the revised grid. Jeff worked the NYT debut words COSPLAY, MAMA BIRD, BEER BRAT and GO BLONDE into the grid and my contribution in addition to RIJKSMUSEUM, was OBAMA ERA. I was surprised to see the clue we had for TOMY, “Big name in toys headquartered in Japan”, was replaced by the partial TO MY. I did like the edited change of clues for EARS and DJS to “Reception figures” as well as the clue change for HARRY from a name to “Badger”. I hope you’ve enjoyed your Saturday solving experience.

And, from Crack Teammate #2, J.C.:

I like trying multiple dozens of versions of every region within a themeless. Luckily, ML graciously puts up with my OCD about exploring the entire solution space. We saved so many versions that I didn’t remember which one we finally submitted. Thankfully, ML has a good eye for what’s the best trade-off between strong entries and gluey short ones. Looking back on it, I would have tried to open up the NW and SE corners, which feel more disconnected from the rest of the puzzle than I like. It did let us easily try many dozens of versions in each area, but with so few entries connecting everything up, hopefully solvers don’t get stumped on LAKSHMI or RIJKSMUSEUM.

For those of us wondering where the time went this week, here is a little video of a mama robin:

“It’s their room,” Mr. Cloepfil said.
“Danny Meyer’s mother is a supporter” of the museum, Mr. Cloepfil said.
Then Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara announced plans for a new restaurant in the skyscraper at 425 Park Avenue, at 56th Street.
He said that Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara wanted banquettes.","He said this outside, under the vaulted entrance. Eleven Madison Park is on the ground floor of a Jazz Age tower that was supposed to be 100 stories tall. It was scaled down after the stock market crash of 1929, making it look somewhat stubby. “Awkward little thing,” he said. For years the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, whose clock-tower headquarters loomed over it, used it as a warehouse. Met Life sold 11 Madison Avenue, and the restaurant opened in the former lobby in 1998.

Eleven Madison Park was only Mr. Cloepfil’s second restaurant. He designed one in Portland years ago — Bluehour — but he said he realized he was at a different place in his thinking now. “Where before it would be more about me,” he said, “it’s about them.”

Oh, them — the owners, Daniel Humm and Will Guidara. In 2011, they bought Eleven Madison Park from the restaurateur Danny Meyer, who had opened it. Mr. Humm had worked there since 2006, and said in 2012 that he had been determined to make it more special than it was.

“It’s their room,” Mr. Cloepfil said. “I think of it as a gallery” — a gallery for Mr. Humm’s food. That reflects something else that had come with experience: “The ability to understand what design can offer and not offer — an ability to see that.” Or, he said, “where I can back off. A young designer would put pedal to the metal and go.”

Eleven Madison Park was pulling Mr. Cloepfil into its orbit long before he met Mr. Guidara in 2008. Consider the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis, which he designed and that opened in 2003. “Danny Meyer’s mother is a supporter” of the museum, Mr. Cloepfil said. “He’s from there. When we had the press luncheon, it was up there.” He pointed toward a private dining room on the mezzanine at Eleven Madison Park.

The celebration dinner for his controversial redesign of 2 Columbus Circle, the white marble structure that became known as “the lollipop building” and now houses the Museum of Art and Design, was also held at Eleven Madison Park.

Eleven Madison Park tugged at him in other ways. His daughter Hannah was a hostess there after she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. (She is now “a freelance curator-art director,” he said, “doing that Brooklyn thing.”)

His office was across Madison Square Park. After a while, the bartenders knew to make a gin martini when he walked in. (Plymouth, not Beefeater, Bombay or Tanqueray.)

Then Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara announced plans for a new restaurant in the skyscraper at 425 Park Avenue, at 56th Street. “I said, ‘I would have loved to do that with you,’” he recalled.

And then, he said, they approached him about Eleven Madison Park, and he faced “the challenge of changing something this revered.”

“I mean, it is revered,” he said. “It occupied a place of memory in the city for 20 years.” But it was “a room that was meant to be a bistro, not a fine dining room.”

He did research in London and Paris. “I ate and drank a tremendous amount — duty called,” he joked.

He said that he wanted to make the room “a better version of itself,” and he had focused on the ceremony of dining: the walking in, the parade to the table, the people-watching.

And where the people sit. He said that Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara wanted banquettes. “They both talked about comfort,” he said. “They wanted banquettes as a legacy,” a salute to a staple of fine restaurants of the past. He decided to add little lamps, built into the little spaces between the banquettes. Like the banquettes, they are something of a tribute: “I love those old restaurants where they had lamps on the tables,” he said.

He designed the chairs, and said, after sitting in one, that the backs needed to be plumped up. He said the chairs were made without mock-ups. There wasn’t time, he explained.

And then there were the plates. “In April, when the design was set and the furniture was set,” he recalled, “they said, ‘We think we’re going to do new plates.’”

So Mr. Cloepfil added tableware to his responsibilities. As it happens, he collects midcentury ceramics. But he wanted to do more research, so he was off to London again, to study the collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Then he concentrated on shapes of pieces like something called a coupe bowl. This meant “working with Daniel so it holds the sauce the way he wants it to.”

That prompted a question: Is this architecture?

No, he said.

“I think of it more as stage design,” he said. “There’s architecture of the space — after that, it’s entirely different.”

But the architect of the space was pleased.

“This is the longest I’ve sat in here,” he said after an hour. “It feels really good.”",An Architect Designed a Calmer Restaurant. It Was Very Stressful.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/nyregion/an-architect-designed-a-calmer-restaurant-it-was-very-stressful.html

The answer is yes, at the level of ideological commitment — but not so much in practice. In the real life of liberalism, Hefnerism endures as the effective philosophy of many liberal men, for whom sexual individualism justifies using women because hey, we’re all cool consenting adults here, and caddishness blurs into predation when power differentials permit. Meanwhile, feminism struggles to find norms that check this kind of behavior, swinging between a facile sex-positivity and illiberal attempts to police the hookup scene.

Here it would be nice to say that cultural conservatism offers an alternative, one that welcomes female advancement while retaining useful ideas about sexual difference and restraint. I might have argued as much once. But in the age of Donald Trump and Bill O’Reilly, “pro-life” hypocrites in Congress and the alt-right online cesspool, the right is its own sort of cautionary tale.

So I’ll say something more modest: If liberals want to restrain the ogres in their midst, a few conservative ideas might be helpful.

First: Some modest limits on how men and women interact professionally are useful checks on predation. Many liberals were horrified by the revelation that for a time Mike Pence avoided one-on-one meetings with women not his wife. But one can find the Pence rules too sweeping and still recognize that life is easier for women if their male bosses don’t feel entitled to see them anywhere, anytime. It would not usher in the Republic of Gilead if it were understood that inviting your female subordinate to your hotel room, Weinstein-style, crosses a line in a way that a restaurant lunch does not.

Second: Consent alone is not a sufficient guide to ethics. Caddishness and predation can be a continuum. If you cheat on your wife you may be more likely to harass subordinates. Promiscuity can encourage predatory entitlement. Older rules of moral restraint were broader for a reason. If your culture’s code is libertine, don’t be surprised that worse things than libertinism flourish.

Third: You can’t ignore moral character when you make decisions about whom to vote for or work with or support. This was something conservatives used to argue in the Clinton years; under Trump, many have conveniently forgotten it. But it remains true. Yes, sometimes you have to work with a bad person or vote for a bad person or hold a fund-raiser with a bad person for the greater good. But not nearly as often as you think.

The truth is that while not everyone knew exactly how Harvey Weinstein treated women, everyone knew what kind of man he was. The women he harassed didn’t have the power to restrain him, but plenty of powerful people did.

The disrupted Norman Rockwell idyll, and the theme of families dividing, would recur in his early movies: a shark disrupting an American beach summer in “Jaws,” the single-parent family in “E.T.,” the father chasing U.F.O.s in “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.”

This sensibility made him mainstream, but that jeopardized his artistic cred, especially coming up in the raging-bull 1970s. Even George Lucas of “Star Wars” fancied himself a rebel.

Mr. Spielberg’s craving for assimilation extended to his Jewish heritage. He recalls being mortified as a child when his grandfather would call him by his Hebrew name — “Shmuel!” — in front of his friends. “He didn’t want to be Jewish,” his sister Anne Spielberg says, “because it made us different from everybody.” In part, “Schindler’s List” was his way of coming to terms with his identity.

Ms. Lacy created “American Masters” for PBS, and “Spielberg” is in that mold, bringing in dozens of celebrities, critics and colleagues and nearly 30 hours of interviews with Mr. Spielberg. At almost two and a half hours, it’s a vast survey, though it accelerates for the later, elder-statesman part of the director’s career. (“A.I.,” “Minority Report” and “War of the Worlds” are grouped as his dystopian sci-fi trilogy; “Amistad,” “Lincoln” and “Bridge of Spies” under civic order and the rule of law.)

“Spielberg” is laudatory but not unreservedly so. It brings up the critique that he watered down the lesbian sexual elements in his adaptation of Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple” — a film he made in part to prove his seriousness — and Mr. Spielberg recognizes that he was the wrong director to address those themes.

Ms. Lacy doesn’t stint on discussion of technique or clips from Mr. Spielberg’s films; a reel of them early in the documentary reminds you how many images he’s added to our visual vocabulary.

But the first movie scene you see in “Spielberg” is a stunning desert vista from “Lawrence of Arabia,” a screening of which almost drove the young Mr. Spielberg to give up directing. Before Ms. Lacy shows you Mr. Spielberg’s movies, she shows you the movies through his eyes.

For all its sweep, “Spielberg” the documentary succeeds most distinctively where Mr. Spielberg the director has: accessing the child in its subject. Talking about his penchant for suspense, Mr. Spielberg remembers how he used to trap his sisters in a closet with a skull that he’d dripped gory-looking candle wax on. It sounds like a pretty rotten trick, but talking about it now, Mr. Spielberg gets animated.

“If that happens again, you’re going to see C. J. back out there,” Maddon said, using Edwards’s nickname. “He made a bad pitch and the guy didn’t miss it, and that’s it. Sometimes that happens.”

But the move backfired against Harper, who has played only seven games over the past eight weeks because of a knee injury.

“I saw the loop in the curveball and said, ‘Why not swing as hard as you can?’” Harper said.

After Edwards walked Anthony Rendon, Maddon inserted Montgomery to face the left-handed Daniel Murphy, who bested him for a single. Then Montgomery fired a changeup over the plate to Zimmerman, who did not miss.

As Zimmerman’s towering fly ball floated toward left field and the Cubs’ Ben Zobrist drifted back, the crowd at Nationals Park rose. What had once appeared like another Cubs victory behind their postseason stalwart, pitcher Jon Lester, had become a Washington win in only a handful of at-bats.

Despite six straight winning seasons, including four N.L. East titles, the Nationals have not advanced past the first round of the playoffs. They lost to the Cardinals in 2012, the Giants in 2014 and the Dodgers last year.

The Nationals were shut out in Game 1 of this series on Friday, and Lester fired six stout innings on Saturday, allowing only one run, a solo homer by Rendon. Before the five-run outburst in the eighth inning, the Nationals had only four hits over the first 16 innings of the series.

“I was kind of bewildered because it’s not too many teams or pitchers that have held us in check like that for a couple days,” Nationals Manager Dusty Baker said. “I just knew in the bottom of my heart that we were going to explode.”

On Saturday, the Cubs built a 3-1 cushion before the fifth inning, thanks to home runs off Gonzalez by Willson Contreras and Anthony Rizzo.

Rizzo’s blast was unusual because he hit a Gonzalez curveball, a difficult pitch to drive over a fence, and because he became only the second left-handed hitter this year — along with Freddie Freeman of the Atlanta Braves — to hit a homer off Gonzalez.

A Cubs fan reached over the railing in right field to grab Rizzo’s shot, but the umpires upheld the home run after a replay review.

Lester, a three-time World Series winner, kept the Nationals’ powerful lineup at bay with his typical postseason savvy. He did so even when the Nationals threatened in the fifth inning with a single by Zimmerman and walks by Michael A. Taylor and Howie Kendrick. In what seemed like the game’s biggest moment to that point, Lester struck out Trea Turner to end the inning with the bases loaded.

Then in the decisive eighth, the sluggish Nationals offense finally awoke. Zimmerman, who has been a National since 2005, when the franchise moved from Montreal to Washington, hit 36 home runs in the regular season, a career high. But none of them could match the significance of his blast off Montgomery.

“I couldn’t tell you anything about that run around the bases,” Zimmerman said.

For Game 3 in Chicago on Monday, Max Scherzer is to start for the Nationals and Jose Quintana for the Cubs.","Nationals Stage a Late Comeback, Perhaps Exorcising Postseason Demons",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/sports/baseball/chicago-cubs-washington-nationals-playoffs.html

The monarch is the only butterfly that migrates thousands of miles the way birds do, wintering in Mexico and traveling — through successive generations in a single season — as far north as Canada before heading south again. Their travels make them vulnerable to more than just the loss of milkweed. Two other causes of population decline are deforestation in their Mexican wintering grounds and, you guessed it, climate change.

Of all the assaults on the monarch population, climate change may prove the most pernicious. In summer, excessive heat stresses developing caterpillars already vulnerable to diseases and predators. In fall, unseasonable warmth can prevent them from heading south in time to reach their wintering grounds, and extreme weather events like hurricanes can destroy an entire wave of the migration before it reaches Mexico. Worst of all, climate change threatens the monarchs’ wintering grounds, where very specific environmental conditions keep them in a hibernation-like state. In winter, unstable temperatures in Mexico can wake the butterflies too early from hibernation, sending them north before the nectar flowers they feed on have bloomed. And by some estimates, that microclimate high in the mountains of Mexico will all but disappear by 2030.

Not all monarchs in North America migrate. In South Florida, they live and breed year-round, though virtually all of those butterflies are heavily infected with protozoans that weaken the population. Monarchs west of the Rockies travel much shorter distances, overwintering on the California coast, but that population is in even worse shape, down 97 percent from its pre-Roundup norm. A new study this year suggests that it’s on the verge of extinction.

In the wild, less than 10 percent of monarch caterpillars survive to adulthood, even when environmental conditions are ideal. Monarch enthusiasts bring in the eggs they find outside to rear indoors, hoping to improve those odds. When something goes wrong for someone in an online butterfly group, the refrain of consolation is always a reminder of how poorly the monarch fares in nature, of how even one success will help to “raise the migration.”

Since I had no eggs to collect from my own milkweed, I decided to order another set of caterpillars from a different supplier and try again indoors. I put them in a professionally manufactured butterfly enclosure and fed them milkweed leaves I’d sterilized and rinsed. The monarch stewards in my online groups were having glorious success with this method, releasing hundreds of monarchs they’d collected as eggs earlier in the summer. They kept posting videos of the newly emerged butterflies walking delicately over their hands, and I was going a little mad with jealousy. I typed in my credit-card number one more time.

O.K., two more times. Still, not a single caterpillar survived.

There are many possible causes, both natural and chemical, for my failure. At the top of the list: user error. And my plan was flawed from the beginning, it turns out. Releasing monarchs raised from commercial butterfly farms can create additional risks for the native population, spreading disease, limiting genetic diversity and interrupting scientific efforts to understand the migration.

I haven’t decided whether I’ll go on a quest for wild monarch eggs when these lovely creatures return to Middle Tennessee next spring, but I think it’s time to admit that the pollinator garden I’ve planted here in sterile suburbia is just not big enough to attract a migrating butterfly high in the sky. Still, it’s possible, and if there’s any sight more heart-lifting than a monarch butterfly glowing in the sunshine, I don’t know what it might be.

National Parks Struggle With a Mounting Crisis: Too Many Visitors

Image Credit

The rocky shorelines, shifting deserts and winding canyons of the country’s 59 national parks have been hallmarks of American vacations for generations.

But the number of park visitors has reached an unprecedented level, leaving many tourists frustrated and many environmentalists concerned about the toll of overcrowding.

Image Credit

In 2016, the National Park Service tracked a record 331 million visits, and after a busy summer, the system is likely to surpass that number this year. In August alone, some 40 million people came through park service gates.

Image Credit

Shuttle buses at Zion National Park, in southwest Utah, filled like sweaty subway cars. Selfie-takers clogged the slender path through the Narrows slot canyon, one of the park’s best-known attractions. And at the top of Angels Landing, an iconic trail of switchbacks on the east side of the park, some portable toilets were marked off with a sign: “Due to extreme use, these toilets have reached capacity.”

Zion is among the most visited parks in the system and is particularly prone to crowding because many of its most popular sites sit in a narrow six-mile canyon. In 2016, about 4.3 million people visited, up 60 percent from a decade ago.

So this year, park managers announced they were considering a first for any national park: requiring reservations for entry. A final decision is expected in 2018.

“We don’t have a choice,” said Jack Burns, who has worked in Zion since 1982. “We have to do something. If this going to remain a place of special importance for generations, we have to do something now.”

The National Park Service was created in 1916 to protect the country’s growing system of parks and monuments. Its mandate is to conserve scenery and wildlife while also protecting visitor enjoyment for generations to come. For years, the lack of a reservation system for park entry aligned with the service’s ethos of democracy and discovery: Anyone could come, pretty much anytime. (The service has long required permits for hiking in more remote areas.)

But lately, both visitors and nature are suffering. Mr. Burns, who is on a team that is considering a reservation system, said some people showed up for a vacation they had planned for months, spent a day in the gridlock and turned around. Rangers, stressed by the frustrated masses, have started a monthly meeting to discuss “visitor use” that some say has turned into a group-therapy session.

Image Credit

And Zion’s delicate desert ecosystem has been battered by tourists, some of whom wash diapers in the Virgin River, scratch their names into boulders and fly drone cameras through once quiet skies. The park has about 25 miles of developed trails. But over time, rangers have mapped about 600 miles of visitor-made paths, which damage vegetation and soil and take a toll on wildlife.

The story is similar at parks from Yosemite in California to Acadia in Maine. And the crowding problem comes as the system faces the dual threat of a funding shortage and climate change.

Image Credit

Image Credit

The park system has a maintenance backlog of more than $11 billion and President Trump has proposed a 13 percent cut to the service.

At the same time, park officials have identified the heat and floods of climate change as one of the system’s greatest perils. In Zion, as maximum temperatures in the summer have risen, the heat-intolerant American pika , a tiny mammal related to rabbits, has disappeared. Rangers call it a sign of what is likely to come : smaller streams, more frequent droughts and other shifts in the ecosystem.

Image Credit

This summer, administrators at Zion submitted three proposed visitor plans to the public.

One option would require people to make an online reservation before arrival, and would set a yet-to-be-specified limit on visitors. The second option would require reservations only for certain areas. The third option would be to make no changes.

About 1,600 people sent in comments, and the park plans to send out a revised round of proposals for public review. Superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh will make the final decision.

Some have expressed opposition to the reservation idea, including a group that founded the website stopzionreservations.org .

Image Credit

Mr. Burns said he favored a reservation policy. He recalled the days when he would jump in a car and pull up to parks across the West with no plans.

When he first came to the park in the 1980s, he was a young employee at the lodge, and he wrote a letter home. “I’m living in no-man’s-land,” he told his parents. He could hike for hours, even days, without seeing a soul, and he remembered a constant sensitivity to the changing light on the canyons, the brilliant green of the trees, the emerald water of the Virgin River.

Today, he said, when he finds solitude, it is usually accompanied by the distant rumble of the shuttle bus.

“There is only one Zion National Park,” he said to those struggling to see a need for limiting access. “And it’s sacred. Its beauty is sacred.”

After a report last week that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had once referred to Mr. Trump as a “moron,” Mr. Corker told reporters at the Capitol that Mr. Tillerson was one of three officials helping to “separate our country from chaos.”

In August, Mr. Corker had told reporters in Tennessee that the president “has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.”

Mr. Trump’s feud with Mr. Corker is particularly perilous given that the president has little margin for error as he tries to pass an overhaul of the tax code — his best hope of producing a major legislative achievement in the coming months.

If Senate Democrats end up unified in opposition to the promised tax bill, Mr. Trump would be able to lose the support of only two of the Senate’s 52 Republicans in order to pass it. That is the same challenging math that Mr. Trump and Senate Republican leaders faced in their failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

Preparation for the Necks involves shutting their eyes for five seconds, waiting to see who will serve.
The Necks could be said to do versions of — to improvise on — their past (entirely improvised) performances.
If they are all on good form, it still does not necessarily mean that it will be a great gig by the Necks.
A performance by the Necks is all about band and audience being utterly absorbed in the process of creation.","The Necks are not careerists. “Hanging Gardens” was followed by “Aether,” a whole album consisting entirely of variations on four shimmering chords. “Drive By,” with its potential to become a crossover hit, was followed shortly by a difficult double CD (“Mosquito/See Through”). By now I knew how foolish it was to try to guess what they might do next, but “Chemist” broke the molds of expectation in several ways. There were three tracks, each clocking in at a mere 20 minutes, on at least two of which the drummer (Tony) overdubbed surf guitar. The last of these tracks, “Abillera,” didn’t just swing; it rocked. The influence of Krautrock, of Neu! in particular, was unmistakable, but as often happens when the critic spots an unmistakable influence, it turns out that Tony hadn’t ever listened to Neu! The Necks had moved far from the minimalist grooves of the earlier records, from post-jazz to a kind of post-rock, but they were in the midst of a deeply creative groove, releasing masterpiece after masterpiece. The live album “Townsville” had none of the narrative trajectory that made “Drive By” and “Chemist” so enthralling — and that, I realized eventually, was its beauty. To experience “Townsville” properly is to give way entirely to the oceanic sense.

“Silverwater” (2009) followed, an epic reminder that they both were and were not the band that recorded “Sex.” Featuring further evidence of the drummer’s guitar prowess, “Silverwater” succeeded in being both fragmented and cohesive. After about 50 minutes, you could be forgiven for thinking that the record was coming to an end. Everything subsides to a series of low electronic beeps, like a faint message from a stricken space station, picked up randomly, so long after transmission as to serve as evidence of its doom. Except records by the Necks change radically according to the system on which you’re hearing them. On about the 10th listen, through headphones, I detected, so far back in the mix it seemed to have leaked through the inadequate sound proofing of a neighboring sound system, the faint bleed of funk. Scientists are still poring over this discovery, trying to establish if, in the last phases of its existence, a section of the space station was given over to a party.

I was about to start listening to the four tracks of “Unfold” when I was struck by how long it had been since I looked forward to a band’s new album the way I look forward to each new offering from the Necks. This was how I felt waiting to hear “London Calling,” by the Clash, “Slow Train Coming,” by Bob Dylan, or, going even further back, “Electric Warrior,” by T. Rex. So intense was the anticipation generated by the prospect of hearing “Unfold” that I kept putting off playing it. And then there was the nonoptional wait to get into the Lab in San Francisco for the opening gig of the American tour. Just as the experience of listening to an eagerly awaited record by the Necks varies from system to system, your experience of a performance depends a lot on where you sit. So, as we stood in the long and lengthening line, I delivered a rousing address to my troops — five of them — on the need to act decisively once we were inside, how we had to seize the very best nonassigned seats: as near to the front as possible, but not too close to the potentially overwhelming drums, and not to one side. This anxiety threatened to turn what for everyone else was supposed to be a fun night out — going to a gig — into its opposite, but I knew, with the unshakable conviction of the believer whose devotion is a sign not of gullibility but of superior powers of discernment, that we were potentially on the brink of one of the greatest musical experiences currently available on the planet. (In the unlikely event that it didn’t quite happen that night, I was booked in for another two-set helping the following evening.)

We scored great seats, three rows from the front, and I was able to make sure, without anyone noticing (even though everyone noticed), that I got the best seat of all, with the clearest view — of the resting instruments — of any of us. Ever since I went to my first rock concert, Family in Oxford in about 1972, the thrill of what was about to happen was symbolized by the dormant power of the vacant drum kit, the way it sat there like a throne to its imminent rhythmic might. That sense of the instruments lying in wait is even more pronounced with a gig by the Necks as we wait for music to come into existence for the first time.

The gigs the band played immediately before this tour were in large venues, opening for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, in Australia. This brought the Necks to the attention of a new audience, but it’s in places like the Lab that they really come into their own: 150 people, ready to focus on every moment, every note. Typically, bands “tour” an album, showcasing its contents, advertising it. The Necks do not do this, of course, but one track from the new album, “Blue Mountain,” bears a sufficiently close resemblance to some of the performances from the recent tour to permit me to conflate the transient experience of a live performance with repeated exposures to the documentary evidence of the record.

They take the stage at the Lab, Lloyd looking like a tall backwoodsman with balding head and full beard; Chris, bald, bespectacled, austerely professorial; Tony, white-haired and dressed, by comparison, quite fashionably in a polka-dot shirt. Chris sits with his back to the other two as if cutting himself off, but it’s a setup that enables them to hear one another better — and responsiveness to one another is at the heart of the performance. Tennis players, by the time they come on court, are already halfway into the realm of intense concentration required by the coming sets. Preparation for the Necks involves shutting their eyes for five seconds, waiting to see who will serve. Chris touches the piano keys.

Instead of the band gradually stretching out and easing into a groove, there is a steady creation and increase of internal pressure. From Tony there tends, at the outset, to be a lot of shaking, rattling, scraping and shuffling. It’s easy to hear this as aimless — a sonic bush through which it will be necessary to beat a path rhythmically. Gradually the impediments to rhythm emerge as its formative parts. Insistently repeated press rolls on the snare generate the need to break out — rhythmically — while simultaneously incarcerating this need. The same thing is happening with the tidal moan of Lloyd’s bowed bass, a sublimated pulse that manifests itself as a refusal to fully express itself. At some point the yearning is answered, at first chthonically, by the bass drum, later by the insistent jump of the high-hat. But the forward momentum remains contained.

So there is a piling up of forces, like the roiling storm clouds of a weather system, already in our midst but continuing to approach. The pressure continues to mount, to bear down and, partly through the immense shimmer of cymbals, to expand. The piano suggests what might remain of the lyrical after all else — including much of what constitutes lyricism — has been corroded. Think of all that aural starlight in jazz (“Stella by Starlight”!). The glimmer, here, is of ruined starlight. Contained in the piano is a scattered residue of jazz, traces of a lost blues. You focus on what Chris is doing, and then your attention is drawn to the drums, then over to the bass and back to Chris, who has jabbed the piano into an off-the-cuff Reichian lockdown. There are no solos, but the ball is being passed back and forth constantly. At some point it becomes impossible to tell who is doing what.

And not only that. There appear, through some weird alchemy of harmonics, phantom instruments. A cello? A human voice? A violin? Hearing such things, wanting to have the source of these auditory hallucinations verified, you look to see what is happening, but there are just these three middle-aged blokes, playing piano, bass and drums, conjuring things that do not exist. There are also moments that make you aware that your attention has wandered. Is this just about refocusing as a listener, or has the band, having drifted into a comparatively slack interlude, done something deliberately to pull you back into the trance? The Necks, these days, do not swing, but there is a constant swelling, an abundance of lateral movement that is manifest also as its opposite: a tightening of the screw, locking you inside the music, becoming part of its rise, its eventual fall and final fade.

At the end of the first set, Lloyd introduces the band and mentions that CDs are for sale. With their minimalist packaging and discreet information (the recent ones don’t explain who’s playing what), the CDs and the new double LP are consummately cool, eminently desirable, but the economic aftermath and interlude are relatively modest given the profundity of the experience that has preceded it. While the merchandise is being shifted, the band is more than ready to mingle, all the while displaying a distinct lack of any wish to be revered. At the Blue Whale in 2016, Lloyd came up to say hello. I was talking to a guy sitting in the row in front who had seen the band the last time they played in Los Angeles. He wasn’t sure when that was.

“But too long,” he said.

“Right,” Lloyd agreed.

“He was actually referring to the length of the set,” I said.

“Yeah?” he said. “I thought he meant your last book. Pretty surprising, since it was only about 150 pages.” In my book, so to speak, this represents the ideal behavior of the artist: You create this very serious work, and then you shoot the breeze as though the whole world is a pub in the Outback where no one cares what you do as long as you get your round in. Until it’s time for the second set.

The Necks are not improvising from existing tunes but creating from scratch, every night. Except now, in their 30th year, they are able to draw on their own history the way jazz musicians have relied on the history of the form, on what has been done — sometimes composed — by others. The idea in this classic jazz situation is not to copy or emulate but to distinguish yourself, to establish your individual identity by reference to what has gone before. The Necks could be said to do versions of — to improvise on — their past (entirely improvised) performances. In other words, they improvise on their own history. Each night is a slightly more familiar exploration or mapping of the unknown. Their career is therefore expressed in miniature in each piece, and each piece is a condensation of their career. The foundations have to be endlessly re-established, otherwise they collapse (into chaos) or cement themselves into cliché or convention.

It goes without saying that this way of proceeding cannot produce amazing results every time. Were they able to produce a miracle every night, the feeling of the miraculous would be lost. The only way to guarantee a superlative gig each and every time is to rehearse and rehearse, to get everything down pat. The Necks, of necessity, do not rehearse; nor are they locked into a monogamous musical relationship. They meet up, play gigs, tour and record, but each band member pursues other projects with other bands. Chris and Lloyd still live in Australia. Tony moved to Tokyo in 1990, then to Amsterdam in 1994, until 1998, when he moved — or, in a very Necksian way, “cross-faded” — to Berlin, where he is still based. So even after 30 years, making music has the feel of a special occasion — a get-together. And despite what was just said about the impossibility of routine miracles, the standard of the average — the frequency of the exceptional — is surprisingly high. At a gig some years ago at the Vortex in London, they were flooring it, going flat-out, and the next instant they stopped so suddenly that it was like being thrown through a windshield into silence. “How did you do that?” my friend asked them afterward. Well, Lloyd said, there were a few little signs we all picked up on. So are there some moves or tricks to which they resort when the alchemy does not occur? Or, as I said when I went to see them at their Airbnb, “Can a great performance result when one of you is having a bad night?”

“It depends what you mean by a bad night,” Tony said.

“Like a heart attack?” Chris said.

Lloyd mentioned a gig in Perth at the start of last year. The commitment to improvisation extends even to the instruments — he travels without a bass, preferring, like a piano player, to put himself at the mercy of what the venue provides. (Two weeks later, when I bumped into him at a noodle bar near the Blue Whale, he looked slightly stressed because, an hour before the show, he still had nothing to play.) The bass provided for the gig in Perth was diabolical. “The variability of the instrument is one of the things I try to get excited about. As long as the bass is playable, that’s quite exciting. But this one was an absolute dog. I said to the others, ‘There’s about five notes that work on this, so I’m not going to be contributing a whole lot.’ My bass part was really disciplined because I didn’t have a lot of options. And it was an amazing piece of music.”

“But you have made whole records where you’ve only played one note,” Tony said. “So you were spoiled for choice.”

“It’s actually remembered as a virtuoso performance,” I said (sitting in, as they say in the jazz world, improvising with the Necks!). “O.K., I get what you’re saying. But how about if two of you are having a bad night? You can see where I’m going with this. How about if all three of you are?”

“You could get a perfect storm of negative elements,” Lloyd said, before it occurred to me that there was a corollary to my line of questioning. If they are all on good form, it still does not necessarily mean that it will be a great gig by the Necks. And needless to say, what they do is not to everyone’s taste. I reminded them of a gig in Brighton, England, in 2002 — the second time I saw them, before my conversion — when, the moment the first set ended, a member of the audience leapt to his feet and started hurling abuse, telling them and us what a bunch of crap it had been. (The guys took it with surprisingly good grace, seemed entirely unperturbed.) For the record, and to prove that I am not a mindless devotee, their discography contains a few duds: “Silent Night,” “Photosynthetic” and “Vertigo” do nothing for me. And a member of my little group at the Lab, having prepared for our evening out with a noseful of cocaine, was less than enthusiastic. “He does everything with those drums except play them,” he remarked of Tony, rather wittily. I was unsure, when he went on to say that seeing the Necks was just like seeing the Grateful Dead, whether he was joking, trying to make a serious point or testing the limits of my tolerance. Either way, coke is a wretchedly inappropriate drug for experiencing the Necks.

Impatience prevents you from seeing — hearing — that what you are waiting for is already happening (not a bad test-definition of the avant-garde). But there is scope for anxiety on behalf of the participating listener, because the gathering intensity is underwritten by the potential for dissipation. And any given performance makes you wonder how any part of it could be different. This is the possibility that the performance has to raise on the way to becoming that which it was. So the answer is always, Yes, it could have been very different, at almost every stage. Could it have been better? In retrospect maybe, but there are long interludes — sometimes lasting the entire length of the set — when you are left to reflect instead on how much was latent in that first note or chord or rattle of percussion. To what extent did that note — by Chris, say — determine what they all went on to do? The sense, in this genealogy of the moment, is of unanticipated inevitability.

Each set of the San Francisco gigs was extraordinary, as were the two closing sets of the tour at the Blue Whale a fortnight later. But how would these shows sound if they were released on CD? I’ve no idea. Some kind of bootlegged video of part of the previous year’s gig at the Blue Whale exists, but I’ve avoided watching or listening to it. I don’t want to have to measure my experience of being there — superlative! — against a transcript of what occurred. Setting the record straight can sometimes distort it. A performance by the Necks is all about band and audience being utterly absorbed in the process of creation. Whether to release recordings of live performances is therefore a fundamental conceptual issue. In the course of any performance of continuous improvisation lasting for the best part of an hour there are going to be lulls — substandard stretches that are left behind, that evaporate and are forgotten as a show progresses, but that can fatally contaminate an entire recording. And as Lloyd points out, the orgiastic bits — which are so intoxicating live — can seem crude. More broadly, a record becomes a statement or template — this is what the Necks do — whereas it is merely a record of what happened that one night. Even without the problem of releasing live albums, it’s important that the band is not overly concerned with analyzing their live shows; the quality of performance depends on this relative indifference. The kind of post-mortems they go in for after a show typically amount to something along the lines of “That was pretty good wasn’t it?”

They have to feel uninhibited, to be free of the judgments that we listeners often feel bound to make. Was the first set on Saturday in San Francisco better than the second? (My little group of six was split straight down the middle, three and three.) Was Sunday better than Saturday? This is not a problem for the band; they have trouble remembering what they did on a given night.

In the course of thinking about — which means listening to — the Necks and their recent concerts, I’ve often remembered that idea of John Berger’s in “The Moment of Cubism”: “The moment at which a piece of music begins provides a clue to the nature of all art.” But it’s the moment after each piece of music, each set from the Necks, that I think of now. As the music faded into silence, instead of a rush to applaud, the audience waited, respectfully acknowledging that the altered silence was itself still a part of the performance. The silence meant that, on behalf of the performers, the audience wrapped the gift of the music they had received. Only then could the applause begin. That’s when we stood up and applauded.","My Obsession With the Necks, the Greatest Trio on Earth",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/magazine/my-obsession-with-the-necks-the-greatest-trio-on-earth.html

From mid-June through mid-August, the North Korean pair of Ms. Ryom, 18, and Mr. Kim, 25, trained in Montreal, refining their attempt to claim one of five Olympic spots available here at this week’s Nebelhorn Trophy competition.

The skaters, their coach and a North Korean skating official spoke frequently about the Olympics, said Bruno Marcotte, a prominent French Canadian coach who worked with the pair.

“All the time they would ask me: ‘Do you think we have a chance to qualify? Are we good enough? What do we need to qualify?’” Mr. Marcotte said of the pair, who aspire to become one of the world’s top 10 teams.

“They didn’t want to talk about politics,” said Mr. Marcotte, who is also here assisting the North Koreans. “It was all about sport and being the first ones in the Olympics and breaking barriers and doing their best.”

It is a widely held feeling among South Korean politicians and Olympic officials, as well as some international athletes, that the Games would be safer with North Korea’s participation, lessening security concerns and perhaps spurring slow ticket sales.

In that view, Kim Jong-un, the unpredictable North Korean leader, would be less likely to act provocatively if athletes from his country were competing in the Olympics, alongside those of China, North Korea’s benefactor.

“It’s kind of an insurance policy to have them there,” said Ted Ligety, a two-time gold medalist in Alpine skiing from the United States.

Of course, there is no way to predict what the political situation will be on the Korean Peninsula in four months, when the Olympics take place about 40 miles from the demilitarized zone that separates North and South.

And there is no guarantee that North Korea will participate. It is not a winter sports power and did not compete at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. It also boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the South Korean capital.

A general wariness seems to be encroaching on these Games. France has said its Olympic team will not travel to South Korea if its safety cannot be guaranteed.

Still, Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., has said there is “so far not even a hint” that security concerns related to North Korea threaten the Games. In any case, officials say it is too late to move the Olympics.

“There is no Plan B,” said Anita DeFrantz, a vice president of the I.O.C. from the United States.

Mr. Chang, the I.O.C. delegate from North Korea, has said its athletes will also attempt to qualify for the Games in short-track speedskating and Nordic skiing, which includes cross-country events. According to Reuters, North Korea has formally complained that international sanctions have interfered with its ability to purchase skiing equipment needed for training.

In April, North Korea sent its women’s hockey team to play in South Korea. In June, it sent a taekwondo team. That month, South Korea’s sports minister mentioned the possibility of fielding a combined hockey team in the Olympics and permitting North Korea to host an Alpine skiing event.

Those prospects seem unlikely now, South Korean Olympic and government officials said last week in New York.

“North Korea is my biggest worry,” Choi Moon-soon, the governor of Gangwon Province in South Korea, where the 2018 Olympics will take place, said in a recent interview. “It’s not because of North Korea making an impact on the Olympics, it’s that if North Korea can participate, then it will make a great contribution for our goal of hosting a Peace Olympics, and it will be a great selling point.”

If North Korea does compete, perhaps its most visible — and only — athletes will be Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim. They finished 15th at the 2017 world figure skating championships in March with a style influenced by classic Russian efficiency and precise placement of the arms and head.

Dressed in silver and black costumes at training on Wednesday, the pair skated to an instrumental version of the Beatles’ “A Day in the Life,” as performed by Jeff Beck, which will provide a musical backdrop for Thursday’s opening performance.

The issue can be culturally sensitive. At the world championships, the North Koreans ended a brief interview with The Associated Press when asked how they had chosen the Beatles’ music.

On Wednesday, Ms. Ryom and her partner, Mr. Kim, appeared smiling though slightly nervous during practice. (“Trying to be too much,” Mr. Marcotte said.) Still, they received polite applause from the four dozen or so people who watched them train at the Eissportzentrum in this Alpine village with bell cows in the pastures and snow dusting the highest peaks.

It is not uncommon for pairs skaters to have an artistically stressed relationship, and as Mr. Marcotte put it, a coach can sometimes be more of a marriage counselor. But the North Koreans remained unfailingly upbeat during their summer training, he said. And they even made kimchi, a staple dish, for a South Korean pair that he also trained.

“I think there is a will for friendship, a will for peace,” Mr. Marcotte said of the skaters. “They were so driven and so positive. I didn’t expect that. They were sponges. They wanted to learn so badly.”

Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim will be under enormous scrutiny and pressure this week to qualify for the Olympics. But they also appear confident, Mr. Marcotte said.

Ri Chol-un, an official with the North Korean figure skating association, said the pair might even speak to reporters on Friday after the pairs competition ends.

Given his personal ties to Puerto Rico, as well as the substantial Puerto Rican population in his state, Mr. Rubio has been engaged in ensuring that the relief effort there gets on track and stays there. He has flexed his influence on American policy toward Cuba and Venezuela. He has worked with Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, on a proposal to expand the child tax credit that could become an important element of the coming tax debate. He has helped push to passage a bill to help the Department of Veterans Affairs hold employees more accountable. He was part of a bipartisan group behind a new law directing drug companies to pursue more pediatric cancer treatments. He is an important party voice on immigration.

Whether this is all a prelude to a future presidential run for Mr. Rubio, 46, is hard to gauge. But he attributes his rededication to the Senate to a confluence of factors, including the fact that his party is in power and that, now in his second term in the Senate, he is a little more sure of what he is doing.

“It is true that experience generally makes you better at something, not worse,” Mr. Rubio said. “And so the longer you’re in some place, to a certain extent, the better you can be at it. So I am certainly a better senator today than I was five years ago simply because I’m more familiar with the process. It also doesn’t hurt to have your party in the White House with a lot of people over there that I know.”

Mr. Rubio wasn’t supposed to be here at all. A rising superstar in his party with a personality and background that thrilled donors, Mr. Rubio was in the top tier of Republican presidential hopefuls in 2016. Many in Washington believed he would be the nominee, a candidate who would finally broaden the party’s appeal with Hispanics while holding true conservative credentials.

Openly antagonistic about the slow pace of the hidebound Senate, Mr. Rubio made it clear that it was the White House or bust. And bust it was as Donald J. Trump upended him in the Florida primary race. But after insisting he would give up his seat at the end of his term, Mr. Rubio instead decided to run, citing second thoughts about public service that were prompted by the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.

It was not without risk. “Losing two elections in a year has never been part of my plan for life,” Mr. Rubio said.

He won and re-entered an institution that allies said he found frustrating. Mr. Rubio wouldn’t be the first senator to rate his experience as a second-term lawmaker an improvement over the first. Figuring out the Senate can take time, and more-senior lawmakers might not even begin to take colleagues seriously until they have at least one term under their belts.

“I’m at 58 in seniority,” Mr. Rubio noted. “I came in at 99.”

Mr. Rubio, who has close friends in Puerto Rico and visited soon after Hurricane Maria had passed, said that he had no quarrel with the federal response, but that the conventional reaction to a severe hurricane didn’t suffice for the already struggling island.

“The problem,” he said, “is that the model that works in Florida and in Texas doesn’t work as well in Puerto Rico for a lot of reasons: the geographic isolation, the pre-existing challenges and the fact that they had just previously been impacted by a storm.”

As for his relationship with Mr. Trump — who ridiculed Mr. Rubio as “Little Marco” during primary race debates, prompting Mr. Rubio to try to get under his opponent’s skin by noting his “small hands” — Mr. Rubio said those jabs did not extend beyond the campaign stage.

“Politics is verbal combat,” he said. “And in the process of a campaign, which is a competitive environment, people are going to bump up against each other.”

“We were competitors,” he said. “But I never felt we had a negative interaction.”

Assessing Mr. Trump’s performance in office, Mr. Rubio characterized him as “unorthodox” — a description he said Mr. Trump himself would embrace. He acknowledged policy differences and concerns about Iraq and Syria, but said they were in agreement on multiple other fronts.

“I still would rather have him be president than Hillary Clinton, to be frank,” Mr. Rubio said. “And that was the choice before America in November.”

Left unsaid was that Mr. Rubio was ultimately not part of that choice. Is he now satisfied with his Senate role? For the moment, it seems.

“I want to be the best senator I can be — the best senator Florida has ever had,” he said. “That’s obviously a lofty goal, and there will be plenty of people to argue that I didn’t achieve it no matter what I do.”

What he is not doing, the senator said, “is executing on any sort of long-term plan to get to a particular destination other than to do this job as well as I can and make my time here as productive as possible.”

That alone is a big change for a man who a little more than a year ago was happily on his way out the Senate door for good.

HGTV programs like “Tiny House, Big Living,” which have helped popularize the movement, often gloss over this not-so-tiny detail. But the many Facebook pages and websites devoted to tiny-house culture are obsessed with it: Online discussions are dominated by requests, if not outright pleas, for tips on how and where to find tiny-house-friendly locations.

Zoning regulations in most places — especially densely developed regions like the New York metro area — typically do not allow full-time living in temporary structures like R.V.s or movable tiny houses. Most tiny homes are built on wheeled trailers that can be towed. Unlike R.V.s, however, tiny houses are generally not wheeled for touring, so much as for flexibility of location.

Zoning also commonly specifies a minimum home or lot size that is too large and expensive for a lifestyle geared toward affordability. Residential building codes can also present a problem for tiny houses built on foundations.

As a result, “easily upwards of 90 percent of tiny-house owners are living illegally, when it comes to zoning,” said Andrew Morrison, a professional builder and tiny-house advocate in Oregon who travels the world teaching seminars on tiny-house construction.

“A very small minority live in R.V. parks, though they usually have a limit on how long you can stay,” he said. “A friend or family’s backyard, or land in the country, is much more common.”

For some, flouting zoning restrictions is an accepted, even celebrated, aspect of a culture that rejects the American appetite for big houses, rampant consumption and excess stuff. “It’s one of the last things we have where you can kind of stick it to the man,” Marcus Stoltzfus, a co-owner of Liberation Tiny Homes, near Lancaster, Pa., said with a smile.

In the right setting, illicit tiny-house dwellers can usually get away with it. “If it’s off the road and you’re on good terms with your neighbors, you probably won’t have an issue,” said Dave Cramer, an owner of Hudson River Tiny Homes, in the Albany area.

But with the tiny-living craze having lasted well past the fad stage, pressure is growing for municipalities to embrace tiny houses as legal residences. And more tiny-house building companies are popping up, anticipating just such a shift.

“The way they’re legalizing it, it’s coming from West to East,” said Tori Pond, who opened a tiny-home company called Craft & Sprout with her husband, Ken, in Greenwich, Conn, last year. “It’s a matter of when, not if.”

So far, advocates have made the most progress in changing ordinances governing so-called accessory dwelling units and backyard cottages. Some high-cost municipalities, including Fresno, Calif., and Nantucket, Mass., now allow tiny houses to share land with existing homes.

“It’s a spirit of cooperation,” Mr. Morrison said. “It’s a simple way to bring in affordable housing that doesn’t cost the municipality anything.”

Advocates hope the movement will gain more ground in coming years now that the International Code Council has approved a model code for tiny houses for inclusion in its International Residential Code, the most widely recognized residential building code in the country. Mr. Morrison, who led the effort to write the code, said it should alleviate both safety and aesthetic concerns for those states and municipalities that adopt it.

“There’s a fear that people are going to end up living in shanty shacks,” he said. “We don’t want that either. We want people to be safe in their houses, and in something they can afford.”

For the time being, however, finding a place to live long-term in a tiny house requires creativity, flexibility and considerable networking.

For Amy Garner and John McCarthy, it was a conversation over coffee with a well-connected architect that led them to the ideal location for their 340-square-foot tiny house in New Haven: waterside, at a marina on the Quinnipiac River.

For about $400 a month, including utility hookups, the couple enjoy up-close views of the river through the glass front of their Traveler XL, a high-end tiny home made by Escape Traveler. The spot alongside the docks has made their home a favorite hangout for friends, despite the close quarters, and it is only about a mile from their business, a Pilates studio.

“It’s perfect,” said Ms. Garner, 30. “You wake up in the morning, and the sun reflects off the water, and you get this twinkle effect on the bedroom ceiling.”

They have been there since April without issue, other than the occasional curious passers-by. And now they have a like-minded neighbor: A woman living in an Airstream, an aluminum-sided travel trailer, recently moved in behind them.

Lisa Cohen and Richard Ratcliff, who met last spring while hiking the Appalachian Trail, are hoping for similar stability while they finish converting a school bus they bought on eBay into a tiny house. Finding a place to park it within reasonable commuting distance of Sarah Lawrence College, in Bronxville, N.Y., where Ms. Cohen is a graduate student, was no easy feat.

“We asked a few farms, a gardening center and a flea market,” Ms. Cohen, 27, said in an email. “Everyone was kind and said they would think it over, but then would either not answer calls or said ‘no’ in the end.”

Eventually the couple found a restaurant owner in Dutchess County willing to let them park off to the side of his lot for $150 a month. (They asked that the restaurant not be identified.) Settled there for about a month now, they have access to electricity and well water. The train ride to Sarah Lawrence takes Ms. Cohen about 90 minutes, with three transfers, but she is appreciative of the spot, which she deemed preferable to “ending up in Walmart parking lots.”

Brianna Welch, 25, starts graduate school at the University of Vermont in January, and hopes to move from her Bronx apartment to the Burlington area in a 340-square-foot tiny house being built by Craft & Sprout. She and her husband, Chris Murphy, a 24-year-old software product manager, are actively hunting for land to rent, hoping to get settled before the first snow.

As of last week, they had no promising prospects. A year-round R.V. campground they looked into is already booked for the winter. Someone offered to rent them a building lot, but that particular town would require them to install a septic system, at a cost of about $18,000, and pay an $8,000 impact fee. As they look for farmland to rent, the couple are tapping sites like Tiny House Hosting, on Facebook, for connections.

“I think it’s going to be through our network that we find someone who knows someone who has land,” Ms. Welch said. “We knew this would be the hardest part, but I didn’t think it would be this hard.”

Finding a site in rural towns is often easier, because of the likelihood of looser zoning and enforcement. In Lodi, N.Y., for example, Eleanor Liebson, an occupational therapist, is hoping to start a tiny-house community on a portion of the 100-plus acres she owns near Finger Lakes National Forest. “There’s the potential because there’s no zoning in our town,” she said. “We can do it.”

The downside to remote sites, however, is the absence of readily available utility hookups. Seth Porges, a science and technology journalist, found that out after he bought a 180-square-foot tiny house last February. He put the house on rented farmland in the Hudson Valley to use as an Airbnb rental, and imagined it would be an off-the-grid experience.

The house had a solar energy system, 50-gallon water tanks and a dry-flush toilet. But he quickly realized that the solar power supply was not nearly robust enough, especially when the air-conditioner was on. And the water supply lasted only a few days before it had to be replenished.

“People think they’ll throw their house on a cheap piece of land and that’s the end of it,” said Mr. Porges, who lives in a regular house in a nearby town. “They don’t realize all the logistical challenges they’re going to face.”

He wound up hiring an electrician to lay heavy-gauge extension cords connecting the tiny house to a power supply elsewhere on the farm. And he invested in hoses specially designed for potable water to run downhill to his house from a spigot. But come winter, he expects those hoses will freeze, once again necessitating the use of the water tanks.

As for the dry-flush toilet, it functions as expected, essentially “shrink-wrapping your waste,” Mr. Porges said. But the disposable cartridges are fairly expensive: He calculates the cost at about $1 per flush. Other bathroom options for tiny homes include composting and incineration toilets.

For Kerri L. Richardson, a clutter-clearing coach and the author of “What Your Clutter is Trying to Tell You,” the hassles of tiny-house living are more appealing than the headaches of being tied to a traditional single-family home. She and her wife, Melissa Silk, sold their 2,200-square-foot home in Newburyport, Mass., about three years ago and have been gradually downsizing ever since. They are currently renting a 500-square-foot apartment in Groton, Conn., while building a 240-square-foot tiny home on a trailer.

“The roots that we had planted felt more like shackles,” said Ms. Richardson, 46. “It takes some courage to go against that societal template of life, but we decided we wanted to have more experiences and less things.”

As they both are able to work remotely, their plan is to tow their house up to northern New England later this fall – although they haven’t yet found a place to park it. While they’re not entirely averse to living under the radar, they would prefer to find a town where they can live aboveboard, Ms. Richardson said.

And if all else fails, they have a fallback: a year-round R.V. park they heard about in New Hampshire. “That’s our last choice,” Ms. Richardson said. “But if we have to, we will do it.”",Where Can You Park a Tiny Home?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/realestate/where-can-you-park-a-tiny-home.html

If neither the state nor individual prosecutors can be sued, the brief said, then Judge Donnelly’s ruling barring most suits against the city could mean that there would be no way for defendants to be compensated for — or to force changes in — a “D.A.’s unconstitutional or deliberately indifferent policy decisions.”

Both the ruling and the brief came in the case of Kareem Bellamy who was found guilty in 1995 of stabbing a man to death outside a C-Town supermarket in Rockaway, Queens. After he spent 13 years in prison, Mr. Bellamy’s conviction was overturned by a State Supreme Court judge who determined that someone else had committed the murder. Though the Queens district attorney’s office initially contested the reversal, it dismissed the indictment against Mr. Bellamy in September 2011. Six months later, he filed suit against two police officers who worked on his case, and also sued the district attorney’s office, accusing it of having an illegal policy in place that helped get him convicted.

According to depositions in the lawsuit, that policy established a so-called “Chinese wall” closing off communication between prosecutors in the Queens witness protection program who provided security for people testifying at criminal proceedings and the rank-and-file prosecutors who tried defendants like Mr. Bellamy in court. The lawsuit claims that the wall was designed to keep trial prosecutors unaware of any deals with witnesses that encouraged them to testify. That way, it maintains, the trial prosecutors could accurately tell a jury that they had no personal knowledge of agreements reached with witnesses.

Two years before Mr. Bellamy’s trial, the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, had ruled that a similar scheme in a different case — one that “shielded trial assistants from knowledge of benefits agreements made with witnesses” — was illegal. And even five years after the trial, the suit contends, the “Chinese wall” was still in effect.

Robert J. Masters, an executive assistant district attorney in Queens, said that although Mr. Bellamy’s case exposed “soft spots” in the program, communications have been improved between line prosecutors and witness protection experts. Mr. Masters said that witness security was still handled separately from trial preparation in order to ensure that witnesses understood that they were being called to testify because of what they knew, not because of rewards.

There is no way to track precisely how many lawsuits have accused prosecutors of misconduct in wrongful conviction cases, but these sorts of complaints tend to name the police as defendants because it is easier to litigate against them, according to Joel Rudin, a lawyer for Mr. Bellamy. Mr. Rudin added that about a half-dozen wrongful-conviction suits against New York prosecutors have been settled by the city in the last 10 years.

The Bellamy suit remains important because it has not been settled yet and will mark the first time in nearly 20 years that the issue of municipal liability will be considered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. “It’s absolutely going to be a pivotal case,” said John Hollway, an associate dean at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who has written extensively about wrongful convictions.

The cost of damages in wrongful-conviction cases can be steep. New York City and the state have already paid more than $40 million to settle suits in Brooklyn involving the retired city detective Louis Scarcella, and other suits are pending. But prosecutors in the Brooklyn district attorney’s office have largely avoided being caught up in those suits.

The Innocence Project, which helps exonerate the wrongfully convicted, and the criminal defense lawyer associations, joined Mr. Rudin’s suit through an amicus brief because they felt that Judge Donnelly’s ruling would further weaken accountability and create “a gaping safe haven” for official misconduct.

“Municipal liability provides a much-needed incentive for municipalities to hold their policy makers accountable,” their brief said. “That accountability can push DAs to adopt policies and practices that promote fair trials and implement training and disciplinary policies that reduce the likelihood of repeat mistakes and misconduct resulting in wrongful convictions.”",Holding Prosecutors Accountable Is Hard.

Cancer, by contrast, was an exterminator’s problem — a poisoner’s dilemma. Cancer-causing agents unleashed abnormal cellular proliferation by mutating genes involved in regulating growth. These cancer cells, occupying tissues and spreading, demanded a cellular poison — chemotherapy — that would spare normal cells and kill the malignant ones.

Cardiologists and oncologists — plumbers and poisoners — lived in different medical realms. We spoke different languages, attended different conferences, read different specialty journals. If our paths intersected, we considered the crossing coincidental, the unavoidable convergence of two common age-related illnesses on the same body.

I was a medical resident in Boston in the early 2000s when I heard a theory that would, in time, force these separate worlds to collide. Two cardiologists, Peter Libby and Paul Ridker, were thinking about plaque formation in a different way. Libby and Ridker acknowledged the role of cholesterol and lipids. But just as important was another variable, seldom discussed: inflammation — the recruitment and activation of certain immune cells. These activated immune cells infiltrated blood vessels early in the course of coronary disease and enabled plaques to grow and rupture. “Bad” cholesterol was a necessary part of the equation — it was these lipid deposits that may incite the immune cells, they proposed — but it was not sufficient.

If inflammation triggers coronary disease, might targeting it directly — beyond simply reducing cholesterol — decrease the risk of heart attacks? Over the course of a decade, Libby and Ridker found themselves focusing on a molecule involved in inflammation called interleukin-1 beta. By the mid-2000s, they heard of a new drug — an interleukin-1-beta inhibitor — that was used to treat exceedingly rare inflammatory diseases. In April 2011, Ridker’s team started enrolling 10,000 patients who carried signs of inflammation and were at very high risk for coronary disease in a randomized study to determine the effects of the inhibitor on heart disease and strokes.

The results, published this August, are provocative: Despite no change in cholesterol levels, there was a demonstrable reduction in heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular death, particularly at higher doses of the drug. But what caught my attention was a separate analysis that asked a seemingly unrelated question: Might the drug also reduce the risk of cancer? In a paper published in The Lancet, Ridker and his colleagues found that drug-treated patients had a drop in all cancer mortality. More striking still was a stark decrease in the incidence of and deaths from lung cancer. Some element of inflammation that drives plaque formation in coronary disease is also driving cancer progression. It’s a study that needs careful replication; the analysis was designed to suggest a hypothesis, not to prove it. There are questions about drug pricing and the risks of infections and low blood counts. But if the benefit holds up in future trials, interleukin-1-beta inhibition could eventually rank among the most effective prevention strategies in the recent history of cancer.

Inflammation at the nexus between cancer and heart disease? But of course, some of you must be thinking, with an exasperated nod. You’ve had your third serving of blueberries; you’ve drunk your green tea. Wasn’t it obvious all the while?

It isn’t so simple. An avalanche of studies has implicated inflammation as a central player in many diseases — but there are inconsistencies. Consider an inflammatory illness like lupus: The risk of most cancers (except some virally related cancers and lymphomas) in lupus patients is only marginally higher. Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of lymphomas — but oddly lowers the risk of breast cancer. Tuberculosis, an inflammation-inducing disease, appears to promote lung-cancer risk, but in an animal study, eczema, weirdly, reduces the risk of skin cancer. Meanwhile, an alternative-medicine industry daily peddles “anti-inflammatory” diets — but which of these reduce inflammation, or what types of inflammation are affected, remains far from known.

“Inflammation,” in short, is a concept in flux — “a wastebasket word,” as Padmanee Sharma, an immuno-oncologist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, told me. There isn’t one inflammation: Lupus, tuberculosis and influenza all cause “inflammation,” but each might provoke different or overlapping wings of immune responses. I asked James Allison, who pioneered cancer immunotherapy, to define “inflammation,” and he paused, considering the definition. “It’s a response to injury, mediated by immunological cells. But there are dozens of cell types communicating through even further dozens of signals.”

We might imagine inflammation, then, as a fuse box that you chance upon in a new house. You are looking for the switch that turns the light on in the living room, or one that turns the alarm off (just as we’re hoping to throw the switch that disables cancer growth or plaque formation). But the circuitry baffles you. Some knobs are marked in crimson: Do Not Touch. Some carry no labels. Some do, but the writing is in a foreign language.

“Inflammation, an umbrella term, is now being broken up into many different categories,” Sharma told me. Is it chronic or acute? Is there a “right” kind of inflammation that protects us from infections and a “wrong” kind that precipitates disease? Is it mediated “adaptive” immunity — the type of immunity involving B and T cells that adapts to infections? Or “innate” immunity, the more ancient phalanx of immune responses that is preprogrammed to fight certain pathogens?

When doctors read trials like Ridker’s, we generally ask two sets of questions. The first might be loosely described as: Is it good science and good medicine? Was the concept proposed in the study proved by the trial? Were the conclusions accurate, the adverse effects acceptable? Cardiologists and oncologists I spoke to agreed on the technical accuracy of the study. One of them noted the modest benefit for heart disease; Ridker and Libby counter that the drug is at least as effective as some cholesterol-reducing medicines.

But there’s a second kind of inquiry that’s harder to put a finger on, for it lives in a nearly aesthetic realm. Does the study illuminate something strange and wonderful about human physiology? A trial might be “good”— but is it, well, “beautiful”? This study is: It links disparate arenas of medicine through a common pathological mechanism. It’s hard to know whether the illnesses in the man I met were driven by inflammation, but Ridker and Libby forced me to view his case — and a thousand other cases I’d seen previously — under new clinical lights. I will never think about patients with cancer and coronary disease in the same way.

There’s another twist of wonder, though. What are the chances that one molecule, sitting at one corner of the immune response, acts as a switch for two utterly different diseases? It must be a quirk in our design, a barely visible chink in physiology that allows us to target inflammation in a manner that doesn’t kill or maim but acts just so, disabling two terrifying illnesses. It’s as if we had walked into the basement of the new house, found the fuse box, learned to read the coded language of the labels and — in the partial darkness — pulled just one switch. And, miracle of miracles: Upstairs, only the living-room lights went on.","What We Learn When Two Ruthless Killers, Heart Disease and Cancer, Reveal a Common Root",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/can-heart-disease-shed-light-on-cancer.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Iraqi troops, including Shiite Muslim militias incorporated into Iraq’s armed forces, are already in the Kirkuk area. While the city is controlled by Kurdish forces, Iraqi troops are fighting the Islamic State as part of an American-led coalition about 40 miles southwest of the city.

Kurdish troops known as pesh merga seized Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi Army fled an assault by militants there.

The inclusion of Kirkuk and other disputed areas in the referendum enraged the Iraqi government, which interpreted the move as a land grab. Baghdad has accused the Kurds of illegally selling Iraqi oil from the Kirkuk oil fields through a pipeline that runs into Turkey.

The Kurdish independence challenge is the latest crisis to rock Iraq in recent years. The country was controlled by Saddam Hussein’s regime until 2003, when the American invasion helped set off a brutal civil war and years of wrenching upheaval.

Just three years ago, Iraq lost a third of its territory to Islamic State militants. Now that the Islamic State is finally being driven out, Iraq is faced with losing a third of its territory and access to areas with oil and natural gas if Kurdistan breaks away.

Beyond the threats of military action, Iraqi authorities have struggled to come up with any meaningful punishment for the Kurds for carrying out the referendum. But with its move to shut down flights to the landlocked region, Iraq seems to have found a weak point.

Iraqi aviation authorities notified foreign airlines on Wednesday that it would cancel all permits to land and take off from two international airports in the Kurdish region as of Friday afternoon. The action followed an ultimatum by Prime Minister Abadi on Tuesday for Kurdistan to surrender control of its two international airports or face a shutdown of international flights.

The Kurdish Regional Government said Wednesday that it would refuse to hand over the airports. The region’s transportation minister, Mawlud Murad, called the Iraqi ultimatum “political and illegal.” He said the airports were critical to the American-led coalition’s fight against Islamic State militants.

Kurdish officials had planned to send a delegation to Baghdad on Wednesday to discuss the issue, but the offer was rebuffed.

On Wednesday night, Mr. Murad said that the Kurdish government had agreed to hold talks with Iraq about placing Iraqi government observers at its airports.

There was no immediate public response from the Iraqi government, but Mr. Abadi, speaking to Parliament earlier, said Iraq would not negotiate with the Kurds unless they annulled the results of the vote.

He said he had warned the Kurds “of the consequences of the crisis with Kurdistan.”

“The preservation of the security of the citizens of the country is our priority,” he added.

At least six airlines — three Turkish companies, the Lebanese carrier Middle East Airlines, Royal Jordanian and Egypt Air — started notifying passengers on Wednesday that they were canceling regularly scheduled flights from the airports in Erbil and Sulaimaniya.

Baghdad can make good on its threat because the Iraqi civil aviation authority oversees all airports in the country, including the two international airports in the Kurdish region.

The threat to cancel landing and takeoff permits would force international airlines to cancel flights to those airports because insurance risks would be too high, according to Robert W. Mann Jr., a former airline executive who is now an industry consultant.

“The issue turns on which entity controls Kurdish region airspace and airports,” Mr. Mann said. “Unless and until the autonomous region is given that control, Iraq controls and can ban, blockade or embargo air service to airports under its control, much as Qatari airports have been embargoed or blockaded by nearby nations. Faced with such a restriction, most commercial airlines would comply, in part due to warnings by their insurers.”

The Turkish Consulate in Erbil said that Turkish airlines were working to increase their seat capacity in an effort to get all passengers out of the Kurdish areas before the flight ban took effect on Friday afternoon.

Without international flights, getting in or out of Kurdistan would require going through Turkey, Iran, Syria or Iraq, where there are also threats of a blockade.

The Iraqi Parliament urged the government on Wednesday to close off its land border with Kurdistan.

For years, the Kurdish authorities in Erbil have controlled their own borders with Turkey and Syria. Mr. Abadi has demanded that all borders return to full Iraqi central government control by Friday.

Photo

Turkey’s customs minister, in remarks carried by Turkish state television, said that the main land border crossing between Turkey and the Iraqi Kurdish region remained open, although he would not say for how long that would remain the case.

Turkey is the largest trade partner with Iraqi Kurdistan, and the road border is used for much of the cargo trade. Turkey also is the transit country for the oil pumped out of areas controlled by the Kurdish authorities to the world market.

Turkey and Iran have opposed the referendum and any moves toward Kurdish independence, fearing unrest by their own Kurdish minorities.

Kurdish authorities in Erbil announced on Wednesday that 92.7 percent of those who went to the polls on Monday had voted for Kurdish leaders to seek independence. About 72 percent of 4.6 million registered voters cast ballots, with about 2.9 million voting yes to independence and about 224,000 voting no, the Kurdish Independent High Electoral Referendum Commission reported.

The referendum does not automatically trigger a declaration of independence but sets in motion a series of moves toward the establishment of a Kurdish state. The most important one of those may be negotiations of a separation with Iraq, which Iraq has refused.

American officials opposed the vote because they feared it would destabilize Iraq, stir ethnic conflict and undermine the American-led coalition.

Kurdish pesh merga fighters have played a central role in the coalition’s operations against the Islamic State militants, fighting alongside Iraqi Army units.

The Kurdish region’s president, Massoud Barzani, pushed for the referendum in hopes of obtaining a strong public mandate for eventual independence that he could use to begin negotiations with Baghdad.

Kurds have been celebrating since Monday evening, setting off fireworks, honking horns and affixing flapping red, white and green Kurdish flags to their automobiles.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — When you’ve had a busy or a tough week — a week where it feels as if your hair is on fire — your best bet is to find a distraction. Ideally, this distraction should be good for you (or at least not terribly harmful) and should allow you to focus hard on it so that you can temporarily displace thoughts about what kindled that hair fire to begin with.

My own go-to distractions are running, reading, cooking and knitting. When I really need to distract myself and focus down, I enjoy British-style cryptic crosswords. I’m sure you have your own distractions.

My point is, once the hair fire is extinguished and the smoke settles, you deserve a reward for making it through. The Venn diagram of “distractions from hair fires” and “rewards” probably overlaps quite a bit, but in my opinion, sitting down on a Friday with a lovely beverage and a Patrick Berry themeless crossword is one of the best ways to end the week. I put that firmly in the rewards circle.

Mr. Berry can bring some fresh entries to his grids and bring back entries that have not been seen for a while. The middle section — BARBARA JORDAN, SOCIAL STUDIES and ACCOUNT HOLDER — is O.K. in terms of liveliness, but those are all debuts, so bonus points there.

In 2011, the governor and the Legislature approved a cap on property taxes in an effort to limit the annual growth to 2 percent or the rate of inflation.
“We’ve tried attacking property taxes in all different ways,” he said.
“But you need structural changes on the local and county level if you’re going to make a real difference in property taxes.
Nonetheless, some county officials still viewed the initiative with skepticism, even cynicism.","The new statute, enacted into law when the state budget passed in April, laid out a timeline by which leaders in every county outside New York City had to appoint a panel of local elected officials, brainstorm ideas for sharing services, draft a plan and hold a vote. As an incentive, the state said that in 2018, the first full year of implementation, it would match any savings the towns and counties achieved.

Nearly three dozen counties approved such plans earlier this month, for a total savings to taxpayers next year of $220 million, state officials said. The other counties decided to punt the initiative to next year, when they will have to follow a similar timeline. If panels reject a shared-services plan, the law requires any members who cast nay votes to explain their decisions to constituents.

The goal of leaders in Albany is to reduce taxes — a formidable task, given that New York State makes up a taxable kingdom. There are county, city, town and village governments, along with school districts, each with their own budgets and taxing authority. Then there are fire districts, water districts, sewer districts, park districts and on and on.

The layers of services, and taxes, have made the tax bill an object of dread, particularly in suburbs like Westchester and Nassau, which frequently top rankings for the nation’s highest property taxes. Yet historically, the push to consolidate by regionalizing a high school, say, or merging two police departments has been anathema to many residents who are loath to even share their snowplows.

In announcing passage of the state budget, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, called high property taxes “the single greatest problem in this state,” pointing out that the median state income tax was $1,800, compared to the median property tax of $4,700. In 2011, the governor and the Legislature approved a cap on property taxes in an effort to limit the annual growth to 2 percent or the rate of inflation.

“We’ve tried attacking property taxes in all different ways,” he said. “But you need structural changes on the local and county level if you’re going to make a real difference in property taxes. This budget empowers citizens to say to their local governments, ‘Enough is enough. We need you to make structural changes and we need you to do it now.’”

The new statute stopped short of making local governments combine village halls or even municipal departments, avoiding the unpopular term “consolidation” all together. Nonetheless, some county officials still viewed the initiative with skepticism, even cynicism.

Steve Bellone, the Suffolk County executive, saw it as an opportunity.

A few years ago, Mr. Bellone oversaw the merger of the county comptroller and treasurer departments. “It’s human inclination to want to keep things the same,” he said. “These were two departments within county government and that was a massive challenge. So getting separate and distinct governments working together is a monumental task.”

Mr. Bellone immediately appointed Mr. Kaiman to become the shared-services czar; Mr. Kaiman, a former supervisor of North Hempstead, had managed to swap services and streamline government functions in that sprawling town, which has no fewer than 30 incorporated villages and 11 school districts.

“This wasn’t a volunteer scenario,” Mr. Bellone said from his 12th-floor office in the county government complex here. “But I viewed it as an opportunity to have leaders in our region communicate and collaborate in a way that we never have before, with the idea that positive things could come from that.”

Getting a majority of the 48 mayors, supervisors and school leaders on the shared-services panel to a “yes” vote was not easy, however.

In fact, in the days before the shared-services statute became law, the Suffolk County Village Officials Association passed a resolution opposing it. In a letter to Mr. Bellone, the association said the initiative “poses a serious threat to home rule, restricts village budgets and jeopardizes the ability of local municipalities to adequately govern.”

Mr. Kaiman’s first priority was to meet with mayors and town supervisors to reassure them that the state initiative was more about sharing than consolidating.

“It’s about identity,” said Mr. Kaiman, explaining the resistance. “I identify with my local school and my local village or town. People don’t want to lose that. But we can still come up with ways to benefit from our common resources, our excess capacity.”

After meeting throughout the summer, the panel drafted a plan that is projected to save a potential $37 million over two years.

As an example, Mr. Kaiman said that if one municipality had a graffiti-cleaning truck, but only used it part of the year, officials could rent the truck to towns and villages that don’t have one. “I can call up Islip and ask to rent their graffiti truck,” he said. “Otherwise, I would have to hire some company or dedicate 10 workers to scrape off graffiti. The town with the resource is making money. The town that’s getting the resource is saving money by not going to the private sector.”

When Mr. Kaiman led North Hempstead, the town’s sign shop made 2,000 signs for local schools and governments. “Villages and schools were getting estimates of $1,250 for one sign, so we did it for $450,” he said.

Robert Mujica, the state budget director, praised Suffolk’s plan. “It’s robust,” he said. “They took it very seriously. They looked at not only sharing services but using technology and auditing processes to make sure the savings are there. All the things you should be doing — it looks like they did.”

State officials said that some 400 initiatives were included in the plans approved by counties this year. In Montgomery County, changes to the way records are retained is expected to yield $1.5 million in taxpayer savings. Nassau County’s plan included more than a dozen ideas for sharing services among villages, from pothole repair to code enforcement. The initiative should save $130 million over a number of years.

Virtually all of the savings in the Nassau plan — $128 million — would result from the conversion of Long Beach’s antiquated sewage treatment plant to a pump house, diverting the city’s wastewater to a county plant.

In Suffolk, its shared-services plan was passed unanimously on Sept. 12. Mr. Kaiman believes the key to securing the panel’s support was the emphasis on autonomy. In other words, no one will be forced to share or buy or barter.

“If it’s not exactly the product you want, go use the local sign shop,” he said. “You never lose your independent authority as a municipality. We believe in local government too. We don’t believe in waste and inefficiency.”","New York Towns’ New Deal: We’ll Make Your Signs, You Sweep Our Streets",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/nyregion/new-york-consolidation-shared-services.html

He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

Some of his observations in Mr. Roth’s script, largely culled from 80 hours of recorded conversations between its two characters (who both died in the 1980s), are so presciently on-target they leave you reeling. Listen, for example, to an aside Warhol delivers about his ever-trusty cassette recorder.

Everybody he came in contact with, he says, wound up performing for the tape. “You couldn’t tell which problems were real,” he said, “and which problems were exaggerated. Better yet, the people telling you the problems couldn’t decide anymore if they were really having the problems or just performing.”

Did you hear that, Kardashians and Real Housewives of everywhere? Decades before you became TV stars by just being “yourself,” Warhol had predicted your future.

As might have been expected, “WARHOLCAPOTE” is filled with gleefully exchanged gossip. Some of it is merely lubricious; some of it verges on the profound. Capote recalls Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis telling him, “Because of an accident of history, I’ll always be an object of curiosity, like something you see in a freak show.”

That Warhol and Capote were kindred sideshow attractions may make you nostalgic for an era in which artists and writers were considered worthy of mass fascination. But Mr. Roth’s play, which doesn’t always disguise its cut-and-paste seams, turns out to be about how public freakishness leads its victims to the solace of anesthesia.

Capote found it in pills and liquor; Warhol, in a willed detachment that transformed emotional peaks and valleys into glazed, flatline curiosity. Both men turned their ways of battling anxiety into copiously documented public personas that would seem to be easy to imitate but are not.

Mr. Spinella, best known for his passionate, Tony-winning performances in the “Angels in America” plays, here has the harder task, finding the affect in Warhol’s affectlessness. And his owlish, little-boy-lost Andy only sporadically convinces. (In wig and spectacles, he reminded me more of the superstar book editor Robert Gottlieb.)

The more combustible Capote, who wore his psychodrama like a cascading pocket handkerchief, provides more obvious actorly substance. And Mr. Butler, who replaced Leslie Jordan late in rehearsals, has moments of raw, bleeding anguish that make you ache for the cyclone of self-destruction that his character became. Of course, as Warhol might have pointed out, this Capote is performing for a tape recorder.

The pain that courses through Ms. Friedman’s “Merrily We Roll Along,” which I saw in an earlier version at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London four years ago, is authentic enough to keep its audience bathed in tears. Never mind that Mr. Furth’s book — adapted from a 1934 play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart and a 16-performance flop on Broadway — remains a compendium of heartbreak-of-success clichés.

There’s a reason that these clichés — about shedding your integrity and identity on the road to stardom — have never been displaced: They still apply. The hard truth that celebrity, or the maintenance of it, tends to make its possessors more and more superficial is the reason that novels about the rich and famous so often feel flat. (I would argue that Jacqueline Susann, the author of celebrity potboilers like “Valley of the Dolls,” was as right in her way as Warhol was.)

Ms. Friedman, best known as a star of the London musical stage and a veteran interpreter of Sondheim, appreciates the depths of feeling to be dredged from such shallows. And she allows the layers of ambivalence in this exquisite score to color everything onstage.

In following the show’s chronologically reversed path of a successful film producer — from middle age in Hollywood to his idealistic youth in Manhattan — the production brings out the sharpness in the showbiz satire. (This aspect is wittily enhanced by Soutra Gilmour’s time-capsule sets and costumes and by Tim Jackson’s effortlessly integrated choreography.)

But what makes this “Merrily” transcendent is the conviction and nuance of the three performers at its center, who embody a friendship under siege. They include two happy holdovers from the London production: Mark Umbers, as Franklin Shepard, the charismatic composer who goes Hollywood, and Damian Humbley, as Charley Kringas, his longtime pal and collaborator.

New to the cast (although you wouldn’t know it) is Eden Espinosa as Mary, the alcoholic novelist in love with Frank. Supported by a fine-tuned ensemble, they are all close to flawless in navigating Mr. Sondheim’s intricate melody lines. More important, they use the splintered music to convey a fractious but blessed interconnectedness that makes their retrospective coming apart all the more poignant.

For the first time in my experience, Frank is the beating, shattered heart of the show. That’s partly a matter of how Ms. Friedman has ingeniously framed her production. But it’s also a consequence Mr. Umbers’s startlingly sympathetic performance of a (usually unsympathetic) man to whom fame happens.

The busy hurricane season of 2017 has given fresh purpose to a president who, until now, made most of his own weather inside the West Wing. On Tuesday, he said he would visit Puerto Rico and the storm-ravaged Virgin Islands next week. The White House issued photos of a grave-looking Mr. Trump being briefed in the Situation Room.

But the hurricanes are yet another reminder of this president’s rare capacity for self-congratulation — a trait that seems particularly ill-suited to the aftermath of deadly disasters, when the plight of people who lost homes or even family members would seem to take precedence over testimonials to FEMA.

From the start, Mr. Trump has had trouble separating himself from the story. On his first visit to Texas after Hurricane Harvey swamped Houston, the president went to a firehouse in Corpus Christi, nearly 220 miles away, for a briefing with federal, state and local officials that stopped just short of being a pep rally. “We’ll congratulate each other when it’s all finished,” he told the group.

Outside, he greeted a crowd of about 1,000 who had gathered by saying, “What a crowd! What a turnout!”

Four days later, Mr. Trump returned to the state — this time, to meet actual victims of the storm. He handed out cardboard boxes with hot dogs and potato chips to residents in Houston, and talked about the love he had seen in the NRG Center, a convention center converted into a shelter for nearly 1,200 people. But he could not resist a victory lap.

“They’re really happy with what’s going on,” he told reporters traveling with him. “It’s something that’s been very well received. Even by you guys, it’s been very well received.”

In Florida, after Hurricane Irma roared up the Gulf Coast, Mr. Trump seemed more at ease in his role as a consoler. At a ruined mobile home park in Naples, he handed out encouragement along with hoagies. But when one man yelled, “Where was Obama during the last hurricane? On a golf course,” Mr. Trump stopped and asked whether he had voted for him.

“Best vote of your life?” the president said, with a grin.

Puerto Rico, unlike Texas and Florida, is not Trump country. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida trounced him in the Republican primary there in March 2016. And Mr. Trump has been noticeably less vocal about the damage from Hurricane Maria. Over the weekend, as Puerto Ricans ran perilously low on food, water and fuel, he posted nothing about the crisis.

Yet he posted 17 tweets about sports — from the dispute he single-handedly revived over the N.F.L. and the national anthem to his withdrawal of an invitation for Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors to visit the White House. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump denied that he had neglected Puerto Rico in favor of his feud with professional athletes.

“I’ve heard that before: ‘Was I preoccupied?’” he said. “Not at all, not at all. I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work.”

Some residents of the Virgin Islands, parts of which were leveled by Irma, feel similarly overlooked by Washington. Kenneth E. Mapp, the governor, assured them that Mr. Trump had told him he “loves the Virgin Islands.”

When the president finally did get around to addressing Puerto Rico, on Monday, he led off with some unsympathetic observations about the territory’s well-publicized fiscal problems.

“Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble,” he said in a series of tweets. “It’s old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities – and doing well.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he had deployed Navy ships to Puerto Rico. His homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, and the FEMA administrator, Brock Long, traveled there to meet with officials. But even then, Mr. Trump said less about the resilience of the people than about the territory’s problems. The federal government, he said, had to take over some security because police officers, having lost their homes, had gone off duty.

After his news conference, Mr. Trump tweeted, “America’s hearts & prayers are with the people of #PuertoRico & the #USVI. We will get through this — and we will get through this TOGETHER!”

To the extent that Mr. Trump lauded Puerto Rican officials, however, it was for their praise and gratitude for his administration’s efforts.

“We have had tremendous reviews from government officials, as we have in Texas and Louisiana, and as we have in Florida,” Mr. Trump said, singling out Greg Abbott of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida as “great governors.”

For a moment, it looked like he would pay a similar tribute to the governor of Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosselló.

But when Girardi walked into a news conference immediately after the loss, he struck a tone far different from the one he used on Saturday.
Instead, Girardi clung to Green’s “success” against Lindor, who had walked twice and struck out twice previously against Green.
Advertisement Continue reading the main storySince replay was instituted for the 2014 season, nobody has been more efficient than Weber.
It was unclear whether Girardi understood that, unlike in the regular season, he had two challenges instead of one.","Given a night of restless sleep — and after perhaps letting an excoriation from the news media (including from commentators on the YES Network, which is partly owned by the Yankees) sink in — Girardi ventured to the Bronx on Saturday, disassembled his standard defensive armor and offered up something unusual: a mea culpa.

“I screwed up,” he said.

“In hindsight, yeah,” he added. “I wish I would have challenged it.”

“Again, I screwed up,” he went on. “And it’s hard. It’s a hard day for me.”

In his decade as manager of the Yankees, Girardi has probably offered fewer such apologies than the number of pitching changes he made on Friday night. Typically, questions to him that call for self-reflection are dealt with dismissively. On Saturday, he responded with something approaching humility.

When he was asked near the end of Saturday’s 12-minute news conference if this mistake would be hard for him to forget, Girardi said: “Let’s just see what happens tomorrow and as we move forward. That will probably determine the severity of it.”

If the replay fiasco indeed becomes the epitaph for this Yankees season, it will be the latest once-a-decade, mistake-by-the-lake moment the team has endured in Cleveland, which happens to be the ancestral home of the Steinbrenners, the team’s owners.

The nonreview would be a fitting accompaniment to Mariano Rivera’s surrendering the only road playoff home run of his career — to Sandy Alomar Jr., with the Yankees four outs from clinching a 1997 division series — and to the swarm of midges that befuddled pitcher Joba Chamberlain and unspooled the Yankees in a 2007 series loss.

That last playoff defeat here a decade ago turned out to seal the end for Manager Joe Torre, whose forced departure after the season paved the way for Girardi’s entrance.

Though the current ownership, led by Hal Steinbrenner, is more deliberate, questions will nevertheless be invited about Girardi, whose contract expires after this season — including, apparently, from inside his own clubhouse. Early Saturday morning, reliever Aroldis Chapman’s Instagram account liked a fan’s post expressing hope that the Yankees would not renew Girardi’s contract, calling the manager “a complete imbecile.”

(A Yankees spokesman, Jason Zillo, said Chapman had accidentally liked the post and had apologized to Girardi.)

Girardi had a number of other moves backfire on Friday night — lifting C. C. Sabathia after only 77 pitches, leaning too heavily on the relievers Chad Green and David Robertson, and using Ronald Torreyes as a pinch-runner and then watching him be picked off second base. But when Girardi walked into a news conference immediately after the loss, he struck a tone far different from the one he used on Saturday.

Instead of acknowledging that he had slipped on a banana peel, he offered explanations.

Girardi ignored that Green — one of baseball’s best at avoiding bats — did not appear typically untouchable after throwing 42 pitches in the Yankees’ wild-card win on Tuesday. He had allowed eight two-strike pitches to be fouled off before Lindor’s home run. Instead, Girardi clung to Green’s “success” against Lindor, who had walked twice and struck out twice previously against Green.

It was his response to questions about the replay, though, that sounded especially hollow.

“My thought is I never want to break a pitcher’s rhythm,” Girardi said. “That’s how I think about it. So if it’s not something — there was nothing that said he was not hit.”

That’s not quite accurate. Catcher Gary Sanchez told Girardi immediately that he heard the ball hit Chisenhall’s bat. Players in the Yankees dugout noticed that Chisenhall never flinched. “When there wasn’t a reaction from the hitter, I was yelling that it didn’t hit him,” designated hitter Chase Headley said.

When it comes to challenging umpire’s calls, managers generally view their players’ pleadings with a skeptic’s eye: Trust but verify.

Weber, the coaching assistant who walked away from a job as a stock analyst, has consistently rewarded Girardi’s faith.

When he sees something on one of the two flat-panel monitors, which can carry as many as 15 different camera angles, Weber picks up a phone and calls the dugout. The bench coach Rob Thomson answers and relays what Weber says to Girardi, who will signal to umpires whether he wants to challenge a call. Teams are allotted 30 seconds to make a decision.

Since replay was instituted for the 2014 season, nobody has been more efficient than Weber. The Yankees have had the highest percentage of calls overturned in three of the four seasons. The exception was in 2016, when they were second. The Yankees won 29 of 41 challenges this season.

“Webby is usually right on,” Girardi said in an interview last year. “I don’t even run back and look, and I could run back and look in our clubhouse. I trust him with anything.”

But on Friday night, Girardi said, Weber was not immediately provided with the same slow-motion replay that TV viewers saw, which showed the ball hitting the knob of Chisenhall’s bat and deflecting into the glove of Sanchez. If the call had been overturned, the pitch would have been a third strike and the final out of the inning, depriving Lindor of his bases-loaded at-bat.

(Weber said after the game that he wanted to comment but had been instructed not to.)

Girardi said he was told that Weber had found the replays available to him inconclusive. The manager had to decide whether to make a challenge anyway. It was unclear whether Girardi understood that, unlike in the regular season, he had two challenges instead of one. And beginning in the eighth inning, managers can always ask the crew chief to initiate a review.

“Now, knowing that I had two challenges, in hindsight, yeah, I wish I would have challenged it,” Girardi said on Saturday, almost as an aside.

It was a startling admission from a manager who takes great pride in being fastidiously prepared and always in search of an edge.

Mr. McConnell could be an anchor around incumbents in the same fashion as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who is routinely used to undermine Democratic candidates. The loudest applause Mr. Moore received during an election-eve rally came when he declared, “Mitch McConnell needs to be replaced.”

In a memo about the Alabama election that circulated among Republican donors, Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a “super PAC” closely allied with Mr. McConnell, said primary voters were intensely angry and inclined to blame Republicans for dysfunction in Washington.

“The Republican Congress has replaced President Obama as the bogeyman for conservative G.O.P. primary voters,” Mr. Law wrote, cautioning that the president was helping to amplify that point of view: “This narrative is driven by Trump himself, and it resonates with primary voters who believe the Republican Congress ‘isn’t doing enough’ (as we frequently heard in focus groups) to advance the president’s agenda.”

Mr. Law, whose group spent more than $10 million to prop up Mr. Strange, said in the memo that Republicans had been damaged by “the Obamacare repeal fiasco,” and said they should expect to fight hard-right primary candidates in Mississippi and Nevada, among other states. Mr. Law derided Mr. Bannon for being focused mainly on “promoting his own brand,” and discounted him as a major force in Alabama.

The convulsive mood on the right has considerably reshaped the political map for 2018, making a favorable list of Senate races somewhat less hospitable to Republicans. Two Republican senators, Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona, have seen their poll numbers collapse after clashing with Mr. Trump and embracing unpopular legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

In Tennessee, Senator Bob Corker, a well-liked lawmaker from a traditional Republican mold, on Tuesday became the first Senate Republican to announce that he would not seek re-election in 2018. His departure is likely to yield a contentious Republican primary, much like the one just concluded in Alabama.

The Alabama race “is going to inspire a lot of people,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview in Montgomery on Tuesday night.

Mr. Bannon said he had held discussions about the Tennessee race with Mark E. Green, a state senator who was nominated to be Mr. Trump’s Army secretary before withdrawing after facing scrutiny for his past statements about gay and transgender people. Tennessee could be the site of the next major populist-versus-establishment conflagration if Gov. Bill Haslam responds to entreaties to enter the race.

Mr. Bannon also said he aimed to oust Mr. Heller, Mr. Flake and Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Ed Martin, a former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, said Mr. Bannon had also inquired about the state’s Senate race, in which the Republican establishment has rallied around Josh Hawley, the state attorney general, as an opponent for Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat.

After leaving the White House last month, Mr. Bannon returned to his perch at Breitbart News, and has been using the hard-right website and his close ties to the Mercer family, New York-based conservative donors, to create a new, insurgent power base.

It remains unlikely that Republicans will lose control of the Senate next year, because the playing field of races is tilted so strongly in their direction. The party is defending just eight seats, mostly in strongly conservative states, compared with 25 seats held by Democrats or independents who caucus with them.

Yet the pitfalls Republicans have encountered so far have created unexpected opportunities for Democrats, and the party is assessing even long-shot races where there is the possibility of an upset. In Tennessee, a solidly Republican state, several new Democrats are considering the race for Mr. Corker’s seat: Mayor Andy Berke of Chattanooga said in a statement that he would explore a bid “in the coming weeks,” and State Senator Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville legislator, is also eyeing the race. One Democrat, James Mackler, a lawyer and Iraq war veteran, is already running.

And in conservative Alabama, both Democrats and Republicans believe Mr. Moore’s nomination may put the seat at risk in a Dec. 12 general election, when he faces Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor who is the Democratic nominee.

Mr. Jones is scheduled to campaign with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. next week, and said in an interview on Tuesday that he would seek support from Republican and independent voters who may be repelled by Mr. Moore, who was removed from the bench for defying Supreme Court rulings and has called in the past for banning homosexuality.

In a sign of Mr. Moore’s vulnerability, Mr. Law’s memo described him as off-putting to “business-oriented Republicans,” who “recoil at Moore’s grandstanding.”

It is not only Republican senators who could find themselves cast out by conservative challengers next year. A parade of candidates, aligning themselves explicitly with Mr. Trump, is lining up to take on House Republicans whom they view as insufficiently loyal to the president. If enough Republican lawmakers are ousted in primaries, or forced to spend millions just to secure renomination, it could give Democrats a better chance to pick up the two dozen seats they need to take a majority.

“I think incumbents are extremely vulnerable,” said Barry Moore, an Alabama state representative challenging Representative Martha Roby, a Republican who called on Mr. Trump to withdraw from the presidential race late last fall. “The American people are sending a message that there’s nothing getting done in D.C., and we’re going to have to replace a lot of those people.”

A spokesman for Ms. Roby, Todd Stacy, noted that she and “her House colleagues have voted to repeal Obamacare, roll back Obama regulations, repeal Dodd-Frank, fund border wall construction, rebuild the military, reform the V.A. and tax reform got rolled out today.”

Still, the alarm is most acute in the Senate. Party strategists have seen private polling in a number of states that shows Mr. McConnell deeply unpopular with his fellow Republicans. In Arizona they have found Mr. Flake trailing his primary challenger, Kelli Ward, a former state senator, by a significant margin.

This month, Senator John McCain, Mr. Flake’s Arizona colleague, staged something of a gentle intervention, urging Mr. Flake to move more aggressively to repair his standing in the party, according to two Republicans briefed on the conversation.

Mr. Bannon taunted Mr. Flake on Tuesday night, suggesting that if the Arizona senator “doesn’t get a better poll in the next 30 days, you’re going to see him step down or the establishment is going to make him” — a possibility Mr. Flake’s campaign spokesman discounted.

“He is running,” said Will Allison, a spokesman for Mr. Flake.

In Mississippi, Mr. Wicker, a former chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has been gearing up early in anticipation of a revolt on the right, hiring a veteran campaign manager, Justin Brasell, and branding himself on social media as a fierce ally of Mr. Trump.

But Chris McDaniel, a Mississippi state senator who nearly toppled Mr. Wicker’s colleague, Thad Cochran, in a 2014 primary, said that Mr. Moore’s victory made a challenge against Mr. Wicker “more compelling” and that he would decide by the end of October. He said he had spoken multiple times with the Mercers in recent months and had received assurances of support.

Mr. Wicker, he charged, had become “Mitch McConnell’s yes-man.”",Roy Moore’s Alabama Victory Sets Off Talk of a G.O.P. Insurrection,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/republican-senate-alabama-mcconnell.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

As a physician who graduated from a domestic medical school, I’ve often heard others disparaging doctors who went to medical school outside the country as if they were inferior. Those complaints are not supported by data. A study from Health Affairs in 2010 found that patients with congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction had lower mortality rates when treated by doctors who were foreign medical graduates. Another from earlier this year in the BMJ found that older patients who were treated by foreign medical graduates had lower mortality as well, even though they seemed to be sicker in general.

A recent study in Annals of Internal Medicine shows that these graduates are also responsible for a significant amount of teaching. Of the 80,000 or so academic physicians in the country, more than 18 percent were foreign medical graduates. More than 15 percent of full professors in medical schools in the United States were educated elsewhere, most often in Asia, Western Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean.

Foreign medical graduates also do a lot of research. Although they are ineligible for some National Institutes of Health funding — which is granted only to citizens of this country — they still manage, through collaboration, to be primary investigators on 12.5 percent of grants. They led more than 18 percent of clinical trials in the United States and were responsible for about 18 percent of publications in the medical literature.

“Our findings suggest that, by some metrics, these doctors account for almost one fifth of academic scholarship in the United States,” said the lead author of the study, Dhruv Khullar, who is a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, a researcher at Weill Cornell and a contributor to The Upshot. “The diversity of American medicine — and the conversations, ideas and breakthroughs this diversity sparks — may be one reason for our competitiveness as a global leader in biomedical research and innovation.”

The United States is not the only country that relies on doctors trained or educated in other countries. We’re not even the country with the highest percentage of such physicians. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, almost 58 percent of physicians practicing in Israel are foreign medical graduates. About 40 percent of the doctors in New Zealand and Ireland were trained outside those countries.

Because of the sizes of those nations, even though the percentages of foreign medical graduates are higher there, the total numbers aren’t as high as in the United States. In 2015, the O.E.C.D. estimated that the United States had more than 213,000 foreign-trained doctors, and no other country was close. Britain had about 48,000, Germany had about 35,000, and Australia, France and Canada had between 22,000 and 27,000.

For years, I’ve listened to doctors tell me stories of physicians who leave Canada — because they were dissatisfied about working in a single-payer health care system. That might have been true decades ago. But in the last 10 years, that number has dropped precipitously. The number of Canadians returning to their country to practice may actually be higher than the number leaving.

Although many feared that coverage expansions from the Affordable Care Act might lead to an overwhelmed physician work force, that didn’t happen. That doesn’t mean that America doesn’t have a shortage of physician services, especially when it comes to the care of the oldest, the poorest and the most geographically isolated among us. Even though we know foreign medical graduates care for those patients disproportionately, we make it very difficult for many born and trained elsewhere to practice here. Some Americans need these doctors desperately.

“He took my head and put it on Joe’s neck,” said Mr. Rochford, who is 20 years Mr. Schmitt’s junior.","Joseph William Schmitt was born on Jan. 2, 1916, in O’Fallon, Ill. His father, Benjamin, was a city marshal who was killed in the line of duty only a few weeks after Joseph’s birth. His mother, the former Apollonia Berkel, raised him and his siblings with the help of extended family.

In the 1930s, his high school principal, knowing Joe was mechanically inclined, suggested he join the Army Air Corps. He first studied aircraft engines but, with World War II still in the future, found himself looking for more to do.

“It was kind of a slow period,” Mr. Schmitt said in an oral history. “I asked if I could go back to take a parachute riggers course and also an aircraft clothing repair course.”

That proved pivotal when, after leaving the service in 1939, he found his way into the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, a forerunner of NASA. He started as an airplane mechanic, working on the 1947 flight in which Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, but was later put into its Space Task Group as the agency began thinking about manned spaceflights and what astronauts would need to wear.

As an equipment specialist, or a suit tech, Mr. Schmitt would accompany astronauts to the spacecraft and hook up the various connections that would keep them alive, monitor their health and enable them to communicate during flight. It was a job that above all required a high level of attentiveness.

“Joe was a perfectionist in many respects,” James W. McBarron II, his supervisor, recalled in a telephone interview.

Mr. Schmitt suited up John Glenn for the 1962 flight in which he became the first American to orbit the earth. The many missions he worked also included Apollo 11, the first lunar landing, and other Apollo missions, where a less-heralded part of the job — care of the suit after a flight — took on new significance.

“We vacuumed out all the moon dust,” Mr. Schmitt said in the oral history. “A lot of people at that time, contractors mostly, they would take some of that dust and try and give it to their friends.” Officials eventually clamped down on that practice, he said.

Mr. Schmitt married Elizabeth Ann Rayfield in 1939; she died in 2008. He is survived by a son, Joseph Michael; a daughter, Norma Jean Spencer; six grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.

Mr. Schmitt accumulated an enviable collection of mementos, including a medal with Mr. Schmitt’s initials on it that Glenn gave him after taking it with him into space.

He also made a game-show appearance: He was a mystery challenger on “What’s My Line?” in May 1963, just days after he had suited up Gordon Cooper for the final Mercury mission. (The celebrity panel surmised that he was part of the space program but failed to guess his role.)

He also became an artistic footnote during his NASA career: That’s him kneeling on the left in “Grissom and Young,” a 1965 painting Norman Rockwell made of the Gemini astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young as they’re being suited up. But Mr. Rochford said Mr. Schmitt is actually in the painting one and a half times.

Rockwell took photographs of the astronauts to work from, pictures that Mr. Schmitt posed for in his role as suit tech. Later, Rockwell asked NASA to send him a spacesuit so he could get the details just right. Mr. Schmitt brought a suit to Rockwell’s studio in Massachusetts and, Mr. Rochford said, told the artist that there were actually two suit techs for the Gemini 3 flight: He had dressed Mr. Young, while Mr. Rochford had dressed Mr. Grissom. So Rockwell obtained a photo of Mr. Rochford’s face and put a second suit tech into the painting, on the right.

A great many hunters and gun owners are like me. We are not “gun nuts,” stockpiling weapons in the name of some future apocalypse. We exercise our Second Amendment rights in a way that is palatable to most people who otherwise oppose guns — we’re the bridge that connects the two sides of the chasm in the national debate. Even the N.R.A. recognizes this, which is why it tries to enhance its legitimacy by identifying as a sportsmen’s group, though few of its stances reflect the will of sportsmen. Hunters are accustomed to following nuanced gun laws (gun calibers and ammunition types are limited depending on the season and species we’re hunting, for example), so we understand that common-sense regulation doesn’t mean an end to bearing arms. And because we see the brute power of a gun every time we kill an animal, we are regularly reminded of why guns need to be regulated.

We also have an interest in drafting sensible gun laws now, rather than waiting for an avalanche of pent-up frustration to generate a policy response so long overdue that it overreaches. If we don’t want onerous regulations to infringe on a tradition we love, then we can’t afford to stay quiet as body counts rise and politicians offer no more than thoughts and prayers.

The N.R.A. doesn’t represent gun owners like me, but the problem is that no one else really does, either. Americans who don’t own guns are represented by an array of nonprofits that share their wish to crack down on gun violence with gun laws that are as restrictive as possible. Gun owners are hesitant to get behind these groups because we first want to understand their nuanced views on gun laws. Details matter to us.

Last year I joined the board of a small nonprofit in Oregon called Gun Owners for Responsible Ownership. This group was founded by gun owners and relatives of victims of a 2012 mass shooting at a mall near Portland. The killer stole his rifle from a friend, who left the weapon unsecured and containing a full magazine of ammunition.

Our group is trying to do important, mostly apolitical work — handing out free gun locks, training doctors to talk to patients about safe firearm storage, offering basic information about guns to the news media so they can report about the issue more accurately. But we are frequently met with suspicion or disdain by gun owners who think we’re secretly out to disarm them.

We do very little lobbying, though our board endorsed a proposal signed into law in Oregon this year to issue protection orders to keep guns temporarily out of the hands of people who, in a situation like sudden extreme distress, pose a clear threat to themselves or others. Suicides account for 60 percent of the nation’s more than 33,000 firearm deaths a year. Many suicides are impulsive acts, so even minor barriers — akin to putting guardrails on bridges, for example — can save lives.

By the time my boys are hunters, I hope there are more sensible gun laws, such as those that close loopholes on background check requirements, restore funding for research on gun violence and regulate modified semiautomatic guns just as strongly as we do the automatic guns they are altered to mimic. I also hope my sons take a broad view of what it means to be a responsible gun owner. Responsible ownership is about more than safe storage and careful handling of one’s own firearms — it’s also about making sure that as a society we have effective laws to keep guns out of unsafe hands.

“I would say you’re a Questioner,” Ms. Rubin told me, because among other things I balked at her quiz questions.
“Questioners don’t like to be questioned,” Ms. Rubin, a proud Upholder, said.
Whatever happened to just being Type A?","Meanwhile, Ms. Rubin gestated her eighth book.

“The Four Tendencies: The Indispensable Personality Profiles That Reveal How to Make Your Life Better (and Other People’s Lives Better, Too),” out last month, is already a best seller. By mid-September, over one million people had taken Ms. Rubin’s online quiz, making her the queen of personality typing.

A colleague of mine took it and learned she is an Obliger, “which is totally messing up my career,” she said. She thinks I’m a Rebel because I’m squirrelly about deadlines, but the quiz deemed me an Upholder when I first took the test, and then a Questioner the second time around; a couple of days ago, I took the test again and came up an Obliger.

Now Obligers, Ms. Rubin writes, are the most challenging of the Tendencies, other than Rebels. This is because Obligers, pushed to their limits, will go rogue: quit their jobs, walk out on their marriages, abruptly end friendships. Obliger rebellion, she calls it. (Lateness, she writes, is a small but popular form of Obliger rebellion.)

“I would say you’re a Questioner,” Ms. Rubin told me, because among other things I balked at her quiz questions. She had phoned from Los Angeles, where she was on the first leg of her book tour, and was amusing herself by noting how her audiences were dividing themselves by Tendency. “We did a meet-up through the app,” she said, “and only one Rebel showed up in crowd of almost 100 people.” This was not because Rebels won’t R.S.V.P., she concluded, but because “they don’t like to be told they have to arrive between 5 and 7.”

But back to me.

Ms. Rubin said: “Maybe you aren’t meeting your deadlines because you aren’t convinced they are really true.” According to Ms. Rubin’s research, Questioners have other charming weaknesses in addition to a certain mulishness about deadlines. These include “crackpot potential” and an inability “to accept closure on matters that others considered settled if their questions aren’t answered.”

Also, they don’t like to wait in line.

“Questioners don’t like to be questioned,” Ms. Rubin, a proud Upholder, said.

Whatever happened to just being Type A?

Ms. Rubin was a Yale-educated lawyer who once clerked for Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, before diving into the self-help business with her 2009 book, “The Happiness Project: Or, Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun.”

The energetic Ms. Rubin, a member of four book groups who has said that she loves to take notes, “often for no apparent reason,” larded her memoir with insights and observations, nuggets from Nietzsche to Diana Vreeland (and the Duke of Wellington, whose advice is to urinate whenever you get the chance, a happiness booster we can perhaps all agree on), along with enough social science “data” to fill three Malcolm Gladwell books.

The book and its offspring — journals, calendars and coloring books — have been consistent best sellers, having sold close to three million copies, according to Ms. Rubin’s longtime agent, Christy Fletcher.

“It came out in the wake of ‘Eat, Pray, Love,’” said Ms. Fletcher of “The Happiness Project,” “this idea that to find happiness you had to leave your husband and quit your job and eat, pray, love. What Gretchen realized is that most people don’t want to leave their husbands and their jobs, and what she provided was recipes for being happier in place. It created a lot of entry points for people. Everybody can make their bed. What we’ve learned is that this kind of advice couched in the language of one person’s very specific experience was more accessible to people than having the Dalai Lama or a Harvard professor tell you what the human path to happiness is.”

I would argue that Ms. Rubin’s exhaustive and exhausting methods — her rigorous list making and goal setting, her extreme research (speed-reading every parenting manual, say, since Dr. Spock, or the collected works of Plutarch, Montaigne and Adam Smith) — would make all but the most high-functioning humans feel like slackers. But maybe that’s the point: She strives, and you warm yourself in the afterglow of her efforts.

To fully grok Ms. Rubin’s newest oeuvre, I read “The Four Tendencies” and its prequel, “Better Than Before,” in which along with the typology she introduces a complex and confounding layer of additional sorting methods that I gamely, if lamely, tried to assume and address.

But if I was a Lark, a Procrastinator, an Underbuyer, a Simplicity Lover, a Finisher and a Familiarity Lover, as I apparently am according to my answers to the questions in Chapter 3 of “Better,” what did that actually mean and did I have to answer all the other questions Ms. Rubin strewed at the end of that same chapter, and throughout the rest of the book?

In “Better,” Ms. Rubin does attempt to soothe her information-addled readers with a section called “Desire, Ease and Excuses,” all of which, as she writes, “play a role in the Strategies of Abstaining, Convenience, Inconvenience, Safeguards, Loophole-Spotting, Distraction, Reward, Treats and Pairing,” but I had already grown contrary. Perhaps it was all the capital letters. Or was I exhibiting the hallmarks of my type?

Questioners, Ms. Rubin writes, follow “their own judgment — sometimes even when it flies in the face of experts who (allegedly) know more.”

Personality typing has long bubbled merrily atop the self-help soup. Self-improvement may be a distinctly American habit, from its founding, a national credo, but the father of psychological types was Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist, who laid them out in a book of the same name in 1921.

“It has a long and sordid history in psychology, especially pop psychology,” said Scott O. Lilienfeld, a professor of psychology at Emory College, in an email. “Most people seem to love sorting themselves into discrete, mutually exclusive categories (e.g., I’m an extrovert, you’re an introvert; I’m a perceiver, you’re a judger). Managers, bosses, and administrators seem to love them too. None of this is terribly surprising. Decades of psychological research show that the human mind craves simplicity and prefers categories to dimensions when it comes to conceptualizing ourselves and others.”

On online dating profiles, some note their Myers-Briggs type, that hoary system based on Jung’s types and beloved by white-collar companies since the 1970s, as if it were a professional affiliation or a college degree.

“As swipe-based dating apps proliferate, the pressure is on to differentiate yourself in sound bites,” said Emily Listfield, a co-founder of Jyst, a dating-advice app. “One trend we see is people putting their personality types in their profiles as a shortcut to describing themselves. The problem is that most people have no idea what the acronyms stand for. ‘Likes long walks on the beach, looking for a woman who can wear jeans or a little black dress, E.N.F.P.’ leaves most people scratching their heads.”

Ms. Listfield recalled an inscrutable profile from a military veteran who proclaimed his score from two personality systems, Myers-Briggs and something called Kolbe, a business-performance classification that rates you in a very unsexy series of numbers.

(One yearns for simpler times: “Sultry Scorpio seeks Tempestuous Leo.”)

“This kind of neat categorization is highly appealing when one’s internal emotions and struggles are so messy,” said Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, an associate professor of history at the New School who has been researching wellness and self-help culture since the 1950s. “Isn’t it comforting to put yourself in a box that others occupy as well? Doesn’t that assure us of our normalcy? And unlike, say, trying to understand your problems through a clinical source like the D.S.M.” — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Baedeker of pathologies and a bucketing good read — “all of the categories tend to have some generally objectively positive traits. That is, you won’t arrive at the diagnosis that you’re a narcissist or a sociopath in a popular self-help book, in part because no one would buy that book.”

Self-help enthusiasts do buy an awful lot of books. A third to one-half of all Americans will buy a self-help title in their lifetimes, said Christine Whelan, a professor of consumer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, adding that at any given time there are more than 45,000 titles in print.

Last year, the entire self-help industry — books and products — was worth nearly $10 billion, according to Market Data Enterprises. A self-help author herself, Dr. Whelan wrote her Ph.D. thesis on the history of the self-improvement movement in the United States (and met Ms. Rubin, coincidentally, in the stacks of the main branch of the New York Public Library, where both had holed up to do their research).

“Since 1975, self-help books — nonfiction books that offer advice for behavior modification and make explicit promises for positive change — have doubled as a percentage of all book titles,” Dr. Whelan said. “Self-help offers us hope that we can take control of our lives. The more alienated we feel from what’s going on in the larger world, the more likely we are to seek to regain some sense of control. And what can you control? Yourself.”

Ms. Rubin, though, bristles at the term “self-help.” “I always think of my books as being self-helpful,” she said. “How do we achieve our aims in life? How do we make ourselves happier and more productive? What’s the category for that? I don’t know.”

She divides self-help authors into Astronomers (scholarly) and Astrologers (intuitive), placing herself firmly in the Astronomer camp.

Personality typologies seem to multiply with each publishing season, growing ever more baffling. Everett Jones, the reviews editor at Publishers Weekly, recalled “Reconcilable Differences: Connecting in a Disconnected World,” out last June, whose authors rated people according to their communication styles, which they described as visual, auditory or kinesthetic. It was a confounding paradigm that created some unfortunate acronyms: VAK, VKA, KAV and so forth.

“Our reviewer found it too elaborate and indecipherable,” Mr. Jones said. “I think you need a story, something you can latch on to.”

Mr. Jones admired the archetypes in a coming book, “The Right and Wrong Stuff: How Brilliant Careers Are Made and Unmade,” out next January. These are five mind-sets that apparently are impediments to successful careers: Captain Fantastic, Solo Flyer, Version 1.0, One Trick Pony and Whirling Dervish. (To my mind, that’s a tad too much narrative, but I’m still recovering from the collected works of Ms. Rubin.)

Mary Ellen O’Neill, an editor at Workman Publishing, is wrapping up her edits on “Your Story Is Your Power: Free Your Feminine Voice,” out next March, a self-help title that uses methods including the Enneagram, another ’70s holdout, to figure out how you developed your worldview and how you can rid yourself of patriarchal and other cultural biases — second-wave feminism meets personality typing for the woke generation.

Remember Kingdomality? Neither do I. But in 2005, this mash-up of pop psychology and parable making presented in a business self-help book of the same name was poised to be a best-seller. Or so its publisher hoped, said Ms. O’Neill, the book’s editor, who was then at Hyperion. “The parable was that there was a king, and his kingdom was in disarray. If he could figure what everybody’s job should be, the kingdom would be in better order.”

There were eight questions, she said, that led you to one of 12 personality types. “It was fascinating because it was so accurate. It identified your personality to a T. Everyone at Hyperion took it. I was a Shepherd, which meant I was really good at keeping things organized and together. Here’s the funny thing. Each type had a logo that went with it. The Benevolent Ruler was a heart with a crown on top of it. And our head of sales, who was also deemed a Benevolent Ruler, happened to have a tattoo on her shoulder of a heart with a crown on it. That was how she saw herself. It was pretty great.”

Nonetheless, the book was published to the sound of crickets, Ms. O’Neill said.

“I have a feeling that Kingdomality was the end of the parable trend,” she said. “And it was a very goofy parable.”",Whatever Happened to Just Being Type A?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/style/personality-type-the-four-tendencies-gretchen-rubin.html

I was given a visa to North Korea, as were three other New York Times journalists. The U.S. State Department promptly gave us an exemption from the travel ban to North Korea and issued special passports good for a single trip here.

Far more than when I previously visited, North Korea is galvanizing its people to expect a nuclear war with the United States. High school students march in the streets in military uniform every day to denounce America. Posters and billboards along the public roads show missiles destroying the U.S. Capitol and shredding the American flag. In fact, images of missiles are everywhere — in a kindergarten playground, at a dolphin show, on state television. This military mobilization is accompanied by the ubiquitous assumption that North Korea could not only survive a nuclear conflict, but also win it.

“If we have to go to war, we won’t hesitate to totally destroy the United States,” explained Mun Hyok-myong, a 38-year-old teacher visiting an amusement park.

Ryang Song-chol, a 41-year-old factory worker, looked surprised when I asked if his country could survive a war with America. “We would certainly win,” he said.

These interviews were conducted in the presence of two Foreign Ministry officials, but even if they weren’t, there is no chance that ordinary people would speak freely to a foreign reporter. This is perhaps the most tightly controlled country in the world, so such quotes should be seen as reflecting a government script — in this case, a disturbingly jingoistic one.

On past trips (my last was in 2005), we journalists stayed at hotels in the capital and were free to walk around on our own, but this time the Foreign Ministry housed us at its own guarded Kobangsan Guest House east of the capital. At first I thought this was simply to restrict us, but increasingly I saw signs of something more interesting and menacing: The Foreign Ministry was also protecting us from hard-liners in the military or in the security services.

“Someone might hear you are from America,” and there could be trouble, one official explained.

Hard-liners seem to have gained greater power this year, especially after Trump’s threat to “totally destroy” North Korea, and we were told that military officers sometimes mock their own country’s diplomats for being wimpish “American cronies.”

Foreign Ministry officials escorted us every time we left the compound, probably both to keep us out of mischief and to protect us from the security agencies.

Yes, all this has been a little discomfiting.

The upshot is that I have felt more constraint than on past visits to North Korea, and considerably more tension. Before, I had been able to see senior generals, but this time the military flatly refused to consider my interview requests. The security forces also refused my request to meet the three Americans whom they still detain, one for two years now, without consular access.

A basic problem is that hard-liners seem ascendant in both Washington and Pyongyang.

In Washington, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is advocating a diplomatic resolution to conflict with North Korea — but Trump undercut him on Twitter last Sunday and said Tillerson was “wasting his time.” Trump’s policy toward North Korea is founded on false assumptions that the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, will give up his nuclear weapons, that China can save the day and that military options are real.

In Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, which is full of wide streets and monumental buildings, officials also express little interest in the kind of tough compromises that would be necessary to resolve the crisis.

“The situation on the Korean Peninsula is on the eve of the breakout of nuclear war,” Choe, the Foreign Ministry official, told me. “We can survive” such a war, he added, and he and other officials said that it was not the right time for talks with the U.S.

The North Koreans insist that the U.S. make the first move and drop its sanctions and “hostile attitude” — which won’t happen. And the U.S. is equally unrealistic in insisting that North Korea give up its entire nuclear program.

I told Choe that my visit gave me a sense of déjà vu, reminding me of a trip to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq on the eve of the American invasion. The difference is that a war here would be not just a regional disaster but a nuclear cataclysm.

Choe was unimpressed by my warning. He said that Iraq and Libya had made the mistake of giving up their nuclear programs; in each case, America then ousted the regime. He added that the lesson was obvious, so North Korea will never negotiate away its nuclear warheads.

Still, for all the shadow of possible war, North Korea has had some positive changes. The famine is over (although malnutrition still leaves one in four children stunted), the economy has developed and government officials are far more open and savvy than a generation ago.

Officials used to deny that there was ever any crime in North Korea — but now they freely concede that this country has thieves, that young women sometimes become pregnant before marriage, that inevitably there’s a measure of corruption. (They do deny that North Korea has any gay people.)

North Korea is no longer hermetically sealed, and South Korean pop music and soap operas are smuggled in on flash drives and DVDs from China (watching them is a serious criminal offense). There is also an intranet — a rigidly controlled domestic version of the internet — and students learn English from about the third grade. At the best schools, like Pyongyang No. 1 Secondary School, the students are extraordinarily bright and they conversed with us in fluent English, with far more sophistication than on my first visit to the same school in 1989.

Yet this is still North Korea. I asked these kids if they had ever heard of Beyoncé or the Beatles; none had. I asked if they had heard of Facebook. One had, because computer software sometimes referred to it, but he didn’t know what it was.

Radios or televisions that might get foreign broadcasts are illegal, and there is no access to the internet except for foreigners and senior officials. When I arrived at the airport, my luggage was closely searched for pernicious publications, and even my phone was examined.

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

In Mexico City, at least 38 buildings collapsed in the quake. The city’s mayor has said about 500 have been deemed “high risk” and would have to be demolished or have major reconstruction before people could return. Most of those buildings are residential.

Public and private efforts to help displaced people with housing and reconstruction needs have begun to take shape. On Tuesday, the authorities in Mexico City announced a plan to provide low-interest loans and other financial assistance to homeowners, depending on their needs and the conditions of their homes. The city has also promised financial assistance for renters.

President Enrique Peña Nieto has promised that the government would “directly support families with resources and materials” to repair damage and build new homes, and he announced Wednesday that his administration would help the country’s most powerful business leaders obtain private-sector assistance for reconstruction through a newly created fund.

A project called Arriba Mexico has started a website that invites people to “book a symbolic stay in a ruined home and help rebuild Mexico,” with the proceeds going toward relief efforts for victims, including temporary housing. The offers are truly symbolic; donors will not set foot on the properties.

“Stay in a gorgeous ruined apartment (parking included) in Atlixco, Puebla,” says one listing, beneath the photo of a building reduced to rubble. The price is $44 a night.

The future for many of the displaced, at least in the near term, is highly uncertain, leaving them in a frustrating, exhausting transitional state that could test friendships and strain relationships.

Last week’s quake drove Ana Paula Velasquez from her apartment in the Roma Sur neighborhood, where she and her husband, daughter and mother lived. Their building was found to be unsafe, and its residents scattered to hotels and to the homes of relatives and friends.

Ms. Velasquez, 39, and her family spent the first night after the earthquake with a friend of her mother’s, and the second at a relative’s home.

She and her husband then decided to send their daughter to live with family friends while they, along with Ms. Velasquez’s mother, moved into a shelter that had opened in a grade school in their neighborhood.

It was the primary school that her daughter, now 13, once attended.

“Ironic, isn’t it?” Ms. Velasquez said, sitting on a bench designed for small children. Classrooms had been converted to dormitories, with mattresses on the floor.

Ms. Velasquez, a former receptionist for a parking lot company, had decided to move to the shelter in part because she did not want to impose on friends and family. In addition, she said, the shelter has functioned as an outlet for information about legal assistance and other aid for earthquake victims. Staying there allows her to remain on top of her case.

“If you let this get cold, there’s even less chance the government will do something,” she said.

The shelter is scheduled to close on Friday, and the family will be forced to move to another one, though she is not sure where.

In the Portales Sur neighborhood, evacuated residents of a three-tower complex on Tokio Street have set up an encampment of tents in front of the building and organized a round-the-clock patrol to keep an eye on it.

Two towers are leaning precipitously, and the entire complex has sunk by one story. Demolition is certain.

The residents’ constant presence ensures that they do not miss a visit from a utility company representative, or a lawyer, or officials who might be able to clarify what happens next, including whether they will be able to recover their belongings.

Mario Jiménez, 54, a restaurant worker who lived on the fourth floor, says he has been able to look into his apartment from an upper-floor window next door.

“And I just think: It is right there. If I could just reach in,” he said. “Get stuff like the invoice that proves I own my car, to that one jacket I like, to a pot from the kitchen. It’s the story of a life, if you will, and it is stuck there. And who knows if we will have access to it again.”

Longer-term questions for many also remain unanswered, like whether new apartment buildings will rise to replace those that are demolished, allowing developers and unit owners to recover their investments. Many homeowners in Mexico do not have property insurance.

Nobody believes that the process will be quick, particularly if the aftermath of the devastating 1985 earthquake is any indication. That quake flattened hundreds of buildings in Mexico City and caused structural damage to thousands of others in the capital, many of which were later demolished.

Rebuilding in some areas of Mexico City took more than a decade. Some buildings slated for demolition became ensnarled in litigation for years.

“The one thing we know for sure right now is that our recovery is in for the long haul,” said Oscar Ramírez, 52, an engineer who owns an apartment in a Mexico City building that, though only a year old, collapsed in last week’s quake.

“The good thing is that most of us are alive,” he said. “And we just hope that we are not forgotten.” The top elected official from the district vowed on Tuesday to punish the building’s developer for “endangering people and using low-quality materials.”

Neighbors of the building where Ms. Flores, the property manager, lived in the Letrán Valle district have also set up a round-the-clock watch, taking turns on four-hour shifts. They are waiting for a final ruling by the authorities on whether the building can be saved or must be demolished.

Despite the safety concerns, however, several residents have quietly resumed living in their apartments.

Constructor Notes

I’m 20 years old, a junior at Brandeis University, majoring in Chemistry and American Studies. I started writing crosswords my freshman year of college. My school newspaper, the Justice, was using some very underwhelming syndicated crosswords, and I said to myself, “I could write better crosswords than that!” I couldn’t. At least, not at first. I still shudder to think of some of my very early crosswords. But, as I got more and more practice, I started to get decent at it. I continue to write a crossword for them each week. But when I write what I think is a really good puzzle, I send it off to The Times instead. This time, it seems Will agreed with me, and I got in. Not without a number of revisions beforehand, though. It’s a real honor to be in The New York Times for the first time, and I hope it won’t be the last! As for this puzzle’s construction, I don’t have all that much to say about it. The idea had been rattling around in my brain for a while before I got around to making it. I ended up brainstorming by thinking of all the spatial words I could muster, seeing which ones had phrases associated with them, and then seeing what I could come up with for words that fit those phrases. BENEATH ME was by far the answer I was most pleased with. I really learned a lot from the revision process, but I know I’ve got a lot left to learn about making crosswords.

Welcome to the party, Mr. Mahnken. I hope we get to see more from you soon, and 100 percent on your debut.

Cancer, by contrast, was an exterminator’s problem — a poisoner’s dilemma. Cancer-causing agents unleashed abnormal cellular proliferation by mutating genes involved in regulating growth. These cancer cells, occupying tissues and spreading, demanded a cellular poison — chemotherapy — that would spare normal cells and kill the malignant ones.

Cardiologists and oncologists — plumbers and poisoners — lived in different medical realms. We spoke different languages, attended different conferences, read different specialty journals. If our paths intersected, we considered the crossing coincidental, the unavoidable convergence of two common age-related illnesses on the same body.

I was a medical resident in Boston in the early 2000s when I heard a theory that would, in time, force these separate worlds to collide. Two cardiologists, Peter Libby and Paul Ridker, were thinking about plaque formation in a different way. Libby and Ridker acknowledged the role of cholesterol and lipids. But just as important was another variable, seldom discussed: inflammation — the recruitment and activation of certain immune cells. These activated immune cells infiltrated blood vessels early in the course of coronary disease and enabled plaques to grow and rupture. “Bad” cholesterol was a necessary part of the equation — it was these lipid deposits that may incite the immune cells, they proposed — but it was not sufficient.

If inflammation triggers coronary disease, might targeting it directly — beyond simply reducing cholesterol — decrease the risk of heart attacks? Over the course of a decade, Libby and Ridker found themselves focusing on a molecule involved in inflammation called interleukin-1 beta. By the mid-2000s, they heard of a new drug — an interleukin-1-beta inhibitor — that was used to treat exceedingly rare inflammatory diseases. In April 2011, Ridker’s team started enrolling 10,000 patients who carried signs of inflammation and were at very high risk for coronary disease in a randomized study to determine the effects of the inhibitor on heart disease and strokes.

The results, published this August, are provocative: Despite no change in cholesterol levels, there was a demonstrable reduction in heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular death, particularly at higher doses of the drug. But what caught my attention was a separate analysis that asked a seemingly unrelated question: Might the drug also reduce the risk of cancer? In a paper published in The Lancet, Ridker and his colleagues found that drug-treated patients had a drop in all cancer mortality. More striking still was a stark decrease in the incidence of and deaths from lung cancer. Some element of inflammation that drives plaque formation in coronary disease is also driving cancer progression. It’s a study that needs careful replication; the analysis was designed to suggest a hypothesis, not to prove it. There are questions about drug pricing and the risks of infections and low blood counts. But if the benefit holds up in future trials, interleukin-1-beta inhibition could eventually rank among the most effective prevention strategies in the recent history of cancer.

Inflammation at the nexus between cancer and heart disease? But of course, some of you must be thinking, with an exasperated nod. You’ve had your third serving of blueberries; you’ve drunk your green tea. Wasn’t it obvious all the while?

It isn’t so simple. An avalanche of studies has implicated inflammation as a central player in many diseases — but there are inconsistencies. Consider an inflammatory illness like lupus: The risk of most cancers (except some virally related cancers and lymphomas) in lupus patients is only marginally higher. Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of lymphomas — but oddly lowers the risk of breast cancer. Tuberculosis, an inflammation-inducing disease, appears to promote lung-cancer risk, but in an animal study, eczema, weirdly, reduces the risk of skin cancer. Meanwhile, an alternative-medicine industry daily peddles “anti-inflammatory” diets — but which of these reduce inflammation, or what types of inflammation are affected, remains far from known.

“Inflammation,” in short, is a concept in flux — “a wastebasket word,” as Padmanee Sharma, an immuno-oncologist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, told me. There isn’t one inflammation: Lupus, tuberculosis and influenza all cause “inflammation,” but each might provoke different or overlapping wings of immune responses. I asked James Allison, who pioneered cancer immunotherapy, to define “inflammation,” and he paused, considering the definition. “It’s a response to injury, mediated by immunological cells. But there are dozens of cell types communicating through even further dozens of signals.”

We might imagine inflammation, then, as a fuse box that you chance upon in a new house. You are looking for the switch that turns the light on in the living room, or one that turns the alarm off (just as we’re hoping to throw the switch that disables cancer growth or plaque formation). But the circuitry baffles you. Some knobs are marked in crimson: Do Not Touch. Some carry no labels. Some do, but the writing is in a foreign language.

“Inflammation, an umbrella term, is now being broken up into many different categories,” Sharma told me. Is it chronic or acute? Is there a “right” kind of inflammation that protects us from infections and a “wrong” kind that precipitates disease? Is it mediated “adaptive” immunity — the type of immunity involving B and T cells that adapts to infections? Or “innate” immunity, the more ancient phalanx of immune responses that is preprogrammed to fight certain pathogens?

When doctors read trials like Ridker’s, we generally ask two sets of questions. The first might be loosely described as: Is it good science and good medicine? Was the concept proposed in the study proved by the trial? Were the conclusions accurate, the adverse effects acceptable? Cardiologists and oncologists I spoke to agreed on the technical accuracy of the study. One of them noted the modest benefit for heart disease; Ridker and Libby counter that the drug is at least as effective as some cholesterol-reducing medicines.

But there’s a second kind of inquiry that’s harder to put a finger on, for it lives in a nearly aesthetic realm. Does the study illuminate something strange and wonderful about human physiology? A trial might be “good”— but is it, well, “beautiful”? This study is: It links disparate arenas of medicine through a common pathological mechanism. It’s hard to know whether the illnesses in the man I met were driven by inflammation, but Ridker and Libby forced me to view his case — and a thousand other cases I’d seen previously — under new clinical lights. I will never think about patients with cancer and coronary disease in the same way.

There’s another twist of wonder, though. What are the chances that one molecule, sitting at one corner of the immune response, acts as a switch for two utterly different diseases? It must be a quirk in our design, a barely visible chink in physiology that allows us to target inflammation in a manner that doesn’t kill or maim but acts just so, disabling two terrifying illnesses. It’s as if we had walked into the basement of the new house, found the fuse box, learned to read the coded language of the labels and — in the partial darkness — pulled just one switch. And, miracle of miracles: Upstairs, only the living-room lights went on.","What We Learn When Two Ruthless Killers, Heart Disease and Cancer, Reveal a Common Root",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/can-heart-disease-shed-light-on-cancer.html

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

Even the most ephemeral street art is not usually this fleeting: Minutes after the work is finished in the metallic glint of dawn, passers-by stop, stare — then carry bits of it away, until the whole thing collapses. The act of creation has been briefer than a spring shower; destruction comes even more swiftly. Soon, all that is left is a scattering of petals and twisted stems, curled on the ground like punctuation marks. Photos of the piece survive on social media, of course, as most things now do — a cascade of orchids and echinacea, nature sculpted into a gloriously unnatural state — but even the images are haunted by the specter of wilt; it’s built in.

Guerrilla flower “flashes” — such as those by the married Melbourne-based duo called Loose Leaf, whose giant wreaths appear suspended in air amid the city’s alleyways like portholes to another dimension, as well as those by the Manhattan florist Lewis Miller, who has, under cover of night, turned the city’s bedraggled mascots, the waist-high metal mesh garbage cans, into giant vases — are taking the most evanescent of the decorative arts into places it has rarely gone. Unlike graffiti, which is meant to leave its mark on mostly urban environments for as long as possible, these installations attempt not to defy but to chronicle nature’s mutability.

Fashion designers, including Alexander Wang, whose show last month was staged with impromptu aplomb from a tour bus that made stops in Manhattan and Brooklyn, have always sought to create a sense of spontaneity and surprise with their work, but clothing can never feel as deliciously impermanent as flowers. These short-lived botanical street installations seem both an embrace and a rebuke of earlier, earthier “happenings” wrought in quicksilver mediums. The 1960s Fluxus artists at least left behind a series of tiny attaché cases filled with objects (games, bottles with plastic droppers, custom-lettered cards, sets of rocks) to commemorate their events; at Carole Goodden and Gordon Matta-Clark’s Food, the 1970s SoHo restaurant-cum-art installation, diners were once given a necklace made of their entrees’ scrubbed bones to wear home. But blossoms leave behind no trace.

Photo

Perhaps that is why flora is increasingly an expansive medium for artists; no other material so explicitly blurs the line between fine art and decoration that was created in the early 20th century, and which left floral art on one side of the divide and sculpture on the other. The latter got to call itself high art, fine art; the former had to settle for the diminutive label of “decorative.” These days, though, such distinctions seem quaint and out of touch. One has only to see the work of the London-based Rebecca Louise Law, who created an upside-down meadow floating from the ceiling of a structure at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2015, and that of Tokyo’s Azuma Makoto, who has made botanical sculptures suspended in ice for the likes of Dries Van Noten, to recognize this truth.

But the provocative beauty of such sculptural, large-scale creations tends to be confined to galleries or exclusive events — which is, to Geoffroy Mottart, a shame. Over the last two years, the artist has adorned more than 20 historical statues around Brussels with elaborate beards and wigs made completely of flowers, giving new life to monuments that may have become invisible in the landscape. He has made it his mission to use flowers as a “connection between people and their history.” Charlie Lawler and Wona Bae of Loose Leaf consider guerrilla installations a celebratory way to recycle leftover blooms from private floral commissions; they incorporate foraged materials, including sticks and roadside vines, into the wreaths as well. Tina Libby, a freelance florist in Philadelphia who has been adorning stone statues and garbage cans since April, uses donated surplus from local flower shops. But these works aren’t meant to merely delight: Earlier this year, the Iran-born, Brooklyn-based brothers who call themselves Icy and Sot wove blossoms into barbed wire atop a cement wall in Miami as a commentary on current immigration struggles.

Photo

For Miller, who is inspired by the superabundance of Rousseau’s paintings as well as by the linear juxtapositions of cubism, the flower flashes are simply “guttural.” The works — which he constructs with a three-person team in fewer than 15 minutes at first daylight in various downtown N.Y.C. locations, including the foot of the Washington Square Arch and near a traffic light on West 14th Street — force him to abandon the perfectionism endemic to his craft. It wasn’t an easy leap — when he began making his pop-up pieces in October 2016, his first impulse was to create a perfect arrangement in the studio and plop it into the cans. Then he realized that he had to get away from all that fussing, to transcend his workaday occupation of “making rich people’s lives more beautiful.” The point was to throw together an arrangement on the spot, on a street corner; to force a collage of compromises. Getting too fancy or self-conscious would annihilate the joy.

That those who wander by the renegade installations feel comfortable taking handfuls of blooms, thus destroying the effect, delights Miller. The works are, in some way, a twist on Felix Gonzalez-Torres’s melancholic, often restaged “Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)” from 1991, in which gallery-goers are encouraged to take a piece of wrapped candy from a giant pile, enacting the wasting away of the artist’s partner from complications due to AIDS.

In this modern retelling — in yet another era when spontaneous beauty can remedy despair, if only briefly — a garbage pail becomes a geyser of roses, an explosion of dahlias, a shooting plume of lilies and irises. And in the blink of an eye, the cans once again hold only trash.

But here’s the challenge that rule-following Australia now finds itself confronting: What’s to be done with those who have a different experience, say in countries where rules are more negotiable, or those who simply want a less rigid society and more, well, encouragement of difference?

Our ethical conundrum was relatively minor (kangaroos have survived far worse than white bread), but there are bigger issues afoot that are testing Australia’s sense of when to hold the line and when to live and let live.

With same-sex marriage, for example, Australians are deciding whether the old rules of relationships should still be enforced, or loosened. The debate isn’t just about competing arguments of freedom or fairness, or about what the word marriage should really mean; it’s also about whether or not to change how Australians interact with each other.

That question affects immigration too. The elevation of rules restricting access drives the refugee policy that led to the detention centers on Manus and Nauru. It’s also what lets the country’s leaders pat each other on the back for Australia’s “multicultural society” even as they work to add additional rules that make it harder to obtain citizenship, and insist that immigrants exhibit “Australian values,” which mean just about anything that the establishment deems important.

Indeed, I’m often struck by the gap between white Australians who insist everyone is welcomed in Australia — no hyphenated identities here! — and the experience of immigrants or the children of immigrants who tell me the many ways they are treated as “other” and made to feel that their differences are unwelcome.

This is hardly unique to Australia; immigrants and expanding ideas of sexuality and gender are challenging societal norms all over the world. And yet what’s so interesting about the current moment in Australia are the ways that these forces — those defending the status quo, and challenging it — are colliding.

The postal plebiscite for gay marriage has already been answered by nearly 60 percent of eligible Australians, far surpassing expectations. The debate over Australia’s refugee policies regularly brings out both supporters and critics, while outside the gaze of the Australian establishment, immigrant communities in places like Fairfield, one of Sydney’s most diverse western suburbs, are creating their own versions of “Australian values” every day.

Where, I often wonder, will Australia be in five or 10 years on its adherence to rules, and on these issues of sexuality and gender, and race and immigration?

With trust in government and media sharply declining in the country, will Australia become a messier or a more rigid democracy, with more bending of the rules or more conflict? Or will new compromises emerge?

At our cottages, my daughter found her own middle ground. When offered a slice of bread to feed the kangaroos, she declined, but without comment. She did not defend the rules to those who may not have seen the signs (they had walked in from another area), nor did she violate the rules herself.

Maybe, just maybe, there’s something to be learned in that?

Nor are the double standards confined by America’s borders. In Britain, an anti-abortion member of Parliament named Jacob Rees-Mogg did not urge a mistress to end a pregnancy. Yay for him. Mr. Rees-Mogg, however, who opposes abortion even in cases of rape, runs an investment firm that has money in an Indonesian pharmaceutical company that sells abortifacients “widely used in illegal abortions in Indonesia,” according to the British newspaper The Independent.

It’s a child, not a choice, abortion opponents tell us.

Life begins at conception, as Mr. Rees-Mogg said in a debate, unless that life begins inside of a poor brown-skinned woman half a world away, and there’s money to be made from helping her to end it.

It’s almost as if these men don’t really believe that every time sperm and egg combine, the result is a child worthy of being cherished and protected. It’s almost as if these men are fighting to make abortion a crime because they’re more invested in curtailing women’s options and controlling their bodies than they are with saving innocent lives.

The double standards employed by some members of the “do as I say, not as I do” Christian right are nothing new. Show me a senator who votes against gay marriage, and, at least in one infamous case, I’ll show you a guy who’s soliciting same-sex encounters in the airport men’s room. (Hello there, Larry Craig!)

Show me another Republican senator who made his name as a “pro-family advocate” and I’ll show you a guy whose phone number showed up in a Washington madam’s little black book. (Howdy, David Vitter!)

Show me the far-right speaker of the House, a man with perfect scores from the National Right to Life Committee and the Christian Coalition, and I’ll show you a guy who, as a high-school wrestling coach, set up a chair in front of the boys’ shower the better to ogle his protégés, and who was eventually jailed as a serial child molester.

We’ve been down this road of duplicity before. The televangelist who prayed, alongside his wife, for the return of traditional morals, admitted to having sex with — and was accused of rape by — a 21-year-old church secretary, and found to have paid her $279,000. The congressman who voted for the Defense of Marriage Act was sexting with his underage male pages.

Scandals roll by so frequently that there is, by now, an expected script: the shocking revelation, the tearful confession, the up-from-the-ashes reinstatement plea or re-election campaign, garlanded with declarations of “God/my wife/Willie Robertson, star of ‘Duck Dynasty’ has forgiven me, why can’t you?” Perhaps the most shocking part of Mr. Murphy’s story is that he elected to quit, rather than scream “Fake news!” or sit back and wait for a new story to eclipse his hypocrisy, as Mr. DesJarlais did.

But what Mr. Murphy’s moral flexibility ultimately reveals is that, for these particular hard-line anti-abortion politicians, it’s not about fetal pain or the sanctity of life. It’s all about control — whether you’re telling a woman she can’t have an abortion, or forcing a woman to get one.

When Mr. Rees-Mogg was asked how he could oppose abortion as a lawmaker but support it as an investor, he told The Sunday Mirror, “It would be wrong to pretend that I like it, but the world is not always what you want it to be.”

This is a locked-in piece of music and script that I’m going to be performing pretty much the same on a nightly basis. It’s a solidified piece of work. And I think the intimacy of the venue is going to really affect it, to make it quite a bit different from the acoustic tours. Though I don’t know if I’d be doing this without the experience of doing them. When I recorded “Nebraska” back in the ’80s, I didn’t tour on it because I wasn’t sure if I could.

Are you using video?

Basically it’s a one-man show. There’s no production beyond the stage, some lights and some very high-quality sound. I thought anything beyond the song and the story ended up feeling too rigid and distracting. It happens every time we go to do a tour, you know?

You did a VH1 Storytellers with some extensive spoken interludes [in 2005].

That would be the closest thing to what I’m doing now. When I did the VH1 thing, Elvis Costello came up to me later and said, “Gee, it created some third entity.” And that’s what I’m interested in doing with the show. I’m playing familiar music, but I believe it will lead you to hear it with very fresh ears by the context that I set it in. I always make a comment that when things are working in art, one plus one equals three.

I think an audience always wants two things. They want to feel at home and they want to be surprised. And I go out every time to do those two things. I try to make people feel that they’ve come to some place that they’ve known for a long time, and then also try to surprise them with some new insights or new forms or new energy or just a new way of doing something. You’ve got to have that X factor. If you don’t have that, you’re dead in the water.

Do you go to Broadway shows?

We go on occasion. I saw “Hamilton.” I guess that was the last thing I’ve seen. It was great.

But you didn’t try to write a Broadway musical.

That’s tough! I salute the guys that have given that a shot. It’s not the same rules as pop music writing. It’s a completely different format, and I think it takes a set of completely different skills. It’s not like, oh, I’ll write 12 songs and kind of stick them together somehow. The guys I know who tried it really gave a good shot at it. My friend Sting, I thought, did a great job [with “The Last Ship”]. But it’s a different thing conceiving it from the beginning to the end. I admire all the Broadway writers, Sondheim, who have been able to do that so magnificently, but it’s not something I could ever do. It just seems too hard.

And then I’ve never really been good at, say, writing to script. In other words, “Now I need a song about [a certain subject].” I’ve never written like that. I’ve always written about what’s pressing itself upon me to write at a given moment. I’ve never sat back and said, well, I need a song about Trump, or I need a song about this happening or that happening. When I’ve crossed over with topical songwriting, even that was something that began as, you’re angry about something or you want to say something. That’s the feeling that comes up first.

With your book and with “Springsteen on Broadway,” you’re surveying your whole past. Are you also writing songs?

I’ve finished a record. I had some inspiration. When you’re locked into a period of creativity it’s very similar to being hungry all the time. You have an appetite to write. It’s one of the nicest feelings in the world for a songwriter because you know what it is to be without that appetite. Once you lock into that, then you’re feeding yourself. Everywhere you go you’re hungry. So I might come up with a verse sitting at the kitchen table, I might be asleep and wake up in the middle of the night and run upstairs to my writing room and come up with another verse or two. Literally I do it anywhere and everywhere and that’s a nice place to be. It doesn’t happen that often.

Writing the book must have made you think about your life story.

I really never had planned on writing anything. So when it came around, yeah, obviously, you draw a story from your story. I supposed you’re contextualizing your own life for yourself, and in the course of it you’re trying to have an honest hand.

It’s one of the things that I’m sort of glad it exists. Just for your kids — your kids really don’t know much about your life, you know? We had our kids late, I was 40 when our first son was born, and they showed a healthy disinterest in our work over all the years. They had their own musical heroes, they had their own music they were interested in. They’d be pretty blank-faced if someone mentioned a song title of mine, and I always looked upon that as that we did a good job. I know that none of my kids have read the book, though I imagine someday they will perhaps. I kind of like that. My job, it’s a strange job, it’s an eccentric line of work. And it’s not comparable to anything else and it can be difficult to be around it. As I say in the book, I know a lot of kids who wouldn’t mind seeing 50,000 people boo their parents. But I don’t know how many would want to see those people cheer their parents. It’s just not right (laughs).

The book explains that you’ve always been a musician. You never really had a 9-to-5 job. But “Springsteen on Broadway” is five nights a week for five months. It’s steady work.

That’s a real job. This is my first real job, I think (laughs). That’s the one thing I’m going into with a certain sense of faith. I go, well, I’m not using myself so totally physically on a nightly basis. And I’m not using my voice — you know, you’re not screaming. But the mental energy that it takes to do it is the same. People come to see you be completely, completely present. Any time you’re trying to do that, it takes a lot of energy.

You say the show and stories are locked in — won’t that become repetitive for you?

I’ve played “Born to Run,” many, many times. I’m sure if we went on the internet we could find out how many. (laughs) But the key is, you have to approach it not as a repetition but as a renewal. And to do that your spirit has got to be 100 percent present. But it’s a new audience every night. There’s new faces, there’s new opportunities. Those songs have been very good to me over the years, and in return I try to be good to them. So you have a chance of renewing the emotion and the spirit in that music on a nightly basis. That’s the place I work to get to every night when I’m onstage. I think that if the foundation of what you’ve built is built well, you’ll be able to inhabit it on a nightly basis and your audience will come in and it will feel like they’re seeing it for the first time.

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London.
Photo“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted.
“We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said.
“Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said.","With so many exhibits and monographs devoted to fashion photography and its leading practitioners, it’s hard to imagine that it wasn’t that long ago that the genre was seldom the focus of highbrow studies. Yet, that’s what Eugénie Shinkle discovered when she began researching it almost a decade ago.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London. “Apart from a handful of exceptions, there was a real reluctance amongst scholars to engage with it in a serious way,” she said. “Unapologetically commercial, it had been reduced to ‘only advertising.’ And, until recently — that is until it started appearing in galleries — it was considered to be ephemeral. Because it wasn’t meant to last and because it wasn’t created with any kind of critical or artistic intent, people didn’t believe its history should be approached in that way.”

After publishing “Fashion as Photograph: Viewing and Reviewing Images of Fashion” in 2008, which examined why the genre deserves intellectual scrutiny, she’s now releasing “Fashion Photography: The Story in 180 Pictures,” a compendium of important figures who help chart the genre’s evolution. From Camille Silvy, a diplomat turned studio photographer in the 1850s, to the contemporary creative couple of Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes, who specialize in abstract still lives, the volume published by Aperture chronicles various movements and turning points.

“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted. “Initially, it was reluctant to engage explicitly with politics, but since the end of the ’60s it has become more openly, overtly and unabashedly political.”

After World War II, photographers like Henry Clarke subtly alluded to the changing role of women in society by portraying them as “independent and in control,” writes Ms. Shinkle. Artists like William Klein parodied fashion conventions and encouraged his peers to engage in self-criticism. Even Richard Avedon proved to be a revelation: “I learned to appreciate his depth and talent by seeing how he was able to reinvent himself halfway through his career and noticing how ardently he campaigned for the use of models of color. Creatively, and politically, he’s one of the most important fashion photographers of the 20th century.”

By the ’90s, thanks in no small part to the nonconformist British magazine “The Face,” the grunge movement — which challenged gender norms, capitalism and the ideals of social respectability — appeared in mainstream publications and paved the way for today’s more cerebral work. Collier Schorr’s images, for example, question gender fluidity, notions of desire and how identity is constructed, while Chen Man speaks up creatively about China’s complexities.

Looking at the people in the volume, it also become more apparent how conservative the industry has been. Most photographers listed are Western-educated white men. This is due in part to the author’s and publisher’s decision to keep close reins on what was considered a primer. “We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said. “I had to make that decision early on. Did I want to include more vernacular practices like that of Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso, who has been doing amazing fashion-inspired work since the ’70s? Or, did I want to restrict it to so-called pure fashion photography?”

In doing so, she revealed how difficult it has been for traditionally marginalized groups to be taken seriously. Case in point: Women, in the early 20th century, were rarely behind the camera. Yva, Madame D’Ora and Toni Frissell were trailblazers working “at a time when that was not what a well-bred women did, because photography was seen as a technical job.” To showcase them and highlight their technical prowess and unique perspectives is to revise history, which too often ignored them. Similarly, the inclusion of the Harlem Renaissance photographer James Van Der Zee, well known in the African-American community, but virtually unknown at the time outside of it, “points out how exclusive and white-centric the industry was in those years.”

While there’s now a more diverse roster, there’s still a long way to go. “Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said. “It’s representative and it popularizes certain tendencies in ways that no other type of photography can because it’s so ubiquitous.”

Correction: Sept. 27 2017:

An earlier version of this article misstated the academic title held by Ms. Shinkle. She is a reader in photography, not a professor of Photographic Theory and Criticism.

Those who don’t plan ahead might find themselves battling long lines and dwindling supplies at Walmart, as they rush to stock up on water, batteries and portable generators. “The week before Irma hit, we had so many phone calls from people desperate to have product overnighted to them,” said Paul Fulton, the president of the Ready Store, an online emergency preparedness retailer that has seen inquiries jump 500 percent in the past few weeks. “At that point, it’s just too late.”

The growing prepper movement might capture the imagination of zealous survivalists awaiting the apocalypse, but in reality, most Americans are woefully unprepared for any disruption to their daily routines.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, the American Red Cross and the Department of Homeland Security all provide advice on preparedness. Yet a 2015 FEMA survey found that only 39 percent of respondents had an emergency plan that they had discussed with their families, even though 80 percent of Americans live in counties that have suffered weather-related disasters since 2007.

“We need a culture of preparedness that becomes a part of our everyday existence,” said Leslie Chapman-Henderson, the chief executive of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, a nonprofit organization in Florida. “There is not a place in the U.S. that is not without some form of hazard and risk.”

The best time to prepare is when the sky is clear and your weekend is free, not when local officials are telling you to board up windows and head for higher ground. But readying for the unknown can feel like a daunting and costly task — and one easily shelved. To make it more manageable, weave emergency planning into your everyday life, chipping away at the long to-do list. Here are some ways to get started.

CONSIDER WHAT AND WHERE YOU BUY

There is no way around it: Some homes are more disaster prone than others. Those near heavily wooded areas may face fire risk. Those near water could flood.

During this year’s ferocious hurricane season, people shopping for homes have been on high alert. Real estate brokers in Connecticut and Long Island say that prospective buyers have been asking pointed questions about waterfront properties, and interest in such homes has dipped since Hurricane Harvey ravaged Texas.

Photo

“It seems like homes on the water that were selling briskly during the summer have taken a slowdown,” said Joanne Schloen, the branch manager of the West Islip, N.Y., office of Coach Realtors, an affiliate of Christie’s International Real Estate. Prospective buyers “are afraid to buy something on the water,” Ms. Schloen said, adding that shoppers want to know if homes took on water in previous storms and are reluctant to consider those that have not been raised to meet FEMA flood elevation standards.

Some waterfront homes are a safer bet than others. Consider the five-bedroom home of Richard and Kim Alexander in Rowayton, a coastal village in Norwalk, Conn. After the 3,500-square-foot property sustained water damage in Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the Alexanders spent roughly $300,000 to raise the house and the grade of the lot, exceeding FEMA elevation standards. “As soon as I saw the damage from Sandy, I basically said to myself, ‘Third time is not a charm,’” said Mr. Alexander, 57, a consultant. “We’ve got to mitigate this flood exposure.”

The house is currently listed for $1.75 million. Amanda Davenport, the listing agent, said that elevating the property added $250,000 to the list price and helped attract nervous shoppers. “Nine out of 10 buyers will say, ‘I’m only looking at houses that are FEMA-compliant,’” said Ms. Davenport, a saleswoman for Halstead Property. “And that’s different from two weeks ago.”

A buyer made an offer on the house as Hurricane Irma was pummeling Florida, and the offer was accepted.

KNOW YOUR RISKS AND MAKE A PLAN

To protect yourself and your family from the unknown, you need to have some idea of what that unknown might be. If you live in New York, for example, you should prepare for blizzards, hurricanes and extreme heat, but you probably don’t need to spend too much time fretting about earthquakes.

Not all risks, however, are immediately obvious. The Federal Alliance for Safe Homes has a map that lists peril risk by state. Once you know your risks, download the Know Your Plan app from the Insurance Information Institute, which provides detailed checklists to help you prepare for various emergency scenarios.

At the very least, families should keep an emergency kit on hand. What you store in that kit will depend on where you live and the potential hazards you face. Generally, you’ll be dealing with one of two scenarios: the need to evacuate or to shelter in place. To make a speedy exit a smooth one, pack a backpack full of supplies for each family member. To stay put safely, you’ll need enough provisions to sustain your household for at least 72 hours.

Either way, you’ll need items like clothes, water, food, flashlights, batteries, a portable radio, cash, a first-aid kit and medicine. Keep a paper copy of important names, phone numbers and addresses, because thanks to cellphones and speed dial, few of us remember anyone’s phone number anymore. Items like baby wipes, work gloves and a multipurpose tool may also come in handy.

Discuss an emergency response plan with your family. Decide where to meet if you have to leave your home, or the neighborhood. Select a friend or relative to be the point person to call if you become separated.

And remember, emergency supplies need to be updated. Children outgrow clothes and medications expire. Warmer months call for different supplies than colder ones. Refresh your emergency kit as part of your spring and fall cleaning routine.

Diane Thomson, a professional organizer and life coach, suggests preparing in stages, to avoid getting overwhelmed. “We’re not going to get it done this week,” she said. “But let’s say over this year, let’s take one step at a time.”

PROTECT YOUR VALUABLES

Jenny Herrero, who lives with her husband, Jose Herrero, and their two children in Lake Worth, Fla., thought she was prepared for Hurricane Irma. The family had weathered Hurricanes Irene and Sandy when they were living in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., losing power in both storms. For Irma, the family stocked up on food, lantern-style flashlights, batteries and gasoline for the portable generator.

They lost power for only a day during Irma, a minor inconvenience compared to the 16 days they went without power after Hurricane Sandy, and did not suffer major damage. After so many storms, the Herreros plan to add a separate emergency electrical panel, an investment of about $1,500, so that they can operate critical appliances using a transfer switch, without running extension cords through the house.

In all the preparation, though, Mrs. Herrero, 38, realized she had overlooked the family photographs. “I was scrambling to upload my digital photo collection onto Dropbox,” said Mrs. Herrero, who, ironically, owns Storyteller Productions, a company that stores and preserves photographs. “I was horrified that if we had flooding, or needed to leave suddenly, that my collection of family memories would be lost forever.”

Photo

The Herreros got lucky this time, but they learned an important lesson: Some preparation can be done weeks, if not months or years, in advance. Protect important documents and sentimental items like photographs and letters by uploading digital copies of the items or backing them up. Store original documents in a safe deposit box. And send a flash drive with digital copies of documents and photographs to a trusted friend or family member in another part of the country for safekeeping.

TALLY WHAT YOU OWN

To file a claim for damaged or destroyed possessions, you have to know what you own and roughly how much those items cost.

“No one remembers what’s in their house, not even me,” said Bob D’Amore, the president of the New York Public Adjusters Association. Homeowners often hire public adjusters to help file insurance claims and figure out what was lost.

But long before anything is damaged, you should take stock of your stuff; many insurance companies provide online tools to help. Or photograph rooms, items, receipts and the contents of closets to roughly document your possessions. Apps like Sortly and Home Contents make it easier to create a database that you could use if you were ever displaced.

KEEP TABS ON YOUR INSURANCE POLICY

As your home and life changes, so should your homeowner insurance policy. Review your policy every year to make sure it still provides adequate coverage. If you recently remodeled a kitchen or bathroom, your policy should provide enough coverage to rebuild it back to its updated condition.

Renters should buy insurance, too, and review those policies annually to make sure that the coverage for possessions is sufficient. “Sometimes renters underestimate how much it costs to replace the stuff that they have,” said Angi Orbann, a vice president of personal insurance at Travelers.

Not all hazards are covered in standard homeowners insurance policies. Flood insurance, for example, usually requires a separate policy. Only homeowners living in high-risk flood areas are required to buy flood insurance backed by the National Flood Insurance Program. However, more than 20 percent of flood claims come from people living outside such zones, according to FloodSmart.gov. “I personally believe that everyone should look at getting flood insurance,” Ms. Orbann said.

Some damage can be avoided, or lessened, by ordinary maintenance. Do not neglect chores like cleaning gutters and checking the roof for wear or damage. If your property has trees, have an arborist inspect them for signs of trouble.

“Seventy-five percent of trees that come down in a windstorm had some level of disease,” said Frances D. O’Brien, the division president of North America Personal Risk Services at Chubb. So part of protecting your home, she said, “is about maintaining your landscaping.”

If you live in a cold area, insulate pipes that face external walls to keep them from freezing. Know how to shut the water and gas off in the event of an emergency.

When you renovate, think about adding safety to your improvements. For example, when it comes time to buy a new roof, consider getting one that is resistant to fire, hail or hurricanes, depending on where you live. “If you’re already re-roofing, we’re talking about a nominal increase to upgrade to resistant” materials, said Ms. Chapman-Henderson, of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes.

Spend time now preparing your home and family from unforeseen risks, and when and if disaster strikes, you will be able to respond faster. “There is kind of a civic duty here,” said Ms. Thomson, the professional organizer. “The more we’re prepared, the less stress there is on the system.”

In other words, if you have the things that you need, then emergency responders can focus attention on those who do not.",Preparing Your Home for a Disaster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/realestate/preparing-for-disaster.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

“It’s easy to call rock ’n’ roll vulgar, but to adolescents it is a release,” he told The New York Times in 1965.
“Rock ’n’ roll, if it is anything, is pure joy in sound.
Forced out by the network, Mr. Good resurfaced at its commercial rival, ITV, where he produced “Oh Boy!” with much greater freedom.
She said Mr. Good had resisted efforts by the network to limit the number of black performers on the pilot.","The premiere of “Shindig” ended a relatively short professional journey for Mr. Good that began in 1956 when he became transfixed by an audience’s response to the movie “Rock Around the Clock,” with Bill Haley and His Comets. In rock ’n’ roll’s energy and excitement, he recognized music’s future, especially as a fuel for adolescent rebellion.

“It’s easy to call rock ’n’ roll vulgar, but to adolescents it is a release,” he told The New York Times in 1965. “Rock ’n’ roll, if it is anything, is pure joy in sound.

“I willingly embrace vulgarity,” he continued. “I prefer vulgarity, that is, to the excessive refinement that has long stifled British society. Like St. Paul, I’m a convert, but my conversion was to rock ’n’ roll.”

A job as a trainee producer at the BBC led to his first experiment in transforming what he had seen onscreen into a live show. On “Six-Five Special,” which had its premiere in 1957 (it was named for its 6:05 p.m. start-time), he filled the studio floor with young fans bopping to the music. The formula worked: Millions watched. But he chafed at the BBC’s demands that he add sports and comedy segments.

Forced out by the network, Mr. Good resurfaced at its commercial rival, ITV, where he produced “Oh Boy!” with much greater freedom. Performers followed one another quickly, giving the show a breakneck pace. British rock stars like Cliff Richard, Marty Wilde and Billy Fury were said to have received their first national exposure there.

“The aim was hypnosis and excitement — blitzkrieg time!” Mr. Good said in “A Good Man … Is Hard to Find,” a 2005 documentary about his life made by Greg Wise. “Jumping up and down, the adrenaline, the wildness. Yes, the danger of it all!”

Nik Cohn, the British rock journalist, wrote that Mr. Good had an understanding of rock music’s importance that was rare at the time.

“Everyone else saw pop as a one-shot craze and rushed to cash in on it fast before sanity returned and everything returned to normal,” Mr. Cohn wrote in “Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom: The Golden Age of Rock” (1969). “By contrast, Good realized it clearly as a major phenomenon. I suppose he was the first pop intellectual.”

Mr. Good was born in West London on Aug. 7, 1931. His father, Bob, sold pianos at Harrods, where his mother, Amy, was a secretary. After serving in the Royal Air Force, Mr. Good graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied philology and was president of the drama society.

“Six-Five Special,” “Oh Boy!” and two other music shows in Britain did not end Mr. Good’s dreams of acting. He left for the United States, hoping to succeed in Hollywood. But he landed only a few parts, including one in “Father Goose” (1964), with Cary Grant, and another in “Clambake” (1967), with Elvis Presley.

One day in 1962, soon after moving to the United States, while lazing around in his pajamas, he had an epiphany.

“I saw this so-called special done by a bloke, Dick Clark, and I’d already come to the conclusion that Dick Clark’s shows were hopeless and I could do better,” he said in the documentary. Mr. Clark was, at the time, the host of the long-running “American Bandstand.”

“I said to myself, like the prodigal son in the pigpen, that I’d go back to my father’s house” — referring to Mr. Haley, whom he saw as his muse — “and I devised a show, filmed it, taped it and sent it around to the networks,” he said.

That was the pilot for “Shindig,” which was picked up by ABC, but not until 1964.

“Shindig” was unlike “Bandstand” or “The Ed Sullivan Show.” It had a fast rhythm, like “Oh Boy!,” with rapid cutting and extreme close-ups. The dancers frugged, swam and twisted furiously. The house band featured Glen Campbell, Billy Preston and Leon Russell. And the guests — among them Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, the Righteous Brothers, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Bobby Sherman, the Isley Brothers, Sam Cooke and the Everly Brothers — covered a broad musical range.

The Beatles, taped in Britain, were guests on the show several months after Mr. Good produced a special with them there. The Stones appeared several times, once with the bluesman Howlin’ Wolf, one of their idols.

NBC countered with its own pop music show, “Hullabaloo,” which made its debut a few months after “Shindig.”

Donna Loren, a featured singer on “Shindig,” described Mr. Good as “the Norman Lear of rock ’n’ roll” for his insistence on booking African-American artists, against the objections of at least one executive at ABC. She said Mr. Good had resisted efforts by the network to limit the number of black performers on the pilot.

Mr. Mallet, his former assistant producer, agreed. “He was insulted by it,” he said in a telephone interview, “because at least 50 percent of his favorite people were people like Little Richard.”

Mr. Good said in the documentary that he told ABC that he would limit the number of black artists on the show if the network sent him a memo outlining its rules. (He also threatened to send it if he got it to Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general.) He never got the memo.

He left “Shindig” after a year, exhausted by the demands of producing it but with something else in mind: a rock musical based on “Othello.” It became “Catch My Soul,” with William Marshall in the title role and Jerry Lee Lewis playing an unlikely Iago. When it played at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles, Martin Bernheimer of The Los Angeles Times wrote that it was “an utterly brilliant and utterly maddening experience.”

Mr. Good also wrote the screenplay for the 1974 movie version.

In the early 1970s, Mr. Good moved to New Mexico with his family and continued to produce television programming for a few more years. But he had already begun to alter his life dramatically — mostly in service to his Roman Catholic faith.

Inspired by Rubens’s “The Descent From the Cross,” he learned to paint. And, after his divorce from the former Margit Tischer, he built a chapel beside his home in Cordova, N.M., where he lived alone and painted religious murals and icons.

One mural shows a wild-eyed, fanged devil — his head in the shape of a television set — playing an electric guitar.

In addition to his daughter, Mr. Good, who lived in Oxfordshire, is survived by another daughter, Andrea; a son, Alexander; 10 grandchildren; and a brother, Robert.

Mr. Good expressed regrets about the direction rock took in the post-“Shindig” years. He wrote in The Los Angeles Times in 1967 that the music had been “ironed into one vast, hairy, paisley-patterned uniformity.”

But Mr. Mallet said that his cheeky former boss remained dedicated to the era he helped to influence.

“His idea of heaven,” he said, “was Jerry Lee or Cliff Richard or Elvis giving it 100 percent.”","Jack Good, Who Put Rock ’n’ Roll on TV With ‘Shindig,’ Dies at 86",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/obituaries/jack-good-who-put-rock-n-roll-on-tv-in-the-60s-dies-at-86.html

3. President Trump visited with victims in Las Vegas, and also traveled to hurricane-stricken Puerto Rico.

His pledge to wipe out the island’s vast debts to help it recover sent its bond prices plunging. He told local officials that they should be “proud” of the storm’s relatively small death toll, and tossed rolls of paper towels into a crowd.

Many of the island’s residents are still without electricity or proper food and water. A number have left for Florida, potentially reshaping the state’s politics.

The scandal echoes those surrounding Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly and Bill Cosby, as women face down fears of retribution to tell their stories.

Mr. Weinstein apologized and said he was committed to “do better.” But he rapidly lost at least two members of his extensive legal team, including Lisa Bloom, who had been advising him on gender and power dynamics. Without Mr. Weinstein, his company is in serious trouble.

It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units.
ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months.
According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.
“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint.","Two levels of charging are typically available in residential settings. Level 1 is a standard AC outlet that provides between 1 and 1.5 kilowatts of electricity. It takes a Level 1 charger about 30 hours to fully charge the electric version of the Ford Focus, which has a range of 115 miles. Level 2 uses a professionally installed charger connected to a 240-volt AC outlet — the kind used by some large appliances — and delivers between 7 and 9 kilowatts, lowering the charge time to about 5.5 hours.

Some commercial charging locations offer more advanced technology, employing so-called fast chargers. These offer about 50 kilowatts of DC power, enabling the same Ford Focus to reach 90 miles of range in 30 minutes (battery chemistry causes charging to go more slowly after a battery is 80 percent full). The electric carmaker Tesla has a proprietary “supercharger” for its vehicles that provides 120 kilowatts of power, adding 300 miles of range in 75 minutes.

A new generation of charging points, the first of which are being installed in Europe this year, offer 350 kilowatts of power. Such a jump would slash charging times to 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the vehicle’s range, according to Charlie Yankitis, director of business development for the German manufacturer Bosch’s electric vehicle unit. Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder, has hinted that charging at even faster rates was being studied.

Several companies are making big bets on the technology.

Electrify America, the Volkswagen subsidiary, is planning on installing such high-capacity chargers along highway corridors throughout the United States. It is investing $2 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and education nationwide, $800 million of which is earmarked for California alone.

By the end of 2020, Electrify America plans to have built 350 Level 2 charging sites in urban areas in California, like workplaces and apartment buildings. It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units. A further 540 are to be built elsewhere in the country in that time.

ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months. But its chief executive, Pasquale Romano, did not specify how many.

Similar pushes are being made elsewhere. In Europe, the German automotive giants BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen have joined with Ford in a joint venture to install 350-kilowatt chargers across the Continent. They will start installing them this year, initially planning to get 400 fast-charging sites up and running, with “thousands” in place by 2020.

“We’re looking for similar solutions across the globe,” said Mike Tinskey, Ford’s global director of electrification and infrastructure.

There are, however, hurdles that need to be overcome.

For one, standards differ across manufacturers and regions. Today’s commercial chargers use three different kinds of plugs that are not entirely compatible. In practice, a Chevrolet, Nissan or Volkswagen cannot be charged at a Tesla charger. A Tesla, however, can use an adapter plug to charge at standard commercial stations, and Electrify America says its charging stations will be compatible with a variety of plugs.

Another issue: No vehicle on the road today is able to use the 350-kilowatt fast-charging stations. It is not a simple upgrade: High-speed charging requires thicker cables that won’t get too hot.

No automakers have indicated when they will sell cars equipped to accept such fast charges. Porsche’s Mission E electric vehicle is expected to be available by 2020, and will be able to charge to a 250-mile range in 15 minutes, according to the carmaker. Electrify America and ChargePoint say they expect vehicles capable of accepting 350-killowatt chargers to be available by 2019.

Utilities will also have to upgrade their infrastructure, a change for which California is already preparing.

Under the state’s zero emission regulations, every manufacturer must sell a certain number of emission-free vehicles, calculated as a proportion of overall sales. Consequently, California has become the hub for the mass installation of fast charging points. One of the state’s utility companies, Southern California Edison, estimates that 25 percent of its network must be upgraded to support new chargers.

“We hope we’ll be ready for fast charging when Electrify America is ready to install it,” said Caroline Choi, the utility’s senior vice president of regulatory affairs.

For now, the number of charging stations remains relatively low. According to the Department of Energy, there are just over 16,000 public electric vehicle charging points in the United States, offering about 44,000 individual outlets of varying charging speeds. By comparison, there are 120,000 gas stations nationwide, many of which have 10 or more pumps.

So customers will have to stick to charging an electric vehicle whenever it’s not being used, much as they already do with smartphones and tablets.

According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.

“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint. They are like a horse that eats whenever you’re not riding it: “you refuel them when you’re doing something else.”","For Electric Car Owners, ‘Range Anxiety’ Gives Way to ‘Charging Time Trauma’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/automobiles/wheels/electric-cars-charging.html

Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area.","Privacy is also good, particularly for tasks that require intense concentration, the thinking goes. That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame, he was asked about being denied an N.B.A.
and was able to play basketball.","The former playground phenom could dunk the ball at age 11, when he was 6 feet 2 inches. He became one of the finest players in New York City high school basketball history, starring in Brooklyn and being named a first-team all-American. Growing into a 6-foot-8-inch frame, he possessed unusually large hands and a talent for bursting through defenses before slamming down a dunk.

But by the time he reached the grandest stage in basketball, the N.B.A., he was at an advanced age for a rookie and recovering from knee surgery.

By then, a basketball career that had held so much potential for greatness had been damaged by the suspicions — unsubstantiated — that he had been involved in a collegiate point-shaving scandal in the early 1960s.

Recovering from the setback proved to be an enormous emotional challenge.

“It was totally devastating,” Hawkins told NBA.com in 2009. “I was innocent, but no one would listen to me. Plus, coming from a poor family, no one even thought about trying to get a lawyer to fight it. We just weren’t that sophisticated.”

Other players in the league shared the view that he had been mistreated. When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992, Bob Lanier, the former Detroit Pistons center, who was part of that class, said Hawkins had “never got his just due,” adding, “because obviously the media wasn’t big then.”

Lanier marveled at Hawkins’s skills. Referring to Erving, he remarked how Hawkins “was doing these wild, swooping kind of moves before anyone knew about Dr. J.”

Hawkins had been recruited by numerous colleges before enrolling at the University of Iowa in 1961. But he never a played a game there.

College basketball at the time was engulfed in its second point-shaving scandal after players had received money from gamblers to affect the final score of games. Hawkins was questioned by the New York City authorities about possible connections with one of the fixers, but he was never accused of wrongdoing. Nonetheless, he was banned from collegiate play and the N.B.A.

Hawkins played one season in the American Basketball League and two seasons with the Globetrotters and was a star in his two seasons in the American Basketball Association, which later merged with the N.B.A.

Hawkins’s path to the N.B.A. was buoyed in part by a 1969 article in Life magazine by David Wolf. “Evidence recently uncovered,” Mr. Wolf wrote, “indicates that Connie Hawkins never knowingly associated with gamblers, that he never introduced a player to a fixer, and that the only damaging statements about his involvement were made by Hawkins himself — as a terrified, semiliterate teenager who thought he’d go to jail unless he said what the D.A.’s detectives pressed him to say.”

On Hawkins’s behalf, Roslyn Litman, a civil liberties activist, along with her husband and law partner, S. David Litman, and another lawyer, Howard Specter, sued the N.B.A. on antitrust grounds, arguing that the league had in effect illegally banned Hawkins and deprived him of the “opportunity to earn a livelihood.”

They won. The league paid Hawkins a settlement of nearly $1.3 million and dropped the ban. Hawkins joined the N.B.A. in 1969 and became an instant star with the Suns.

Mr. Wolf recounted the Hawkins case in 1972 in the book “Foul!: The Connie Hawkins Story.” Jonathan B. Segal, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said it showed “how an underprivileged black man was victimized by a fat-cat, unfeeling Establishment.”

Cornelius Hawkins was born on July 17, 1942, in Brooklyn. He was introduced to basketball as a youngster in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn by a New York City police officer, Gene Smith, who helped run recreational programs at a Y.M.C.A.

His career at Boys High School in Bedford-Stuyvesant was capped by his being named a first-team high school all-American by Parade magazine in 1960.

“My model was Elgin Baylor,” he told The Times in 1992, recalling the forward known for his superb body control when playing with the Minneapolis and Los Angeles Lakers. “My friends and I used to sneak into the old Madison Square Garden to see him play. Before Baylor, basketball was a more stand-up-and-shoot game.”

Hawkins averaged more than 24 points a game, sixth best in the N.B.A., in his first season with the Suns, and he was named to the all-N.B.A. first team.

He put up impressive numbers for several more years, but when his skills began to erode he was traded to the Lakers early in the 1973-74 season.

The Lakers dealt him to the Atlanta Hawks before the 1975-76 season, and after one season with them he retired, having averaged 16.5 points a game in his N.B.A. career.

Hawkins later worked in recreational programs for youth in Pittsburgh and was hired by the Suns as a community ambassador in 1992.

A list of survivors was not immediately available.

When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame, he was asked about being denied an N.B.A. career for so long. He displayed no rancor.

“My attitude was that had I not played in the A.B.A., I wouldn’t have a job,” The Boston Globe quoted him as saying. “Had I not played with the Globetrotters, I would not have learned the experience and traveled around the world. Those things helped me out and gave me a different style of play once I got into the N.B.A.”

Asked whether induction gave him a sense of vindication, he responded: “My vindication was that I got into the N.B.A. and was able to play basketball. This was icing on the cake.”","Connie Hawkins, Electrifying N.B.A. Forward Banned in His Prime, Dies at 75",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/obituaries/connie-hawkins-dead.html

While we do visit the Kerrigans’ small cluttered apartment and the Styleses’ grand home, Egan’s book is far less interested in domestic relationships than in those of the workplace. By the early 1940s, the stability of American urban domestic life had been under threat for years. Families had been strained by the economic dislocation of the Depression, by the ethnic, religious and class divisions stemming from large-scale immigration and, finally, by the war. Add to these generational forces of entropy the more timeless problems of pride, shame, ambition and wanderlust, and no family unit in Egan’s novel seems particularly secure. “Her life was a war life; the war was her life,” Egan writes of Anna at one point. “There had been another life before that — her family, the neighborhood — but everyone from that time had died, or moved, or grown up.”

Yet what stability the central characters fail to find at home, they discover at work. Eddie, Dexter and Anna all form profound bonds on the job — whether with fellow shipmates, henchmen or divers. While in their personal lives the three struggle with the limitations prescribed by their gender, class and family roles, their intimate professional units provide them with human connections that supersede prejudice and presumption. On the job, the three can ultimately be themselves.

Perhaps it is to be expected that a story of intertwined fates should be laden with secrets. Virtually all of the characters here have them. In the course of the novel, meetings take place that are never to be spoken of again. Money changes hands with provenance suppressed. Misrepresentations of paternity and identity are engineered right alongside the more mundane deceits that spring from infidelity and murder. As Dexter’s white-shoe banker of a father-in-law observes: “Every man has his secrets, his costs of doing business.” We could elaborate by noting that secrecy can also be the cost of having relationships. In this broader context, Egan nimbly explores two of the central paradoxes inherent in the keeping of secrets. First, while a secret is a piece of information that we bury, it can quickly become the prevailing force shaping our identity and governing our actions in the world. Second, while we fashion most secrets to preserve some form of liberty, they inevitably constrain us by inhibiting self-knowledge and self-proclamation.

But for all of their asymmetric influence, secrets are ultimately mortal. What is done cannot be undone through dissemblance. The hidden fact bides its time in obscurity waiting to be revealed by a slip of the tongue or a chance encounter. And in the context of Egan’s novel, it is only when secrets unravel that the business of personal liberty can begin.

“Manhattan Beach” is principally a novel of New York. As such, it inevitably pays tribute to the city’s iconography: its crowded tenements and highbrow retreats and quasi-legitimate nightclubs. But these familiar landmarks are not the focus of Egan’s narrative. Refreshingly, Egan and her characters turn their backs on a Manhattan interior defined by subways and skyscrapers, Broadway and Wall Street, to look outward to sea. After all, from New York’s founding until not long ago, the city was chiefly a port — busy with the daily movement of goods onto and off ships. In addition, because New York was America’s gateway for immigration, by 1940 a significant percentage of the city’s population had crossed the sea to get here. The very title of the novel, “Manhattan Beach,” points to this fact of history that in modern times seems almost oxymoronic. Egan also gestures to this paradox by choosing as her epigraph a quote from Herman Melville, who spent most of his life not on the island of Nantucket but on the island of Manhattan.

In the New York of Egan’s novel, freighters are docked the length of the West Side piers and battleships are being built in the Brooklyn Naval Yards. The local fisheries and oyster beds are still thriving. By extension, the book is teeming with those who earn their living on the water: sailors, stevedores, lobstermen, shipbuilders and that particular maritime specialist prized by the underworld, the boatman who sinks bodies to the bottom of the sea. Anna principally comes of age in the Naval Yards as one of the pioneering divers who performed underwater repairs and salvage. And it is in a remote boathouse at the far reaches of Manhattan Beach that the destinies of Anna, Eddie and Dexter ultimately come to fruition — albeit at three different moments in time.

The prevalence of the ocean in this story is not simply atmospheric; it is central to the symbolism. As the Melville epigraph affirms, “meditation and water are wedded for ever.” For Anna the sight of the sea provides an “electric mix of attraction and dread” while for Eddie it’s “an infinite hypnotic expanse” and for Dexter it’s “never the same on any two days, not if you really looked.” Egan really looks, and so do her characters. Turning their backs on the crowded constraints of their urban lives, all three look to the ocean as a realm that while inherently dangerous also promises the potential for personal discovery and an almost mystical liberty. This is a novel that deserves to join the canon of New York stories.","In ‘Manhattan Beach,’ Jennifer Egan Sets a Crime Story on the Waterfront",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/books/review/jennifer-egan-manhattan-beach.html

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London.
Photo“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted.
“We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said.
“Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said.","With so many exhibits and monographs devoted to fashion photography and its leading practitioners, it’s hard to imagine that it wasn’t that long ago that the genre was seldom the focus of highbrow studies. Yet, that’s what Eugénie Shinkle discovered when she began researching it almost a decade ago.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London. “Apart from a handful of exceptions, there was a real reluctance amongst scholars to engage with it in a serious way,” she said. “Unapologetically commercial, it had been reduced to ‘only advertising.’ And, until recently — that is until it started appearing in galleries — it was considered to be ephemeral. Because it wasn’t meant to last and because it wasn’t created with any kind of critical or artistic intent, people didn’t believe its history should be approached in that way.”

After publishing “Fashion as Photograph: Viewing and Reviewing Images of Fashion” in 2008, which examined why the genre deserves intellectual scrutiny, she’s now releasing “Fashion Photography: The Story in 180 Pictures,” a compendium of important figures who help chart the genre’s evolution. From Camille Silvy, a diplomat turned studio photographer in the 1850s, to the contemporary creative couple of Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes, who specialize in abstract still lives, the volume published by Aperture chronicles various movements and turning points.

“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted. “Initially, it was reluctant to engage explicitly with politics, but since the end of the ’60s it has become more openly, overtly and unabashedly political.”

After World War II, photographers like Henry Clarke subtly alluded to the changing role of women in society by portraying them as “independent and in control,” writes Ms. Shinkle. Artists like William Klein parodied fashion conventions and encouraged his peers to engage in self-criticism. Even Richard Avedon proved to be a revelation: “I learned to appreciate his depth and talent by seeing how he was able to reinvent himself halfway through his career and noticing how ardently he campaigned for the use of models of color. Creatively, and politically, he’s one of the most important fashion photographers of the 20th century.”

By the ’90s, thanks in no small part to the nonconformist British magazine “The Face,” the grunge movement — which challenged gender norms, capitalism and the ideals of social respectability — appeared in mainstream publications and paved the way for today’s more cerebral work. Collier Schorr’s images, for example, question gender fluidity, notions of desire and how identity is constructed, while Chen Man speaks up creatively about China’s complexities.

Looking at the people in the volume, it also become more apparent how conservative the industry has been. Most photographers listed are Western-educated white men. This is due in part to the author’s and publisher’s decision to keep close reins on what was considered a primer. “We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said. “I had to make that decision early on. Did I want to include more vernacular practices like that of Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso, who has been doing amazing fashion-inspired work since the ’70s? Or, did I want to restrict it to so-called pure fashion photography?”

In doing so, she revealed how difficult it has been for traditionally marginalized groups to be taken seriously. Case in point: Women, in the early 20th century, were rarely behind the camera. Yva, Madame D’Ora and Toni Frissell were trailblazers working “at a time when that was not what a well-bred women did, because photography was seen as a technical job.” To showcase them and highlight their technical prowess and unique perspectives is to revise history, which too often ignored them. Similarly, the inclusion of the Harlem Renaissance photographer James Van Der Zee, well known in the African-American community, but virtually unknown at the time outside of it, “points out how exclusive and white-centric the industry was in those years.”

While there’s now a more diverse roster, there’s still a long way to go. “Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said. “It’s representative and it popularizes certain tendencies in ways that no other type of photography can because it’s so ubiquitous.”

Correction: Sept. 27 2017:

An earlier version of this article misstated the academic title held by Ms. Shinkle. She is a reader in photography, not a professor of Photographic Theory and Criticism.

He said that by the 2023 target date for the new electric models, G.M.
By 2020, Ford plans to produce an electric car that can go 300 miles before needing to recharge, Mr. Marakby said.
“That’s a big change,” he said, compared with the early electric models that could go fewer than 100 miles, a limitation that made them impractical for many consumers.
However the tastes and demand for electric vehicles evolve domestically, China may have the biggest influence in shaping the marketplace.","But the upstart automaker Tesla has proved the potential of electric vehicles to generate excitement, with its first mass-market offering, the Model 3 sedan, attracting $1,000 deposits from hundreds of thousands of potential buyers. (It is also showing the challenges of getting the technology to scale, announcing on Monday that it produced only 260 Model 3s in the third quarter, “less than anticipated due to production bottlenecks.”)

More than consumer demand, however, it is regulatory pressure that is revving up the electric push, with officials in China, Europe and the United States ratcheting up emissions standards and setting or discussing deadlines that could eliminate gasoline-powered cars within a generation.

The announcements by G.M. and Ford follow pledges by the German automakers Volkswagen and Daimler to build hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles in the coming years, and the decision by Volvo, the Chinese-owned Swedish luxury brand, to convert its entire lineup to either electric cars or hybrid vehicles that are powered by both batteries and gas.

The accelerated pace of development also reflects the symbiotic relationship between battery-powered cars and another technological frontier; auto companies are tying their electric-car plans to lofty goals of building fleets of autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.

The automakers believe they can solve the problem of achieving — as G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, has begun stressing — a world with “zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion.”

It is a stunning statement from a company that, together with Ford, sells more large pickup trucks and full-size sport utility vehicles than the rest of the global industry combined — and from an industry that grudgingly got into building electric vehicles in the face of stricter fuel emissions standards.

Just last month, during a visit to China, Ms. Barra cautioned against mandates in which the transition to electric vehicles outpaces consumer demand. “I think it works best when, instead of mandating, customers are choosing the technology that meets their needs,” she said.

On Monday, Mr. Reuss framed the company’s strategy as a natural outgrowth of what it had learned from its existing entry in the all-electric arena, the Chevrolet Bolt, even though it has achieved only negligible sales so far.

“There is a transition going on,” said Mr. Reuss, adding that G.M. has no timetable to eliminate gasoline engines from its vehicles. He said that by the 2023 target date for the new electric models, G.M. will still be building cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles with internal combustion engines.

“They wisely gave no time frame because, frankly, no one knows how the future will evolve,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the research firm Autotrader.

For its part, Ford said it intended to accelerate its development of electric cars as part of a broader business strategy that will be laid out for Wall Street on Tuesday by its new chief executive, Jim Hackett. Mr. Hackett was installed in May after his predecessor, Mark Fields, failed to persuade investors and his board that the company was moving fast enough to develop the vehicles of the future, like battery-powered and self-driving cars.

Ford already fields several slow-selling hybrid, battery-powered and plug-in models, and has said it also plans to add hybrid versions of its big sports-utility vehicles, like the Ford Explorer, as it expands its electric offerings.

The company has formed a group it calls Team Edison to focus on pure battery-electric cars, said Sherif Marakby, Ford’s vice president for autonomous vehicles and electrification.

By 2020, Ford plans to produce an electric car that can go 300 miles before needing to recharge, Mr. Marakby said. “That’s a big change,” he said, compared with the early electric models that could go fewer than 100 miles, a limitation that made them impractical for many consumers.

However the tastes and demand for electric vehicles evolve domestically, China may have the biggest influence in shaping the marketplace. Sales of electric vehicles, or E.V.s, are already in the hundreds of thousands there and could exceed 400,000 by 2019, representing two-fifths of the world market, according to LMC Automotive, a global consulting company.

“China is a huge part of the story in E.V.s, and it is a big factor in the decision making of the automakers,” said Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner who tracks auto-industry technology. “China’s move toward higher emissions standards and the E.V. mandates gives the big global automakers certainty that they are going to have a significant market for these cars and they can know these investments will be worth it.”

Reflecting the importance of the Chinese market, Ms. Barra, the G.M. chief, visited Shanghai last month as the company announced that it would roll out at least 10 all-electric or hybrid models in China between 2016 and 2020, including those already in the market.

Just a few days earlier, China had joined other countries, including Britain and France, in announcing plans for an eventual ban on sales of gasoline- and diesel-powered cars. But unlike those countries, which said that they hope to halt sales in 2040, China set no date.

The chief auto-emissions regulator in California — whose agency largely sets the standards to which automakers design their American fleets — said last week that Gov. Jerry Brown was asking why his state shouldn’t follow suit.

“I’ve gotten messages from the governor asking, ‘Why haven’t we done something already?’” the regulator, Mary D. Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, told Bloomberg News. “The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California.”

At the same time, however, the Trump administration is pushing in the opposite direction, conducting a review of tight fuel-emissions standards for 2025 set by the Obama administration; it is widely expected to scale them back.

Investors reacted positively to G.M.’s announcement, with its shares tacking on more than 4 percent in Monday’s trading. And Mr. Reuss said G.M. did not expect to be hurt financially by a shift toward electric models, which at least for now can cost more to produce than comparably sized gasoline-powered vehicles.

Those who don’t plan ahead might find themselves battling long lines and dwindling supplies at Walmart, as they rush to stock up on water, batteries and portable generators. “The week before Irma hit, we had so many phone calls from people desperate to have product overnighted to them,” said Paul Fulton, the president of the Ready Store, an online emergency preparedness retailer that has seen inquiries jump 500 percent in the past few weeks. “At that point, it’s just too late.”

The growing prepper movement might capture the imagination of zealous survivalists awaiting the apocalypse, but in reality, most Americans are woefully unprepared for any disruption to their daily routines.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, the American Red Cross and the Department of Homeland Security all provide advice on preparedness. Yet a 2015 FEMA survey found that only 39 percent of respondents had an emergency plan that they had discussed with their families, even though 80 percent of Americans live in counties that have suffered weather-related disasters since 2007.

“We need a culture of preparedness that becomes a part of our everyday existence,” said Leslie Chapman-Henderson, the chief executive of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, a nonprofit organization in Florida. “There is not a place in the U.S. that is not without some form of hazard and risk.”

The best time to prepare is when the sky is clear and your weekend is free, not when local officials are telling you to board up windows and head for higher ground. But readying for the unknown can feel like a daunting and costly task — and one easily shelved. To make it more manageable, weave emergency planning into your everyday life, chipping away at the long to-do list. Here are some ways to get started.

CONSIDER WHAT AND WHERE YOU BUY

There is no way around it: Some homes are more disaster prone than others. Those near heavily wooded areas may face fire risk. Those near water could flood.

During this year’s ferocious hurricane season, people shopping for homes have been on high alert. Real estate brokers in Connecticut and Long Island say that prospective buyers have been asking pointed questions about waterfront properties, and interest in such homes has dipped since Hurricane Harvey ravaged Texas.

“It seems like homes on the water that were selling briskly during the summer have taken a slowdown,” said Joanne Schloen, the branch manager of the West Islip, N.Y., office of Coach Realtors, an affiliate of Christie’s International Real Estate. Prospective buyers “are afraid to buy something on the water,” Ms. Schloen said, adding that shoppers want to know if homes took on water in previous storms and are reluctant to consider those that have not been raised to meet FEMA flood elevation standards.

Some waterfront homes are a safer bet than others. Consider the five-bedroom home of Richard and Kim Alexander in Rowayton, a coastal village in Norwalk, Conn. After the 3,500-square-foot property sustained water damage in Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the Alexanders spent roughly $300,000 to raise the house and the grade of the lot, exceeding FEMA elevation standards. “As soon as I saw the damage from Sandy, I basically said to myself, ‘Third time is not a charm,’” said Mr. Alexander, 57, a consultant. “We’ve got to mitigate this flood exposure.”

The house is currently listed for $1.75 million. Amanda Davenport, the listing agent, said that elevating the property added $250,000 to the list price and helped attract nervous shoppers. “Nine out of 10 buyers will say, ‘I’m only looking at houses that are FEMA-compliant,’” said Ms. Davenport, a saleswoman for Halstead Property. “And that’s different from two weeks ago.”

A buyer made an offer on the house as Hurricane Irma was pummeling Florida, and the offer was accepted.

KNOW YOUR RISKS AND MAKE A PLAN

To protect yourself and your family from the unknown, you need to have some idea of what that unknown might be. If you live in New York, for example, you should prepare for blizzards, hurricanes and extreme heat, but you probably don’t need to spend too much time fretting about earthquakes.

Not all risks, however, are immediately obvious. The Federal Alliance for Safe Homes has a map that lists peril risk by state. Once you know your risks, download the Know Your Plan app from the Insurance Information Institute, which provides detailed checklists to help you prepare for various emergency scenarios.

At the very least, families should keep an emergency kit on hand. What you store in that kit will depend on where you live and the potential hazards you face. Generally, you’ll be dealing with one of two scenarios: the need to evacuate or to shelter in place. To make a speedy exit a smooth one, pack a backpack full of supplies for each family member. To stay put safely, you’ll need enough provisions to sustain your household for at least 72 hours.

Either way, you’ll need items like clothes, water, food, flashlights, batteries, a portable radio, cash, a first-aid kit and medicine. Keep a paper copy of important names, phone numbers and addresses, because thanks to cellphones and speed dial, few of us remember anyone’s phone number anymore. Items like baby wipes, work gloves and a multipurpose tool may also come in handy.

Discuss an emergency response plan with your family. Decide where to meet if you have to leave your home, or the neighborhood. Select a friend or relative to be the point person to call if you become separated.

And remember, emergency supplies need to be updated. Children outgrow clothes and medications expire. Warmer months call for different supplies than colder ones. Refresh your emergency kit as part of your spring and fall cleaning routine.

Diane Thomson, a professional organizer and life coach, suggests preparing in stages, to avoid getting overwhelmed. “We’re not going to get it done this week,” she said. “But let’s say over this year, let’s take one step at a time.”

PROTECT YOUR VALUABLES

Jenny Herrero, who lives with her husband, Jose Herrero, and their two children in Lake Worth, Fla., thought she was prepared for Hurricane Irma. The family had weathered Hurricanes Irene and Sandy when they were living in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., losing power in both storms. For Irma, the family stocked up on food, lantern-style flashlights, batteries and gasoline for the portable generator.

They lost power for only a day during Irma, a minor inconvenience compared to the 16 days they went without power after Hurricane Sandy, and did not suffer major damage. After so many storms, the Herreros plan to add a separate emergency electrical panel, an investment of about $1,500, so that they can operate critical appliances using a transfer switch, without running extension cords through the house.

In all the preparation, though, Mrs. Herrero, 38, realized she had overlooked the family photographs. “I was scrambling to upload my digital photo collection onto Dropbox,” said Mrs. Herrero, who, ironically, owns Storyteller Productions, a company that stores and preserves photographs. “I was horrified that if we had flooding, or needed to leave suddenly, that my collection of family memories would be lost forever.”

The Herreros got lucky this time, but they learned an important lesson: Some preparation can be done weeks, if not months or years, in advance. Protect important documents and sentimental items like photographs and letters by uploading digital copies of the items or backing them up. Store original documents in a safe deposit box. And send a flash drive with digital copies of documents and photographs to a trusted friend or family member in another part of the country for safekeeping.

TALLY WHAT YOU OWN

To file a claim for damaged or destroyed possessions, you have to know what you own and roughly how much those items cost.

“No one remembers what’s in their house, not even me,” said Bob D’Amore, the president of the New York Public Adjusters Association. Homeowners often hire public adjusters to help file insurance claims and figure out what was lost.

But long before anything is damaged, you should take stock of your stuff; many insurance companies provide online tools to help. Or photograph rooms, items, receipts and the contents of closets to roughly document your possessions. Apps like Sortly and Home Contents make it easier to create a database that you could use if you were ever displaced.

KEEP TABS ON YOUR INSURANCE POLICY

As your home and life changes, so should your homeowner insurance policy. Review your policy every year to make sure it still provides adequate coverage. If you recently remodeled a kitchen or bathroom, your policy should provide enough coverage to rebuild it back to its updated condition.

Renters should buy insurance, too, and review those policies annually to make sure that the coverage for possessions is sufficient. “Sometimes renters underestimate how much it costs to replace the stuff that they have,” said Angi Orbann, a vice president of personal insurance at Travelers.

Not all hazards are covered in standard homeowners insurance policies. Flood insurance, for example, usually requires a separate policy. Only homeowners living in high-risk flood areas are required to buy flood insurance backed by the National Flood Insurance Program. However, more than 20 percent of flood claims come from people living outside such zones, according to FloodSmart.gov. “I personally believe that everyone should look at getting flood insurance,” Ms. Orbann said.

Discuss your policy with an insurance agent who can guide you through what sort of additional coverage you might need, depending on where you live and the particulars of your situation.

MAINTAIN YOUR PROPERTY

Some damage can be avoided, or lessened, by ordinary maintenance. Do not neglect chores like cleaning gutters and checking the roof for wear or damage. If your property has trees, have an arborist inspect them for signs of trouble.

“Seventy-five percent of trees that come down in a windstorm had some level of disease,” said Frances D. O’Brien, the division president of North America Personal Risk Services at Chubb. So part of protecting your home, she said, “is about maintaining your landscaping.”

If you live in a cold area, insulate pipes that face external walls to keep them from freezing. Know how to shut the water and gas off in the event of an emergency.

When you renovate, think about adding safety to your improvements. For example, when it comes time to buy a new roof, consider getting one that is resistant to fire, hail or hurricanes, depending on where you live. “If you’re already re-roofing, we’re talking about a nominal increase to upgrade to resistant” materials, said Ms. Chapman-Henderson, of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes.

Spend time now preparing your home and family from unforeseen risks, and when and if disaster strikes, you will be able to respond faster. “There is kind of a civic duty here,” said Ms. Thomson, the professional organizer. “The more we’re prepared, the less stress there is on the system.”

In other words, if you have the things that you need, then emergency responders can focus attention on those who do not.",Preparing Your Home for a Disaster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/realestate/preparing-for-disaster.html

Some of the most skilled cooks I know — people who confidently roast, grill and fry — balk at the notion of braising. They think it’s more mysterious or fussy than other cooking methods. The opposite is true: Braising is extremely flexible, and it follows a formula.

There is an art to it. But since a good braise is so utterly, deliciously succulent, learning how is painless.

You need only to understand the process. It involves gently simmering vegetables, fish, fowl or meat (or a combination) with a small amount of liquid, usually in a covered pot. Braising chicken is a good place to start, and it’s a lot easier than you think.

Indisputably, the best part of the bird for this project is the thigh: It is the most succulent cut. Though a whole chicken chopped in pieces can be braised, skip the heartache of overcooked breast meat and stick to thighs; your fellow diners will thank you.

A chicken thigh is nearly impossible to overcook. There is forgiveness — 10 minutes longer in the oven simply means a little more tenderness. Thighs can also be cooked ahead and successfully reheated, often gaining juiciness and depth in the process. I am not, however, referring to skinless, boneless thighs. You want skin-on, bone-in meat.

Of course, the standard claims are being made about the vast stimulative effects of the repatriated cash. They are being met this time with vigorous counterclaims based on the results of the Bush administration’s shot over a decade ago.

Back then, companies found their way around regulations forbidding this use of the money to simply benefit shareholders and corporate chiefs. A Senate commission reported that the top 15 repatriating corporations reduced their overall United States work force by 20,931 jobs, even as share buybacks increased and the annual compensation for their top five executives jumped 27 percent from 2004 to 2005 and another 30 percent the next year.

Pfizer, for instance, brought back $35.5 billion, the largest amount repatriated by a single company during the tax holiday, according to the Senate report. Then it turned around and spent over $20 billion in stock repurchases from 2005 to 2007. By 2007, the aggregate compensation of its top five executives was nearly $13 million higher than in 2004. Its United States payroll was 12,000 smaller.

The pattern was similar across most repatriating companies. Hewlett-Packard, which brought home $14.5 billion, bought back $22 billion worth of stock over the three years and cut its payroll by more than 8,500. The tobacco company Altria, which brought over $6 billion home during the holiday, spent $2.5 billion on share buybacks and bumped pay in the executive ranks by more than $50 million, but cut 6,000 jobs.

A few years back, Ms. Forbes explained to my colleague Floyd Norris how the computer manufacturer Dell had lobbied hard for the holiday — claiming that part of the money would be used to build a plant in Winston-Salem, N.C. “They did bring back $4 billion, and spent $100 million on the plant, which they admitted would have been built anyway,” she said. “About two months after that, they used $2 billion for a share buyback.”

Profits Held Outside the U.S. The 10 companies with the most profit held outside the United States last year, in billions. Apple Pfizer Microsoft G.E. IBM Johnson & Johnson Cisco Merck Google Exxon Mobil $230.2 197.1 124.0 82.0 71.4 66.2 65.6 63.1 60.7 54.0

With a new move afoot to put such holdings back on American books, there is a critical question that is too quickly glossed over: Why do businesses act this way? Why didn’t corporate executives invest more in their businesses and their work forces? Why did they go to the trouble of dribbling around a rule forbidding the use of repatriated profits to pay themselves a bonus? (Note to Congress: Money is fungible.)

Call me naïve. Professor Forbes and her colleagues — indeed, many economists — might swat the question away by arguing that businesses didn’t use the extra cash to invest and employ because they were well-run businesses, well invested and sufficiently staffed to maximize their profitability.

There is truth to this argument. In fact, most corporate investment today comes not from retained earnings but from borrowing. Bringing a foreign profit stash home has little effect on investment incentives.

Still, the question should resonate in an administration that came to power on a promise to address the plight of the working class. Because the working class stands on the other end of a deal with the corporate class. I don’t think it is possible to fully address workers’ demands without understanding, and changing, corporate motivations.

Many forces have shaped this deal, including technology, which replaced workers performing routine tasks, and globalization, which squeezed the margins of many businesses and exposed their workers to competition from cheap labor markets. And yet it would be a mistake to ignore the impact of a corporate ethos that has come to focus on rewarding shareholders and executives at the expense of any other consideration — be it workers’ welfare or even the company’s long-term sustainability. Indeed, workers today amount to little more than a line on the cost side of businesses’ balance sheets, with little claim to its prosperity.

Corporate profits have risen over the last quarter-century, as a share of the nation’s income, even as the workers’ share has shrunk. While executive pay has soared — padded with stock options and shares — the earnings of ordinary workers are below where they were in the 1970s. What’s more, the pensions that ensured workers a retirement perch in the middle class have been replaced by 401(k) savings accounts — which are cheaper for companies but put workers’ retirement prospects at the mercy of the stock market.

“How you divide the pie is a choice,” said Rick Wartzman, who heads the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute of Claremont Graduate University. “It is being carved differently.”

The change has happened across the board. In his book “The End of Loyalty,” published in May by Public Affairs, Mr. Wartzman lays out a shift in corporate culture both in success stories like Coca-Cola and General Electric and in less successful ones, like Eastman Kodak and General Motors. “For workers, the story was the same, whether they were working at a winner or a losing firm,” he said.

The good news is that it is not impossible to modify the behavior of the corporate leaders who have so drastically altered the contract with their work force over the last few decades. While it may be tempting to cast the new breed of executives as selfish villains who somehow lost their sense of right and wrong, the shift in their behavior responded to a shift in the incentives they faced. It was fed by a belief that snaked its way three or four decades ago from the halls of the University of Chicago through investment-bank trading floors and into the corner offices of corporate America: that the interests of corporate managers must be brought into tight alignment with those of shareholders. It was accompanied by one of the most destabilizing propositions in the modern history of corporate governance: This alignment was best achieved by paying corporate managers almost exclusively with stock.

Mihir A. Desai of Harvard Business School argues that this strategy amounted to outsourcing corporate compensation decisions to the capital markets — which have no way of telling whether the rise or fall in shares is caused by executives’ strategies or simply luck. This produced an enormous bubble in chief executive pay — which rose in tandem with the stock. It also made chief executives’ jobs more uncertain, vulnerable to market downturns. And it vastly distorted their behavior, putting every decision at the service of the share price at the close of the quarter.

Professor Desai points out that in the end, this structure does not really serve shareholders, at least not those with an interest in a company’s prosperity more than a few quarters down the road. “Capitalism seems to be serving managers and investment managers at the expense of shareholders,” he wrote.

Changing this behavior is not beyond the reach of policy. Just as changes in the tax treatment of executive pay in the 1990s encouraged stock-based remuneration, tax reforms might motivate corporate executives to invest for the long term rather than for an immediate stock bump — maybe even encourage stable employment and worker training. Until then, offering tax breaks to American corporations seems more likely to line the pockets of executives and shareholders than to improve their long-term prospects or the prosperity of their workers.",Will a Corporate Tax Holiday Give Workers Anything to Cheer?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/business/economy/corporate-tax.html

“This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and midsize businesses in this country in more than 80 years,” Mr. Trump said.
“Let them know you’re waiting.”In an apparent nod to the harsh political realities the tax plan faces, Mr. Trump made an explicit overture to Democrats to support the plan.
“Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people,” Mr. Trump said.
Studies of similar plans produced by Mr. Trump and House Republicans have been projected to cost $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade.","On the individual side, the plan would collapse the tax brackets from seven to three, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, the president said. The current top rate is 39.6 percent and the lowest rate is 10 percent. The framework also gives Congress the option of creating a higher, fourth, rate above 35 percent in the tax plan to ensure that the wealthy are paying their fair share.

The plan aims to simplify and cut taxes for the middle class by doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. That would allow people to avoid a complicated process of itemizing their taxes to claim various credits and deductions. It would increase the child tax credit from $1,000 to an unspecified amount, and create a new $500 tax credit for non-child dependents, such as the elderly.

Provisions such as the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax, a levy on inherited wealth that Mr. Trump has derided for years, would be gone under the Republican proposal.

The proposal calls for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a shift that supporters say is needed to make American companies more competitive with their counterparts around the world.

A new tax rate of 25 percent would also be created for so-called pass-through businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, which are currently taxed at the rate of their owners. About 95 percent of businesses in the United States are structured as pass-throughs and they generate a majority of the government’s corporate tax revenue.

“This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and midsize businesses in this country in more than 80 years,” Mr. Trump said.

While Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, they must now sell it to lawmakers who have been deeply divided this year. The push began at a House Republican retreat on Wednesday at Fort McNair in Washington, where Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, walked members through the blueprint and talked about the importance of coming together to fix the tax code.

Later, in a hopeful sign for Republican leaders fretting privately about keeping their rank and file together, the conservative Freedom Caucus, whose members have derailed the party’s initiatives with hard-line demands, issued a statement of support calling the plan “forward looking” and pledging to back the party’s budget designed to ensure its passage.

The political stakes are high for a president who is desperate to score a legislative win before his first year in office draws to a close. Mr. Trump, who has eschewed the advocacy tours that his predecessors have used to build support for their top domestic priorities, made a rare direct appeal to voters during his speech, imploring them to call their representatives and senators and demand action on the tax proposal. “Let them know you’re watching,” Mr. Trump said. “Let them know you’re waiting.”

In an apparent nod to the harsh political realities the tax plan faces, Mr. Trump made an explicit overture to Democrats to support the plan.

“Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people,” Mr. Trump said.

But behind the scenes, Republican congressional leaders and senior White House officials have discussed bypassing Democrats and using special budget rules that would allow them to get the bill through Congress on a simple majority vote. And Mr. Trump paired his scripted talk of bipartisanship with an impromptu threat to Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, saying he would personally work to defeat the senator’s re-election bid next year if he does not fall into line on the tax plan.

“If Senator Donnelly doesn’t approve it — because, you know, he’s on the other side — we will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn’t believe,” Mr. Trump said as Mr. Donnelly looked on from the audience.

Conservatives cheered the plan as a bold and long-awaited step to spur economic growth, while Democratic leaders condemned it as an irresponsible boon to the rich. And some budget watchdogs expressed worry about the long-term impact of a plan they said could cost more than $2 trillion over a decade.

Mr. Trump, who has broken with precedent for modern American presidents by refusing to release his tax returns, insisted that wealthy people like him would not benefit — an assertion that seemed improbable for a man who runs a family-owned real estate empire and whose children stand to inherit vast sums.

“Tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected,” Mr. Trump said, framing a proposal that would affect hundreds of millions of Americans in terms of his own self-interest. “I’m doing the right thing, and it’s not good for me, believe me.”

Democrats scoffed. “If this framework is all about the middle class, then Trump Tower is middle-class housing,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. “It violates Trump’s tax pledge that the rich would not gain at all under his plan by offering sweetheart deals for powerful C.E.O.s, giveaways for campaign coffers and a new way to cheat taxes for Mar-a-Lago’s loyal members.”

As with the individual side, some of the thornier business tax issues remain unaddressed. It will be left to Congress to create safeguards that prevent wealthy individuals from incorporating as pass-through businesses, which would tax their income at a lower rate.

Most itemized deductions, including those widely used for state and local tax expenses, would also be eliminated, along with most of the tax credits that businesses use. However, the plan would preserve the deductions for mortgage interest expenses and charitable giving and keep incentives for education and retirement savings plans, as well as preserve the tax credits for research and development and low-income-housing on the business side.

Another big change for companies would be a limitation of the deductibility for corporate interest expenses, in exchange for the opportunity to immediately expense business investments. The ability to immediately write off these expenses would last only five years, and the limitations for deducting interest have yet to be determined.

Perhaps the most significant, yet murky, shift is the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system for multinational corporations. In theory, this means that companies would not be taxed on their overseas earnings. But to prevent erosion of the tax base, Republicans plan to impose some form of tax on foreign profits. The transition to the new system would also include a one-time repatriation tax at yet-to-be-determined rates to encourage companies to bring offshore profits back home.

Administration officials did not provide a cost estimate for the plan. Members of the Senate Budget Committee have agreed on a budget resolution that would allow for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years. Studies of similar plans produced by Mr. Trump and House Republicans have been projected to cost $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade.

Republicans say economic growth will compensate for lost revenue. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who sits on the Finance Committee, said he was confident that a growing economy would pay for the tax cuts.

“This tax plan will be deficit reducing,” Mr. Toomey said.",Trump Proposes the Most Sweeping Tax Overhaul in Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-tax-cut-plan-middle-class-deficit.html

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”

The building has a 24-hour doorman, and this apartment has a private, keyed elevator and vestibule. The main entry on the lower level opens to a 45-by-29-foot great room with a domed geometric skylight. The space includes a formal dining area and living room, as well as several spots for lounging. Three sets of French doors, with arched transoms, lead to a south-facing terrace overlooking the park. There are additional views of the MetLife clock tower and the Flatiron Building.

“This is the crown jewel of the Whitman,” Mr. Modlin said of the apartment.

At the center of the loft-like home is an open kitchen, with another spacious dining area and built-in seating. The kitchen has marble countertops and a long breakfast bar with stools, as well as built-in pantries, stainless-steel Miele appliances, a wine cooler and white custom cabinets.

Beyond the kitchen, at the apartment’s north end, are three en-suite bedrooms, a laundry room and an en-suite staff room that could also be used as an office.

The apartment is decorated in an eclectic mix of contemporary and antique furniture and artwork. (The furnishings are not included in the sale.) Photographs of Ms. Lopez and her twin son and daughter, and at least one with her and the retired Yankee third baseman Alex Rodriguez, whom she has been dating, are in the main-level hallway.

Throughout the unit are oversize windows, wide-plank oak floors and beamed ceilings extending around 12.5 feet. The apartment also has a Crestron smart home system.

On the upper level, which is reached by two separate staircases, there is a spacious master suite and a media room with a powder room that could be converted into another master bedroom. The master suite has a seating area; two marble baths, one of which has a separate soaking tub; and a windowed dressing room filled with Ms. Lopez’s outfits and accessories.

There are three sizable terraces on this level — with outdoor furnishings, various plantings and even a small putting green. One terrace is off the master suite and looks out onto 27th Street, one faces the park off the media room and another is adorned with outdoor lights in between the media room and master suite.

Tricky Clues

37A: This is one of those clues that was probably a no-brainer for some of you, but I went down the catwalk looking for an answer to “Prep for the runway, maybe.” We’re dealing with airliners, not fashion lines, and the answer is a crossword stalwart, DEICE.

51A: Religious references always bounce off my unschooled mind, but I find Pope Francis’ personality fascinating and when I saw this quote — “when one goes against one’s conscience” — I assumed that he meant guilt, which didn’t fit. This was also probably not a universally difficult clue, but it was a thought-provoking one for me. He’s referring to SIN, something I’ve always thought of as an absolute, objective rather than subjective or personal.

72A: “Cause of insomnia, maybe” just had to be guilt. Why did I fixate on this particular sensation while doing this puzzle? Worry, stress, self-doubt, a strong urge to begin a move to Scandinavia at 3 a.m. — there are many things that can keep one up at night. Including, I guess, a DRIP — be it a slow leak or someone who just won’t stop talking.

138A: An example of how precise cluing can be, “We should avoid doing that” led me to snap in BAD IDEA when I was first circling the grid. I realized my mistake soon thereafter — it’s LETS NOT — but I probably could’ve avoided the error by reading more closely. Also, what word was I thinking of at 112D to end in B? Not using my noggin.

19D: It took a while for me to break into the corners here. I got one or two entries in each section but no traction. There were a lot of possible answers for “Very last part,” and TAG END wasn’t something I’d seen before in the puzzle, but it does appear occasionally.

46D: This term for a “ratcheting wheel mechanism,” PAWL, was a completely new word to me. It wasn’t a blocker for anything so I just let it fill itself in with crosses at the end of solving. This used to happen to me all the time when I started doing puzzles 350 years ago, but these days it’s a novelty to discover a common word like this. It’s also used in the puzzle, though rarely.

I took my dog to the emergency room twice in one month thinking she had broken her ankle when in fact a prickly little sweetgum ball had gotten lodged in between her pawpads.

Sea turtles, which take 25 to 30 years to reach reproductive age, lay their eggs in the open beach, under vegetation or at the base of a dune. The hurricane eroded key nesting beaches, washing away nests or flooding them with rainwater or seawater, Dr. Mansfield said.

Along two stretches of beach south of Cape Canaveral, more than 90 percent of incubating loggerhead nests were destroyed by the storm, representing about 25 percent of the season’s total.

Green turtles typically lay more nests in alternate years. Last year, Hurricane Matthew wiped out many nests, but it was a light laying season for the greens, so there were fewer nests to destroy, Dr. Mansfield said.

This year, with record numbers of green turtle nests on the northeastern coast of Florida — with 12,000 north of Cape Canaveral and more than 15,000 a bit farther south — huge numbers were lost, Dr. Ceriani said.

Hurricane Nate, which is bearing down on Florida’s Gulf Coast, is unlikely to have a huge impact, because the loggerheads that are more common in that area have already laid their nests for the season.

There may be some impact on remaining green turtle nests on the Atlantic coast if the storm hits hard on those beaches, “but I don’t expect it would be bad,” Dr. Ceriani said in a follow-up email.

Mr. Mulkeen and Ms. Meier-Zimbler attended a 2010 holiday party in Park Slope, Brooklyn. “I had just gotten out of a serious relationship, and he seemed really nice,” Ms. Meier-Zimbler recalled. She didn’t expect to meet anyone — or even go to a party — that night. Instead, she was planning to pick up Ms. Greenhouse at the airport. After a year and a half of working as an editorial assistant in London at the literary magazine Granta, Ms. Greenhouse was returning to New York.

“I had been dating this British guy and we broke up, and my grandfather was dying,” Ms. Greenhouse said of her decision to move back to New York. “I had always feared the rat race of New York, but my family is here.” She also had a job interview lined up with Robert Silvers, the longtime editor of The New York Review of Books who died this year.

But Ms. Greenhouse’s plane never took off that night because an inch of snow had fallen on Heathrow Airport. “I had to lug all my possessions back to London by tube — impossible to find a cab — go awkwardly back to my ex’s in East London,” she said, “and then call Sarah and tell her my flight had been canceled.”

The next day, Ms. Meier-Zimbler called Ms. Greenhouse, a willowy ringer for a young Joan Baez, to share her impressions of the handsome Mr. Mulkeen, a San Francisco native. Ms. Greenhouse listened attentively.



“She and I Skyped from my ex-boyfriend’s bed in London,” Ms. Greenhouse said. While they chatted, she looked up Mr. Mulkeen online to determine whether he was worthy of a romantic overture from Ms. Meier-Zimbler. Ms. Greenhouse decided fast, telling her best friend to ask out the man who would one day end up being her husband.

“I remember, from examining his Facebook profile, that he sometimes had a mustache, that he had written for GQ, that he had this dashing photo in a navy peacoat and that he liked Richard Ford,” Ms. Greenhouse said.

Ms. Knuti and her older brother, Matt Knuti, had been hanging out in the same Brooklyn social circles. And Mr. Mulkeen, Mr. Knuti’s roommate at Brown University, was part of that crowd of young professionals.

Mr. Mulkeen remembers those days as a blur of outings to local dive bars: “The hip thing at that time was picklebacks, which is when you have a shot of whiskey and then a shot of pickle juice. Which I should say is a drink that I’d be embarrassed to buy anyone now.”

But the first time Ms. Greenhouse rendezvoused with Mr. Mulkeen and the Knuti siblings — Oct. 15, 2011, at Sharlene’s, a bar in Park Slope — Mr. Mulkeen did the hip thing and bought Ms. Greenhouse a pickleback.

That briny drink led them down a conversational path along which they talked about everything from poetry to politics. “I felt he was sweetly charismatic and adorable,” Ms. Greenhouse said. The evening ended, she said, with a game of footsie under the table.

Or at least she believes it did. Mr. Mulkeen thinks otherwise. “I definitely would have remembered if there was foot contact,” he said. What they and several friends do recall without deviation is that within months of that dive bar meeting, Ms. Greenhouse and Mr. Mulkeen became inseparable.

But not before Ms. Greenhouse received Ms. Meier-Zimbler’s permission to remove Mr. Mulkeen from the friend zone.

“I remember talking to Sarah and saying, ‘Would it be O.K. to date this guy?’” she said. “It wasn’t like I was stealing her man, but I needed to formally ask her.”

Ms. Meier-Zimbler, now married and an urban planner in Holyoke, Mass., said, “When she and Martin first started dating, I could tell she wanted to be sensitive about it, especially because I was still single. But it became clear really fast that they were right for each other.”

In 2014, after a couple of years of navigating career changes and spending nights together in Mr. Mulkeen’s Crown Heights apartment, the couple bought a brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Mr. Mulkeen knew he wanted to marry Ms. Greenhouse. While they were renovating their house together, his thoughts on how to propose intensified.

“I really wanted to do it right,” he said. By the middle of 2016, he decided that Paris, where Ms. Greenhouse had lived as a child, was the ideal place. “We had been going there once a year together since we met, and she has a lot of nostalgia about it,” he said. “I feel like it really brings her alive.”

Mr. Mulkeen arranged a surprise trip in late September of that year, clearing the dates with Ms. Greenhouse’s deputy editor at The New Yorker and telling her parents of his plan to propose. They encouraged him, sending him off with a diamond ring that had belonged to a great-grandmother of Ms. Greenhouse’s.

The morning of Sept. 30, 2016, Mr. Mulkeen and Ms. Greenhouse stopped by their favorite French bakery, Gérard Mulot, for their usual order — a plum tart, croissants and the tourte loir-et cher mulot. Mr. Mulkeen then steered them toward the Luxembourg Gardens, near where Ms. Greenhouse had once lived and played. She sensed something was up.

“It was an overcast day, but basically he was like, ‘Let’s eat these in the garden.’ We sat in those green chairs Bryant Park imitates,” Ms. Greenhouse said. The mood? Awkward. “I got a bit nervous,” Mr. Mulkeen said. “I think Emily could sense what I wanted to say, and she tried to comfort me by being jokey. She sang a little and put her scarf around me.”

And then the words, “Will you marry me?” came out. Through tears, Ms. Greenhouse said yes.

“It’s weird because Martin is the person I’m most comfortable with in the world, but in a moment like that there can still be this welling up of nervousness and all of a sudden we’re almost timid around each other,” she said.

In the days before their wedding, Ms. Greenhouse said she read many love letters. Not just any letters, but Georgia O’Keeffe’s exchanges with Alfred Stieglitz, Iris Murdoch’s letters, Saul Bellow’s, Napoleon to Josephine, Elizabeth Bishop’s with Robert Lowell.

In his handwritten vows, Mr. Mulkeen praised Ms. Greenhouse’s fierce independence, intelligence and wit.

Ms. Greenhouse choked back sobs as she read her vows during their Sept. 9 wedding at Camp Timber Lake West in Roscoe, N.Y. She told Mr. Mulkeen: “You, Martin, have taught me a directness and lightness that I had never known. I was a lifelong journal keeper, an antic scribbler, a dreadful thrower of notes to boys across classrooms. When you and I started dating, I stopped keeping a journal. Sometimes I regret this or feel guilty about it, and I know sometimes you do, too. But I realize that you were the confidant I had been waiting for. Now I am free to write about things larger than myself, and still I have you to make sense of me.”

Mr. Mulkeen’s childhood friend, Matt Pantell, said that in Ms. Greenhouse, Mr. Mulkeen had found someone who shared his intellect and love of the written word.

“Even when they argue, it’s poetic,” Dr. Pantell said.","It’s a Good Story, Editors Included",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/fashion/emily-greenhouse-of-the-new-yorker-marries-martin-mulkeen.html

A few of the memorable entries for me were E, “It’s measured from E to F”, which logically called for GASTANK and is very clever; O, which stands for Octopus, OPHELIA, and the answer to my favorite clue of all, S, “Aquiline: eagle :: struthious:” OSTRICH. Aquiline, of course, refers to a specific profile; I had to look struthious up after the fact to see how this word is (or was) used, and I urge us all to resurrect its meaning to refer to the willfully ignorant. We can do this, people.

Constructor Notes

Octopuses! Oh, we once got into a big puzzle brouhaha over the plural OCTOPI. How wrong is it? Merriam-Webster permits it, but apparently it’s based on the mistaken assumption that the -US is a Latin noun ending that pluralizes into -I. A good scientist would probably say OCTOPODES. Would you?

Consulting with Gardiner Harris, who covers international diplomacy for The Times and has written several articles about this case, I learned there was not even an official medical report.

I decided to try to draw some boundary lines for all the speculation swirling around the story. Is the idea of a sonic attack plausible, based on what scientists know about sound and the human body?

I wound up perusing a massive 2009 book called “ ‘Non-Lethal’ Weapons,” with a chapter summarizing research on using sound to incapacitate people at a distance.

But there’s less than meets the eye. There’s a lot of wild rumor about secret weapons that can make brains explode or make people think there’s a voice inside their head. And while medical researchers have studied the effects of sound for decades, they’ve done so sporadically, leaving us with a very patchy understanding.

So I hit the phone. I didn’t want to talk with just anyone — I looked for people with lots of experience in research that had direct bearing on this question. I started with Timothy Leighton, whose job title at Southampton University is, literally, professor of ultrasonics and underwater acoustics. Better yet, Dr. Leighton has published the only thorough recent scientific review of the effects of environmental ultrasound that I’m aware of.

When I interviewed Dr. Leighton and others, I made clear I didn’t expect them to solve this mystery; I just wanted them to reconcile the question with what we know through science. Everyone I spoke with had been following the news, too, so in each interview we hit the ground running.

Spoiler alert: The consensus was that it was extremely unlikely the diplomats were the victims of a sonic weapon. It would be necessary to rule out less exotic possibilities before taking that one seriously. The notion has ricocheted like mad around the press, making it possible for readers to assume that it has been generally accepted by experts. But it most certainly has not. I’ll be curious to see if articles like mine can put the brakes on the speculation.

If the United States government ever does release the results of a detailed investigation, I would love to report on the case again. But, as the retired acoustics professor Steven L. Garrett pointed out, the chance to easily prove that a sonic weapon was involved — using a cellphone microphone — is long past.

Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Photo

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

Over the years, and almost without meaning to, I have become an obsessive collector — not of objects but of recipes. I have accumulated boxes’ and files’ worth. I search for them casually in print and online, and relentlessly, determinedly and often shamelessly when I’m out, whether close to home or traveling. I eavesdrop as I wait in line at the market, and sometimes, if I think there’s the possibility of nabbing something special, I’ll muster the courage to wriggle into the conversation. I ask shopkeepers how they prepare whatever it is they sell, which is how I came to cook a turkey at a temperature so low I feared it wouldn’t be ready to eat until the next day (its slow-roasted skin was burnished and its meat moist). I take notes when I taste something I like in a restaurant and then spend days in my kitchen trying to recreate it. And sometimes recipes just come to me, by mail, by good luck or through the front door, which is how my first visiting cake arrived.

The cake, protected by a tea towel and nestled in a basket, was given to me by its baker, Ingela Helgesson, a woman I’d talked with now and then at a local farm store in Connecticut. Ingela was searching for the perfect kitchen sink, and I invited her to come see mine; the cake was her unnecessary — but much appreciated — thanks. It was a butter cake, round and low, a few sliced almonds baked into its golden top. It was both unassuming and immensely inviting, but it was the story of the cake that I loved most. Ingela’s mother, who taught her to make the cake in their native Sweden, said it came together so speedily that you could start mixing the batter the moment you spied visitors coming up the walk. By the time they were settled in your home, the cake would be ready to serve.

The name charmed me. It evoked images of pilgrims as well as of potlucks, of picnics in town and country, of weekends with friends and treats to tide you over on long trips.

Fifteen years later, I’ve christened dozens of “visiting cakes” of my own devising, no matter if I’ve taken them far away or left them in the kitchen to be enjoyed for days. My visiting cakes might be Bundt cakes, simple yet often fanciful, with swirls, stripes and crenelations molded into the pans they are baked in. They might be sheet cakes that can be cut into squares, or rounds, like Ingela’s, which make nice wedges. But most often they’re compact loaves, sometimes squat, sometimes flat and many times crowned, their centers cracked in volcanic fault lines.

What separates a visiting cake from all other cakes is its sturdiness — it’s built to be wrapped, packed and bundled, to travel and to retain its goodness for at least the span of a long weekend. This often precludes frostings and fussy decorations and means that the cake’s clarion qualities are its flavor and its texture, which tips toward moist, firm and easily sliceable, like poundcakes (which make fine visiting cakes). What all the cakes have in common is that they are meant to be shared. The joy of community is implicit in their name.

My lemon-spice visiting cake is one I bake regularly. Among its virtues are the quickness with which it’s made; the need for only a whisk to blend the batter; the fact that, like many spice cakes, it’s good when you make it and even better a day or two later, when the spices have had time to find their way into the cake; and that it is both homely and beautiful — its golden honey color and solid shape promise comfort and satisfaction.

Traditionally, a small percentage of grapes in the region are dried after harvest until they became sweet and concentrated. They are then fermented into a sweet wine, Recioto della Valpolicella. The concentration of sugar in the dried grapes produces high alcohol levels in which yeast cannot survive — generally dying before fermentation is complete — leaving a sweet, unctuous wine.

Occasionally, though, the Recioto ferments until it is dry. This is Amarone, a powerful wine with alcohol levels that can surpass 16 percent. Even though it is considered dry, it can leave a profoundly sweet impression.

The popularity of Amarone has been widely documented. At Italian seafood temples like Marea in Midtown Manhattan, you can see diners relishing this heavy red wine with ethereal raw-fish dishes. To each their own, I suppose.

The powerful wake of Amarone has given rise to a new style of Valpolicella, known as Ripasso. Valpolicella itself tends to be light- to medium-bodied wine, fragrant but not opulent. The popularity of Amarone led to efforts to add muscle to Valpolicella, by employing Amarone-like techniques to its production.

In order to make Ripasso, grape skins left over from Amarone production or dried grapes are added to Valpolicella. The resulting maceration adds body, tannins, alcohol and intensity to the wine.

With the natural inclination to assume that more is better, it is tempting to think that Valpolicella Ripasso, with more flavor, intensity and body, is better than ordinary Valpolicella. Many people feel that way, and Ripassos can be fine wines. But I have always preferred the freshness and easy drinkability of plain old Valpolicella, which, like Beaujolais, has historically been a wine you could knock back without fear of heaviness, headache or hangover.

Nonetheless, the popularity of Ripasso has made itself felt. In the last 10 years, production of ordinary Valpolicella has declined to 18 million bottles a year, from 41 million, according to the Consorzio Tutela Vini Valpolicella, a trade association.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“Nowadays, the trend is to use most of the vintage Valpolicella to produce Ripasso,” Olga Bussinello, director of the consortium, wrote in an email.

Keeping all this in mind, the wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles of Valpolicella from recent vintages. Our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch, did his best to select only ordinary Valpolicellas for the tasting, but it’s not always easy to differentiate Valpolicella from Valpolicella Ripasso. The wine now has its own official designation, Ripasso della Valpolicella, but it is not always used.

For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Justin Timsit, who just recently left his post as wine director at Gramercy Tavern. Our second guest called in sick at the last minute. So, though we prefer a foursome, we tackled this tasting as a trio.

For our part, we all thought Bernie did pretty well in his selections. Of the 20 bottles, only one stood out as not a classic Valpolicella. This bottle, the 2012 Bussola Classico Superiore TB, was syrupy and 15.5 percent alcohol, as against the others, which ranged from 11.5 to 13.5 percent, more Amarone than Ripasso. Otherwise, we were impressed. As the production of these ordinary Valpolicellas has declined, the quality has risen.

“That’s a wine that takes me to that place,” Justin said, speaking of the Veneto region. “I appreciated their freshness and energy.”

Some of the wines seemed modern and highly polished, which made them less distinctive. But the best were quintessential Italian reds, balancing the flavors of sweet cherry fruit with a tart, earthy quality and a welcome bitterness that refreshed. These wines seemed light, almost delicate, yet they had a linear intensity, offering a progression of evolving sensations from first taste through last impression that lingered well after swallowing.

Photo

Those that we did not like so well seemed tarted up, not with the flavors of new oak barrels — as is so often the case in historic wine regions — but with richness, Ripasso-style, that thickened the texture. The lightness and linearity were lost. The richness seemed shapeless, arriving but not progressing.

Our all-around favorite was the 2016 Valpolicella Rio Albo from Ca’ Rugate, which was both sweet and savory, with depth, length and complexity. At $16, it was also our best value. Seven of our top 10, in fact, were under $20, indicating that the many Valpolicellas are good values.

The Ca’ Rugate was a simple Valpolicella rather than a Valpolicella Classico, a geographical indication. The Classicos come from the heart of the historic Valpolicella region, which is generally considered to have better potential than simple Valpolicella, which usually comes from areas into which the appellation expanded in the mid-20th century. That may be so, but five of our top 10 were simple Valpolicellas, which suggests that conscientious farming and careful production may currently be more important than location.

Our No. 3 wine, too, was a simple Valpolicella, the savory, floral 2015 Ca’ Fiui from Corte Sant’Alda, as was No. 7, the earthy, agile 2015 Acinum.

Our No. 2 bottle, the spicy, lively 2016 Il Buono from Le Albare, was a Valpolicella Classico. So was No. 4, the textbook sweet and bitter 2015 Secondo Marco and No. 6, the juicy 2013 Saseti from Monte Dall’Ora. And our No. 5 bottle, the smoky, spicy 2014 Marchesi Fumanelli, was a Valpolicella Classico Superiore, a category that must meet an aging requirement of at least one year.

What is the future of this easygoing wine? It’s hard to say. If you see any Valpolicellas on good Italian wine lists these days, they tend to be either Ripassos or very expensive wines from cult producers like Romano Dal Forno or Giuseppe Quintarelli. Wines like the bottles we tasted are rare in restaurants, though they are still on retail shelves.

The Valpolicella consortium acknowledges that Ripasso is the driving force in sales from this region of the Veneto. But trade association officials say they are taking steps to preserve what they call ordinary Valpolicella. By 2018, producers will be limited to making twice as much Ripasso as they make Amarone, and they will only be able to use Valpolicella Superiore wines. This, they hope, will ensure that some grapes are left over for Valpolicella as it has always been.

Recipe Pairing: Striped Bass with Fresh Figs

Without getting Proustian about this, there are dishes that persist. Late last fall, the main course at a pinot noir dinner at Bar Boulud, one of Daniel Boulud’s restaurants, was striped bass with fresh figs. A showstopper, the whole wild striped bass was swaddled in fresh fig leaves and stuffed with fresh black figs in a red-wine sauce. Not only was it unusual — I had never had fish with fresh figs before — but it was delectable. The brooding sauce bathed the velvet figs, and the earthy depth of the sauce made the already succulent fish a fine partner for some priceless bottles of red. For the Valpolicella pairing, I did not tackle a whole 10-pound fish, nor did I have the fig leaves. I winged it without a written recipe, and assembled a close copy that made an excellent match to those Valpolicellas. FLORENCE FABRICANT

Jurich met with members of the university’s board Wednesday morning but left after only five minutes. Pitino met with the trustees soon after Jurich. His meeting, too, was short; one reporter waiting outside noted that the driver of the vehicle that delivered Pitino did not turn off its engine while he was inside.

On Tuesday evening, Pitino denied any knowledge of, or responsibility for, the accusations detailed in the federal charges, saying in a statement: “These allegations come as a complete shock to me. If true, I agree with the U.S. Attorney’s Office that these third-party schemes, initiated by a few bad actors, operated to commit a fraud on the impacted universities and their basketball programs, including the University of Louisville.”

Pitino was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, recognition for a four-decade coaching career in college basketball and the N.B.A. With 770 wins over parts of 32 seasons, Pitino ranks 12th on the Division I career victories list — although that figure could change pending the appeal of the N.C.A.A. penalties announced in June. He is also the only college coach to win national titles with two different colleges, Kentucky and Louisville — although that distinction, too, could change if Louisville is forced to vacate its 2013 championship.

The reasons for the potential erasure of dozens of his wins at Louisville, and his second N.C.A.A. championship, are allegations, some of which Louisville has accepted, that a former basketball staff member who had played under Pitino hired prostitutes to entertain recruits and players in an on-campus dormitory.

While the N.C.A.A. has vacated victories and even Final Four appearances, it has never stripped a championship from the winner of its signature annual tournament.

While in that case the N.C.A.A. accepted Pitino’s explanation that he had no knowledge of the actions of the assistant found to be responsible, it nonetheless found that he had failed in his broader obligation to monitor his staff. Pitino and Louisville have disputed that conclusion, which led to his suspension, pending appeal, for the first five games of Atlantic Coast Conference play this season.

Tuesday’s federal charges, which also implicated the global marketing director for Adidas basketball, four assistant coaches at other Division I programs and several other men involved in college basketball, detailed a scheme to funnel money to two prospects in order to attend a university whose description matches Louisville, and of doing so with the knowledge of two unidentified coaches at the school. It was not clear whether the man the complaint calls Coach-2, who is characterized as having significant leverage at Adidas (which sponsors Louisville), is Pitino.

Born in New York City and raised on Long Island, Pitino never lost the thick accent he earned during a childhood in the region, and first made his name with an improbable Final Four run with Providence in 1987. His career also included less successful stints in the N.B.A., with the Knicks and the Boston Celtics.

Most notably, he revived the two beloved college programs in the Bluegrass State, first leading the University of Kentucky, starting in 1989, out of heavy N.C.A.A. sanctions and to three Final Fours, including the 1996 national title, and then leading the Cardinals to three Final Fours and another national title.

The fact that Pitino was not fired outright could be financial. Pitino, according to a USA Today database, is the nation’s highest paid college basketball coach, at more than $7.7 million a year, and his contract includes language that gives him 10 days to contest a firing for cause.

They unsuccessfully dabbled in side businesses, including a fashion label, but eventually found their film footing with releases like “Inglourious Basterds.”

Lately they have hit a dry spell. Although they have a fast-growing television division, the Weinsteins have not had a mainstream hit at the North American box office since 2013, when “Lee Daniels’ The Butler” took in $116.6 million.

So far this year, the Weinstein Company, a boutique studio that specializes in sophisticated, small-budget dramas like the 2011 Oscar winner “The King’s Speech,” has released six films, which have taken in a combined $123 million at the domestic box office. (The biggest hit has been “Wind River,” a well-reviewed murder mystery that has collected about $33 million.) Last year, the Weinsteins had seven films, with combined ticket sales of just $65 million.

To compare, major studios like Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Company generally take in $1 billion to $2.5 billion annually at the domestic box office.

The Weinstein Company has also found itself sidelined at film festivals, where Mr. Weinstein has long shopped for movies to release, helping to discover auteurs like Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh. For years at the Sundance Film Festival, for instance, his wallet was the only one that mattered to agents, who would track his team relentlessly. Netflix and Amazon dominate now.

At the same time, a new cluster of independent movie companies — some better financed and with more contemporary sensibilities — arrived on the scene. They include A24, which released the reigning Oscar winner for best picture, “Moonlight,” and Megan Ellison’s Annapurna Pictures, which has emerged as a favorite home for the kind of rebel filmmakers that Mr. Weinstein used to have to himself.

Ms. Ellison, whose films include “American Hustle” and “Zero Dark Thirty,” has been one of the few Hollywood executives willing to comment about the accusations against Mr. Weinstein. “Women face serious repercussions for sharing their experiences and deserve our full support,” she wrote on Twitter on Thursday, with a link to the Times report. “I admire the courage of these women.”

Mr. Weinstein acknowledged in a statement on Thursday that his behavior had “caused a lot of pain” and vowed to “do better.” On Friday, a lawyer advising him, Lisa Bloom, said in a television appearance that he had acted inappropriately and agreed with an interviewer who characterized Mr. Weinstein’s reported actions as illegal. And on Saturday, Ms. Bloom said that she had resigned as an adviser to Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Weinstein’s power in Hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the Academy Awards. He was at his height in the late 1990s, when he drove films like “Shakespeare in Love” to best-picture wins and huge ticket sales. Even in his more recent diminished state, he remained a player, prodding a tiny, largely subtitled art film, “Lion,” to six nominations this year. (The last time a Weinstein film was a force at the Oscars was in 2012, when “The Artist” collected five awards, including best picture.)

In this year’s Oscars cycle, the company’s big hopes are “Wind River” and “The Current War,” a period drama about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that is scheduled for a late November release. It received a tepid response at last month’s Toronto International Film Festival, but Mr. Weinstein has personally helped to re-edit the movie since then.

Several agents and producers said that, without Mr. Weinstein’s all-or-nothing campaigning style, those films would probably be stranded on the awards trail.

As the movie business has become more difficult, the Weinsteins have found success in television, especially the reality genre, with Heidi Klum’s “Project Runway.” That series runs on Lifetime, a division of A&E Networks, and has spawned several spinoffs.

Series in development include a crime drama for Amazon starring Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore and created by the director of “Silver Linings Playbook,” David O. Russell. The Weinstein Company is also working with Oliver Stone on a series for Showtime called “Guantánamo.” It has three major projects with the Viacom-owned Paramount Network, including “Yellowstone,” a drama starring Kevin Costner and written by Taylor Sheridan, the writer-director behind “Wind River.”

Amazon, Showtime, A&E and Paramount all declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein on Friday or did not respond to queries. Ms. Klum, Mr. Sheridan and other people involved with Weinstein Company films and shows responded similarly.

One prominent agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to draw his company into the controversy, said that he would advise female clients against withdrawing from Weinstein projects. He quickly added, however, that he would also tell them to ask for a contract saying that they would have zero contact with Harvey Weinstein.","Without Harvey Weinstein, Is There a Weinstein Company?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/media/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harrassment.html

The skaters, their coach and a North Korean skating official spoke frequently about the Olympics, said Bruno Marcotte, a prominent French Canadian coach who worked with the pair.

“All the time they would ask me: ‘Do you think we have a chance to qualify? Are we good enough? What do we need to qualify?’” Mr. Marcotte said of the pair, who aspire to become one of the world’s top 10 teams.

“They didn’t want to talk about politics,” said Mr. Marcotte, who is also here assisting the North Koreans. “It was all about sport and being the first ones in the Olympics and breaking barriers and doing their best.”

It is a widely held feeling among South Korean politicians and Olympic officials, as well as some international athletes, that the Games would be safer with North Korea’s participation, lessening security concerns and perhaps spurring slow ticket sales.

In that view, Kim Jong-un, the unpredictable North Korean leader, would be less likely to act provocatively if athletes from his country were competing in the Olympics, alongside those of China, North Korea’s benefactor.

“It’s kind of an insurance policy to have them there,” said Ted Ligety, a two-time gold medalist in Alpine skiing from the United States.

Of course, there is no way to predict what the political situation will be on the Korean Peninsula in four months, when the Olympics take place about 40 miles from the demilitarized zone that separates North and South.

And there is no guarantee that North Korea will participate. It is not a winter sports power and did not compete at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. It also boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the South Korean capital.

A general wariness seems to be encroaching on these Games. France has said its Olympic team will not travel to South Korea if its safety cannot be guaranteed.

Still, Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., has said there is “so far not even a hint” that security concerns related to North Korea threaten the Games. In any case, officials say it is too late to move the Olympics.

“There is no Plan B,” said Anita DeFrantz, a vice president of the I.O.C. from the United States.

Mr. Chang, the I.O.C. delegate from North Korea, has said its athletes will also attempt to qualify for the Games in short-track speedskating and Nordic skiing, which includes cross-country events. According to Reuters, North Korea has formally complained that international sanctions have interfered with its ability to purchase skiing equipment needed for training.

In April, North Korea sent its women’s hockey team to play in South Korea. In June, it sent a taekwondo team. That month, South Korea’s sports minister mentioned the possibility of fielding a combined hockey team in the Olympics and permitting North Korea to host an Alpine skiing event.

Those prospects seem unlikely now, South Korean Olympic and government officials said last week in New York.

“North Korea is my biggest worry,” Choi Moon-soon, the governor of Gangwon Province in South Korea, where the 2018 Olympics will take place, said in a recent interview. “It’s not because of North Korea making an impact on the Olympics, it’s that if North Korea can participate, then it will make a great contribution for our goal of hosting a Peace Olympics, and it will be a great selling point.”

If North Korea does compete, perhaps its most visible — and only — athletes will be Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim. They finished 15th at the 2017 world figure skating championships in March with a style influenced by classic Russian efficiency and precise placement of the arms and head.

Dressed in silver and black costumes at training on Wednesday, the pair skated to an instrumental version of the Beatles’ “A Day in the Life,” as performed by Jeff Beck, which will provide a musical backdrop for Thursday’s opening performance.

The issue can be culturally sensitive. At the world championships, the North Koreans ended a brief interview with The Associated Press when asked how they had chosen the Beatles’ music.

On Wednesday, Ms. Ryom and her partner, Mr. Kim, appeared smiling though slightly nervous during practice. (“Trying to be too much,” Mr. Marcotte said.) Still, they received polite applause from the four dozen or so people who watched them train at the Eissportzentrum in this Alpine village with bell cows in the pastures and snow dusting the highest peaks.

It is not uncommon for pairs skaters to have an artistically stressed relationship, and as Mr. Marcotte put it, a coach can sometimes be more of a marriage counselor. But the North Koreans remained unfailingly upbeat during their summer training, he said. And they even made kimchi, a staple dish, for a South Korean pair that he also trained.

“I think there is a will for friendship, a will for peace,” Mr. Marcotte said of the skaters. “They were so driven and so positive. I didn’t expect that. They were sponges. They wanted to learn so badly.”

Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim will be under enormous scrutiny and pressure this week to qualify for the Olympics. But they also appear confident, Mr. Marcotte said.

Ri Chol-un, an official with the North Korean figure skating association, said the pair might even speak to reporters on Friday after the pairs competition ends.

“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

He continued, “If they can’t keep you down by discrimination, then they have attempted to keep you down by terror, by instilling fear in you, in me.”

Identify your values before donating

When considering how to give, it’s helpful to start by asking what motivates you.

“You pick the issue with your heart and you pick the organization with your head,” said Jacob Harold, the chief executive of GuideStar, a nonprofit that publishes information about charities in an effort to promote transparency.

People with ties to a region may want to give locally. Animal lovers may want to give to a shelter. Others may want their money directed to certain groups of people, like children, or causes, like public health.

Many opt to leave the decision to the charities themselves, which is sometimes best: “If you’re trusting them with your money, you should trust them to spend it well,” Mr. Harold said.

Decide how to spend your time

Your time is a resource, too, and you should decide how you want to spend it.

Some people prefer to deeply research the charities they support, while others simply want to know they’re giving to a trustworthy group.

For those who prefer the latter, Mr. Harold recommends groups like Global Giving, which collects donations and redistributes the funds to vetted, locally focused organizations.

Do your research before you give

Evaluating a charity is often the most daunting part of donating, but it doesn’t have to be.

In addition to GuideStar and Charity Navigator, the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance and Charity Watch offer helpful resources.

Tax filings and other documents can shed light on a group’s operations, but donors should look beyond the numbers, too, experts said. That includes reviewing an organization’s website, annual report, governing board and mission.

“If the organization is only talking about the problem, but not talking about how the work they do leads to solutions to that problem, that is a red flag,” Mr. Harold said.

Ask questions about the charity, including how much experience it has in disaster relief, how long it’s been around, how it measures accomplishments, and how others in the field talk about it.

He also said that too much focus is often placed on overhead, a measure of administrative and fund-raising costs. While it can signal inefficient spending or, worse, fraud, some overhead is necessary to support a nonprofit’s long-term viability.

Cash is often the best way to help

It may feel impersonal, but money is often the most useful form of donation. Unlike goods, financial gifts have no associated transportation costs.

A $20 pair of jeans, for example, would cost about $165 to ship from Washington, D.C., to the capital of Honduras, according to an online calculator developed by the University of Rhode Island. That money could instead be used locally to buy 24 blankets, nearly 33,000 liters of water or a variety of other supplies, according to the calculator.

There are secondary benefits, too: With cash, relief organizations can support local economies, according to the Center for International Disaster Information, which was created by the United States Agency for International Development.

Follow up later. Recovery takes a long time.

Donations surge in the immediate aftermath of disasters, but recoveries unfold over a much longer timeline.

For that reason, donors should consider sustained involvement with charities, whether that involves checking up on how resources were spent and how needs have changed weeks or months down the line or making automatic monthly contributions.

“In my day, it cost an average of $1 million to train a special forces soldier.","But in a stunning operation that began late on July 3, 1976, Israeli commandos swooped in. They killed the hijackers and dozens of Ugandan soldiers, gathered the hostages and flew them to safety. The raid was carried out with near perfection, though it cost the lives of four hostages and of the commando leader, Lt. Col. Yonatan Netanyahu, the older brother of the current Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

A new era in counterterrorism had dawned. Joshua Shani, a retired Israeli brigadier general, was there, having flown the first C-130 Hercules cargo plane to land at Entebbe. He told Retro Report: “It was like the whole world say, ‘Wow, they have chutzpah, these guys. They are damn good.’”

They were so good that the United States tried something similar in April 1980 to end a hostage crisis in Iran that traumatized this country. Fifty-two United States diplomats and other citizens had been taken captive five months earlier under a new Iranian theocracy hostile to America. From the get-go, this rescue mission, code-named Eagle Claw, would not be an easy assignment for a Delta Force commando unit still in its infancy. “The only difference between this and the Alamo is Davy Crockett didn’t have to fight his way in,” said Mr. Ishimoto, who was an intelligence officer on the Delta Force raid.

Almost everything that could have gone wrong did. Two American helicopters were disabled by severe dust storms over Iran. Separately, a third one broke down. Still another crashed into a tanker aircraft; eight servicemen were killed. It was a disaster that left America humiliated — and left the hostages stuck for nine more months.

But failure can be a powerful teacher. Eagle Claw was. What emerged within a few years was a well-trained, disciplined force of special operators groomed for counterterrorism, hostage rescue and other demanding missions. The force today is perhaps 10 times as big as it was in 1980, when its numbers, Mr. Ishimoto said, were between 6,000 and 8,000. As for successes, one need look no further than the 2011 SEALs raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed.

With Americans weary of war without end since Sept. 11, 2001, President Obama withdrew most conventional soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. At the same time, he turned the Joint Special Operations Command into a dray horse. Its members are just about everywhere: Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, Pakistan, you name it. Their impact can be deadly. But their footprint is lighter, and less costly, than that of a fully decked-out Army operation.

This commando force plainly appeals to Mr. Trump, who has shown scant faith in “soft power,” the use of diplomacy and humanitarian example to win friends and influence nations. His budget proposals have included many billions more for the Defense Department and billions less for the State Department and the Agency for International Development. In his first half-year in office, military special operators were sent on about five times as many lethal missions in what for the United States are non-battlefield countries — Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia — as there had been during Mr. Obama’s final six months.

Relying on them so heavily has a price. Though they make up roughly 5 percent of the total armed forces, they have accounted for at least half of the nation’s combat deaths since 2015. The risks were evident mere days into the Trump presidency when a member of the SEALs was killed on a flawed night mission in Yemen that also left more than a dozen civilians dead.

It’s easy to romanticize commandos. Just ask any Hollywood director. But they are not supermen. Even Israeli forces have lost their post-Entebbe glow, with blemished missions in Lebanon and Gaza that led to their own men and innocent civilians being killed.

Some military experts worry that even though the American teams also have chutzpah and are damn good, they are being asked to do too much too often. “These guys truly are amazing warriors,” Russell D. Howard, a retired brigadier general who was a special forces commander, told The Cipher Brief, a website focused on security issues. “But they’re more than that. They’re smart, flexible, adaptable and unafraid.” The problem, General Howard said, is that “the guys are still deployed all the time.”

“These guys are a national treasure,” he said. “In my day, it cost an average of $1 million to train a special forces soldier. Now it probably costs closer to $1.5 million, and you don’t waste that asset. You use them judiciously when you really need them.”",Special Ops Forces: How Elite Forces Became Military Muscle,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/special-ops-retro.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Ms. Rigau was among three senior Catalan government officials who were recently found guilty of civil disobedience for helping coordinate the nonbinding vote on Catalan independence in 2014.","Those elections presented big tests of the bloc’s cohesion. The dispute over Catalonia instead presents a test of the cohesion of a member state itself. And it points to ominous storm clouds in other independent-minded regions, from Scotland to northern Italy.

Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, has long been an uneasy part of Spain, and aspirations for independence have surged and ebbed for generations. But Catalonia is also Spain’s economic engine, and Madrid is determined to hold onto it. The tug of war is now entering perhaps its most intense and unpredictable phase since the approach of the Spanish Civil War last century.

In 2014, the last time Catalonia held an independence vote, it, too, was declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court. But Catalan officials described that vote as a straw ballot, and the government in Madrid and the police did not prevent it.

This time, sensing the growing seriousness of the Catalan referendum, which the regional government says will now be binding, Madrid is taking a far more aggressive tack.

The approach has left many Catalans bridling under what they say is a heavy hand by the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The steps to intimidate people who back a vote not only may backfire, they argue, but also threaten to transform the conflict into a broad campaign of civil disobedience that could spiral out of control.

Tensions on the streets have mounted, along with political recriminations. While the separatists charge that Mr. Rajoy is taking Spain back to the dark days of Franco, Madrid warns that the separatists have shifted from violating Spanish law to encouraging civil strife.

In the interview, Mr. Puigdemont said the conflict would not turn violent, but he warned that Madrid would have to assume its share of the blame if things got further out of hand. “If you stop somebody from unfolding a banner that asks for more democracy, the problem is with the person who forces its withdrawal,” he said.

Even President Trump has weighed in, declaring that he supports a unified Spain after a meeting in Washington with the Prime Minister Rajoy. Mr. Trump took no position on whether the referendum should be held.

The swirl of competing pressures is perhaps nowhere greater than at the local level, among city and small-town mayors who must decide whether to host the voting.

On Monday, Joan Rabasseda, the mayor of Arenys de Munt, headed for a courthouse rather than his town hall because of his decision to ignore Spain’s government and constitutional court and help his residents vote. Mr. Rabasseda could be suspended from office if found guilty of civil disobedience — along with about 750 of the almost 950 mayors of Catalonia who have vowed to facilitate the referendum.

“Spain’s judiciary can go after me, but that’s only helping unite my town even more and increasing everybody’s determination to vote,” Mr. Rabasseda said defiantly.

Catalan officials who do not favor independence say that they, too, are facing intimidation — but from an increasingly aggressive pro-independence movement that wants them to go through with a vote declared illegal by Madrid.

With the referendum just days away, taking a side has become inescapable. In many ways, for Catalonia’s officialdom, it’s a case of be damned if you do and damned if you don’t.

“This conflict is forcing elected officials to walk into a cul-de-sac and then deal with very difficult consequences,” said Irene Rigau, a Catalan politician. “Whatever you do, you will be punished either by your citizenship or by the state.”

Separatist mayors must endorse the referendum, she said, because otherwise “nobody will vote for you again.”

“But if you stick to your promise,” she said, “the state could then never allow you to be a politician again.”

Ms. Rigau was among three senior Catalan government officials who were recently found guilty of civil disobedience for helping coordinate the nonbinding vote on Catalan independence in 2014.

This time, Spain’s judiciary is promising to punish anybody involved in organizing Sunday’s referendum. But for mayors like Mr. Rabasseda, the choice to go ahead with the ballot was simple, if potentially disastrous for him.

His was the first town in Catalonia to hold an independence straw ballot in 2009, at a time when secessionism had far less supporters than it now has. On Monday, a group of about 100 residents escorted their mayor to the courthouse in the nearby city of Mataró and sang the Catalan hymn as he entered the building. When he emerged, they repeatedly shouted, “We will vote!” and “Independence!”

A smaller number of mayors are complaining about suffering harassment and insults for refusing to turn their town hall buildings into polling stations. Their decision is forcing Catalonia’s separatist government to find alternative venues for a referendum whose logistics have already been seriously complicated by the Spanish police, who are seizing ballot papers and other election-related equipment.

While Mr. Rabasseda was in court, Josep Monràs, the mayor of the town of Mollet del Vallès, was filing a police complaint after a group of about 100 separatists surrounded his home last weekend and shouted insults. The protesters used a megaphone and also plastered secessionist posters on his house, Mr. Monràs said in a telephone interview.

He argued that Catalonia “isn’t viable as an independent state,” but that his opposition to the vote was in any case entirely justified by his duties as a Spanish mayor. “Every mayor takes office with a promise that includes respecting the Constitution,” he said.

Mr. Monràs, who has been mayor since 2004, said he had never before received such insults on his doorstep, including people calling him a fascist.

“There have always been people who defend different ideas using legitimate means, but there are now some who use instead coercion and insults,” he said. “It’s outrageous.”

Sunday’s referendum has widespread support in the smaller towns and villages of the Catalan hinterland like Arenys de Munt.

Photo

There, the owner of one fish distribution company had plastered a banner showing Josep Lluís Trapero, the head of the autonomous Catalan police force, who has become an icon of the region’s assertion of an independent identity since last month’s terrorist attacks in Barcelona, the region’s capital.

After a foreign journalist left a news briefing, frustrated that it was being held partly in Catalan, Mr. Trapero commented, “Well, very good, well, farewell.” His words have since been turned into a slogan by separatists who want to say the same to Spain.

But support for independence is far more limited in places like L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, the second-largest city in Catalonia, whose mayor, Núria Marín, has been leading the call for mayors not to be intimidated into hosting the referendum.

“I was elected to manage a city, not to provide ballot boxes,” she said in an interview. “Telling me that I should help people vote is a political and not a legal argument — and in this case it’s clearly not one that carries a lot of weight if made before a judge.”

Spain’s attorney general has warned Catalonia’s political leaders that they could be arrested at any time and face criminal charges for misusing public money to finance an illegal referendum.

The separatists, however, have lashed out at Madrid’s efforts to prosecute mayors and eventually, perhaps, thousands of other officials involved in their referendum. They say Mr. Rajoy is returning authoritarianism to Spain.

Mr. Rabasseda, the mayor of Arenys de Munt, said that Madrid’s clampdown has been disproportionate. He was prepared for a court battle, but acknowledged that his legal problems were worrying others, starting with his 86-year-old mother.

“She’s really upset and concerned,” he said. “For her, it’s a bit like returning to the past and the loss of all political freedom.”",Catalan Officials Are Squeezed as Madrid Tries to Stop Independence Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/europe/catalonia-spain-referendum.html

After the rocket strikes, Afghan helicopters circled the capital’s diplomatic quarters and the airport for hours. Gen. Salem Almas, the head of criminal investigations for the Kabul police, said Afghan forces had started an operation in the area where the rockets were fired.

He did not provide details on the number of rockets, which were most likely rocket-propelled grenades, but officials at the airport said that many had landed, and that assailants had entered a house behind the airport.

The operation to clear the house lasted about six hours. Najib Danish, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said all of the three attackers in the house were killed.

Mr. Danish said one civilian had also been killed and 11 wounded. Two houses were damaged in the attack on the airport and during government’s response, he said.

American helicopter gunships operating in support of the Afghan special forces caused several civilian casualties when “one of the missiles malfunctioned,” the United States military command said in a statement. It was not clear precisely what the errant missile had struck.

A senior Afghan security official said the assailants had stockpiled so much heavy weaponry in the house behind the airport that a standard clearance operation was impossible and helicopters targeted the area.

One Western official said the insurgent rockets had ignited part of an American weapons depot at a military camp, causing secondary explosions. The airport remained closed to domestic and international flights for much of the day, resuming flights on Wednesday night.

Some officials said Afghan and American aircraft parked at the airport may have been hit. Jalaluddin Ibrahimkhel, a spokesman for the Afghan Air Force, denied this. “The rockets landed in the military and civil parts of the Kabul airport, but it did not damage the runway or any aircraft,” he said.

Capt. Bill Salvin of the United States Navy, a spokesman for the military, also denied reports of aircraft damage and said “nothing in the schedule of the visit changed because of the attack.”

At the time the rockets struck, Mr. Mattis was meeting with Mr. Ghani and Mr. Stoltenberg. Mr. Mattis, who arrived from India, emphasized that President Trump’s new strategy for Afghanistan was an “inclusive” effort to bring stability to South Asia.

The strategy has caused a particularly harsh reaction in Pakistan, which Afghan and American officials contend has long been a safe haven for the Taliban leadership. Mr. Mattis said that the Trump administration would work with Pakistan, but that it would also “watch Pakistan’s choices.”

Mr. Mattis did not provide details on how many more American troops would be arriving in Afghanistan, saying he did not want to share details that could help the enemy. But the lack of transparency has raised concerns, particularly since it was revealed that the United States already had thousands more troops in Afghanistan than officials had declared.

Mr. Ghani emphasized that American and NATO troops stationed in the country would not be “returning to a combat role,” but would be assisting, training, and advising the Afghan forces who are leading the fight.

“We will not abandon you to a merciless enemy trying to kills its way to power,” Mr. Mattis said, emphasizing the American position that a negotiated settlement was the only way out of the 16-year-old war.

The rival claims of responsibility for the rocket assault by both the Taliban and Islamic State pointed to the confusing landscape of the Afghan insurgency. Although the groups have fought territorial battles, American and Afghan officials have expressed concern about their convergence in certain areas.

The officials have been particularly concerned about an overlap in the enabling networks for major attacks planned by the Islamic State branch operating in Afghanistan and the Haqqani Network, an arm of the Taliban.

Angel Lazaro, 29, was hanging out with his friends (who call him Mayito) at Bar Roma , on the rooftop of a 1920s building in Old Havana. Mr. Lazaro hadn’t ended up at the bar from seeing it on the street. There was no sign outside indicating that a ride up in a rickety open-air elevator would lead him to one of the city’s most interesting watering holes.

Inside, the scene consists of creative types mingling with tourists over mojitos and rum cocktails. “To me, that was an indicator that Cuba was changing,” said Rose Cromwell, a photographer who has traveled to Cuba for over 12 years.

When Ms. Cromwell visited the bar, there was no bathroom. The residents living down the hall opened their homes to patrons for a small tip, a transaction in keeping with part of Cuba’s economy; many people run bed-and-breakfasts, restaurants and even clandestine clothing shops out of their houses.

In a country where clothing options are limited by a lack of imports, cultivating a singular style can be challenging. “People will bring clothes in bundles from Miami, Panama or Mexico and sell them up from their homes,” Ms. Cromwell said.

And when there is a particular trend, “you see it everywhere, it’s like wildflower,” Ms. Cromwell said. A few years back, she recalled, everyone was wearing the British flag: “It was just what they had made in China and had been manufactured on a large scale.”

Mr. Lazaro describes his style as “funk” and has tried to not follow these trends. He is one of the many Cubans who go to lengths such as making their own clothes, having relatives bring pieces from abroad or scouring local vintage spots.

Here, Yairis, 19, is dressed in the traditional style of someone who has been “sainted” in Santeria, an Afro-Cuban religion with origins in the Caribbean. Part of the rite of passage is to wear all white for an entire year, which represents the process of rebirth and purification.

Alexis, 24, is a street vendor who sells odds and ends from a table in Old Havana. His sunglasses, fitted clothing, gold chains and fade haircut identify him as someone who listens to reggaeton, or “reggaetoneros,” as they are called in Cuba. “Men pay attention to detail in their grooming, from their beards or mustaches to their eyebrows and their haircuts,” Ms. Cromwell said. “You definitely see a high level of self-care, and barbershops are ubiquitous in Cuba.”

Some of those barbershops are in homes, like the one Roberto Alvarez, above, runs out of a rented space. Mr. Alvarez isn’t into trends and prefers to alter his own clothing; the vest he is wearing is made from a women’s jacket that he cut up. When he isn’t shaping men up, he is a rapper and goes by the stage name Robe L Ninho.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’m going to do something a bit different today. I’ve spilled a few clues, but I want you to get through the puzzle yourself, mostly so you will appreciate the rest of the column. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to develop my Lewis Black impression, and this is it.

Sometimes, when I’m feeling like I haven’t yet had enough pain and humiliation in my life, I take a Zumba class. No, don’t write me letters about how I’m doing it wrong and if I would just relax I’d learn to enjoy it. No one on the entire planet has ever convinced another human being to do anything that way, especially when it comes to tripping over their own two feet. I’ve accepted my fate when it comes to Zumba.

At other times, I solve puzzles by Byron Walden. It has largely the same effect as the Zumba, minus the muscle pain. Mr. Walden, who is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, quietly takes his aggressions out by writing the kind of clues that make many solvers, myself included, feel a lot like this dog:

That’s called misdirection. Misdirection is when you look at a clue like 20D’s “One who tries to avoid being touched” and your brain starts to run through the names of disorders where people don’t like being touched because that’s got to be what the constructor is thinking, right, and then the answer winds up being an odd word like EPEEIST. (A “touch” is when your fencing opponent scores against you.)

It’s when you see a clue like “Fabulous speaker?” and think O.K., maybe it’s AESOP, because you’ve been trained, I mean trained, to think AESOP’s fables whenever you see the word “fabulous” in a clue, but the answer turns out to be LIAR. And he’s not wrong. Someone who tells tales is a LIAR.

His mosaic of tattoos included portraits of Tupac Shakur, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr. and Mike Tyson (shown chomping on Evander Holyfield’s ear).

“It’s not like I’d bite someone’s ear off to win,” he said, then reconsidered.“But I really would. ‘Oh, I’m about to lose this fight?’” He bared his teeth and made gnawing noises. He plans on adding a tattoo of Allen Iverson stepping over Tyronn Lue.

Once at Nike SoHo, Mr. Beckham was ushered through a back entrance, into an elevator and up to an impromptu greenroom. Photographers snapped away as he personalized a Giants jersey on an e-tablet with the assistance of Eric Elms, a Brooklyn-based artist. “I should have made this small for my mama,” Mr. Beckham said of a digital mock-up that read “Savage” on the back.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said Ms. Yingluck was in Dubai, where her elder brother Thaksin Shinawatra, another former prime minister, has a home. Her lawyers have said they do not know where she is; one recently said he had not heard from her since she fled the country.

Ms. Yingluck became Thailand’s first female prime minister in 2011, having had no prior experience in politics. She was widely considered a proxy for Mr. Thaksin, a controversial but popular former telecommunications tycoon who served as prime minister for five years before he was ousted in a coup in 2006. Mr. Thaksin was later convicted in absentia on conflict of interest charges, after having fled the country himself.

Since 2001, every nationwide election in Thailand has resulted in victories for Mr. Thaksin or political forces loyal to him. But judicial actions and a pair of army coups have unseated each of these governments.

Mr. Thaksin’s sister was removed from office in May 2014, after the Constitutional Court found her guilty of abuse of power. The same month, the army orchestrated its latest coup, one of a dozen successful putsches carried out since Thailand abandoned absolute monarchy in 1932.

Thailand’s politics are cleaved, roughly, between the rural poor, who have supported the populist policies of politicians aligned with Mr. Thaksin’s family, and a traditional ruling class that has dismissed the Shinawatra clan as corrupt, power-hungry and dangerously divisive.

A security crackdown on street protests by Mr. Thaksin’s supporters in 2010 resulted in more than 90 deaths in downtown Bangkok.

Since then, Thailand has experienced periods of martial law, and its economic growth has trailed that of other Southeast Asian nations. The country’s current Constitution, drafted under the oversight of a junta that calls itself the National Council for Peace and Order, curtails democratic institutions. It stipulates that the upper house of Thailand’s Parliament, for instance, is appointed, rather than elected.

The junta, led by Mr. Prayuth, has promised elections next year. But with Ms. Yingluck and her brother in self-imposed exile, and many in the top echelons of Pheu Thai sidelined by various legal rulings, it is unclear how effectively the party’s supporters will be able to campaign.

Last month, a former commerce minister who served in Ms. Yingluck’s cabinet was sentenced to 42 years in prison in connection with the rice program.

At the courthouse on Wednesday, some of Ms. Yingluck’s supporters sounded philosophical about both the verdict and the exile of the Shinawatra siblings.

“Maybe it is good that they both aren’t here, because now the other side can stop saying we are Shinawatra slaves,” said Rungrawee Chaloenpol, a market vendor, breaking down in tears. “Now we can fight for true democracy without having the Shinawatra name attached to us.”","Yingluck Shinawatra, Ex-Leader Who Fled Thailand, Gets 5-Year Sentence",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/asia/thailand-yingluck-sentence.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“You will lose coverage,” our waitress told us later that night in the hotel’s restaurant when we described our plans.","Painting didn’t pay the bills, and so she ran a boardinghouse where her tenants ranged from “inanimate, mincing ninnies” to “door slammers.” The house, which is on Simcoe Street, is around the corner from the Emily Carr House, with its small rooms crammed with books, prints, old china, furniture and, in high season, Emily Carr fans.

In cooler months, the house is closed, but do walk by; in the yard, you might glimpse the “Elephant,” the trailer-like caravan that Carr acquired in 1933 for sketching trips.

But inspiration was also nearer at hand: Beacon Hill Park, the subject of many Carr paintings. Western red cedars, Douglas firs, ponds, peacocks, frothy fountains and stone bridges (one is named for Carr): It is an enchanting park, and, occasionally, a place of high drama. As we strolled, a terrible screeching arose. It was nesting season, and dozens of great blue herons burst from the mid-reaches of some tall trees. The reason for their frenzy: a bald eagle circling overhead patiently, menacingly. It was a drama that showed no signs of abating by the time we left.

Photo

When Emily was a teenager, her mother died, and she became mysteriously distant from her father. Though she would remain close to her older sisters and had a few friends, loneliness remained a constant theme in her journals; marriage and a life of afternoon tea at the Empress seemed unlikely and undesirable. She once compared herself to “a lone old tree.”

But she also took pleasure in solitude, writing stories deep into the night, and sketching during the day. Though her work received praise, she trusted none of it. Success for her was a complex, spiritual matter; the business of melding art and godliness was an unending quest.

And, of course, she had her animals for company: a Javanese monkey who got into all sorts of trouble, multiple dogs and a white rat.

Photo

And then there was the forest. “I sought my companionship out in the woods and trees rather than persons,” she wrote. “It was as if they had hit and hurt me … so that I went howling back like a smacked child to Mother Nature.”

And so, with the aid of the Elephant, she began producing some of her best work as she entered her 60s. “Nothing ever, ever stands still,” she wrote, “and we never, never catch up.”

It doesn’t take long to find wilderness on Vancouver Island. On yet another overcast afternoon, we pulled into a parking lot about 10 miles outside Victoria, and walked down a wide trail. This was Goldstream Provincial Park, more than 900 acres of Douglas fir, cedar, hemlock and other trees; through it all runs a river where salmon spawn each fall.

Photo

Emily Carr loved to anthropomorphize; after reading about brown-eyed lilies and screaming trees, it was easy to imagine that the giant fern fronds on the trail weren’t just brushing against our legs, but reaching out beseechingly, or at least curiously, trying to get as much a visceral sense of us as we were of them.

In 1933, Emily had the Elephant towed to the Goldstream River flats, and there she settled down for a lengthy visit. It wasn’t her first. A few years earlier she had been there, producing sketches in which, say, a cedar branch was not a static thing, but a moving wave of foliage. (One of her most famous works, “Red Cedar,” illustrates this effort.)

No doubt she expected to experience the same productivity two years later, but a parade of parkgoers wasn’t helping. “They started early this morning — the Public,” she wrote. “The air is riled up with motor snorts, dog parks and children’s screechings.” Add to that the antics of Woo, her monkey — who consumed her green paint and had to be treated with Epsom salts — and the rain and the darkness. “I am not afraid, but it’s creepy,” she wrote, before leaving.

Photo

To us, nothing seemed creepy, and there were few people. We arrived at the visitor’s center, which smelled of damp, fragrant wood. Everything inside, it seemed, had been made either by or for visiting school children: Nature paintings hung on the walls, and exhibits — most of them handmade — focused on things like bald eagle counts and the salmon life cycle. Outside, a deck overlooked the river; in the distance, three eagles soared above the trees.

A volunteer with a lined, sunny face expressed enthusiasm for our driving trip to the island’s western side — a trip I was nervous about after reading online warnings about the dangers of washed-out roads, aggressive logging-truck drivers and frequent rain. She brushed it all aside. “Nothing but ocean till you get to Japan!” she said of the views from the wild western coast, then gave us directions to a nearby waterfall, advising us to ignore the high safer path, and to walk instead along the dry riverbed. It was a precarious walk on slippery stones, and rain was beginning to fall, but finally, the waterfall appeared. I saw my friend far ahead of me, her jacket a tiny red smudge below the trees and the falls. Everything here was big.

We drove on, toward Albert Head Lagoon, located in a populated area where the prospects of transformative beauty weren’t promising. As it turns out, Albert Head, its beach edged with trees and strewn with driftwood, is an understated arc of paradise on this developed shore. Here and nearby, Carr found fodder for luminous sky and sea paintings such as “Strait of Juan de Fuca” and “Lagoon at Albert Head,” in which she unleashed an incredible range of colors.

Photo

Our goal was to reach the artsy resort town of Sooke before night fell, but we decided to backtrack in hopes of finding Esquimalt Lagoon. On the way, we stumbled upon the Royal Roads Forest, a hauntingly beautiful woodland where some of the largest Douglas firs on the island are found. We wandered in the cool, dark forest, forgetting about our schedule.

The lagoon itself is a fragile place, a bird sanctuary protected by a wisp of land. Carr, seduced by the “wide sweeps of sea and sky,” arrived here on a beautiful spring day in 1934. Her caravan was deposited on a field of daisies. “Woo rolls among the daisies with her four hands in the air,” she wrote happily. But that night, an epic storm rolled in: “Everything inside blew out and outside things blew in till in and out were all mixed up.” Soon enough, the caravan was hauled to higher ground on a farmer’s field.

A few years later she would return to this area off the coast, and find inspiration in something that was basically ugly: gravel pits. Paintings called “Above the Gravel Pit,” show scenes of denuded land and tree stumps, all beneath a brilliant, rippled sky. There would be more paintings of bare landscapes, some with spindly second- or third-growth trees struggling upward beneath a blue sky.

Photo

In this period, Maria Tippett writes in her biography, Carr approached the sketching or painting process ritualistically: Sitting on her camp stool, she might light a cigarette, sing a hymn, then “raise her gaze slightly above and just beyond her subject, so that it was out of focus. Then, with her sketching-board on her lap and brush or charcoal in her hand, she would strike out with her arm and wrist and with curved or slashing motions make great sweeping strokes.…”

Michelle Jacques, the chief curator at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria said that the environmentally themed exhibition, “Picturing the Giants: The Changing Landscapes of Emily Carr” — which includes Carr’s two gravel pit paintings — is based on “the hypothesis that Carr was thinking about logging and environmental issues in a real way.” In British Columbia, Ms. Jacques noted, there are currently many concerns: debates over an oil pipeline and increased shipping, salmon farming, land and resource rights for indigenous groups and, of course, protection of forests.

“There’s a torn and splintered ridge across the stumps I call the ‘screamers,’ Carr wrote. “These are the unsawn last bits, the cry of the tree’s heart, wrenching and tearing apart just before she gives that sway and the dreadful groan of falling, that dreadful pause while her executioners step back with their saws and axes resting and watch.”

Photo

Later on our trip, those words would resonate.

We arrived in Sooke an hour before sunset, too late to explore Sooke Hills, which Emily had visited. We stayed at a rambling hotel on the wedding circuit with wide porches overlooking the water. On a Monday, it was nearly empty. By the water four harbor seals bobbed and rolled between moored boats. The clouds had dispersed, revealing a Prussian blue sky and the glimmer of stars. Here, in an area where the weather is notoriously moody, the clear skies that had evaded us in the supposedly milder Victoria area, would, with luck, greet us in the morning.

“You will lose coverage,” our waitress told us later that night in the hotel’s restaurant when we described our plans. She was referring to cellphone service on the farther reaches of the Pacific Marine Circle route. “But you will see animals, guaranteed. I saw elk and eagles and bears last time.” She told us that she had been born on the island, moved to Toronto, and not relishing the pace, returned. “I live over there,” she said, pointing at the dark hills across the water. “Sometimes I kayak to work.”

I thought of Carr, who had generally been eager to return home from her travels. In her journal, she recounts an exchange with a Vancouver art promoter: “‘It’s a shame to think of you stuck out here in this corner of the world unnoticed and unknown,’ says he. ‘It’s exactly where I want to be,’ says I.”","Vancouver Island, Through an Artist’s Eyes",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/travel/vancouver-victoria-emily-carr.html

For many Saudi women, gaining the right to drive is not the end of the struggle.","Built on an alliance between a royal family and the descendants of an ultraconservative Muslim cleric, Saudi Arabia has struggled throughout its history with how to reconcile modernization with loyalty to religious heritage.

That debate heated up as oil wealth enriched the state, bringing in unfamiliar customs and technologies like television, public education and automobiles.

Over time, competing camps dug in around women and the right to drive.

For liberals, the driving ban was a blot on the national brand that was hampering modernization and weakening the economy.

Conservatives, including powerful clerics employed by the state, thought that allowing women to drive would be a crack in the dam that would allow secularism to flood in, washing away the kingdom’s unique Islamic identity.

The royal decree announced on Tuesday handed victory in that battle to the reformers, who had gained an advantage in recent years because of demographics, economics and the country’s young leadership, analysts said.

Saudi leaders, who have been criticized for the war in Yemen, the blockade of Qatar and a range of human rights issues, clearly hoped the step would help the kingdom’s reputation.

“There is no wrong time to do the right thing,” Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to Washington and a son of King Salman, told reporters after the change was announced.

The government also worked behind the scenes to control the message.

At least eight prominent women’s activists received calls and text messages from Saudi security officials warning them not to tweet or speak to the news media about the issue, according to three Saudi activists.

They presumed the government did not want to give credit to activists for prompting the change and spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize the women — or themselves.

Many women cheered the decision, calling it a final victory in a long campaign for social change.

Manal al-Sherif, who was jailed for having posted videos of herself driving and who wrote a book about her activism, said her life had tracked the wider social changes in the kingdom.

Born into a poor conservative family in Mecca, Ms. Sherif, now 38, was taught that women were to remain at home and that good Muslims were to avoid “infidels” who did not share their faith, she said by phone from Australia, where she now lives.

Her worldview changed when as a university student in the Red Sea port city of Jidda, she saw women who did not cover their faces in public and even had boyfriends, though covertly.

Then she got a job with the state oil company, Saudi Aramco. On its sprawling compound women enjoy greater freedoms than elsewhere in the kingdom, including the ability to drive.

She said that the status of women in Saudi Arabia had been used by the government over the years to placate conservatives.

“Our rights as women were always used in a political game, and that is what we wanted to stop,” she said. “That really kept the country behind.”

She credited King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, another of the king’s sons, with making the decisions necessary for the kingdom to advance.

“The government took the right decision,” she said. “Finally, they had the guts to say, ‘We were wrong.’”

It was difficult to immediately gauge reactions to the rescinded ban among more conservative Saudis. The government recently arrested more than two dozen people, including prominent clerics, some of whom had criticized government policies.

Three clerics employed by the government declined to comment when asked for their thoughts on the rescinded ban.

“Hahahahahahaha,” one responded on Whats App, offering no further comment.

Social media provided a glimpse.

By midafternoon on Wednesday, the Arabic hashtag “The people reject women driving” had appeared on 335,000 tweets, while the hashtag “The king is victorious for women driving” had appeared in only 33,700 tweets, according to Twitter.

But many users used the hashtags to join discussions, even if they disagreed with their message.

Even longtime campaigners said they expected some resistance.

“We’re a religious country,” said Fawziah Al-Bakr, a professor who has been campaigning for the right to drive for nearly three decades.

But religion had nothing to do with the issue, she said, noting that women in other predominately Muslim countries like Egypt, Sudan and Pakistan have been driving for a long time.

“All these women are Muslim and yet they are driving,” she said. “Not being able to drive has nothing to do with Islam.”

Previous reforms have been met with great resistance in the kingdom. Conservatives campaigned against the introduction of television, fearing it would fill Saudi homes with un-Islamic images.

Now many Saudi clerics have their own shows and are enthusiastic users of social media.

They also tried to prevent girls’ education.

Now many of their daughters are studying in Saudi universities, and even in the United States.

For many Saudi women, gaining the right to drive is not the end of the struggle. Many hope the government’s next step will be to lift its so-called “guardianship laws,” which require women to have the permission of a male “guardian” in order to get a passport, travel abroad or undergo certain medical procedures.

That could take time, but Ms. AbuSulayman, the television presenter, said the trajectory was clear.

About two thirds of the kingdom’s 22 million citizens are under 30 and they will grow up seeing women differently than their elders, she said. Many will not remember when women could not drive.

The busy hurricane season of 2017 has given fresh purpose to a president who, until now, made most of his own weather inside the West Wing. On Tuesday, he said he would visit Puerto Rico and the storm-ravaged Virgin Islands next week. The White House issued photos of a grave-looking Mr. Trump being briefed in the Situation Room.

But the hurricanes are yet another reminder of this president’s rare capacity for self-congratulation — a trait that seems particularly ill-suited to the aftermath of deadly disasters, when the plight of people who lost homes or even family members would seem to take precedence over testimonials to FEMA.

From the start, Mr. Trump has had trouble separating himself from the story. On his first visit to Texas after Hurricane Harvey swamped Houston, the president went to a firehouse in Corpus Christi, nearly 220 miles away, for a briefing with federal, state and local officials that stopped just short of being a pep rally. “We’ll congratulate each other when it’s all finished,” he told the group.

Outside, he greeted a crowd of about 1,000 who had gathered by saying, “What a crowd! What a turnout!”

Four days later, Mr. Trump returned to the state — this time, to meet actual victims of the storm. He handed out cardboard boxes with hot dogs and potato chips to residents in Houston, and talked about the love he had seen in the NRG Center, a convention center converted into a shelter for nearly 1,200 people. But he could not resist a victory lap.

“They’re really happy with what’s going on,” he told reporters traveling with him. “It’s something that’s been very well received. Even by you guys, it’s been very well received.”

In Florida, after Hurricane Irma roared up the Gulf Coast, Mr. Trump seemed more at ease in his role as a consoler. At a ruined mobile home park in Naples, he handed out encouragement along with hoagies. But when one man yelled, “Where was Obama during the last hurricane? On a golf course,” Mr. Trump stopped and asked whether he had voted for him.

“Best vote of your life?” the president said, with a grin.

Puerto Rico, unlike Texas and Florida, is not Trump country. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida trounced him in the Republican primary there in March 2016. And Mr. Trump has been noticeably less vocal about the damage from Hurricane Maria. Over the weekend, as Puerto Ricans ran perilously low on food, water and fuel, he posted nothing about the crisis.

Yet he posted 17 tweets about sports — from the dispute he single-handedly revived over the N.F.L. and the national anthem to his withdrawal of an invitation for Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors to visit the White House. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump denied that he had neglected Puerto Rico in favor of his feud with professional athletes.

“I’ve heard that before: ‘Was I preoccupied?’” he said. “Not at all, not at all. I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work.”

Some residents of the Virgin Islands, parts of which were leveled by Irma, feel similarly overlooked by Washington. Kenneth E. Mapp, the governor, assured them that Mr. Trump had told him he “loves the Virgin Islands.”

When the president finally did get around to addressing Puerto Rico, on Monday, he led off with some unsympathetic observations about the territory’s well-publicized fiscal problems.

“Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble,” he said in a series of tweets. “It’s old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities – and doing well.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he had deployed Navy ships to Puerto Rico. His homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, and the FEMA administrator, Brock Long, traveled there to meet with officials. But even then, Mr. Trump said less about the resilience of the people than about the territory’s problems. The federal government, he said, had to take over some security because police officers, having lost their homes, had gone off duty.

After his news conference, Mr. Trump tweeted, “America’s hearts & prayers are with the people of #PuertoRico & the #USVI. We will get through this — and we will get through this TOGETHER!”

To the extent that Mr. Trump lauded Puerto Rican officials, however, it was for their praise and gratitude for his administration’s efforts.

“We have had tremendous reviews from government officials, as we have in Texas and Louisiana, and as we have in Florida,” Mr. Trump said, singling out Greg Abbott of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida as “great governors.”

For a moment, it looked like he would pay a similar tribute to the governor of Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosselló.

I’m playing familiar music, but I believe it will lead you to hear it with very fresh ears by the context that I set it in. I always make a comment that when things are working in art, one plus one equals three.

I think an audience always wants two things. They want to feel at home and they want to be surprised. And I go out every time to do those two things. I try to make people feel that they’ve come to some place that they’ve known for a long time, and then also try to surprise them with some new insights or new forms or new energy or just a new way of doing something. You’ve got to have that X factor. If you don’t have that, you’re dead in the water.

I admire all the Broadway writers, Sondheim, who have been able to do that so magnificently, but it’s not something I could ever do. It just seems too hard.

And then I’ve never really been good at, say, writing to script. In other words, “Now I need a song about [a certain subject].” I’ve never written like that. I’ve always written about what’s pressing itself upon me to write at a given moment. I’ve never sat back and said, well, I need a song about Trump, or I need a song about this happening or that happening. When I’ve crossed over with topical songwriting, even that was something that began as, you’re angry about something or you want to say something. That’s the feeling that comes up first.

With your book and with “Springsteen on Broadway,” you’re surveying your whole past. Are you also writing songs?

I’ve finished a record. I had some inspiration. When you’re locked into a period of creativity it’s very similar to being hungry all the time. You have an appetite to write. It’s one of the nicest feelings in the world for a songwriter because you know what it is to be without that appetite. Once you lock into that, then you’re feeding yourself. Everywhere you go you’re hungry. So I might come up with a verse sitting at the kitchen table, I might be asleep and wake up in the middle of the night and run upstairs to my writing room and come up with another verse or two. Literally I do it anywhere and everywhere and that’s a nice place to be. It doesn’t happen that often.

Writing the book must have made you think about your life story.

I really never had planned on writing anything. So when it came around, yeah, obviously, you draw a story from your story. I supposed you’re contextualizing your own life for yourself, and in the course of it you’re trying to have an honest hand.

It’s one of the things that I’m sort of glad it exists. Just for your kids — your kids really don’t know much about your life, you know? We had our kids late, I was 40 when our first son was born, and they showed a healthy disinterest in our work over all the years. They had their own musical heroes, they had their own music they were interested in. They’d be pretty blank-faced if someone mentioned a song title of mine, and I always looked upon that as that we did a good job. I know that none of my kids have read the book, though I imagine someday they will perhaps. I kind of like that. My job, it’s a strange job, it’s an eccentric line of work. And it’s not comparable to anything else and it can be difficult to be around it. As I say in the book, I know a lot of kids who wouldn’t mind seeing 50,000 people boo their parents. But I don’t know how many would want to see those people cheer their parents. It’s just not right (laughs).

The book explains that you’ve always been a musician. You never really had a 9-to-5 job. But “Springsteen on Broadway” is five nights a week for five months. It’s steady work.

That’s a real job. This is my first real job, I think (laughs). That’s the one thing I’m going into with a certain sense of faith. I go, well, I’m not using myself so totally physically on a nightly basis. And I’m not using my voice — you know, you’re not screaming. But the mental energy that it takes to do it is the same. People come to see you be completely, completely present. Any time you’re trying to do that, it takes a lot of energy.

You say the show and stories are locked in — won’t that become repetitive for you?

I’ve played “Born to Run,” many, many times. I’m sure if we went on the internet we could find out how many. (laughs) But the key is, you have to approach it not as a repetition but as a renewal. And to do that your spirit has got to be 100 percent present. But it’s a new audience every night. There’s new faces, there’s new opportunities. Those songs have been very good to me over the years, and in return I try to be good to them. So you have a chance of renewing the emotion and the spirit in that music on a nightly basis. That’s the place I work to get to every night when I’m onstage. I think that if the foundation of what you’ve built is built well, you’ll be able to inhabit it on a nightly basis and your audience will come in and it will feel like they’re seeing it for the first time. (laughs) That’s my plan, anyway.",Bruce Springsteen on Broadway: The Boss on His ‘First Real Job’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/arts/music/bruce-springsteen-broadway.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The speed limit, just 25 miles an hour, helps reduce the risk if something goes wrong. And because it is private property, the company does not have to share ride information with regulators and it can try new ideas without as much red tape.

Cars that can drive themselves could be a great benefit to older people. Residents at the Villages say that once people stop driving, they often pull back from activities and interacting with friends.

Ms. Jackson, who has lived here for three decades, was one of Voyage’s first test passengers. For now, the company is limiting rides in two driverless cars (with a third arriving in two weeks) to a busy, two-mile loop. A person stays in the driver’s seat in case something goes awry. And the plan is for any Village resident to be able to summon one of Voyage’s cars through a smartphone app for free door-to-door service.

Voyage’s introduction to the Villages comes as self-driving vehicles interact more and more with regular cars. Waymo, the driverless car unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, started a trial ride-hailing program in Phoenix this year with several hundred cars. The ride-hailing service Uber is also testing the technology in more than 200 cars with real passengers in Arizona and Pittsburgh.

Voyage was formed this year after spinning out of the online education start-up Udacity. How an online education start-up ended up operating an autonomous taxi service in a retirement community is an “only in Silicon Valley” story.

It started with a drive from nearby Mountain View to San Francisco. When Udacity started to offer a self-driving car curriculum, a team of employees created a challenge for themselves: Make a 32-mile drive on busy El Camino Real during rush hour and without human intervention.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

After five months of failure, the team finally completed the route. Sensing an opportunity, Udacity executives spun out the self-driving car project into a new company. Voyage raised $5.6 million from investors.

The company had a major selling point: Udacity’s chairman, Sebastian Thrun, the founder of Google’s driverless car project and a pioneer in autonomous vehicle research, was joining Voyage as chairman. He pushed the idea of starting in a retirement community.

It was a good match. Last year, the Villages had conducted a survey about what amenities residents wanted to see over the next 15 years. Among the top answers: autonomous cars and a shuttle service.

Four years ago, the Villages considered a shuttle, but decided it was too costly to have a full-time driver. There is a service called the Villages Medical Auxiliary to take people to the doctor’s office or the supermarket, but there is a shortage of volunteer drivers and people need to make appointments two days in advance. It pushes residents to keep driving when they shouldn’t.

Ask almost anyone at the Villages and he or she can tell you about an accident: the driver who drove into a pond or the person who hit the accelerator instead of the brake and took out the tennis court fence.

“The driverless car would be far less risky than the drivers that we currently have,” said Bill Devincenzi, a former board president of the Villages whose term expired in June.

Another issue that could be solved by driverless cars is a shortage of parking spots. Like many of the Villages’ residents, Nancy Green, 88, is active. She swims three times a week, regularly attends wine-tasting dinners and participates in a weekly bridge game. But after three back operations, she struggles to walk long distances.

For popular events, she sometimes arrives an hour early to secure one of the few handicap spots. If none are available, she turns around and goes home. She said she did not like eating dinner at the clubhouse at 5:30 p.m., but the chances of finding a parking spot at her preferred time of 7 p.m. were “slim and none.”

“From that perspective, I think the self-driving car would be great,” she said.

But what seemed like a done deal hit a roadblock this year. The agreement to offer self-driving car rides in the retirement community almost fell apart when negotiations hit an impasse over insurance. California requires autonomous vehicles to have $5 million of coverage, but the Villages insisted on 50 percent more coverage because it is a private community with more liability risk.

“We’d call the Geicos and Progressives of the world and asked them, ‘Do you do self-driving car insurance?’” said Oliver Cameron, Voyage’s 29-year-old chief executive. “The answer was no.”

Working with an insurance broker, Voyage delved into “exotic insurance” policies and had to pay twice as much per car for its insurance policy versus the standard $5 million coverage.

The insurer, Munich Re, also had an unusual request. It wanted data — any data — produced by the cars. Because this is a new field, even insurers wanted to understand the potential risks of self-driving cars. Voyage agreed to hand over nonidentifiable, sensor data.

Another issue arose when Mr. Thrun had to leave the company because of a conflict of interest. He was also the chief executive of Kitty Hawk, a flying car start-up backed by Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, which owns Waymo.

Coupled with the fact that Voyage and not Udacity would be operating in the Villages, some in the community were concerned that they had fallen for a bait and switch.

To sweeten the deal for the Villages, Voyage offered them an equity stake — the equivalent of what it would grant a new hire.

For the last few months, Voyage has been testing at the Villages. The cars — nicknamed Homer and Marge after the characters on “The Simpsons” — have often prompted questions from curious onlookers in the Villages.

Are you from Google? (No.)

What’s that spinning top on the roof? (It’s a sensor that helps the car see the world around it.)

How do I invest? (Flattering, but we’re not taking new investors now.)

Then, there were the skeptics who questioned whether driverless cars were safer. Mr. Cameron said the residents’ concerns were a welcome reality check from the hype of Silicon Valley. “It’s preparing us for the sorts of questions many millions have on their mind when it comes to the technology,” he said.

Ms. Jackson, who still drives regularly and shuttles friends to church, activities and other community events, said she could not distinguish between human driver and machine during her ride.

I can’t get into arguments about pot as a gateway drug; I’ve known people over 40 years who still smoke a joint before going to sleep and never graduated to anything stronger. The gateway to all of it is life; what happens, what you experience, what you choose to take in and decide to leave behind.

I had thought if he came to see us, while he was casting his line into the water and the music from the party boats floating in a stream down the bay, that maybe he’d say something, give us some clue that would unlock his stoic silence. Something that would explain the lost chances, the ennui that led to another bout, another stint in rehab.

But even if he did, what, after all, would we say in return? He wouldn’t find solace if we told him, “You’re not alone; it’s an epidemic, ravaging the country.” It might make him feel smaller, somehow, more lost in something so huge. You don’t have to do heroin to understand that it must be the greatest escape on earth. Why else would people endure the things they do for a fix?

Whenever the edges of exasperation curled around our conversations, whenever I was tempted to say, “Fine! Go then!” I’d think of people like Philip Seymour Hoffman, and how wonderful heroin must be for someone with a life like his to want to leave it for something like that. We always make excuses for the rock stars, though; that somehow, it’s more tragic, a greater loss. But what if you don’t possess some superlative talent, if you’re not the greatest drummer or photographer or playwright who ever lived? What if you’re just a boy who’s known setbacks and heartbreak and fear of what lies ahead?

How many times do you write and say, “We love you so much, we believe in you,” before it begins to sound as hollow to him as all the “This is the last time, swear to God, I’m done with it” starts to sound to us?

The first time he overdosed, his brother heard the thud as he hit the ground; the third time his father found him, sprawled on the floor of his bedroom. How many times in rehab, now? I don’t like to ask. We’re past “three times is the charm,” that’s for certain.

I hope this is the last time. I hope he can finally feel the love that surrounds him. I hope the day arrives when he does come up to visit, maybe later in the fall, when it’s less crowded and we can pick him out a rod and sit together, watching the water ripple beneath the bridge, him feeling the tug on his line, talking about nothing and everything. I hope this really is the last time, so there never is a final thud on the floor.

• China’s slowing economy has opened the door to “business cults” — essentially pyramid schemes that have lured in tens of millions of people with promises of riches or advancement.

Despite a crackdown that began last month, after a 23-year-old college graduate was found dead in Tianjin, the government has warned that the schemes are spreading faster and growing larger. Above, suspected members of one scheme detained in Guangxi province in June.

For the authorities, a key concern is the intense loyalty some groups inspire, which could threaten the Communist Party’s own grip on society.

Back Story

Early this morning at Confucius temples across Taiwan, robed officials performed elaborate ceremonies. The reason: Teacher’s Day, a day of honors for those who impart knowledge on what is believed to be the 2,567th birthday of Confucius, the ancient Chinese sage.

Many other countries designate a special day to celebrate the teaching profession. India commemorates the birthday of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher and the country’s president in the 1960s.

The U.S. celebrates National Teacher Appreciation Week in May.

Many countries have their Teacher’s Day next Thursday, thanks to a global effort started in 1994 by Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, meant to spread respect for the profession.

The world body says that teachers remain underappreciated: “Strangely one of the most central, vital professionals to society does not receive the respect it deserves in some parts of the world.”

So here’s a timeless essay by an American teacher with tips on how to thank a teacher. The gesture won’t be forgotten, she wrote.

Identify your values before donating

When considering how to give, it’s helpful to start by asking what motivates you.

“You pick the issue with your heart and you pick the organization with your head,” said Jacob Harold, the chief executive of GuideStar, a nonprofit that publishes information about charities in an effort to promote transparency.

People with ties to a region may want to give locally. Animal lovers may want to give to a shelter. Others may want their money directed to certain groups of people, like children, or causes, like public health.

Many opt to leave the decision to the charities themselves, which is sometimes best: “If you’re trusting them with your money, you should trust them to spend it well,” Mr. Harold said.

Decide how to spend your time

Your time is a resource, too, and you should decide how you want to spend it.

Some people prefer to deeply research the charities they support, while others simply want to know they’re giving to a trustworthy group.

For those who prefer the latter, Mr. Harold recommends groups like Global Giving, which collects donations and redistributes the funds to vetted, locally focused organizations.

Do your research before you give

Evaluating a charity is often the most daunting part of donating, but it doesn’t have to be.

In addition to GuideStar and Charity Navigator, the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance and Charity Watch offer helpful resources.

Tax filings and other documents can shed light on a group’s operations, but donors should look beyond the numbers, too, experts said. That includes reviewing an organization’s website, annual report, governing board and mission.

“If the organization is only talking about the problem, but not talking about how the work they do leads to solutions to that problem, that is a red flag,” Mr. Harold said.

Ask questions about the charity, including how much experience it has in disaster relief, how long it’s been around, how it measures accomplishments, and how others in the field talk about it.

He also said that too much focus is often placed on overhead, a measure of administrative and fund-raising costs. While it can signal inefficient spending or, worse, fraud, some overhead is necessary to support a nonprofit’s long-term viability.

Cash is often the best way to help

It may feel impersonal, but money is often the most useful form of donation. Unlike goods, financial gifts have no associated transportation costs.

A $20 pair of jeans, for example, would cost about $165 to ship from Washington, D.C., to the capital of Honduras, according to an online calculator developed by the University of Rhode Island. That money could instead be used locally to buy 24 blankets, nearly 33,000 liters of water or a variety of other supplies, according to the calculator.

There are secondary benefits, too: With cash, relief organizations can support local economies, according to the Center for International Disaster Information, which was created by the United States Agency for International Development.

Follow up later. Recovery takes a long time.

Donations surge in the immediate aftermath of disasters, but recoveries unfold over a much longer timeline.

“Moby-Dick.” I read it first, and then I listened to it. I actually preferred having it read to me — having all the voices of the characters acted out was great.

Whose writing today most inspires you?

Graphic memoirs/novels are very inspiring to me. It feels like a very supple and new form. There are too many nongraphic memoir/novel writers whose work I love to name them all. George Saunders, Elif Batuman, Rachel Cusk, Matthew Klam, Rivka Galchen, Jeffrey Eugenides, Jennifer Egan, Emma Donoghue, Kazuo Ishiguro …

What kinds of books bring you the most reading pleasure these days?

I love contemporary fiction, but I also love long, older novels. I love getting involved with the characters, and also getting a sense of another time and place. Right now, I’m listening to “The Old Curiosity Shop.” Listening to a book while working on a craft project, like hooking a rug or embroidering, is my idea of a really good time.

Which genres do you avoid?

Not a big fan of fantasy, although I’m O.K. with some science fiction. I avoid books about romance, sports, detailed history of wars (“And then General Eisenhower said …”), books about secrets of success, and that whole genre of self-help books that seem to be pitched mainly to women about exercise, diets, being “mindful,” etc. Depressing.

The last book that made you laugh?

“Trashed,” the graphic novel about a garbage collector that I mentioned before. At one point, the garbage collector is taunted by a jerky kid. Later that day while on his route, he sees that kid from behind and throws a bag of garbage at him. When the kid turns around, he realizes it’s just some poor bespectacled shlub who happens to be wearing the same shirt as the taunter. He muses about how, for the rest of his life, that kid is going to wonder why a trash collector threw a bag of garbage at him.

The last book that made you cry?

“A Tale of Two Cities.” That scene at the end, where the little seamstress and Sydney Carton are being taken to the guillotine. She’s terrified and asks him to hold her hand, which he does. You feel that even though she knew she was still going to have her head chopped off, he was able, somehow, to take a tiny bit of the terror away. That got to me.

The last book that made you furious?

“The Power Broker.” Robert Moses may have been a genius and a visionary, but he was also a horrible jerk. He idealized cars and loathed public transportation. Interestingly, he never learned how to drive, so his whole idea of driving and cars was shaped by a life spent in the back of limousines.

What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?

“The Art of the Deal.” Kidding!!! As if!!!!!!!!

Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?

Hero? So many. Nick Carraway. Lily Bart. Harriet the Spy. Antihero? Definitely Tom Ripley.

What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?

Voracious. Books were an escape from boredom and loneliness and also worries. I loved “The Wizard of Oz,” all the “Eloise” books, “Alice in Wonderland,” “Harriet the Spy.” I loved the whole “Betsy-Tacy” series. Generally I preferred fiction to nonfiction.

If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?

What makes you so sure he knows how to read?

You’re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?

Edith Wharton, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Marcel Proust. It would probably be incredibly awkward and embarrassing. I would be dumbstruck by my love and awe of them. They would probably be annoyed and wondering why I woke them from the dead and brought them to this lame dinner. On top of everything else, my cooking is terrible. Maybe their mutual irritation at me and their dislike of the food would be a conversation starter.

Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?

“Infinite Jest.” I’ve tried twice to read it, and feel terrible about not being able to get past page 85 or so.

Tell All

From Splinter: Welcome to the United States of Snitches, land of the petty, home of the brazen — at least when they’re anonymous. Except they aren’t when they call the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (Voice) hotline run by the federal government. This report not only documents Americans dropping a dime on their neighbors, it reveals that Voice stupidly posted online personal identity details, even Social Security numbers, of both complainants and accused. In most cases there weren’t even crimes involved, viz.: “Caller requested to report her mother-in law and sister-in law. Caller stated these individuals came to the U.S. as tourists and stayed in the U.S. in order to get legal status.” — Rod Nordland, international correspondent at large

The Making of a Scoop

From Politico: Over the past several weeks, Politico smoked the competition in Washington with a series of stories about the private jet travel of Tom Price, President Trump’s health secretary. After Mr. Price resigned, the two reporters who broke open this story wrote about how much time, energy and resources went into their investigation. In an era where news outlets are struggling to stay afloat, there are no better examples of why it’s so important to have beat reporters who can zero in on a big target when needed. — Katie Rogers, correspondent

The biggest takeaway is counterintuitive: At all costs, resist. Many women are taught from an early age that the best chance of survival in an attack is to obey. Not true, says Kardian (who co-wrote the book with A. Clara Pistek). Get in the car, follow him to the deserted apartment, do what he wants — and you’re toast. Kardian is also a big believer in people not minding their own business. A third person barging into a situation that looks dicey is extremely likely to help avert a crime. So if you see someone who’s listening a little too closely to a woman’s room number at a hotel, tell her; if you think you saw someone slip something into her drink when she goes to the restroom, speak up. He cites a YouTube video called “Snack Man,” in which two people on a New York City subway are having a brawl because the woman thinks the man is following her. There are punches and kicks. And then some big dude eating chips just kind of sidles between them, continuing to eat, saying nothing … and the fight is over. Snack Man is my hero.

Laura Bates has written the book that you should give your teenage daughter this Christmas — or your teenage son, for that matter. GIRL UP: Kick Ass, Claim Your Woman Card, and Crush Everyday Sexism (Touchstone, paper, $16) is a manifesto for maintaining your sanity and dignity in today’s social media quagmire, where “suddenly our lives, our looks, our relationships, our meals and our cats are open to scrutiny.” (Bonus points: Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, is as funny and sex-positive as early Cynthia Heimel.) A bracing antidote to self-consciousness — Bates reminds us constantly that no one is scrutinizing us a tenth as much as we scrutinize ourselves — “Girl Up” offers practical steps to overcoming stereotypes and not letting the world define you. The chapter titles say it all: among them, “You Aren’t Your Body,” “Sluts, Unicorns, and Other Mythical Creatures,” “Porn ≠ Sex” and “The F-Word” — that word being “feminist.” The book is filled with tap-dancing vaginas, clever comebacks to ridiculous pickup lines and all sorts of handy translation guides, notably of tabloid-magazine language pertaining to women. For instance: “flaunts” means “has body part”; “shows off” means “has body part”; “goes makeup-free” means “is human.”

In a chart with two columns — “Ten Things Every Girl Should Know How to Do According to Magazines” vs. “Ten Things Every Girl Should Know How to Do in Real Life” — she compares the magazine imperative (“How to kiss in a way that communicates perfectly what you would and wouldn’t like to happen next”) with what would actually be useful: “How to use your words and have an actual conversation, in the event that your partner doesn’t, in fact, turn out to be a lip psychic.” All of us, and young women especially, need to maintain our humanity and kindness while not giving a hoot what other people think, as long as we’re not hurting anyone. And that’s what makes this book special. Well, that and the tap-dancing vaginas.

While Bates is empowering a young girl’s psyche, Tasneem Bhatia is here to give our health a boost. SUPER WOMAN RX: Discover the Secrets to Lasting Health, Your Perfect Weight, Energy, and Passion With Dr. Taz’s Power Type Plans (Rodale, $26.99) is a perfectly traditional self-help guide, which works on the premise that while everyone is a lovely individual snowflake, we all fall into certain emotional and physical categories, and if we figure out our category we can determine the best diet and fitness and psychic-energy plan to empower ourselves. In other words: Quizzes! I had to find out if I was a Gypsy Girl, a Boss Lady, a Savvy Chick, an Earth Mama or a Nightingale. Turns out I was a Savvy Chick, like the author, and I have to say that the ills Savvy Chicks are prone to (anxiety, migraines, infertility, eczema) are pretty much precisely the ones I’ve had. The solutions are quite involved but perfectly sensible. I also happen to be incapable of sticking to any regimen. But that doesn’t mean I won’t spend money on vitamins, probiotics and various warm broths while I try.

Speaking of quizzes, I took the pop quiz about car care at the beginning of Patrice Banks’s GIRLS AUTO CLINIC GLOVE BOX GUIDE (Touchstone, paper, $25) and scored my personal best: zero. I did not get a single answer right. I can’t be excused for being a car-less New Yorker, because I have actually owned a car. In most areas of life I am keen on understanding what I’m doing. But when it came to the car I somehow felt a penis was necessary to deal with it. And I am not alone, despite the fact that women are more frequently the purchasers of cars in a family. Explaining that a woman’s relationship to her car should be like a relationship to her partner — heavy on the communication and the commitment — Banks gives us the basics here: the parts, how they operate, what you can fix yourself, and perhaps most important, how not to be cheated (by knowing how much various repair jobs should cost). It’s simply written, it’s not condescending or cutesy, and it removes the mystery from something that many of us find a little scary. “Girls Auto Clinic” is not about how we feel about our cars; it’s about what we can learn to do. And that’s some pretty excellent roaring right there.",How to Fight and Fix Your Car Like a Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/books/review/claudia-chan-this-is-how-we-rise-self-help-women.html

How did you feel when you found out you would be CoverGirl’s newest ambassador?

Aging has been good for me. You develop confidence, you’re able to handle the knocks a little easier. I model for my age. I’m not trying to hide it and say I’m 50. I’m so proud that I’m going be 70.

I don’t dye my hair. It’s so fabulous. I had brown hair for so long. I was always getting my roots done. Sometimes I did it myself because I couldn’t afford to go to a hair salon. When I turned 60, I decided to see what color I am underneath. I started dyeing my hair a very light blond and then I let it grow out. I cut it very short.

When did you first start modeling?

At 15. I was a science nerd. I have two science degrees. I enjoyed the sciences, nutrition, so I always modeled part time, thinking it would end. And it hasn’t, of course. “Just getting started” is my hashtag. I had three kids in three years, so that slowed me down somewhat. I was 28 and the oldest model in the city.

What advice would you give to young models today?

Be nice to everybody. Keep your brain active. Read a lot.

Did you ever involve your kids in your modeling work?

When I didn’t have a nanny, the shows weren’t long, so they would have their books and sit in the front row. I tried to get them to model, but they found it boring. They didn’t have iPads back then. When you’re on set you stand a lot and you wait, wait, wait. Tosca was doing runway with me and she was about 11, and they did her hair in a style she hated and she refused to step on the runway. And I said, “That’s the end of your modeling career.” And that was fine with me, too.

What do you love about makeup?

For me, it makes a huge difference because my face is pretty plain, and I’m very fair with very few eyebrows and very short eyelashes. Makeup transforms me. I feel like I’m in disguise when I walk my dog without makeup on.

I was 12 or 13 when I started experimenting. At 15, I was modeling. I had to do my own hair and makeup. I also made my own clothes because I grew up in South Africa, where fashion was six months behind because of the seasons.

We wore a lot of makeup. It took us an hour to get ready. The eyelashes on top, the black eyeliner in the crease of the eye that you can see in photos from the ‘60s, the beehive hairstyle.

The modeling industry has a lot of issues with eating disorders and underweight workers. What’s your perspective on that as someone who studies nutrition?

There are models who are naturally skinny, but the thing is that many of them are emaciated. You can tell because they have hirsutism. There’ll be some hair on their face. It’s to protect their body and keep it warm because they’re too skinny. They also don’t have good energy. I’m surprised how many of them can do so many shows.

Modeling agencies would send me their models. If they were a swimsuit model, they would have to lose 10 pounds to do runway. I would say, “You’re perfect.

The stabbings — and the presence of a switchblade in the school — stirred complaints from some parents that the school did not have metal detectors and prompted questions from reporters to the mayor and police officials about whether the school should have had them. Eighty-eight of the city’s roughly 1,300 school buildings have metal detectors that are used either full time or part time.

Among students and faculty, though, the talk was of the lives changed.

Public and private efforts to help displaced people with housing and reconstruction needs have begun to take shape. On Tuesday, the authorities in Mexico City announced a plan to provide low-interest loans and other financial assistance to homeowners, depending on their needs and the conditions of their homes. The city has also promised financial assistance for renters.

President Enrique Peña Nieto has promised that the government would “directly support families with resources and materials” to repair damage and build new homes, and he announced Wednesday that his administration would help the country’s most powerful business leaders obtain private-sector assistance for reconstruction through a newly created fund.

A project called Arriba Mexico has started a website that invites people to “book a symbolic stay in a ruined home and help rebuild Mexico,” with the proceeds going toward relief efforts for victims, including temporary housing. The offers are truly symbolic; donors will not set foot on the properties.

“Stay in a gorgeous ruined apartment (parking included) in Atlixco, Puebla,” says one listing, beneath the photo of a building reduced to rubble. The price is $44 a night.

The future for many of the displaced, at least in the near term, is highly uncertain, leaving them in a frustrating, exhausting transitional state that could test friendships and strain relationships.

Last week’s quake drove Ana Paula Velasquez from her apartment in the Roma Sur neighborhood, where she and her husband, daughter and mother lived. Their building was found to be unsafe, and its residents scattered to hotels and to the homes of relatives and friends.

Ms. Velasquez, 39, and her family spent the first night after the earthquake with a friend of her mother’s, and the second at a relative’s home.

She and her husband then decided to send their daughter to live with family friends while they, along with Ms. Velasquez’s mother, moved into a shelter that had opened in a grade school in their neighborhood.

It was the primary school that her daughter, now 13, once attended.

“Ironic, isn’t it?” Ms. Velasquez said, sitting on a bench designed for small children. Classrooms had been converted to dormitories, with mattresses on the floor.

Ms. Velasquez, a former receptionist for a parking lot company, had decided to move to the shelter in part because she did not want to impose on friends and family. In addition, she said, the shelter has functioned as an outlet for information about legal assistance and other aid for earthquake victims. Staying there allows her to remain on top of her case.

“If you let this get cold, there’s even less chance the government will do something,” she said.

The shelter is scheduled to close on Friday, and the family will be forced to move to another one, though she is not sure where.

In the Portales Sur neighborhood, evacuated residents of a three-tower complex on Tokio Street have set up an encampment of tents in front of the building and organized a round-the-clock patrol to keep an eye on it.

Two towers are leaning precipitously, and the entire complex has sunk by one story. Demolition is certain.

The residents’ constant presence ensures that they do not miss a visit from a utility company representative, or a lawyer, or officials who might be able to clarify what happens next, including whether they will be able to recover their belongings.

Mario Jiménez, 54, a restaurant worker who lived on the fourth floor, says he has been able to look into his apartment from an upper-floor window next door.

“And I just think: It is right there. If I could just reach in,” he said. “Get stuff like the invoice that proves I own my car, to that one jacket I like, to a pot from the kitchen. It’s the story of a life, if you will, and it is stuck there. And who knows if we will have access to it again.”

Longer-term questions for many also remain unanswered, like whether new apartment buildings will rise to replace those that are demolished, allowing developers and unit owners to recover their investments. Many homeowners in Mexico do not have property insurance.

Nobody believes that the process will be quick, particularly if the aftermath of the devastating 1985 earthquake is any indication. That quake flattened hundreds of buildings in Mexico City and caused structural damage to thousands of others in the capital, many of which were later demolished.

Rebuilding in some areas of Mexico City took more than a decade. Some buildings slated for demolition became ensnarled in litigation for years.

“The one thing we know for sure right now is that our recovery is in for the long haul,” said Oscar Ramírez, 52, an engineer who owns an apartment in a Mexico City building that, though only a year old, collapsed in last week’s quake.

“The good thing is that most of us are alive,” he said. “And we just hope that we are not forgotten.” The top elected official from the district vowed on Tuesday to punish the building’s developer for “endangering people and using low-quality materials.”

Neighbors of the building where Ms. Flores, the property manager, lived in the Letrán Valle district have also set up a round-the-clock watch, taking turns on four-hour shifts. They are waiting for a final ruling by the authorities on whether the building can be saved or must be demolished.

Despite the safety concerns, however, several residents have quietly resumed living in their apartments.

“Some don’t have anywhere else to go,” said Juan de la Barrera, 70, a resident and retired real estate broker.

He admitted he had visited his apartment, hanging out for a couple of hours at a stretch, though not staying overnight.

“I’ve done it just for the comfort,” he explained. “My clothes are there, my things. There’s no place like home.”",Still More Victims in Mexico’s Quakes: Legions of Displaced,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/americas/mexico-earthquakes-displaced.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.

In a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”

He added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to “deal with this issue head on.”

Lisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that “he denies many of the accusations as patently false.” In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O’Connor’s memo were “off base” and that they had parted on good terms.

He and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, “my motto is to keep the peace.”

Ms. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.” She said she had “explained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.”

Though Ms. O’Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women’s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.”

The allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting” to the television show “Project Runway.” In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.

In 2015, the year Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women’s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.

“From the outside, it seemed golden — the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,” said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. “But behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,” he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women.

Dozens of Mr. Weinstein’s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.

Mr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its “business reputation” or “any employee’s personal reputation,” a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.

Charles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, “It’s not evidence of anything.”

I am a professional and have tried to be professional. I am not treated that way however. I am sexualized and diminished.  From Lauren O’Connor‘s memo

At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.

In the wake of Ms. O’Connor’s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and longtime partner, Bob, 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.

“The parties made peace very quickly,” Ms. Bloom said.

Through her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O’Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. “I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,” Ms. O’Connor wrote. “But remaining silent is causing me great distress.”

In speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.”

A Common Narrative

Ms. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein’s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.

“She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,” one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees.

Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.

Working for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.

In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.

Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview. “You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”

“I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said.

Most women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.

Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. “We did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.”

Others in the London office said the same. “I was pretty disturbed and angry,” said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. “That’s kind of the way things were.”

The human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. “If a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up” so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles.

Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.

But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades?

“It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.

Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.

Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.

In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.

Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.

Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.

Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “Life Is Beautiful” and “Shakespeare in Love” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.

‘Coercive Bargaining’

For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. Mr. Weinstein’s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago” to Jennifer Lawrence in “Silver Linings Playbook.”

But movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “Kiss the Girls” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.

Mr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.

“I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. “It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”

To get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. “There’s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.”

Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “Variety” without naming the man involved.

In 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film “Scream” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.

Increased Scrutiny

Just months before Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.

Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.

In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.

The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges.

But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.

The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.

Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago, Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.

After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.

Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, “The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”

She was a valued employee — Mr. Weinstein described her as “fantastic,” “a great person,” “a brilliant executive” — so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.

But the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O’Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate.

“Because this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,” Ms. O’Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo. She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry.",Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html

They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html

Of the 11 people who suffered various injuries — mostly leg and head wounds, according to the London Ambulance Service — nine of them were taken to the hospital, including the man arrested, the police said. The injuries were not believed to be life-threatening.

The Natural History Museum, one of several tourist attractions in the area, including the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert, released a statement on Twitter that said, “There’s been a serious incident outside the museum,” adding that the institution was working with the police.

The museum was sealed off with crime-scene tape and police cars as officers tried to clear hundreds of tourists and families from the scene. A woman with a blood-soaked bandage on one foot was pushed in a wheelchair to an intersection.

The London area has been hit with five attacks in the past six months, and the terror threat level is set at “severe,” indicating that officials believe an attack is highly likely.

The last one was an assault with an explosive device on a train at the Parsons Green subway station that injured at least 30.

In March, five people were killed and at least 40 more injured when a knife-wielding assailant in a sport utility vehicle ran over pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. He then got out and stabbed a police officer outside the Parliament building.

On June 3, three men carrying knives and wearing fake suicide bomb vests rammed their van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed several people in the nearby Borough Market, killing eight.

Two weeks later, a van driver plowed into a crowd of Muslims as they finished prayers at the Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, leaving one dead.

In addition, a suicide bomber killed 22 people and wounded 59 others when he blew himself up near one of the exits of the Manchester Arena at the end of a concert in May by the American pop singer Ariana Grande.

In a tweet on Saturday, Prime Minister Theresa May thanked the “first responders” and “the actions of members of the public.” She added, “My thoughts are with the injured.”",At Least 11 Injured After Driver Crashes Car Into Pedestrians Near London History Museum,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/world/europe/natural-history-museum-london.html

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

Constructor Notes

Erik Agard: Music and wordplay are but two of Alex’s superpowers (you can see some of her punny drawings on her Instagram), so when this puzzle’s then-half-formed theme needed rescuing, I knew who to shine the Bat Signal for. Through a couple revisions and upwards of a hundred emails, the collaboration was always fun, and I’m looking forward to her next puzzle. Alex Briñas: Erik was the true superhero here — he zipped nimbly through the bulk of the work and picked up after all my snafus. I’m a super-newbie to everything in the crossword world, but I do enjoy myself a good pun every now and then, so this was fascinating and foreign and exciting and daunting all at once. And I owe much thanks to Erik for inviting me to sidekick this mission in the first place. For your enjoyment (we hope), here are some of the theme answers from the cutting room floor: [Human Torch’s favorite band?] (3,7,4) [Blade’s favorite band?] (7,7) [Wonder Twins’ favorite band?] (5) [Storm’s favorite rapper?] (6) [Beast’s favorite singer?] (6) [Wolverine’s favorite guitarist?] (5) [Lady Deathstrike’s favorite band?] (13) [Banshee’s favorite band?] (5,5)

When the overall Republican vote share in the state is 50 percent or more, the authors of the paper show, the map behaves much like an unbiased one. But when the map is tested by an electorate that leans Democratic, its special features kick in, maintaining a healthy Republican majority against the popular headwind. To gain control of the State Assembly, the authors estimate, Wisconsin Democrats would have to beat Republicans by 8 to 10 points, a margin rarely achieved in statewide elections by either party in this evenly split state. As a mathematician, I’m impressed. As a Wisconsin voter, I feel a little ill.

Republican legislators argue that any Wisconsin map will look biased, because Democratic voters tend to congregate in big cities like Milwaukee and Madison. That packs the Democratic half of the state into a small cluster of districts. “Why are you gerrymandering yourselves?” they ask.

They’re partly right. The clustering of Democrats in cities does indeed give the Republicans an edge. But it’s a much smaller advantage than the turbo-boost the current map provides, as the Duke paper demonstrates. The main tool in the Duke paper is a method called the “Markov chain Monte Carlo” algorithm. Starting from the current Wisconsin district map, it makes a sequence of random changes, swapping wards from one district to an adjacent one, carrying out a “random walk” through the set of all possible maps. Completely unconstrained changes would create crazy-looking districts, so it weights its changes in favor of traditional districting criteria.

Few if any of these maps provide the Republicans the firewall against a Democratic electorate that the Wisconsin district map does. In other words, the map is an “outlier” — so far outside the ordinary run of things that it can’t be mistaken for a map without partisan purpose. It’s an outlier in another way, too: Research by the political scientist Jowei Chen suggests that the Wisconsin district map does much worse on traditional districting criteria than neutral maps do, despite the Wisconsin Constitution’s requirement that districts be “in as compact form as practicable.”

Outlier detection is a critical part of data analysis, and mathematicians have gotten really good at it by now. That’s the good news about advanced computation: You can use it to make electoral mischief, but you can also use it to detect and measure that mischief. It’s not math versus democracy; it’s math versus math, with democracy at stake.

If the Supreme Court sides with the three-judge panel that blocked the Wisconsin map, some liberals foresee an end to gerrymandering, while some conservatives imagine a districting process that is the purview of legislatures being completely usurped by the courts. Both sides of Gill v. Whitford agree: This is a momentous case with major implications for American democracy.

But what if it’s not? The panel’s standards for determining impermissible gerrymandering are hard to meet except in the most egregious cases. Judges empowered by an anti-gerrymandering precedent from the Supreme Court will blunt the worst cases, but won’t end gerrymandering. There will be many cases, maybe most of them, where it’s impossible, no matter how much math you do, to tell the difference between innocuous decision making and a scheme — like Wisconsin’s — designed to protect one party from voters who might prefer the other.",How Computers Turned Gerrymandering Into a Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/opinion/sunday/computers-gerrymandering-wisconsin.html

Mr. Obama, who has been doing quite well financially since leaving the White House, has not yet written a check, but the president of Occidental, Jonathan Veitch, said the former president was high on his list of asks.

“I am going all over the world asking people for money,” he said. “Why wouldn’t I ask him?”

“There are not many liberal arts colleges that educate a president,” Mr. Veitch said. “We are very proud of the fact and very proud of him. We thought this would be a great way to honor him and have our students emulate the values he represents.”

Mastodons, rhinoceroses and saber-toothed cats once roamed Southern California.

We know because of the bones and footprints they left behind in places like Rainbow Basin, in the Calico Mountains just north of Barstow.

Administered by the Bureau of Land Management, the area owes its name to the pink, green, orange and brown sediments that form the basin’s walls.

Over eons, tectonic forces and erosion have lifted the rock and exposed zigzagging strata, made colorful by differing stages of iron oxidation.

It’s a mecca for geologists.

“It’s quite spectacular,” said Robert Hilburn, a Barstow paleontologist. “People come from all over the United States and sometimes all over the world.”

Rainbow Basin was once a lush marshland populated by a unique array of prehistoric animals whose fossils remain scattered across what is now a parched desert.

“Everything that you have on the African savanna today, they had here — except one,” said Mr. Hilburn, who is also vice president of the Mojave River Valley Museum.

Which one? “No man,” he said.

Rainbow Basin is accessible to visitors at the end of a long dirt road. You can walk miles of trails or stay at nearby campsite.

Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

Photo“My aim was not to concentrate on the war or the ruined buildings,” Ms. Kuleshova said.
But the vast majority of visitors are Russians, and they come to Abkhazia for cheap prices and Soviet nostalgia.
While Abkhazians are happy for the economic boost, Ms. Kuleshova said, they are still waiting for the kind of development that could lead to a sustainable future.
“They want more tourists and they want more opportunities,” Ms. Kuleshova said.","More than 20 years after Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a bloody, year-long proxy war decried by Georgian authorities as illegal and a step towards “de facto annexation,” only four United Nations member states — Nicaragua, Venezuela, Nauru and Russia— recognize Abkhazia, a small territory on the eastern coast of the Black Sea bordering the Caucasus Mountains.

Abkhazia is a time capsule. Many buildings, constructed during its days as a Soviet republic, are pockmarked with bullet holes from the 1992 conflict. The economy is weak and dependent on tourism from Russian visitors. Young people with means attend college outside the territory — and stay there after graduation.

But Abkhazia — which, in the local language, means “land of the soul”— is more than its decay and its disputed political status, said the Russian photographer Ksenia Kuleshova. She began photographing there in 2015 as an undergraduate at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Hanover, Germany, and has returned three times since to work on an ongoing project.

Photo

“My aim was not to concentrate on the war or the ruined buildings,” Ms. Kuleshova said. “I didn’t want to concentrate on the negative side. I wanted to find the soul.”

Ms. Kuleshova grew up hearing about Abkhazia from her parents, who vacationed there before the war and remembered it as “a beautiful country with mountains and tasty vegetables and fruits.” When she arrived in Sukhumi, the territory’s capital, for the first time three years ago, she found its appearance unsettling.

“You come there and you feel it’s another world, that this country slept for a while because they didn’t restore buildings after the war,” she said.

Photo

She overcame her shock and got to work, connecting with locals through a friend of her parents. She was looking, she said, for signs of joy, and she found them in abundance. She attended soccer games and horse races and parades, met folk dancers and socialites and zookeepers, and watched people play in the first big snowfall in Sukhumi in nearly eight years. Once, she went to three weddings in a day.

“I wanted to show something beautiful and I wanted to show that there’s happiness,” she said.

But there was no escaping history. While bullet holes are not the focus of her photos, they sometimes appear in the background. And in her conversations with Abkhazians, talk often turned to the war.

“It was a very cruel war and almost every family lost someone,” she said. “They can’t forget it.”

Photo

There has been some change in Abkhazia’s prospects recently. After years of stagnation, business along the Black Sea coast has picked up. Avtandil Gartskiya, Sukhumi’s tourism minister, told The New York Times in 2016 that 1.5 million foreign visitors were expected that year—up from 92,000 a decade earlier. But the vast majority of visitors are Russians, and they come to Abkhazia for cheap prices and Soviet nostalgia. While Abkhazians are happy for the economic boost, Ms. Kuleshova said, they are still waiting for the kind of development that could lead to a sustainable future.

“They want more tourists and they want more opportunities,” Ms. Kuleshova said. “But the main point is they want to be recognized by the world.”

Was Israel’s special relationship with Germany, too, now in danger?

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hastened to say that it was not, announcing Tuesday that he had spoken with Chancellor Angela Merkel. He congratulated her on winning and expressed confidence that Israel and Germany would only deepen their ties.

But Mr. Netanyahu added that Israel was “concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism” on both the political right and left, and noted that “there are two different things: denying the Holocaust and denying responsibility.” He called on Ms. Merkel’s new government to “act to strengthen the forces in Germany that take on the historical responsibility.”

Among the opposition, Amir Peretz, a Knesset member from the left-of-center Zionist Union, wrote on Twitter in German that the election was “a bad day for Germany democracy, with the entry of xenophobes and open anti-Semites into the Bundestag.”

Yet like so much else dividing Israeli society today, the advances by the Alternative for Germany, or the AfD, as it is known, seems to provide more of an excuse for political recriminations and partisan bile than a source of common Jewish ground.

On the right, there was newfound scorn, and worse, for Israeli expatriates in Germany.

Aryeh Eldad, a former Knesset member and medical professor, wrote in Maariv of his revulsion at the “20,000 Israelis who moved from Israel to Germany of their own free will,” whether for “cheaper housing and cheaper cottage cheese” or to live under “the wonderful German democracy” out of a “distorted” leftism. Both groups, he said, were “emotional cripples.”

“These Israelis,” Mr. Eldad wrote, “are not like the dog that comes back to eat his own vomit, but rather like the vomit that returns to the dog that spewed it.”

On the left, there was renewed criticism for the Israeli government that so many left behind when they moved to Germany.

Michael Sappir, a 29-year-old in Tel Aviv who earned a degree in linguistics at the University of Leipzig, in Saxony, and now works in high tech, said the election “makes me think twice about the idea of moving there again, both as a Jew and a leftist.”

But, he added, “the situation in Germany is much, much better than here, where the governing coalition is composed mostly of parties that are intellectually akin to the AfD.” He said, “What’s considered the terrifying right wing there is on many policy points just mainstream here.”

Even after Sunday’s election, Mr. Sappir said, he still believes he would be safer in Germany than in Israel. “The norms of governance, the rule of law, there is much stronger,” he said. “Here I feel like an embattled minority. There I know that we’re a much bigger minority, and there’s at least a pretty broad anti-fascist consensus.”

Eldad Beck, an Israeli journalist and author of a book on German-Jewish relations, said left-wing Israelis in Germany who were surprised by Sunday’s vote were “suffering from blindness.” But he also said that he knew some Israelis in Germany who had voted for the AfD “because they consider the arrival of so many Muslims and the violence, terror and criminality a big problem that has to be stopped.”

Indeed, feelings about the subject do not fall into neat categories, even among left-leaning Israelis.

Mr. Weinberger, the marketing executive in Berlin, said he believed that, aside from anti-Merkel sentiment, what had driven Germans to the AfD was an understandable emotion: “There are strong feelings of fear,” he said. “It’s part of human nature at some point. And some of them I’m sure are really concerned about this open-door policy. It affects their lives.”

Shai Levy, 44, a Jerusalem-born filmmaker in Berlin, said he was saddened to see Israel and the Jewish people fueling the resurgent right wing “because they have a common enemy; being anti-Muslim is considered to be good for the Jews.”

He sees many Israelis newly arrived in Berlin tensing up at the sight of people in Muslim head scarves, a “reflex of phobia for Muslims,” he said, adding: “I know it because I had it. I needed to get rid of it.”

Where Germany goes from here, and how Israel and Israelis will adjust, will depend less on Ms. Merkel than on those who succeed her when she leaves the stage, said Mr. Beck, the author of “Germany, at Odds.”

“As long as Merkel is chancellor, the special relationship is O.K.,” he said. “But Israelis will have to make a special effort, otherwise things are going to fall apart.”

He said that the millions of Muslims who have arrived in Germany in recent years would inevitably influence the country’s politics.

“I’m not so sure the young generations of German politicians feel as connected to Israel and to the past,” he warned. “And I don’t see yet that Israel is really making an effort to convince them why it is doing certain things and why it’s important to do those things.”

Younger Israelis, too, can be frustrating to their elders.

To Miki Goldman, 92, a survivor of Auschwitz and other concentration camps who later helped collect evidence against Adolf Eichmann, diplomacy is one thing, but emigrating to Germany another.

“Undoubtedly Germany of today is a democracy, but it still has a kernel of something else that could become dangerous,” he said. “We can be in good relations with Germany, but why do young Israelis have to forget the fate of their fathers and go back there?”

But some Israelis in Germany insisted they were neither forgetful nor naïve.

Ruthi Grossman, 24, a student who moved to Berlin last year, said she still planned to stay there.

“I think it’s just part of the world moving toward dark times,” she said of the rightward drift. “But I do trust Germany more than I trust any other country in the world to deal with it morally, because of that history.”","Is Germany Still a Haven for Israelis?

“Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people,” Mr. Trump said.
Studies of similar plans produced by Mr. Trump and House Republicans have been projected to cost $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade.","On the individual side, the plan would collapse the tax brackets from seven to three, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, the president said. The current top rate is 39.6 percent and the lowest rate is 10 percent. The framework also gives Congress the option of creating a higher, fourth, rate above 35 percent in the tax plan to ensure that the wealthy are paying their fair share.

The plan aims to simplify and cut taxes for the middle class by doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. That would allow people to avoid a complicated process of itemizing their taxes to claim various credits and deductions. It would increase the child tax credit from $1,000 to an unspecified amount, and create a new $500 tax credit for non-child dependents, such as the elderly.

Provisions such as the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax, a levy on inherited wealth that Mr. Trump has derided for years, would be gone under the Republican proposal.

The proposal calls for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a shift that supporters say is needed to make American companies more competitive with their counterparts around the world.

A new tax rate of 25 percent would also be created for so-called pass-through businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, which are currently taxed at the rate of their owners. About 95 percent of businesses in the United States are structured as pass-throughs and they generate a majority of the government’s corporate tax revenue.

“This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and midsize businesses in this country in more than 80 years,” Mr. Trump said.

While Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, they must now sell it to lawmakers who have been deeply divided this year. The push began at a House Republican retreat on Wednesday at Fort McNair in Washington, where Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, walked members through the blueprint and talked about the importance of coming together to fix the tax code.

Later, in a hopeful sign for Republican leaders fretting privately about keeping their rank and file together, the conservative Freedom Caucus, whose members have derailed the party’s initiatives with hard-line demands, issued a statement of support calling the plan “forward looking” and pledging to back the party’s budget designed to ensure its passage.

The political stakes are high for a president who is desperate to score a legislative win before his first year in office draws to a close. Mr. Trump, who has eschewed the advocacy tours that his predecessors have used to build support for their top domestic priorities, made a rare direct appeal to voters during his speech, imploring them to call their representatives and senators and demand action on the tax proposal. “Let them know you’re watching,” Mr. Trump said. “Let them know you’re waiting.”

In an apparent nod to the harsh political realities the tax plan faces, Mr. Trump made an explicit overture to Democrats to support the plan.

“Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people,” Mr. Trump said.

But behind the scenes, Republican congressional leaders and senior White House officials have discussed bypassing Democrats and using special budget rules that would allow them to get the bill through Congress on a simple majority vote. And Mr. Trump paired his scripted talk of bipartisanship with an impromptu threat to Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, saying he would personally work to defeat the senator’s re-election bid next year if he does not fall into line on the tax plan.

“If Senator Donnelly doesn’t approve it — because, you know, he’s on the other side — we will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn’t believe,” Mr. Trump said as Mr. Donnelly looked on from the audience.

Conservatives cheered the plan as a bold and long-awaited step to spur economic growth, while Democratic leaders condemned it as an irresponsible boon to the rich. And some budget watchdogs expressed worry about the long-term impact of a plan they said could cost more than $2 trillion over a decade.

Mr. Trump, who has broken with precedent for modern American presidents by refusing to release his tax returns, insisted that wealthy people like him would not benefit — an assertion that seemed improbable for a man who runs a family-owned real estate empire and whose children stand to inherit vast sums.

“Tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected,” Mr. Trump said, framing a proposal that would affect hundreds of millions of Americans in terms of his own self-interest. “I’m doing the right thing, and it’s not good for me, believe me.”

Democrats scoffed. “If this framework is all about the middle class, then Trump Tower is middle-class housing,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. “It violates Trump’s tax pledge that the rich would not gain at all under his plan by offering sweetheart deals for powerful C.E.O.s, giveaways for campaign coffers and a new way to cheat taxes for Mar-a-Lago’s loyal members.”

As with the individual side, some of the thornier business tax issues remain unaddressed. It will be left to Congress to create safeguards that prevent wealthy individuals from incorporating as pass-through businesses, which would tax their income at a lower rate.

Most itemized deductions, including those widely used for state and local tax expenses, would also be eliminated, along with most of the tax credits that businesses use. However, the plan would preserve the deductions for mortgage interest expenses and charitable giving and keep incentives for education and retirement savings plans, as well as preserve the tax credits for research and development and low-income-housing on the business side.

Another big change for companies would be a limitation of the deductibility for corporate interest expenses, in exchange for the opportunity to immediately expense business investments. The ability to immediately write off these expenses would last only five years, and the limitations for deducting interest have yet to be determined.

Perhaps the most significant, yet murky, shift is the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system for multinational corporations. In theory, this means that companies would not be taxed on their overseas earnings. But to prevent erosion of the tax base, Republicans plan to impose some form of tax on foreign profits. The transition to the new system would also include a one-time repatriation tax at yet-to-be-determined rates to encourage companies to bring offshore profits back home.

Administration officials did not provide a cost estimate for the plan. Members of the Senate Budget Committee have agreed on a budget resolution that would allow for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years. Studies of similar plans produced by Mr. Trump and House Republicans have been projected to cost $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade.

Republicans say economic growth will compensate for lost revenue. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who sits on the Finance Committee, said he was confident that a growing economy would pay for the tax cuts.

“This tax plan will be deficit reducing,” Mr. Toomey said.",Trump Proposes the Most Sweeping Tax Overhaul in Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-tax-cut-plan-middle-class-deficit.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Making matters worse, 911 still does not work, officials said.

“What do you think? There has to have been deaths,” said Dr. Rafael Rodríguez-Mercado, Puerto Rico’s health secretary. “I can’t give you a number, but we have to be conscious and realistic. To say no would be a lie.”

So far, seven regional hub hospitals are taking in patients. The island’s dialysis patients are also getting care. But none of it is easy. Hospitals should be required to have backup generators, diesel, a stockpile of medication and satellite phones, the doctor added. Even with those precautions, problems could arise. There is enough diesel on the island, but a shortage of gas tanker drivers — some cannot get to their jobs — and working gas stations. In Lares, the mayor, Roberto Pagan, said the municipal hospital almost had to close yesterday because it ran out of diesel fuel.

“We have been putting out fires,” Dr. Rodríguez-Mercado said. “The hospitals call you and say, ‘I have two hours of diesel left.’”

The potential for a public health crisis is a big concern, he said. Rats and decomposing animals can spread disease, the doctor added. Without running water, people are probably not washing their hands or boiling water often enough, or cooking their food well enough. This could lead to gastrointestinal outbreaks.

“What worries me is the sincere possibility of epidemics,” Dr. Rodríguez-Mercado added.

High mosquito counts on the island could also lead to a resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases, like Zika, dengue and chikungunya, doctors said.

A shortage of open pharmacies is another stressor, especially for the chronically ill and elderly residents. Most pharmacies in Puerto Rico remain closed, although they are slowly beginning to reopen. A CVS spokesman said that 21 out of 25 Puerto Rico-based CVS stores are now open, including 17 pharmacies. The first one reopened last Thursday. A Walgreens spokesman said about half of the island’s 120 stores are open and running on generators, but that hours vary. The stores are also receiving supplies of medication.

But many pharmacies in Puerto Rico are independently owned. With so many people pleading for medication, some pharmacists who know their clients are dispensing drugs without the required prescriptions or refill bottles.

Hospitals still have adequate supplies, and so do many of the open pharmacies, but there are concerns they may run out because suppliers are unable to get to them, said Dr. Victor M. Ramos Otero, the president of the College of Doctors and Surgeons of Puerto Rico.

Even when people find the drugs, they often cannot pay for them. Without electricity, A.T.M.s do not work and stores cannot accept credit cards or process insurance plans. That is what happened to José Castillo when he showed up at the Express Care Pharmacy in Santurce, a San Juan neighborhood, on Tuesday, hoping for a refill on the anti-depressants that help him sleep.

Pharmacy workers were outside, tending to customers on the sidewalk. The manager, Yanissa Serrano, told Mr. Castillo the pills cost 25 cents each — cash only.

“But I don’t have the money,” he said.

Her patience worn out, Ms. Serrano erupted.

“I would have been able to give you your medicine, but three times they robbed my generator. Three! Thanks to the fine people of this neighborhood,” she shouted. “I lost my house. I lost everything. I could be home tending to my apartment, but instead I’m here providing this service to the community, and this is how they repay me.”

Before Mr. Trump’s announcement, Representative Luis Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, said on the House floor that, “what I fear is that the federal government is not stepping up as fully and as quickly as we must.”

“This emergency cannot just be treated by Congress, the president, FEMA and the other agencies as just another storm,” he added.

But Mr. Trump defended the response by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday.

Whether the strategy will work is another matter. The plan rests on the premise that Mr. Trump has done nothing wrong — something the president has repeatedly told his lawyers and said publicly — and some lawyers connected to the investigation say that Mr. Cobb has been too willing to take the president at his word. If the White House moves too hastily, they argue, materials could end up in Mr. Mueller’s hands that might damage the president and other administration officials.

Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, previously expressed fears that the document production could set a bad precedent for future administrations. Mr. Cobb has told aides that the White House should move deliberately and carefully, but not drag its feet.

Others doubt that Mr. Mueller will publicly clear Mr. Trump anytime soon, even if the documents and interviews do not show that he committed a crime.

Nevertheless, the president’s advisers have concluded that this strategy represents their best chance to lift the cloud hanging over the administration.

“Good for them if they can pull it off,” said Barbara Van Gelder, a prominent Washington white-collar lawyer who served in the Justice Department with Mr. Mueller. She said he was highly unlikely to give the White House any assurances as long as the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn were open.

“Mueller’s not going to make a statement,” she said, “because he’s not going to want to claw it back.”

Mr. Comey had similar concerns. While F.B.I. agents investigated whether Mr. Trump’s associates had any connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Comey privately told Mr. Trump and members of Congress that the president was not personally under investigation. At least twice, however, he refused requests by Mr. Trump to say so publicly. Mr. Comey later told Congress that he did not want to make a public declaration that he might have to amend after further investigation.

One administration official said it was not yet clear how the White House would make its request for Mr. Mueller to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump, and there have been delays in getting documents to the special counsel. The internal White House review of the documents is not yet complete, and Mr. Mueller does not plan to interview many key White House officials until his team has reviewed all the documents he requested.

Mr. Cobb and several White House lawyers have spent weeks reviewing documents related to numerous subjects, including Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey, and his role in July in drafting a misleading statement to The New York Times about Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016.

Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors have indicated that they plan to ask detailed questions about that statement, written aboard Air Force One, which withheld the purpose of the June 2016 meeting: to get damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government’s efforts to help Mr. Trump.

Some of Mr. Trump’s associates remain suspicious of the special counsel and his team of aggressive prosecutors.

“While it would be good to clear the air on this entire issue so that the president can focus on governing, it presupposes that Mueller is an honest broker, and that he would not take nothing and make it into something, which would be my concern,” said Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser.

Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump’s, said the White House should challenge Mr. Mueller if he investigates anything beyond whether Mr. Trump or his associates colluded with the Russian campaign to disrupt the election.

But White House officials say they do not want a repeat of some of the tactics used in the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton battled an independent counsel in court and in the media as the investigation dragged on for years. Since Mr. Cobb joined the White House, Mr. Trump’s team has significantly muted its criticism of Mr. Mueller.

One sign of the White House’s willingness to cooperate is that officials are strongly considering letting Mr. McGahn speak to investigators about his private conversations with Mr. Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Many presidents insist that conversations with their White House counsel be kept secret under the principle of executive privilege, but Mr. McGahn is seen by some as a witness who could be helpful to Mr. Trump.

Mr. McGahn was involved in the discussions about firing Mr. Comey, and officials believe he would say that Mr. Trump was warned that firing Mr. Comey would only prolong the Russia investigation. Lawyers believe that would help make the case that Mr. Trump was not trying to obstruct justice when he fired the F.B.I. director.

Even as the White House pushes for a swift resolution of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, administration officials are bracing for fallout from the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors have signaled that they intend to indict Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, who is under scrutiny for tax and foreign lobbying matters.

But lawyers in the case say they see no evidence yet that Mr. Manafort will face charges of conspiring with Russia to disrupt the election.

The White House also hopes for a favorable report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian election interference and several related matters. The committee’s leaders said this week that they planned to release a public report about their findings.

That report could be finished before Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Although committee leaders said they would leave any criminal matters to the Justice Department, a determination by the committee that none of Mr. Trump’s associates assisted the Russian campaign would be a boon for the White House even if Mr. Mueller refuses to publicly clear Mr. Trump.

“They want them to write a report saying ‘no collusion,’” said Ms. Van Gelder, the defense lawyer. “And then they can let Mueller twist in the wind.”","Hoping to Have Trump Cleared, Legal Team Eases Resistance to Inquiry",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/trump-russia-legal.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

In an email, Mr. Guglielmi said the punishment was consistent with that in “other cases in which officers engaged in potential political activity while on duty and in uniform.” This year an officer was reprimanded for displaying a “Make America Great Again” hat in a squad car, he said.

“Police officers must serve and protect people on both sides of any given issue,” Mr. Guglielmi said. “They can’t effectively do that if they are perceived to take one side over another. So when officers are on duty and wearing the uniform, there are no sides, just service to anyone who needs them.”

Asked whether that meant the officers who posed with Ms. Clark would not have been reprimanded if they had taken the photo while off duty and out of uniform, he said, “Absolutely.”

The photo was particularly resonant in Chicago, a city where the Justice Department found in January that the police had frequently violated civil rights; where civil rights groups filed a lawsuit in June alleging police abuses; where protests erupted over the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald; where an officer was convicted in August for shooting two black teenagers in a car that was driving away from him. The city’s police and politicians have been trying in various ways to gain residents’ trust.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters on Tuesday that he supported the decision to reprimand the officers, and that the Police Department’s policy was consistent. But he acknowledged that the officers “were somewhat betwixt, between two different aspirations”: the desire to follow department rules and the desire to improve relations between the police and the public, The Sun-Times reported.

Kneeling took on popular significance as a form of protest in 2016, when the National Football League player Colin Kaepernick did it during the national anthem. But when President Trump denounced it last week, what had been isolated actions exploded into a national display of defiance, with players from New York to Indianapolis to Los Angeles dropping to their knees on the sidelines of their Sunday games.

In their photo, Ms. Clark and the two officers paired kneeling with another symbol of protest, made famous by the American runners John Carlos and Tommie Smith on the medal podium at the 1968 Summer Olympics: raised fists and, from Ms. Clark, a downward gaze.

Shaub Jr., a former director of the Office of Government Ethics, said of the agency’s action. He questioned why such a blanket exception for more than 330,000 agency employees should exist when the law allows waivers for individuals or even classes of individuals, like those teaching courses. Invoking the waiver also requires public hearings, he said.

Most troubling to Mr. Shaub, now senior counsel at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, is that the move seems like an attempt by the executive branch to overrule the legislative branch. “They are saying the statute is unreasonable, but that’s not for them to say,” he said of agency officials.

Curtis Cashour, a V.A. spokesman, said officials had focused on the ethics law after the agency’s inspector general investigated complaints this year that two V.A. employees were teaching at a for-profit institution. There were no significant conflicts and a waiver was ultimately granted, he said, but the report led to worries among many employees about the impact of more rigorous enforcement.

“Our response was aimed at easing the concerns of numerous V.A. employees,” Mr. Cashour said in an email, adding that the ethics law had been superseded by subsequent conflict-of-interest statutes.

One concern of critics is that officials at the organization’s upper levels could be making decisions about a college in which they have a financial interest, like permitting a school with a record of abuses to recruit at military bases. Another is that people advising veterans about their educational benefits could steer students to a particular school because they were on the payroll.

“There’s no good that can come from allowing colleges to have unseemly financial entanglements with V.A. employees,” Carrie Wofford, director of Veterans Education Success, a nonprofit advocacy group. “Congress enacted a zero tolerance for financial conflicts of interest for V.A. employees precisely because Congress uncovered massive fraud by for-profit colleges targeting veterans.”

She added that “student veterans were already facing an aggressive rollback of their protections under the Trump administration’s Education Department.”

Two months ago, the Republican-led Senate Appropriations Committee issued a report during its debate over the military budget instructing the department to review the statute — but its concern was that the current rules “may be inadequate to identify conflicts of interest that can develop” because of gifts or expensive meals.

Veterans are particularly valuable as potential students: There are limits on the federal funds that for-profit schools can receive, but money from the G.I. Bill is not counted.

Even before last year’s presidential election, some of the biggest veterans and military organizations were urging the department to better monitor for-profit colleges that were misleading veterans about the costs and benefits of enrolling, and violating legal and regulatory standards.

And a report issued in July by the director of the agency’s Education Service found that financial issues involving tuition and fees were by far the leading complaint among students who had called the agency’s G.I. Bill hotline since 2014.

Some ethics experts disagreed with the department’s contention that other federal statutes made the ethics law unnecessary, saying the agency’s rule sets a higher bar, requiring, for example, more public review.

Dozens of other agencies also have supplemental ethics rules that have been written to address potential problems specific to those agencies.

Under the guise of protecting religious freedom and moral sensibilities, the Trump administration is making it harder for women to get access to birth control. On Friday, it rolled back an Obama-era rule requiring most employers to provide their employees with birth control coverage without co-payments. The mandate, established under the Affordable Care Act, has helped millions of women avoid unwanted pregnancy by eliminating out-of-pockets costs for contraception.

Under new rules, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Treasury and Labor will make it easier for employers to deny contraception coverage if they have a “religious or moral objection” to doing so. Further, the departments have made it harder for women who are denied birth control coverage to get no-cost contraception directly from insurance companies, under a process established by the previous administration.

If that were not bad enough, officials made the changes effective immediately. The administration claimed, absurdly, that the rule had to be issued quickly because the normal process of seeking public comment before acting would be “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” It used other specious arguments to justify its decision — asserting, for instance, that coverage of contraception could lead to more “risky sexual behavior” among some teenagers and young women.

These regulatory rollbacks will almost surely reverse years of progress. The percentage of reproductive-age women who faced out-of-pocket costs for oral contraceptives, for example, fell to less than 4 percent by 2014 from more than 20 percent just two years earlier, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. One study estimates that women are saving about $1.4 billion on the pill. The mandate to cover birth control is also very popular; 68 percent of people say they support it.

The Obama administration, knowing that right-wing groups would seize on any pretext to limit access to birth control and other reproductive health services, carefully exempted churches, mosques and other houses of worship from the mandate. Later, under pressure from religious nonprofit organizations, officials also created a process that allowed those groups to opt out of paying for birth control coverage. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that closely held for-profit companies could also deny contraceptive coverage to employees on religious grounds, in a case brought by Hobby Lobby, the arts and crafts retailer.

The new Trump rules go much further than the Hobby Lobby ruling by effectively allowing any business, university or other organization to opt out, without having to notify the government that it is doing so. That puts hundreds of thousands of women at risk of losing benefits. Under the system created by the Obama administration, when an employer chose not to pay for birth control, employees were provided coverage directly by insurance companies at no cost to the beneficiary. That system will now become optional for employers.

The Trump administration says, with no evidence whatsoever, that its new rules will have no effect on “over 99.9 percent of the 165 million women in the United States.” It further argues that low-income women will still be able to get subsidized or free contraception through community health programs and government health programs. Left unsaid is that the administration has made no secret of its desire to substantially cut government spending on programs like these. Several public interest groups, like the Center for Reproductive Rights, the National Women’s Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, say they plan to challenge the Trump rules in court.

Making matters worse, 911 still does not work, officials said.

“What do you think? There has to have been deaths,” said Dr. Rafael Rodríguez-Mercado, Puerto Rico’s health secretary. “I can’t give you a number, but we have to be conscious and realistic. To say no would be a lie.”

So far, seven regional hub hospitals are taking in patients. The island’s dialysis patients are also getting care. But none of it is easy. Hospitals should be required to have backup generators, diesel, a stockpile of medication and satellite phones, the doctor added. Even with those precautions, problems could arise. There is enough diesel on the island, but a shortage of gas tanker drivers — some cannot get to their jobs — and working gas stations. In Lares, the mayor, Roberto Pagan, said the municipal hospital almost had to close yesterday because it ran out of diesel fuel.

“We have been putting out fires,” Dr. Rodríguez-Mercado said. “The hospitals call you and say, ‘I have two hours of diesel left.’”

The potential for a public health crisis is a big concern, he said. Rats and decomposing animals can spread disease, the doctor added. Without running water, people are probably not washing their hands or boiling water often enough, or cooking their food well enough. This could lead to gastrointestinal outbreaks.

“What worries me is the sincere possibility of epidemics,” Dr. Rodríguez-Mercado added.

High mosquito counts on the island could also lead to a resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases, like Zika, dengue and chikungunya, doctors said.

A shortage of open pharmacies is another stressor, especially for the chronically ill and elderly residents. Most pharmacies in Puerto Rico remain closed, although they are slowly beginning to reopen. A CVS spokesman said that 21 out of 25 Puerto Rico-based CVS stores are now open, including 17 pharmacies. The first one reopened last Thursday. A Walgreens spokesman said about half of the island’s 120 stores are open and running on generators, but that hours vary. The stores are also receiving supplies of medication.

But many pharmacies in Puerto Rico are independently owned. With so many people pleading for medication, some pharmacists who know their clients are dispensing drugs without the required prescriptions or refill bottles.

Hospitals still have adequate supplies, and so do many of the open pharmacies, but there are concerns they may run out because suppliers are unable to get to them, said Dr. Victor M. Ramos Otero, the president of the College of Doctors and Surgeons of Puerto Rico.

Even when people find the drugs, they often cannot pay for them. Without electricity, A.T.M.s do not work and stores cannot accept credit cards or process insurance plans. That is what happened to José Castillo when he showed up at the Express Care Pharmacy in Santurce, a San Juan neighborhood, on Tuesday, hoping for a refill on the anti-depressants that help him sleep.

Pharmacy workers were outside, tending to customers on the sidewalk. The manager, Yanissa Serrano, told Mr. Castillo the pills cost 25 cents each — cash only.

“But I don’t have the money,” he said.

Her patience worn out, Ms. Serrano erupted.

“I would have been able to give you your medicine, but three times they robbed my generator. Three! Thanks to the fine people of this neighborhood,” she shouted. “I lost my house. I lost everything. I could be home tending to my apartment, but instead I’m here providing this service to the community, and this is how they repay me.”

Before Mr. Trump’s announcement, Representative Luis Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, said on the House floor that, “what I fear is that the federal government is not stepping up as fully and as quickly as we must.”

“This emergency cannot just be treated by Congress, the president, FEMA and the other agencies as just another storm,” he added.

But Mr. Trump defended the response by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday.

Now, Energiewende is at a crossroads. Chancellor Angela Merkel may have won a fourth term as Germany’s leader after elections last month, but her party lost sway. She must form a coalition with the left-leaning Greens and the pro-business Free Liberals, parties that have diametrically opposing views, including on environmental policies.

How such a diverse group comes together will affect whether Germany reaches its goal for carbon emissions. It wants a cut of 40 percent, compared to 1990 levels, by 2020, and of 95 percent by 2050.

The clean energy movement has deep roots in Germany.

Alternative sources of electric power are flourishing in the Allgäu, a region of rolling pastures, pine forests and domed churches that is home to Ms. Zinnecker’s family-owned farm.

In Wildpoldsried, a village of 2,600 a short drive from the farm, around €40 million has been invested over the years — much of it by residents — into an array of renewable power sources and improvements in energy efficiency. The brightly painted, wood-trimmed houses are heated cheaply by generators fueled by methane gas from cow manure, and wind turbines nearly 500 feet tall provide electricity from the hillsides.

Günter Mögele, Wildpoldsried’s deputy mayor and energy coordinator, said that the village’s decision in the late 1990s to focus on renewable energy had paid off.

Overall, the village generates about seven times as much energy as it consumes, and the surplus is sold to the grid. The income from solar panels on public buildings is fed back into the public purse. It is often doled out to subsidize residents’ shifts to green power, and to reduce fees for the local music club and sports facility.

But renewable energy subsidies are financed through electric bills, meaning that Energiewende is a big part of the reason prices for consumers have doubled since 2000.

These big increases “are absolutely not O.K.,” said Thomas Engelke, team leader for construction and energy at the Federation of German Consumer Organizations, an umbrella organization of consumer groups.

The higher prices have had political consequences.

The far-right party Alternative for Germany, which won enough support in the recent elections to enter Parliament, has called for an “immediate exit” from Energiewende. The party, known by its German initials AfD, sees the program as a “burden” on German households, and many supporters have come into its fold in part because of the program’s mounting costs.

Julian Hermneuwöhner is one such voter. Mr. Hermneuwöhner, a 27-year-old computer science student, said his family paid an additional €800 a year because of Energiewende.

“But it hasn’t brought lower CO 2 emissions,” he said. “It’s frustrating that we’re paying so much more, because the country hasn’t gotten anything for it.”

As a clean energy pioneer, Germany has not always seen the results it desired from its heavy spending.

For instance, the country has focused on cleaning up electric power generation, with some success. About one-third of German electricity now comes from renewable sources, a fivefold increase since 2000. In the United States, that figure was about 15 percent last year. Britain generates about a quarter of its power from renewables, and France about 19 percent.

But that progress has been undone somewhat by the government’s decision to accelerate its phase out of nuclear power after the 2011 disaster in Fukushima, Japan. That has made the country more reliant on its sizable fleet of coal-fired power stations, which account for the bulk of emissions from electricity generation.

The country has yet to address the transport industry, where emissions have increased as the economy boomed and more cars and trucks hit the road. Unlike Britain and France, Germany has not set a date to end the sale of diesel and gasoline cars.

Recent political experience does not bode well for Germany. The so-called grand coalition between Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, which governed from 2013 until the recent elections, was bogged down with so many competing interests that it was unable to push ahead on energy policy.

Advocates of Energiewende charge that Germany is in danger of falling behind rivals like China and the United States in the potentially vast, and fast-growing, business of developing and exporting clean-energy technologies. And without new direction, they say, the country will most likely fail to meet its carbon emissions targets.

How the government comes to terms with these problems will be crucial for the sector and for consumers.

Germany has already moved to bring subsidies under control. In particular, it has driven down costs by introducing an auction system for new renewables projects — though it is still on the hook for subsidy payments for the 20-year life of existing projects.

A bigger issue may be that Germany has already taken some of the easier steps in its energy transition by making industry more energy efficient and building up renewables.

Further progress will require taking on tougher targets. That would mean challenging the politically powerful auto and coal industries, including unions and companies, that have opposed plant shutdowns.

“Some of the low-hanging fruit might be gone now,” said Tim Boersma, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “It is becoming clear how challenging making this overall transition is.”","Germany’s Shift to Green Power Stalls, Despite Huge Investments",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/energy-environment/german-renewable-energy.html

After the “X Case” of 1992, in which a 14-year-old rape victim was prevented from traveling to Britain for an abortion, voters passed a constitutional amendment that left the ban intact but recognized a woman’s right to travel abroad. Another amendment, also passed in 1992, permitted Irish women to obtain information on abortion services overseas, which had been prohibited by the state.

Much of the impetus for the new constitutional effort stems from the case of Savita Halappanavar, 31, an Indian-born dentist who died of sepsis after miscarrying in a Galway hospital in 2012. Having learned that her 17-week-old fetus would not live, Ms. Halappanavr repeatedly asked the staff to terminate the pregnancy to relieve her own worsening condition. She was told that her pregnancy could not be terminated while the fetus had a heartbeat.

An inquiry determined that recent interpretations of the Eighth Amendment had found therapeutic terminations to be permissible, but the medical staff’s uncertainty over the law and the lack of clear legislation contributed to a delay in her treatment.

The case helped build momentum for a citizens’ constitutional assembly, which this year recommended that the Eighth Amendment be repealed or amended, and that legislation be introduced to allow abortion, effectively on request.

A number of social and economic factors have made contemporary Ireland a more liberal country that the one that passed the Eighth Amendment. Not least among these is an erosion in the status of the Roman Catholic Church, weakened by scandals over the sexual abuse of children and the treatment of marginalized women in bleak church-run laundries, where many died and were buried anonymously.

The 1983 campaign to ban abortion, backed by bishops and Catholic lay groups, represented the high-water mark for institutional Catholic power in Ireland, coming just four years after Pope John Paul II drew huge crowds in the first papal visit to the country. While a significant majority describe themselves as Catholic, few now adhere to the church’s teachings in matters like divorce, contraception, sex outside marriage or gay rights.

An Irish Times poll in May showed that large majorities supported legal changes allowing abortion in cases of rape or serious risk to the physical or mental health of the mother, but less than a quarter of people supported changes making it legal under all circumstances.

Leaders of the Repeal the Eight campaign are likely to be buoyed by another liberal constitutional effort, the 2015 referendum that legalized same-sex marriage, though the country’s well-organized anti-abortion activists will find much in the polls to encourage their own hopes.

Doomsayers argue that Uber epitomizes the problem: Yes it creates new jobs, but they are mainly low-wage, part-time and without much in the way of benefits. Even the better jobs, like self-driving-auto engineer, are so few that they only widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.

No doubt, the boom in jobs has not yet been accompanied by a meaningful increase in wages for most workers. But one reason goes back to demographics: More highly paid older workers are retiring, holding down the average wage. Another is the opening of China, which flooded the global market with new workers — but that one-time impact is receding. Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and a labor economist, has been skeptical about signs of improving wage growth. But she noted in late September that by some measures, wages “have clearly picked up.”

The percentage of companies that report difficulty finding qualified workers is back to levels last hit before the Great Recession, and many have responded with plans to increase wages and signing bonuses — “possible harbingers of stronger wage gains to come,” according to Ms. Yellen. The latest jobs report confirmed her optimism, with hourly wages rising 2.9 percent from last year, the fastest rate yet recorded in this recovery.

The dire view taken by economic populists and writers denouncing the rise of the robots is no longer the view of most American households. The share of workers who are in part-time jobs has actually been falling since 2010, and the number of reluctant part-time workers — those who would prefer full-time work — has fallen to five million from around nine million. The number of discouraged workers — people who have given up looking — has fallen back to levels last seen before the 2008 recession.

At the same time, the share of households who say “jobs are plentiful” is at the highest level in nearly two decades. A new Pew Research survey shows that most Americans do not think automation threatens their own jobs. And over the past 20 years, at least some of the industries that have created the most jobs are also quite well paid, including professional services, management consulting and computer systems design.

United States consumer confidence, which often reflects trends in the job market, is at a peak surpassed only a few times since the early 1960s.

There are still reasonable questions about whether many jobs of the future will be well paid. But there is no evidence so far to support forecasts of a nearly jobless future. If robots threatened human labor, human joblessness would be growing. But it’s not. In fact, since 2008, job growth has been strongest in countries like Germany and Japan, which deploy the most robots.

The pain being felt right now is a symptom of rapid churn, as old industries retreat and new ones emerge. It is no accident that dystopian visions of a jobless future are often reported from Rust Belt cities or rural towns, where manufacturing is indeed dying and good jobs are far from plentiful. But at least some of the workers laid off by shuttered Main Street stores have been hired by Amazon warehouses, which can pay higher wages — all because they work with robots that make them much more productive.

Today, many politicians and editorial writers frame every policy proposal, from cutting taxes to raising trade barriers, in terms of the number of jobs it will create. But they should recognize that while the world faces many problems, from rising inequality to angry economic populism, job creation is not one of them.","No, That Robot Will Not Steal Your Job",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/opinion/sunday/no-that-robot-will-not-steal-your-job.html

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I’m not sure whether it stems from a solving, constructing, or editing mind-set, but I’m always fascinated by the variety of “circled letter” themes in puzzles. Circles can highlight letters within a single entry that spell a word, whether they’re adjacent or spread out. At times, they can be arranged to form images the solver must identify. There have even been puzzles where the circles were used to bring attention to noncircled letters.

Thus, with nearly infinite theme possibilities of this type, it’s no surprise that Jacob Stulberg has come up with an interesting “circled letters” puzzle based on a fresh revealer. Let’s take a look:

Today’s Theme

Mr. Stulberg has made the revealer, THREE-RING CIRCUS, almost come to life: the grid contains three common circus performers arranged in a “ring” as indicated by the clusters of circled letters. When read clockwise, they spell out GLASS EATER, FIRE DANCER, and WIRE WALKER.

This is a very impressive feat. Not only did Mr. Stulberg have to find three circus performers large enough to form into rings, but each one had to be hidden within normal entries so that the surrounding fill could still be smooth.

Normally, when constructing a crossword, each letter has two constraints: it must work with both Across and Down entries. However, for a puzzle like this, the requirement of spelling out a circular phrase serves as a third constraint that makes filling the grid exponentially more difficult. Sure, we have tougher bits of fill like KER, LATH and ASSAI in the bottom-right corner alone ... but these are small prices to pay for such an intricate theme.

National Parks Struggle With a Mounting Crisis: Too Many Visitors

Image Credit

The rocky shorelines, shifting deserts and winding canyons of the country’s 59 national parks have been hallmarks of American vacations for generations.

But the number of park visitors has reached an unprecedented level, leaving many tourists frustrated and many environmentalists concerned about the toll of overcrowding.

Image Credit

In 2016, the National Park Service tracked a record 331 million visits, and after a busy summer, the system is likely to surpass that number this year. In August alone, some 40 million people came through park service gates.

Shuttle buses at Zion National Park, in southwest Utah, filled like sweaty subway cars. Selfie-takers clogged the slender path through the Narrows slot canyon, one of the park’s best-known attractions. And at the top of Angels Landing, an iconic trail of switchbacks on the east side of the park, some portable toilets were marked off with a sign: “Due to extreme use, these toilets have reached capacity.”

Zion is among the most visited parks in the system and is particularly prone to crowding because many of its most popular sites sit in a narrow six-mile canyon. In 2016, about 4.3 million people visited, up 60 percent from a decade ago.

So this year, park managers announced they were considering a first for any national park: requiring reservations for entry. A final decision is expected in 2018.

“We don’t have a choice,” said Jack Burns, who has worked in Zion since 1982. “We have to do something. If this going to remain a place of special importance for generations, we have to do something now.”

The National Park Service was created in 1916 to protect the country’s growing system of parks and monuments. Its mandate is to conserve scenery and wildlife while also protecting visitor enjoyment for generations to come. For years, the lack of a reservation system for park entry aligned with the service’s ethos of democracy and discovery: Anyone could come, pretty much anytime. (The service has long required permits for hiking in more remote areas.)

But lately, both visitors and nature are suffering. Mr. Burns, who is on a team that is considering a reservation system, said some people showed up for a vacation they had planned for months, spent a day in the gridlock and turned around. Rangers, stressed by the frustrated masses, have started a monthly meeting to discuss “visitor use” that some say has turned into a group-therapy session.

Image Credit

And Zion’s delicate desert ecosystem has been battered by tourists, some of whom wash diapers in the Virgin River, scratch their names into boulders and fly drone cameras through once quiet skies. The park has about 25 miles of developed trails. But over time, rangers have mapped about 600 miles of visitor-made paths, which damage vegetation and soil and take a toll on wildlife.

The story is similar at parks from Yosemite in California to Acadia in Maine. And the crowding problem comes as the system faces the dual threat of a funding shortage and climate change.

Image Credit

Image Credit

The park system has a maintenance backlog of more than $11 billion and President Trump has proposed a 13 percent cut to the service.

At the same time, park officials have identified the heat and floods of climate change as one of the system’s greatest perils. In Zion, as maximum temperatures in the summer have risen, the heat-intolerant American pika , a tiny mammal related to rabbits, has disappeared. Rangers call it a sign of what is likely to come : smaller streams, more frequent droughts and other shifts in the ecosystem.

This summer, administrators at Zion submitted three proposed visitor plans to the public.

One option would require people to make an online reservation before arrival, and would set a yet-to-be-specified limit on visitors. The second option would require reservations only for certain areas. The third option would be to make no changes.

About 1,600 people sent in comments, and the park plans to send out a revised round of proposals for public review. Superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh will make the final decision.

Some have expressed opposition to the reservation idea, including a group that founded the website stopzionreservations.org .

Image Credit

Mr. Burns said he favored a reservation policy. He recalled the days when he would jump in a car and pull up to parks across the West with no plans.

When he first came to the park in the 1980s, he was a young employee at the lodge, and he wrote a letter home. “I’m living in no-man’s-land,” he told his parents. He could hike for hours, even days, without seeing a soul, and he remembered a constant sensitivity to the changing light on the canyons, the brilliant green of the trees, the emerald water of the Virgin River.

Today, he said, when he finds solitude, it is usually accompanied by the distant rumble of the shuttle bus.

“There is only one Zion National Park,” he said to those struggling to see a need for limiting access. “And it’s sacred. Its beauty is sacred.”

For many Saudi women, gaining the right to drive is not the end of the struggle.","Built on an alliance between a royal family and the descendants of an ultraconservative Muslim cleric, Saudi Arabia has struggled throughout its history with how to reconcile modernization with loyalty to religious heritage.

That debate heated up as oil wealth enriched the state, bringing in unfamiliar customs and technologies like television, public education and automobiles.

Over time, competing camps dug in around women and the right to drive.

For liberals, the driving ban was a blot on the national brand that was hampering modernization and weakening the economy.

Conservatives, including powerful clerics employed by the state, thought that allowing women to drive would be a crack in the dam that would allow secularism to flood in, washing away the kingdom’s unique Islamic identity.

The royal decree announced on Tuesday handed victory in that battle to the reformers, who had gained an advantage in recent years because of demographics, economics and the country’s young leadership, analysts said.

Saudi leaders, who have been criticized for the war in Yemen, the blockade of Qatar and a range of human rights issues, clearly hoped the step would help the kingdom’s reputation.

“There is no wrong time to do the right thing,” Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to Washington and a son of King Salman, told reporters after the change was announced.

The government also worked behind the scenes to control the message.

At least eight prominent women’s activists received calls and text messages from Saudi security officials warning them not to tweet or speak to the news media about the issue, according to three Saudi activists.

They presumed the government did not want to give credit to activists for prompting the change and spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize the women — or themselves.

Many women cheered the decision, calling it a final victory in a long campaign for social change.

Manal al-Sherif, who was jailed for having posted videos of herself driving and who wrote a book about her activism, said her life had tracked the wider social changes in the kingdom.

Born into a poor conservative family in Mecca, Ms. Sherif, now 38, was taught that women were to remain at home and that good Muslims were to avoid “infidels” who did not share their faith, she said by phone from Australia, where she now lives.

Her worldview changed when as a university student in the Red Sea port city of Jidda, she saw women who did not cover their faces in public and even had boyfriends, though covertly.

Then she got a job with the state oil company, Saudi Aramco. On its sprawling compound women enjoy greater freedoms than elsewhere in the kingdom, including the ability to drive.

She said that the status of women in Saudi Arabia had been used by the government over the years to placate conservatives.

“Our rights as women were always used in a political game, and that is what we wanted to stop,” she said. “That really kept the country behind.”

She credited King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, another of the king’s sons, with making the decisions necessary for the kingdom to advance.

“The government took the right decision,” she said. “Finally, they had the guts to say, ‘We were wrong.’”

It was difficult to immediately gauge reactions to the rescinded ban among more conservative Saudis. The government recently arrested more than two dozen people, including prominent clerics, some of whom had criticized government policies.

Three clerics employed by the government declined to comment when asked for their thoughts on the rescinded ban.

“Hahahahahahaha,” one responded on Whats App, offering no further comment.

Social media provided a glimpse.

By midafternoon on Wednesday, the Arabic hashtag “The people reject women driving” had appeared on 335,000 tweets, while the hashtag “The king is victorious for women driving” had appeared in only 33,700 tweets, according to Twitter.

But many users used the hashtags to join discussions, even if they disagreed with their message.

Even longtime campaigners said they expected some resistance.

“We’re a religious country,” said Fawziah Al-Bakr, a professor who has been campaigning for the right to drive for nearly three decades.

But religion had nothing to do with the issue, she said, noting that women in other predominately Muslim countries like Egypt, Sudan and Pakistan have been driving for a long time.

“All these women are Muslim and yet they are driving,” she said. “Not being able to drive has nothing to do with Islam.”

Previous reforms have been met with great resistance in the kingdom. Conservatives campaigned against the introduction of television, fearing it would fill Saudi homes with un-Islamic images.

Now many Saudi clerics have their own shows and are enthusiastic users of social media.

They also tried to prevent girls’ education.

Now many of their daughters are studying in Saudi universities, and even in the United States.

For many Saudi women, gaining the right to drive is not the end of the struggle. Many hope the government’s next step will be to lift its so-called “guardianship laws,” which require women to have the permission of a male “guardian” in order to get a passport, travel abroad or undergo certain medical procedures.

That could take time, but Ms. AbuSulayman, the television presenter, said the trajectory was clear.

About two thirds of the kingdom’s 22 million citizens are under 30 and they will grow up seeing women differently than their elders, she said. Many will not remember when women could not drive.

Mr. Nadella said that immigrants — and not just those with highly valued skills — help improve competition. He said he himself had benefited from “enlightened” immigration policy that allowed him to study and work in the United States.

“That’s what makes America exceptional, both being the place where the talent comes and also being the beacon of hope for the people who need hope,” said Mr. Nadella, who early in his employment at Microsoft had given up his green card for a temporary H-1B work visa that allowed him to bring his wife, Anu, to the United States from India.

Like many tech companies, Microsoft has voiced opposition to President Trump’s decision to begin rolling back the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy. Microsoft said it would cover the legal costs for any worker threatened with deportation.

Mr. Nadella also addressed a series of business flops — including a disastrous acquisition of the phone maker Nokia and Microsoft’s late start in development of cloud computing services — that pushed it out of the top tier of white-hot tech companies like Facebook, Apple and Google.

But recently, Microsoft has regained traction, making some of the most innovative personal computers in the industry, experimenting with artificial intelligence and augmented reality and testing autonomous vehicles. Microsoft’s share price has more than doubled during Mr. Nadella’s tenure as chief executive.

But there is still room to grow. Revenue from Microsoft’s Azure cloud service soared 97 percent in its fourth quarter, but the business still lags behind the offering of its nearby rival, Amazon.

Mr. Nadella said that companies cannot expect to “hit every trend or catch every wave,” noting that Microsoft faced “a new existential threat” every five years throughout its history. He said that while “zero sum competition” exists in the industry, he also values partnerships.

Amazon and Microsoft, based a short drive apart in Washington State, compete for both talent and business. But the two companies recently paired up to integrate Amazon’s Alexa voice-controlled digital assistant with its Microsoft counterpart Cortana.

“I do not view it primarily through a competitive lens — technology today is much more pervasive, and the top five companies by market cap are all very different,” he said. “The worst mistake I can make is to assume that we should do what they’re doing and not be true to our identity.”

Driving rain, withering heat and sawdust storms come with the job. This used to be men’s work. Not anymore.



Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively women’s work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.

Her conversation with Evelyn Nieves has been condensed and edited.

Q.

What drew you to this topic?

A.

I was passing by this park at the entrance of the town, an immense expanse of coal-black soil, and hundreds of busy people around smoke-filled ovens. I then noticed that they were mostly women. I was intrigued by the contrast between the harshness of the place and the presence of these women, adolescents and little children.

Photo

Q.

Do you know why the industry has gone from all male to almost all female?

A.

At first, this work was exclusively masculine. Women began to become interested when Makandjé, the oldest of these women and leader of the Women Coal Producers Association of the Parc du Pont, dared to venture into this field. She first started assisting male producers, then started her own oven. Today, she has inspired hundreds of women follow her example. Men progressively deserted the charcoal field. Now, most of the men we meet around these fields are wood sellers or carpenters. Charcoal fields are usually near wood manufacturers.

Q.

What did you witness in your three years of documenting the “work of smoke” that stands out?

A.

Some women, like Makandjé, are widows; some are part of a polygamous marriage or have been repudiated. Except for one, Awa, they have no other qualifications, and have no choice but start to work in this field to survive.

All the decisions are made together. I was impressed by the solidarity and unity between the women. They support each other. They have a joint financial arrangement where they contribute equally to save money. I was inspired by the strength, the resilience and the dignity they have.

Q.

What are they made of? Who builds them?

A.

The ovens are made of wood and sawdust left by the carpenters and wood manufacturers. The women build them themselves. The last day of my stay one of the women invited me to work with them. I collected the trash wood from manufacturers that they sometimes use because they can’t afford to pay for good wood. Then we placed the wood in a very specific way to make the oven. It takes a whole day or more to build an oven, depending on the size, and each oven is made for only one time. They can’t be reused.

Photo

Q.

What are some of the hazards?

A.

The sawdust is very light and it is a powder and as the place is very windy, this sawdust enters the eyes and the nose, and sticks on the skin. The eyes are irritated. My eyes and nose were irritated the first day, so I had to wear glasses and a mask to avoid the smoke and the wind with sawdust.

Then there is a lot of heat on the floor from all these ovens which are on fire underneath.

After when the charcoal is ready, they break the oven and collect the hot charcoal and put into bags with their hands. The charcoal is sharp and hot. They need gloves.

So they need masks, proper work shoes, boots for example, and gloves. They do not have enough tools to work, since it’s too expensive for them to buy one for each of them. They share their tools. During the rainy season, the mix of mud and sawdust becomes a sort of moving mud. They also need boots. And as they do not have raincoats, some of them protect themselves with pieces of plastic they find or go without protection from the rain.

After trying to work with them for a day I got sick. The work is physically hard. I couldn’t do it for more than two hours. Everything is done by hand.

Photo

Q.

What do you plan to do with this project?

A.

This project, made possible with the support of the Magnum Foundation Emergency Grant in 2016 and the Prince Claus Fund, is finished. I am very happy because next month, I will go back to San Pedro to introduce the team of “The Poplin Project,” a socially responsible brand of artisanal textiles that wants to empower women and to create a future for underprivileged kids by working with small local organizations and cooperatives. This year, 33 percent of their profit will go to the women’s cooperative of charcoal producers of “Sissi Barra” in San Pedro. The aim is to finance a drinking water system, to build a safe recreation room for the women and children and to help the young girls get an education.

Eero Saarinen gave the world visually-stunning works that influenced modern design and challenged conventional wisdom, a legacy that’s well worth exploring.","There were also several other notable design elements. A nearby cafeteria had orange vinyl flooring, something that I hadn’t seen in years. There were also orange banquettes, giving the eating area a personalized, intimate feel, while retaining the eccentric color coordination. The nearby executive dining room had a bold blue design, with a stunning hexagonal wood ceiling and an excellent lakefront view.

The crown jewel of the nearby Research and Development building is its circular staircase, designed by the architect Kevin Roche, a prominent Saarinen collaborator. The staircase gets its structural support from thin rods that are anchored at the top and bottom, creating another “floating” effect. The hallways leading to offices are generally long and narrow, but remain vibrant spaces since the design enables frequent sightings of co-workers.

Walking out on a patio at the Research and Development building, the blazing sun was contributing to an unbearable heat index. However, I got a great overview of much of the G.M. center, one that further revealed its carefully planned, linear layout.

Photo

The center originally contained 25 buildings, which were mostly built of curtain wall construction, with beams exposed on the exterior and glazed brick that deviated from the standard industrial look. Currently, there are 38 buildings across 710 acres. From Engineering to Design to Research and Development, with other departments in between, the G.M. center continues to thrive.

“It is amazing that General Motors is using buildings more than 60 years later for the same purpose,” Ms. Skarsgard said. “The entrance canopies pull you into the buildings, and they’re simple, clean and inviting.”

Next year, the company is slated to expand the General Motors Design studios, constructing a new building that will surround the Design Dome, along with a new parking garage. I couldn’t see the interior of the silver-topped dome since it is still hosts internal events, but it has a storied history. Many G.M. vehicles have been tested, inspected and approved at the dome, featuring models as old as the 1957 Chevy Bel Air and 1963 Corvette Sting Ray. The column-free interior was designed to be a grand showroom during a time when American automotive companies dominated the market share.

Saarinen was accomplished by the time his first few buildings opened at the G.M. center. Here was evidence that he wasn’t resting on his laurels, that his vision had kept him on the path to his goals. Saarinen sought to design at the highest levels while retaining creative control, which is why one of his last projects resonated with me so deeply.

Drive roughly an hour west of Warren and you’ll arrive in Ann Arbor, filled with quirky shops and collegiate charm. Eero Saarinen temporarily served as a design consultant for the North Campus development at the University of Michigan there and designed the Earl V. Moore Building, which opened in 1964 and houses much of what is now the School of Music, Theater and Dance.

When I approached the building, I was struck by the peacefulness of the surrounding area. I had driven past the bustling main campus closer to South State Street, but the North Campus was much quieter. I walked through the William K. and Delores S. Brehm Pavilion, the modern addition to the Moore building, and noticed several undergraduates taking their instruments into performance spaces and auditoriums. In the Saarinen-designed section, the wooden doors, well-placed brickwork and large clocks signaled his imprint: they are hallmarks of his architectural style.

Through a door left slightly ajar, I could see the sun starting to set, and hear the crickets starting to chirp. The Moore building, on hilly terrain and overlooking a small pond, inspired me to meditate. Saarinen wanted to connect people to nature, and I was proof of that.

Eero Saarinen fell ill while his university building was being constructed, and passed away in 1961 at only 51 years old. He was diagnosed with a brain tumor just weeks before his death and didn’t get to see the completion of the flight center, Dulles Airport, the Gateway Arch or the John Deere World Headquarters in Moline, Ill., among his other high-profile projects.

Today, the Saarinen imprint in Michigan continues to be widely revered. His works will continue to be models for future architects and designers. Eero Saarinen gave the world visually-stunning works that influenced modern design and challenged conventional wisdom, a legacy that’s well worth exploring.

But casting proved to be a challenge. Brisbane is the third-largest city in Australia, with a population of 2.27 million, but 78 percent of Greater Brisbane’s population speak only English at home and just 0.7 percent of the population speak Spanish.

“We were not bound by the specific casting conditions required of a professional production,” he said.

Mr. Ward said he and his team searched their local theater and community groups, contacted agents representing diverse actors and combed local hip-hop and salsa dance studios in search of cast members.

“While Brisbane has only a small Latinx community, and an even smaller community of Latinx musical theater performers,” Mr. Ward said, “we do have a rich and vast multicultural heritage, and this was proudly reflected in our casting of the work.”

But while one of the lead actresses, Stephie Da Silva, who was cast to play Vanessa, is Uruguayan, most of the other actors cast in top roles were not Latino and looked white. Usnavi, the character originally played by Mr. Miranda, was to be played by Jason Bentley.

The producers initially defended their casting decisions, pointing out in a statement that “50 percent of the cast identified with an ancestry other than Australian” — including Mr. Bentley, who is part Samoan.

But as the response to the show spread online and beyond, the producers decided to pull the plug.

Ms. Da Silva, the cast member who was born and raised in Uruguay, said she was disappointed to see the show canceled.

“This was a lesson for many,” she said, noting that minorities and actors involved in the show all ended up feeling hurt. She added: “It’s time to educate ourselves more when it comes to racial and cultural awareness.”

Criticism of Australia’s lack of diversity in media and the arts is increasingly common. In August, a Sydney-based women’s theater group, SheShakespeare, sparked a small firestorm when they posted their latest cast on Facebook. Again, they all appeared to be white.

“It’s really great to see so many white women get a chance,” commented Nakkiah Lui, an Australian Aboriginal writer and actress whose recent play, “Black Is the New White,” tackled some of Australia’s race issues.

Weekend Update’s Bit of the Week

The co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che both delivered pointed comic monologues that advocated for gun control.

Mr. Jost opened the segment by saying, “The investigation into the tragedy in Las Vegas this week has sparked a larger debate in America, between people who want common-sense gun control, and people who are wrong.”

He continued:

This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. The guy had 47 guns. No one should own 47 of anything. If you own 47 cats, you are not a responsible pet owner, you’re a crazy cat lady. And unlike with guns, the government will actually come and take your cats away because everyone agrees that’s insane. Also, this guy bought 33 of his guns in the past year, and that didn’t set off any kind of alert? If I buy $100 worth of Chick-fil-A, I get a text message from my bank that says, ‘Did you just purchase $100 worth of Chick-fil-A? Please, Colin, tell us this is fraud.’ How is no one keeping track of how many guns people own? There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos. And I get why. No one needs that many. If you have more than six dildos, it’s a clear sign you are training for something awful.

Mr. Che asked, “Why is it so hard to get gun control in this country?” His monologue continued:

“Who are these delicate snowflakes that we can’t just tell: ‘No, you’re not allowed to have 40 guns anymore, Earl. From now on, you can have one gun, max. And six bullets.’ If you can’t hit what you’re shooting with six bullets, then you don’t need to be shooting at it. Learn karate or use your words. I’m sick of this narrative that Americans just love guns so much. It’s not true. Seventy-eight percent of Americans don’t even own a gun. And 3 percent of Americans own 50 percent of all the guns in the country. That’s the problem: that whiny 3 percent that needs to feel secure all the time. That’s why I think we should do a buyback program. For every gun you trade in, we give you one half-inch of penis enlargement. That’s fair. If you trade in 10 guns, you get five more inches. And if women want to trade in their guns, don’t. Keep your guns. You’re probably going to need it to fight off all those men in spandex showing off their brand-new eight-inch penises.”

Mr. Che joked, “Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that he wants Congress to look into some proposals for gun control. But first he wants to look into this briefcase from the N.R.A.” Here, an onscreen graphic showed a National Rifle Association briefcase full of money.

Missing Subject of the Night

“S.N.L.,” which was hosted by the “Wonder Woman” actress Gal Gadot, conspicuously avoided the subject of Harvey Weinstein, the powerful film producer who is facing decades’ worth of sexual harassment accusations. The apparent reluctance of the late-night shows to address the issue — as of Friday night, only “The Daily Show” had made a single oblique reference to the accusations — has rankled some critics of these programs, who say it is hypocritical of them to have mocked figures like Bill O’Reilly and Roger Ailes of Fox News and even Mr. Trump for sexual harassment accusations while ignoring a prominent, politically liberal transgressor.

Kate McKinnon’s Role of the Week: Doing the ‘Gins-burn’

During “Weekend Update,” Ms. McKinnon reprised her role as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom she plays as a kind of saucy insult comedian. Talking about a gerrymandering case that the United States Supreme Court is considering, Ms. McKinnon said of Republicans, “Hello, we see what you’re doing. It’s like they’re at a cocktail party, they’re taking all the shrimp. And all the Democrats are left with is the sweaty cheddar. By the way, sweaty cheddar is what they called Steve Bannon in college. Ouch! That’s a nasty Gins-burn.”

Addressing Ms. Ginsburg’s own longevity, Ms. McKinnon said: “Joke’s on you. I made a deal with our female God that I would trade height for years. So in 2095 I’m going to be the size of a Playmobil, but I’ll still be kicking ass and taking Boniva.”

Pete Davidson’s Joke of the Night

In a “Weekend Update” routine, Mr. Davidson discussed his recent disclosure that he had been given a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, which he described as a form of depression. He talked about strategies he could use to keep himself healthy, among them: “If you’re in the cast of a late-night comedy show, it might help if they, you know, do more of your sketches,” he said. “The show is, like, eight hours long and there’s, like, 50 sketches a week. It seems weird you wouldn’t use one of them to fight mental illness, but I guess that’s not your style.”

When Mr. Jost suggested to Mr. Davidson that he should write more sketches, Mr. Davidson answered: “That won’t work. My sketches suck because they’re all written by a depressed person.”","‘S.N.L.’: Jason Aldean Is Surprise Guest, Singing Tom Petty’s ‘I Won’t Back Down’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/arts/television/snl-jason-aldean-gal-gadot.html

Google would like the measure it’s implementing this week to apply narrowly to price comparison shopping services.","The fine against Google in June was among the most aggressive moves against an American technology company taken anywhere in the world. It immediately confirmed Europe’s role as the Western world’s toughest regulator of digital services. But it has also prompted criticism of Brussels, which has been accused of unfairly targeting United States businesses, claims European officials deny.

Still, technology has been a focus of Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition commissioner. Along with other investigations into Google, the commission has also opened inquiries into tax avoidance, data privacy and abuse of market position, affecting American household names like Amazon, Apple and Facebook.

In the case of Google, rivals had long complained that the company gave itself an unfair advantage by automatically putting some of its services at the top of so-called specialized search results. Such search products, like restaurant and business reviews, are increasingly lucrative.

Under the plan presented Wednesday, Google will create a stand-alone unit for its shopping service. That unit will remain part of its overall business, but will operate separately and will be subject to regular monitoring by the European Commission. Rival price comparison services, like Germany’s Idealo and a Dutch comparison site called Vergelijk.nl, would earn money from merchants whose products, from refrigerators to electronic gadgets, they are advertising. But they would also pay Google to take up those spaces.

Customers across the 28 members of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, will be able to see those price comparison sites taking up the spots at the top of a search page where only Google Shopping had previously appeared.

“Google Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else,” said Mr. Verney.

The commission has said that Google met its deadline to offer concessions, but has not commented on whether the moves would actually bolster competition. Fines for failing to meet the Thursday deadline could have been as high as 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Google presented its plans to the commission at the end of August, but did not make them public until Wednesday.

Google would like the measure it’s implementing this week to apply narrowly to price comparison shopping services. But it faces complaints from rivals in other sectors as well, and they may see an opportunity for prying open Google’s formidable search platform.

Google already is facing two separate cases in Europe related to Android, its software for mobile devices, and to some of its advertising products. The company denies the accusations.

But even as Europe has pushed ahead with a series of antitrust charges against Google, the company has not faced the same scrutiny from regulators at home, giving cover to United States lawmakers and lobbyists accusing Europe of unfairly targeting American companies.

Still, Silicon Valley tech giants are facing shifting political winds at home, too.

American lawmakers increasingly worry about the expanding power of technology behemoths and, in particular, the role they may have played in the 2016 election. This shift has opened Google to attacks from both sides of the political spectrum on a wide range of issues, ranging from antitrust to privacy and public disclosure.

The risk of a regulatory crackdown is a significant one facing the company. It maintains a dominant position in online search, making the advertisements that run alongside its search results an indispensable part of marketing on the internet.

Any decision to separate traditional web search from other search-related functions, such as shopping for products, looking for travel bookings or seeking restaurant reviews, could reverse a profitable evolution of the company’s moneymaker.",Google Offers Concessions to Europe After Record Antitrust Fine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/business/google-eu-antitrust.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“The pictures online were completely inaccurate,” Ms. Ratliff said.

On Spring Street in NoLIta, a one-bedroom for $2,250 had slanted floors, and Ms. Ratliff and Mr. Milot feared the sofa would slide.

Other apartments were small, dark or both, often with odd layouts. “The pictures online were completely inaccurate,” Ms. Ratliff said. “They would use fish-eye lenses to make the room look large, or write things in the listing that weren’t there, like a dishwasher.” She enjoyed touring the apartments, though.

She and Mr. Milot contacted Laura Zente of Waverly Realty Associates, which specializes in the West Village, and Ms. Zente showed them a one-bedroom on Leroy Street for $2,350.

The bedroom was comparatively large, but there was barely room for a sofa in the living room. Mr. Milot thought the place was too small for guests. As Ms. Ratliff recalled, he told her, “Unless you want people hanging out in your bedroom and sitting on your bed, this isn’t going to happen.”

Then Ms. Zente took them to a six-story walk-up on a charming block of Christopher Street. Two one-bedrooms were available: one was just a flight up; the other, which had a newer kitchen and a slightly higher price, was three flights up.

They preferred the one on the lower floor, for $2,350. The relatively large living room faced the back, away from street noise. And even with outdated cabinets, limited closet space and a small bathroom, the apartment seemed well worth the money.

They wondered what was wrong with it. Maybe the size? As Mr. Milot said, “It is studio-sized, but it has a door” to the bedroom.

“It is no bigger than 350 square feet,” Ms. Zente said.

Still, they happily signed on. The broker’s fee was 12 percent of a year’s rent, or $3,384.

The couple moved in this past winter and set to work decorating. “I like to think I’m a little bit handy,” Mr. Milot said — he refurbished some of their furniture — “and Katie has a really good eye.”

The tiny bedroom fits a bed, one end table and a bureau.

“The bed touches three walls,” said Ms. Ratliff, who crawls on top of it to change the sheets, tucking them in as best she can.

“It’s a whole process,” she said. “I am on bed duty, and Chet is on garbage and light-bulb duty.” Eventually, she would like to have a bed out in the open, so she can easily change the sheets and put an end table on either side.

They never thought to test the water pressure until they moved in and tried to use the shower. That was when they discovered that the water trickles out. “You feel you still have shampoo in your hair,” Ms. Ratliff said. But they have a workaround: they often shower at the gym.

Even so, they feel they lucked out in finding a place just one flight up. “It’s definitely small, but it functions for us at a steal of a price,” Mr. Milot said.

According to the senior administration official, Mr. Trump is less perturbed by the actions of two other cabinet members who have fallen under recent scrutiny for their spending: Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Mr. Pruitt recently took the unusual step of installing a $25,000 soundproof booth in his office to conduct secure communications, and Mr. Mnuchin inquired about using a military plane for his honeymoon in Europe last month. He also took a government plane on a trip that included a viewing of the solar eclipse on Aug. 21 in Kentucky. That trip fell under scrutiny when Mr. Mnuchin’s wife, Louise Linton, took a stranger to task on Instagram for criticizing the couple’s luxurious lifestyle.

The president has publicly defended Mr. Mnuchin, whose trips came under an official review after the trip to Kentucky. Responding to an ABC News report that Mr. Mnuchin had taken a $25,000 trip to Washington from New York, accompanied by Elaine Chao, the secretary of transportation, the president told reporters to check their facts.

“Why don’t you check your records before you make a statement,” Mr. Trump said to reporters on Sunday. “As I understood it — I don’t know much about it — I haven’t heard about it, but I understand he never took that flight.”

On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into the travel of Mr. Trump’s senior administration members. The investigation, opened by Representatives Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the committee’s chairman, and Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the panel’s ranking Democrat, will examine the use of private and government travel by senior officials, and will request passenger names, destinations and the source of payment for each trip, among other details. The committee is requesting all related documents by Oct. 10.

Ethics experts are critical of the spending activities of Mr. Trump’s cabinet members, many of whom were wealthy before they entered public service. Richard W. Painter, an ethics counsel in the George W. Bush White House and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said that his weekly jaunts to Trump-owned resorts have created a culture of entitlement in the administration.

“Every time they’ve gone to Mar-a-Lago, it’s a couple of million just to haul Air Force One down there,” Mr. Painter said, referring to Mr. Trump’s private club in Florida. “Those other guys say, ‘Gee, I’m important too, I ought to get a private jet. I shouldn’t wait to sit around and have Delta Air Lines kick me around.’”

Matthew Dallek, an associate professor at George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management who studies political history, said that accusations of overspending have plagued nearly every modern presidency: John H. Sununu, the chief of staff for President George Bush, came under fire in 1991 for taking a government limousine to New York from Washington to attend a stamp auction. (He later resigned.) In 1994, David Watkins, the White House director of administration for President Bill Clinton, resigned after taking a $13,129 trip aboard a Marine presidential helicopter to play golf in Maryland.

“The consequences have been swifter” in the past, Mr. Dallek said. “People have lost their jobs for lesser offenses.”

At least two cabinet members have publicly said that they foot the bill for their travel: Betsy DeVos, the billionaire education secretary, uses her own private jet in her travels around the country “at zero cost to U.S. taxpayers,” according to her spokeswoman, Elizabeth Hill.

Linda McMahon, the former chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment and the current administrator of Small Business Administration — and another billionaire in Mr. Trump’s cabinet — covers the cost on private planes “out of her own pocket,” according to her spokeswoman, Carol Wilkerson.",Tom Price’s Spending Habits Catch Trump’s Attention: ‘I’m Not Happy About It’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-price-chartered-air-travel.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

The decision by Senate Republican leaders may prove to be a milestone in the decades-long fight over health insurance in the United States, suggesting that the Affordable Care Act had gained at least a reprieve and perhaps a measure of political acceptance.

Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the panel, have been working on legislation to stabilize insurance markets and hold down premiums in the next couple of years. Both said on Tuesday that they hoped to resume those efforts.

Millions of people who buy insurance on their own face sharp increases in premiums next year, and Trump administration officials have taken a number of steps that have already undermined the operations of the health law.

And health care is sure to be an issue in next year’s midterm elections.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said the concept behind the Graham-Cassidy bill would help Republicans define their differences with Democrats in the campaign season.

“Single payer, socialism — or federalism, returning power to the states to make decisions,” Mr. Thune said. “I think that’s a great contrast for us, and I think that’s an argument eventually we can win.”

For their part, Democrats have tried to use health care as a bludgeon against the few Senate Republican targets they have next year, mainly Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

“We know Republicans like Dean Heller and Jeff Flake won’t stop until they force Americans to pay more for less, and we will make sure voters hold them accountable for it,” the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said in a statement this week.

The Graham-Cassidy bill would have taken money provided under the Affordable Care Act for insurance subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid and sent it to states in the form of block grants.

The bill’s demise was welcomed by consumer groups, doctors, hospitals and insurance executives who mobilized opposition to the proposal. The Congressional Budget Office said Monday that the bill would have reduced projected federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over a decade, added millions of Americans to the ranks of the uninsured and eliminated consumer protections for some people with pre-existing conditions.

Senate Republicans tried in July to approve a repeal bill, but that attempt ended in defeat when Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, gave a thumbs-down, killing that version of the legislation.

This time, Senate Republicans were trying to pass a different proposal, and a deadline was fast approaching: They had only until the end of this week to pass a repeal bill using special budget rules that shield it from a Democratic filibuster.

Mr. McConnell had planned for a vote before that deadline, but he could afford to lose only two Republicans. By Tuesday, three members of his party had already gone public with their firm opposition: Ms. Collins, Mr. McCain and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.

None of the three senators seemed likely to change their minds. Mr. McCain detested the hasty, partisan process used to push the bill; Ms. Collins had broad concerns about the legislation’s effects on health care; and Mr. Paul objected to the fundamental architecture of the bill, which in his view constituted “fake repeal.”

Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he saw no reason for the Senate to vote.

“If you don’t have the votes,” he said, “I don’t see why we would waste the time of the Senate.”

And other Republican senators might have opposed it had party leaders moved forward. In a statement released after Senate Republicans decided not to do so, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted against the last repeal attempt in July, denounced what she described as “a lousy process.”

“The U.S. Senate cannot get the text of a bill on a Sunday night, then proceed to a vote just days later, with only one hearing — and especially not on an issue that is intensely personal to all of us,” Ms. Murkowski said, without saying which way she would have voted.

Mr. Cassidy was blunt: “We don’t have the votes,” he said, adding, “Am I disappointed? Absolutely.”

And Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, was left fuming.

“I am kind of disgusted that after nine months, the self-interest is still outweighing the national interest in our caucus in some ways,” he said.

But Mr. Graham still held out the hope that the repeal proposal would pass — just later, after Republicans tackle taxes, and when Republicans can consider the repeal plan in a more deliberative fashion.

“There are 50 votes for the substance,” Mr. Graham said. “There are not 50 votes for the process.”

But that could be months away — if not years.

The tax effort will probably occupy Congress through the remainder of this year, and into next year.

After tackling the tax overhaul, Republicans could make another attempt at passing a health bill without needing any Democratic votes. But such an undertaking would require passing yet another budget blueprint, in order to protect the bill from a Democratic filibuster, and it would put health care front and center as lawmakers head into the midterm elections.

Even as Republicans shift their focus to taxes, pressure is building for a bipartisan response to the problems of the health care system. The Alexander-Murray stabilization package has two main elements: money for subsidies paid to insurance companies, to reimburse them for reducing out-of-pocket costs for low-income people, and more freedom for states to revamp their insurance markets.

Democrats see the cost-sharing subsidy payments as essential. But many Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have described them as a bailout for insurance companies that would prop up the Affordable Care Act.

“I think most of the members would suggest they really don’t know that they can stabilize the product at this stage of the game,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota. “I think there’s a number of them that are going to be very hesitant to try to put more money into a system that they are convinced is going south.”

Earlier Tuesday, with little hope of success in the Senate, Mr. Trump expressed his displeasure.

“At some point there will be a repeal and replace, but we’ll see whether or not that point is now or will it be shortly thereafter,” he said at the White House. “But we are disappointed in certain so-called Republicans.”

The failure in the Senate was also a disappointment to Republicans in the House, who managed to pass a repeal bill in May after their own struggles.

“We’re a little frustrated that the Senate has not acted on a seminal promise,” said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.

Then he returned to talking up the need for a tax overhaul.",Senate Republicans Say They Will Not Vote on Health Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/politics/mcconnell-obamacare-repeal-graham-cassidy-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Babylon ended up with 18 percent, which if allotted to Iraq, the present-day country of its location, might be just compensation for the years of war endured. Greece came next, with a surprising 15 percent — perhaps my class felt the country was getting shortchanged for all its other mathematical contributions. The Mayans raked in 14 percent, which means Mexico would be rolling in so much money from its share that it might be the one clamoring (and paying) for a wall. My class’s most left-leaning group declared it wouldn’t disburse the money at all, “so as not to encourage capitalism.”

Of course, the exercise was pure fantasy for many reasons; any compensatory scheme would be dead on arrival based on the mention of “reparations.” And yet it highlighted the fact that there were cultures and peoples that parented zero, whose descendants may not be doing as well now. If not financial recompense, is at least some enhanced ethical responsibility toward them owed?

If so, the primary onus might fall on tech companies, arguably the biggest users of this resource. Right now, their prize target is India, with Microsoft, Google and Facebook all vying to bring its enormous population online. These giants might point out that they’re already being altruistic by offering free connectivity, through schemes that will plug in rural areas, vitalize the economy and transform the country — and just happen to add hundreds of millions of potential customers to their rosters for a variety of ads and e-products. Could it be a coincidence that Microsoft, for instance, has also been investing heavily in future cloud services, cybersecurity and e-commerce for India?

Think of it. The companies will use the indigenously developed resource of zeros and ones (the Arabs got their numerals from India, after all), package them into new services and products, and sell them back. India has lived through such irony before. The British Empire took her raw cotton and sold it back as finished garments, destroying the local textile industry and helping lower India’s share of the world gross domestic product to 3 percent from 23 percent.

Fortunately, the parallel flounders. The finished e-products will mostly be manufactured in India, even if backed by foreign investment. Also, the country is wiser: It will not succumb easily to a new cyber-colonialism. Last year, under a broader “net neutrality” decision, the government banned Facebook’s “Free Basics” plan, which offered free Wi-Fi but only to websites of the company’s choosing (Facebook, undeterred, is already marketing a replacement). This year, it also declined a bid from Microsoft to offer connectivity through old television bands. Instead, under pressure from Indian cellular operators, the bands will be auctioned off.

Whether Indian tech companies will prevail remains to be seen. What’s clear is that vigorous market competition is underway to control all those zeros and ones. Despite my liberal student group’s disapproval, zero encourages capitalistic forces, after all.

In fact, zero is essential to much of human endeavor; it has become a fundamental part of our legacy, too seemingly immutable for any kind of compensatory reckoning.

The New York Times had filed a Freedom of Information request for Mr. Pruitt’s calendar, with no response from the agency. But the nonprofit group American Oversight sued the E.P.A. over its slow response to a similar request it had filed and received a copy, which it provided to The Times.

Lisa covers the E.P.A. for The Times. I write about regulatory policy and lobbying. We spent much of the weekend reading through Mr. Pruitt’s calendar.

Page after page showed Mr. Pruitt holding meetings with lobbyists and top executives from automobile manufacturers; oil industry giants; pork and soybean farmers; coal mining companies; chemical companies; coal-burning electric utilities; conservative media outlets; Republican lawmakers; even Steve Bannon and Ivanka Trump (they had a half-hour each, in successive meetings, on the same day, before Mr. Trump’s decision on the Paris climate agreement).

Mr. Pruitt had traveled to speak to industry groups at resorts in Naples, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz., and had fancy meals with industry executives at restaurants like Equinox and BLT Prime, and at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.

But there on Page 180 of the schedule was a detail that to me was perhaps the most fascinating of all: a brief description of a 30-minute meeting Mr. Pruitt had in his office at E.P.A. headquarters with an acquaintance he knew from Oklahoma.

A.J. Ferate, now the vice president of regulatory affairs at the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association, which represents the industry statewide, was penciled in on March 27 at 3:15 p.m.

But now, five and a half years later, he had come to Mr. Pruitt’s office to thank him for moving to kill a part of the exact rule they had teamed up, without luck, to try to block in 2011. (Mr. Pruitt has moved to kill the entire methane rule, but, so far, a court has blocked him from doing that.)

“Twitter is a wonderful thing for me, because I get the word out,” he said in a March interview with Fox News. “I might not be here talking to you right now as president if I didn’t have an honest way of getting the word out.”

But if the president’s tweets are the Digital Age version of quips at the Rose Garden podium, what then are we to make of the deletions?

The president regularly deletes tweets with typos and misspellings. Less frequently, but not unheard-of, are erasures that pertain to more significant topics. In March, he posted and deleted a tweet that read: “Meeting with Generals at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Very interesting!”

At least two government watchdog groups, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive, believe that when Mr. Trump deletes a tweet he may be breaking the law.

And the younger cast members, who are early-to-mid 20s, as well as myself and Sarah, just eat it up.”

‘The Epicenter of Everything’

Decades of karate and “knuckle push-ups” have kept Mr. Kelly compact and lean, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. When I saw him this spring in “Everybody,” he popped out of a seat a few rows behind me with a beard that made him look like an elfin Santa Claus. A few months later, clean-shaven and in an electric-blue suit, he was still a ball of energy. (A smaller beard is back.)

Photo

And his multifaceted intellectual interests were apparent in the first 15 minutes of an interview: He referenced Godard, Eisenstein and Artaud, the Polish experimentalist Jerzy Grotowski and the Chinese director Chen Shi-Zheng, with whom he studied Asian theater techniques.

It’s this voracious appetite that has kept him grounded, so to speak, in New York, rather than trying to parlay his Hollywood connections into a larger film career. He’d rather spend his time mastering karate in preparation for the Shakespearean generals he still hopes to play, or practicing mandolin with his 8-year-old daughter, a budding actress and violinist.

Mr. Kelly is a Detroit native; as a freshman at Wayne State University in 1969, one of his first drama instructors was a graduate student named Jeffrey Tambor. After graduating from the University of Detroit, he followed a friend to New York, taking a $25-a-night job at Max’s Kansas City, what he calls “the epicenter of everything.”

He soaked in the budding Manhattan art world, wrote his own plays and jammed with his band in a bedroom that is now the rehearsal room of New York Theater Workshop.

“My generation — late ‘60s, early ’70s — was very influenced by rock ‘n’ roll and circus techniques and bizarre theatrical things, because everything was getting more theatrical,” he said. “I think punk was a reaction to that.”

Photo

He continues to challenge limits, getting the chance to play mandolin in the Dublin-set musical “Once,” which had a long, acclaimed Broadway run.

After all, he pointed out, “Shakespeare’s actors could do everything: They played instruments, they fenced, they danced, and they said those words.”

Ayn Rand Meets David Lynch

The director Walter Hill cast Mr. Kelly in his first screen role, as the villain Luther in “The Warriors,” the cult classic that imagines a New York City divided among rival gangs. Mr. Kelly, at the film’s climax, improvised its most famous line, the one quoted by Ol’ Dirty Bastard on the Wu-Tang Clan’s 1993 debut album: “Warriors! Come out to play!” (“I think he’s dissonant in there,” he said of the rapper’s intonation.)

From there, he supplemented a steady stream of film and TV gigs — “48 HRS,” “Miami Vice,” “Moonlighting” — with headier stage commitments: “Woyzeck,” “Twelfth Night,” “Tartuffe.”

“I’ve always appreciated kind of genre cinema — action films, things like that,” he said of his appreciation for “one-scene wonders” like the actors Eli Wallach or Bruce Dern. “Because you can kind of sneak in poetics and comments on the world.”

Photo

Poetics and “Commando”? Mr. Kelly’s ease moving between high- and lowbrow creative worlds has given him a certain respect for all the roles he is given. There is no reason, in his mind, not to imbue a smaller TV role with the same motivations used for a Greek classic onstage.

“What’s the greatest idea? Why are we doing these things? Why are we doing this play?” Mr. Kelly said. “Forgive me if it sounds pretentious, but it’s Martin Heidegger: Language is being. ‘Language is the house of being, and we are the caretakers of being.’ If it’s cinematic language, or it’s literal poetry, that’s what gets me going.”

Mr. Kelly’s love for that cinematic language put him in David Lynch’s orbit when he was cast in the director’s 1990 film “Wild at Heart.” That role led to another in a TV series Mr. Lynch was planning: “Twin Peaks.”

“I was an actor who didn’t want to do television,” Mr. Kelly said. “Laura Dern and Nic Cage convinced me, they were the ones that said, ‘You should do this, it’s going to be something very special.’ ”

Mr. Lynch wrote Mr. Kelly into the story as the cheese-obsessed, sociopathic entrepreneur Jerry Horne. It was a small role, but the actor found a way to make it culturally significant.

“I based Jerry Horne on Ayn Rand, ‘Atlas Shrugged’ — this idea of the virtue of selfishness — and the National Enquirer version of the Kennedy brothers,” Mr. Kelly said. “If you read that and believed every bad thing about the Kennedy brothers that was in there, that’s what I tried to do.”

The show took off in 1990, but Mr. Kelly didn’t wait around for his Hollywood break: He had a Greek drama to do in Boston.

“My agent said, ‘Are you nuts? This is the hottest thing on television!’” Mr. Kelly recalled, laughing. “I didn’t have a television, so I had to go to the sports bars in Boston and ask them, whenever it was on, I can’t remember when it was on, Thursday night, I think, if they could switch to ‘Twin Peaks.’”

In Showtime’s recent 18-hour “Twin Peaks” return, his moments as Jerry Horne, now an edible-marijuana magnate too high on his own supply, were part of the absurdist glue that held the plot together.

The storm’s swift approach startled this stretch of the Gulf Coast, where many had hoped they might be able to slip through the grips of this wrenching hurricane season.

“I didn’t expect any more — I felt like we were close enough to the end of the season,” Donna Moran, 57, said as she stood in the parking garage of the Palace Casino Resort here, watching the choppy waves of the Biloxi Bay spray the parking lots at the water’s edge.

Even though the hurricane was expected to weaken into a tropical storm as it moved inland on Sunday, it still had an emotional toll here in Mississippi. When Hurricane Katrina made landfall in 2005, when 6,000 of Biloxi’s 25,000 structures were destroyed.

“I was a little bit more nervous about this one because we haven’t had a hurricane since Katrina,” said Ms. Moran’s daughter Destiny, 26, an employee of the casino. “It’s like PTSD.”

In New Orleans, where Katrina exacted a horrendous toll when its waters overwhelmed the flawed levee system and left the city underwater for weeks, officials began to sound a note of cautious optimism by early Saturday evening, even as they acknowledged that circumstances could change. Officials lifted the city’s short-lived curfew around 9:30 p.m.

“This is the Goldilocks of storms,” Col. Michael Clancy, the commander of the New Orleans District for the Army Corps of Engineers, said. “Big enough to bring us in here on a Saturday night, not big enough to cause a lot of damage.”

The strength of the city’s improved hurricane defense system, he predicted, “is going to make this a minimal event, at least behind the levee.”

After amassing power in the gulf, Hurricane Nate raced toward land and was lashing coastal cities with rain by late afternoon.

Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said on Saturday afternoon that Nate was moving at “an extremely fast rate” of 26 miles an hour, which he said was “almost unheard-of for a storm of this type.”

Even though its speed would limit the amount of time it could deluge any single place, Mr. Edwards said, “this is a very dangerous storm nonetheless.”

“It has proven to be very deadly in Honduras and Nicaragua and that area,” Mr. Edwards said. “We have to make sure we are not taking it lightly.” At least 22 storm-related deaths have been reported in Central America.

At the 17th Street Canal between New Orleans and Metairie, La., workers from the Army Corps of Engineers lowered a set of enormous gates at the mouth of the canal. On Friday, divers checked the beds that the gates rest on to make sure that they would be able to close.

In 2005, there were no gates there or at the three other major canals in New Orleans. Katrina’s surge pushed water from Lake Pontchartrain into the canals. When levees along those canals breached, much of the city was inundated, and stayed underwater for weeks, until the breaches could be closed and the neighborhoods pumped dry. The corps later acknowledged the hurricane protection system it built was “a system in name only.”

Now the corps is building permanent pumping stations at the very end of these canals. Until then, a structure of gates and temporary pumps has been built to protect nearby neighborhoods.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans said at a news conference Saturday that he expected the city’s pump system to function effectively. Of the 120 pumps, 108 were working. “We have plenty enough to deal with the potential rain,” he said. “Everything that we can see, we think we can handle.”

In the afternoon, as Nate’s outer bands hit New Orleans, rain pounded the streets, pushed by heavy gusts. Pedestrians took off running or huddled under overhangs.

Nia Johnson, 23, who lives on Alvar Street a few dozen blocks from the Mississippi River, said she and her family had planned to pile into the car and drive to Lafayette, La., because the streets of her area “always flood.” The power would almost certainly go out because of the high winds, she said, leaving them unable to cook for days.

Many of the larger chain establishments in the French Quarter had closed. But along Bourbon Street, the daiquiri and pizza-slice joints were open, and music spilled out of bars like the Beach, where customers wearing fleur-de-lis-covered ponchos were drinking and watching college football.

Bridesmaids tried to stay dry in front of Arnaud’s restaurant, where a Rolls-Royce waited for the bride and groom. Around the corner, a wedding party was out on a second-floor balcony despite the splitting rain.

The storm nevertheless ground other parts of the central Gulf Coast to a halt. The popular resort town of Orange Beach, Ala., was empty except for ominous red flags whipping in the breeze; the casino city of Biloxi had mostly emptied of the thousands of visitors who had come to the area for Cruisin’ the Coast, a showcase of 8,200 classic cars. On top of that, the Mississippi Gaming Commission closed the casinos here, leaving the waterfront Beau Rivage and other casinos eerily dark.

“Now it’s just like a ghost town,” said Faith Phillips, 30, a dialysis patient care technician who was waiting for dinner at Waffle House, looking at the Beau Rivage as water encroached on parking lots nearby. “You wouldn’t believe that all of this was full.”

Just a few hours earlier, there had been an air of calm along the coast.

Merlin and Suzie DeCorte of Metairie, La., stopped at the R & O restaurant with their son Jacob, 8, near the 17th Street Canal in New Orleans, all wearing Louisiana State University T-shirts.

“It didn’t seem like it was going to be that bad,” Ms. DeCorte said of the storm. They had more time, she said, to get away from the city if needed.

In Gulfport, Miss., Rich Hazen and his wife, Dawn, of Diamondhead, Miss., were completing their errands with a decided sense of normalcy.

“Church hasn’t been canceled for this evening,” Ms. Hazen said.

“And Waffle House is still open,” Mr. Hazen said, citing the ever-reliable barometer of Southern disaster.

Don’t worry, be happy — it might make your flu shot more effective.

A new study suggests that older people who are in a good mood when they get the shot have a better immune response.

British researchers followed 138 people ages 65 to 85 who got the 2014-15 vaccine. Using well-validated tests in the weeks before and after their shots, the scientists recorded mood, stress, negative thoughts, sleep patterns, diet and other measures of psychological and physical health. They assessed their antibody response to the vaccine with blood tests at four and 16 weeks after their injections. The study is in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.

Greater levels of positive mood were associated with higher blood levels of antibodies to H1N1, a potentially dangerous flu strain, at both four and 16 weeks post-vaccination. No other factors measured were associated with improved immune response.

The authors acknowledge they were not able to control for all possible variables, and that their observational study does not prove cause and effect.

The senior author, Kavita Vedhara, professor of health psychology at the University of Nottingham, said that many things could affect vaccine effectiveness, but most are not under a person’s control — age, coexisting illness or vaccine history, for example.

“It’s not there aren’t other influences,” she said, “but it looks like how you’re feeling on the day you’re vaccinated may be among the more important.”",An Upbeat Mood May Boost Your Flu Shot’s Effectiveness,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/well/live/an-upbeat-mood-may-boost-your-flu-shots-effectiveness.html

It immediately confirmed Europe’s role as the Western world’s toughest regulator of digital services. But it has also prompted criticism of Brussels, which has been accused of unfairly targeting United States businesses, claims European officials deny.

Still, technology has been a focus of Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition commissioner. Along with other investigations into Google, the commission has also opened inquiries into tax avoidance, data privacy and abuse of market position, affecting American household names like Amazon, Apple and Facebook.

In the case of Google, rivals had long complained that the company gave itself an unfair advantage by automatically putting some of its services at the top of so-called specialized search results. Such search products, like restaurant and business reviews, are increasingly lucrative.

Under the plan presented Wednesday, Google will create a stand-alone unit for its shopping service. That unit will remain part of its overall business, but will operate separately and will be subject to regular monitoring by the European Commission. Rival price comparison services, like Germany’s Idealo and a Dutch comparison site called Vergelijk.nl, would earn money from merchants whose products, from refrigerators to electronic gadgets, they are advertising. But they would also pay Google to take up those spaces.

Customers across the 28 members of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, will be able to see those price comparison sites taking up the spots at the top of a search page where only Google Shopping had previously appeared.

“Google Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else,” said Mr. Verney.

The commission has said that Google met its deadline to offer concessions, but has not commented on whether the moves would actually bolster competition. Fines for failing to meet the Thursday deadline could have been as high as 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Google presented its plans to the commission at the end of August, but did not make them public until Wednesday.

Google would like the measure it’s implementing this week to apply narrowly to price comparison shopping services. But it faces complaints from rivals in other sectors as well, and they may see an opportunity for prying open Google’s formidable search platform.

Google already is facing two separate cases in Europe related to Android, its software for mobile devices, and to some of its advertising products. The company denies the accusations.

But even as Europe has pushed ahead with a series of antitrust charges against Google, the company has not faced the same scrutiny from regulators at home, giving cover to United States lawmakers and lobbyists accusing Europe of unfairly targeting American companies.

Still, Silicon Valley tech giants are facing shifting political winds at home, too.

American lawmakers increasingly worry about the expanding power of technology behemoths and, in particular, the role they may have played in the 2016 election. This shift has opened Google to attacks from both sides of the political spectrum on a wide range of issues, ranging from antitrust to privacy and public disclosure.

The risk of a regulatory crackdown is a significant one facing the company. It maintains a dominant position in online search, making the advertisements that run alongside its search results an indispensable part of marketing on the internet.

All three countries have been conducting military exercises near the border of Iraqi Kurdistan this week.

Iraqi troops, including Shiite Muslim militias incorporated into Iraq’s armed forces, are already in the Kirkuk area. While the city is controlled by Kurdish forces, Iraqi troops are fighting the Islamic State as part of an American-led coalition about 40 miles southwest of the city.

Kurdish troops known as pesh merga seized Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi Army fled an assault by militants there.

The inclusion of Kirkuk and other disputed areas in the referendum enraged the Iraqi government, which interpreted the move as a land grab. Baghdad has accused the Kurds of illegally selling Iraqi oil from the Kirkuk oil fields through a pipeline that runs into Turkey.

The Kurdish independence challenge is the latest crisis to rock Iraq in recent years. The country was controlled by Saddam Hussein’s regime until 2003, when the American invasion helped set off a brutal civil war and years of wrenching upheaval.

Just three years ago, Iraq lost a third of its territory to Islamic State militants. Now that the Islamic State is finally being driven out, Iraq is faced with losing a third of its territory and access to areas with oil and natural gas if Kurdistan breaks away.

Beyond the threats of military action, Iraqi authorities have struggled to come up with any meaningful punishment for the Kurds for carrying out the referendum. But with its move to shut down flights to the landlocked region, Iraq seems to have found a weak point.

Iraqi aviation authorities notified foreign airlines on Wednesday that it would cancel all permits to land and take off from two international airports in the Kurdish region as of Friday afternoon. The action followed an ultimatum by Prime Minister Abadi on Tuesday for Kurdistan to surrender control of its two international airports or face a shutdown of international flights.

The Kurdish Regional Government said Wednesday that it would refuse to hand over the airports. The region’s transportation minister, Mawlud Murad, called the Iraqi ultimatum “political and illegal.” He said the airports were critical to the American-led coalition’s fight against Islamic State militants.

Kurdish officials had planned to send a delegation to Baghdad on Wednesday to discuss the issue, but the offer was rebuffed.

On Wednesday night, Mr. Murad said that the Kurdish government had agreed to hold talks with Iraq about placing Iraqi government observers at its airports.

There was no immediate public response from the Iraqi government, but Mr. Abadi, speaking to Parliament earlier, said Iraq would not negotiate with the Kurds unless they annulled the results of the vote.

He said he had warned the Kurds “of the consequences of the crisis with Kurdistan.”

“The preservation of the security of the citizens of the country is our priority,” he added.

At least six airlines — three Turkish companies, the Lebanese carrier Middle East Airlines, Royal Jordanian and Egypt Air — started notifying passengers on Wednesday that they were canceling regularly scheduled flights from the airports in Erbil and Sulaimaniya.

Baghdad can make good on its threat because the Iraqi civil aviation authority oversees all airports in the country, including the two international airports in the Kurdish region.

The threat to cancel landing and takeoff permits would force international airlines to cancel flights to those airports because insurance risks would be too high, according to Robert W. Mann Jr., a former airline executive who is now an industry consultant.

“The issue turns on which entity controls Kurdish region airspace and airports,” Mr. Mann said. “Unless and until the autonomous region is given that control, Iraq controls and can ban, blockade or embargo air service to airports under its control, much as Qatari airports have been embargoed or blockaded by nearby nations. Faced with such a restriction, most commercial airlines would comply, in part due to warnings by their insurers.”

The Turkish Consulate in Erbil said that Turkish airlines were working to increase their seat capacity in an effort to get all passengers out of the Kurdish areas before the flight ban took effect on Friday afternoon.

Without international flights, getting in or out of Kurdistan would require going through Turkey, Iran, Syria or Iraq, where there are also threats of a blockade.

The Iraqi Parliament urged the government on Wednesday to close off its land border with Kurdistan.

For years, the Kurdish authorities in Erbil have controlled their own borders with Turkey and Syria. Mr. Abadi has demanded that all borders return to full Iraqi central government control by Friday.

Turkey’s customs minister, in remarks carried by Turkish state television, said that the main land border crossing between Turkey and the Iraqi Kurdish region remained open, although he would not say for how long that would remain the case.

Turkey is the largest trade partner with Iraqi Kurdistan, and the road border is used for much of the cargo trade. Turkey also is the transit country for the oil pumped out of areas controlled by the Kurdish authorities to the world market.

Turkey and Iran have opposed the referendum and any moves toward Kurdish independence, fearing unrest by their own Kurdish minorities.

Kurdish authorities in Erbil announced on Wednesday that 92.7 percent of those who went to the polls on Monday had voted for Kurdish leaders to seek independence. About 72 percent of 4.6 million registered voters cast ballots, with about 2.9 million voting yes to independence and about 224,000 voting no, the Kurdish Independent High Electoral Referendum Commission reported.

The referendum does not automatically trigger a declaration of independence but sets in motion a series of moves toward the establishment of a Kurdish state. The most important one of those may be negotiations of a separation with Iraq, which Iraq has refused.

American officials opposed the vote because they feared it would destabilize Iraq, stir ethnic conflict and undermine the American-led coalition.

Kurdish pesh merga fighters have played a central role in the coalition’s operations against the Islamic State militants, fighting alongside Iraqi Army units.

The Kurdish region’s president, Massoud Barzani, pushed for the referendum in hopes of obtaining a strong public mandate for eventual independence that he could use to begin negotiations with Baghdad.

Kurds have been celebrating since Monday evening, setting off fireworks, honking horns and affixing flapping red, white and green Kurdish flags to their automobiles.

The dispute over Catalonia instead presents a test of the cohesion of a member state itself. And it points to ominous storm clouds in other independent-minded regions, from Scotland to northern Italy.

Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, has long been an uneasy part of Spain, and aspirations for independence have surged and ebbed for generations. But Catalonia is also Spain’s economic engine, and Madrid is determined to hold onto it. The tug of war is now entering perhaps its most intense and unpredictable phase since the approach of the Spanish Civil War last century.

In 2014, the last time Catalonia held an independence vote, it, too, was declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court. But Catalan officials described that vote as a straw ballot, and the government in Madrid and the police did not prevent it.

This time, sensing the growing seriousness of the Catalan referendum, which the regional government says will now be binding, Madrid is taking a far more aggressive tack.

The approach has left many Catalans bridling under what they say is a heavy hand by the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The steps to intimidate people who back a vote not only may backfire, they argue, but also threaten to transform the conflict into a broad campaign of civil disobedience that could spiral out of control.

Tensions on the streets have mounted, along with political recriminations. While the separatists charge that Mr. Rajoy is taking Spain back to the dark days of Franco, Madrid warns that the separatists have shifted from violating Spanish law to encouraging civil strife.

In the interview, Mr. Puigdemont said the conflict would not turn violent, but he warned that Madrid would have to assume its share of the blame if things got further out of hand. “If you stop somebody from unfolding a banner that asks for more democracy, the problem is with the person who forces its withdrawal,” he said.

Even President Trump has weighed in, declaring that he supports a unified Spain after a meeting in Washington with the Prime Minister Rajoy. Mr. Trump took no position on whether the referendum should be held.

The swirl of competing pressures is perhaps nowhere greater than at the local level, among city and small-town mayors who must decide whether to host the voting.

On Monday, Joan Rabasseda, the mayor of Arenys de Munt, headed for a courthouse rather than his town hall because of his decision to ignore Spain’s government and constitutional court and help his residents vote. Mr. Rabasseda could be suspended from office if found guilty of civil disobedience — along with about 750 of the almost 950 mayors of Catalonia who have vowed to facilitate the referendum.

“Spain’s judiciary can go after me, but that’s only helping unite my town even more and increasing everybody’s determination to vote,” Mr. Rabasseda said defiantly.

Catalan officials who do not favor independence say that they, too, are facing intimidation — but from an increasingly aggressive pro-independence movement that wants them to go through with a vote declared illegal by Madrid.

With the referendum just days away, taking a side has become inescapable. In many ways, for Catalonia’s officialdom, it’s a case of be damned if you do and damned if you don’t.

“This conflict is forcing elected officials to walk into a cul-de-sac and then deal with very difficult consequences,” said Irene Rigau, a Catalan politician. “Whatever you do, you will be punished either by your citizenship or by the state.”

Separatist mayors must endorse the referendum, she said, because otherwise “nobody will vote for you again.”

“But if you stick to your promise,” she said, “the state could then never allow you to be a politician again.”

Ms. Rigau was among three senior Catalan government officials who were recently found guilty of civil disobedience for helping coordinate the nonbinding vote on Catalan independence in 2014.

This time, Spain’s judiciary is promising to punish anybody involved in organizing Sunday’s referendum. But for mayors like Mr. Rabasseda, the choice to go ahead with the ballot was simple, if potentially disastrous for him.

His was the first town in Catalonia to hold an independence straw ballot in 2009, at a time when secessionism had far less supporters than it now has. On Monday, a group of about 100 residents escorted their mayor to the courthouse in the nearby city of Mataró and sang the Catalan hymn as he entered the building. When he emerged, they repeatedly shouted, “We will vote!” and “Independence!”

A smaller number of mayors are complaining about suffering harassment and insults for refusing to turn their town hall buildings into polling stations. Their decision is forcing Catalonia’s separatist government to find alternative venues for a referendum whose logistics have already been seriously complicated by the Spanish police, who are seizing ballot papers and other election-related equipment.

While Mr. Rabasseda was in court, Josep Monràs, the mayor of the town of Mollet del Vallès, was filing a police complaint after a group of about 100 separatists surrounded his home last weekend and shouted insults. The protesters used a megaphone and also plastered secessionist posters on his house, Mr. Monràs said in a telephone interview.

He argued that Catalonia “isn’t viable as an independent state,” but that his opposition to the vote was in any case entirely justified by his duties as a Spanish mayor. “Every mayor takes office with a promise that includes respecting the Constitution,” he said.

Mr. Monràs, who has been mayor since 2004, said he had never before received such insults on his doorstep, including people calling him a fascist.

“There have always been people who defend different ideas using legitimate means, but there are now some who use instead coercion and insults,” he said. “It’s outrageous.”

Sunday’s referendum has widespread support in the smaller towns and villages of the Catalan hinterland like Arenys de Munt.

There, the owner of one fish distribution company had plastered a banner showing Josep Lluís Trapero, the head of the autonomous Catalan police force, who has become an icon of the region’s assertion of an independent identity since last month’s terrorist attacks in Barcelona, the region’s capital.

After a foreign journalist left a news briefing, frustrated that it was being held partly in Catalan, Mr. Trapero commented, “Well, very good, well, farewell.” His words have since been turned into a slogan by separatists who want to say the same to Spain.

But support for independence is far more limited in places like L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, the second-largest city in Catalonia, whose mayor, Núria Marín, has been leading the call for mayors not to be intimidated into hosting the referendum.

“I was elected to manage a city, not to provide ballot boxes,” she said in an interview. “Telling me that I should help people vote is a political and not a legal argument — and in this case it’s clearly not one that carries a lot of weight if made before a judge.”

Spain’s attorney general has warned Catalonia’s political leaders that they could be arrested at any time and face criminal charges for misusing public money to finance an illegal referendum.

The separatists, however, have lashed out at Madrid’s efforts to prosecute mayors and eventually, perhaps, thousands of other officials involved in their referendum. They say Mr. Rajoy is returning authoritarianism to Spain.

Mr. Rabasseda, the mayor of Arenys de Munt, said that Madrid’s clampdown has been disproportionate. He was prepared for a court battle, but acknowledged that his legal problems were worrying others, starting with his 86-year-old mother.

“She’s really upset and concerned,” he said. “For her, it’s a bit like returning to the past and the loss of all political freedom.”",Catalan Officials Are Squeezed as Madrid Tries to Stop Independence Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/europe/catalonia-spain-referendum.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women except for skin cancers.

Researchers at the American Cancer Society estimate that there will be 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer in women in the United States in 2017. Some 40,610 women will die from the disease.

In addition, there will be 63,410 cases this year of carcinoma in situ, abnormal cells that may be an early form of cancer.

Over a lifetime, a woman living in the United States has a 12.4 percent risk — one in eight — of being diagnosed with breast cancer.

Non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks have higher breast cancer incidence and mortality than other racial and ethnic groups. The incidence of cancer in black women was slightly lower than that of whites, but the death rate during 2011 to 2015 was 42 percent higher in black women.

36A: One way to develop as a solver is to take the occasional educated guess based on known letters in the grid. Perhaps you’ve never seen “The Phantom of the Opera,” but you are left with the letter pattern _ _ _ IS after confidentially filling in INERT and STAYS at 38/39D. Well, what’s the first five-letter city ending in IS that comes to mind? You may come up initially with both PARIS and TUNIS, and can check the first letter with the crossing clue “Totally captivated” at 25D. Using the “P” in PARIS, 25D could be RAPT ... and there you have it. You’ve just expanded your toehold through a quick guess-and-check.

6D: I got my friends from college into crosswords last year, and a common struggle they had was deciphering exactly which exclamation answered a clue like this. AHA? OHO? Perhaps GEE or WOW? Nope. Despite the plausibility of these guesses, you must check your crossings.

54D: While “going ape” means “losing one’s cool,” this is a cutesy clue inspired by “Tarzan of the Apes.” Love it. Although it’s not the easiest, especially when GO APE looks so odd in a grid.

Constructor Notes

Joy Behar: I started doing The New York Times puzzle right after college, when I found myself working a job that had a lot of down time. It was difficult at first, and still is, especially on Saturday, when the puzzle is very challenging. I found that if I stuck with it, I could finish it. This proved to be a good lesson for other chores and projects. In recent years, I found my name used in the puzzles. I figured they needed the vowels. Even so, it was a thrill. As far as construction, once we landed on a theme (comedians), it was not too difficult to come up with puns for comedians’ names. The grid’s restrictions didn’t allow as many names as I would have liked, but that’s life in the crossword world. The best part of doing the puzzle every day is that it provides a distraction like no other: From politics, the phone and the refrigerator. So thank you. Lynn Lempel: This collaboration was something of a blind date set up by Will, and it was all done via email. We both decided from Day 1 that the theme would be comedians, but it took a while to get from there to this puzzle. At first we thought of using names like (Lucille) BALL, (Bob) HOPE, and (Chris) ROCK that could be used in everyday phrases — and we batted around some possibilities. We also considered a few ideas that included revealers. But then, among ideas for those themes, Joy included PRYOR COMMITMENT … and I knew immediately that she’d come up with something different and perfect. She’d found our theme angle for sure, and her example was even 15 letters for a terrific central grid-spanner. After emailing back and forth, we decided on this set. Three of the five theme entries (PRINZE, PRYOR, and IDLE) were Joy’s ideas, and all but one of the theme clues were hers (all but BARR). Unfortunately, BARR HOPPING didn’t fit. A few names that didn’t work were Chaplin/chaplain, Marx/marks, and Bee/be. I did the grid, which Joy approved. And I wrote clues that she then went through and edited, preferring to make them more challenging. Will changed very few of them. If you guessed that Joy wrote the great clue for GO APE, you’d be right. Also the ones for RESCUE DOG and HELIX, just to name two that I especially liked. Working on this with Joy was great fun. Her emails were guaranteed to include some funny choices I never would have thought of. I loved the way the puzzle turned out. I hope all of you solvers do, too.

Thank you, Ms. Behar and Ms. Lempel, for such a lovely Tuesday puzzle. Truly hope to see more from you, whether it be on television or in print.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Do you ever feel your jaw immediately hit the ground the moment you look at a grid for the first time? Well, that was certainly the case for me today. Joe Krozel has been known to create some inventive puzzles in the past, and this one was no exception.

There’s a black square pattern resembling an animal in the grid’s center, and yet, the triple-stacked, nine-letter answers in the top-left corner make it appear to be themeless. And those orphaned five letters at 35A? What exactly is going on?

Today’s Theme

Turns out that Mr. Krozel wants us to put on our blindfolds to understand this theme. The revealer, 44D, indicates that the figure in the center is a PIÑATA. This also explains the black squares that connect to it; they represent the piñata’s thread.

Yet how are we supposed to nail 35A without any crossings to check? Take a look at the notepad accompanying the puzzle:

“Two letters of the alphabet are missing from the main, connected portion of the completed grid. What are they? The answer goes, appropriately, at 35-Across.”

A thorough scan of the grid conveys that every letter of the alphabet has been used at least once except for C and Y. Hold up. C. AND. Y. CANDY!

MONDAY PUZZLE — Happy Monday, all! Sam Ezersky here again. You may remember me from my “big break” two weeks ago or my diagramless in yesterday’s Magazine. Either way, I’ll be sticking around through Friday, and I promise I don’t bite. [Can confirm. — D.A.]

Let me start by sharing a little secret from my constructing perspective: A solid Monday puzzle is surprisingly hard to create. The theme should not only be exciting on its own, but must also appeal to solvers with widely varying backgrounds and skill levels. On top of this, the surrounding fill should not only be squeaky clean, but largely familiar. Thus, I’m always excited to see Bruce Haight’s byline early in the week, as I know he can produce a top-notch crossword given these criteria. Today’s offering was no disappointment.

Today’s Theme

Bruce has treated us to five, rhyming _ _ _ _ Y - _ _ _ _ Y phrases that cross at the middle letter:

17A/3D: “Useful” = HANDY-DANDY 19A/11D: “Snobbish” = HOITY-TOITY 39A/29D: “Sophisticated” = HOTSY-TOTSY 58A/48D: “Affectionate” = LOVEY-DOVEY 60A/51D: “Weak and indecisive” = NAMBY-PAMBY

Themes don’t get much more straightforward than this, but this is cute and well-crafted, especially since all answers are adjectival phrases as opposed to, say, HOKEY POKEY or LAFFY TAFFY.

It’s also a testament to how helpful the theme can be for getting toeholds elsewhere in the puzzle. Having trouble in the bottom-left corner, where there isn’t an easy three- or four-letter answer in sight? Well, if you’ve caught on to the theme in other areas of the grid, then filling in LOVEY/DOVEY shouldn’t be a problem, and boom! You may have just enough letters to grok answers like SILTS, SAY-SO and perhaps even HONEY-DO.

By Marlon James

When I was 14, in 1984, I played Prince’s “Purple Rain” album so much that both parents would sing along, turning the whole house into a lyric-misreading protokaraoke. Their never getting the words was why I could play it in front of them, but I would never play the fifth song on the album, “Darling Nikki,” and it wasn’t because of the lyrics. This was perhaps Prince’s only song about sex that gave neither redemption nor relief, but I skipped to Side 2 because of the scream. The scream was mine, and I wasn’t about to share it.

There’s a story I can’t confirm that whenever Coltrane became overwhelmed by what he had to say, and frustrated that his sax could not say it, he would put it down and scream. The “Darling Nikki” scream was actually the third time Prince screamed on the record. But this time, the music dropped out, leaving nothing but this loud, unhinged, panicked, hopeless screech. It was the most electrifying seven seconds of my entire year.

In 1984, there was an awful lot for me to scream about, even if until “Darling Nikki,” I never knew screaming was an option. I knew I liked boys, and I knew I was going to hell for it, which was enough, but Earth wasn’t so hot either, trapped as I was in the endlessly repeatable boredom of suburbia, prefab houses, two cars, all the way down the street. Teenage boys think in teenage ways, and one of the few options for what I could do with my life was end it.

Or scream about it. The “Darling Nikki” scream defies paraphrasal. It was not cool; I was discovering an abyss in myself that somehow made me feel better for connecting with it. This was not easy in a house of six, but because I had few friends I was at home alone more than anybody else. And paradoxically, I discovered that screaming and volume did not have to be related. A lip-synced scream was loud enough. A whispered scream was better; a pillow-dampened scream was even better than that. It was strange how it made me feel afterward, not bolder or more at peace so much as more indifferent to taking a verbal punch, like the cool kids’ calling me homo.

Punks recognized this several years before: A scream was an invitation. We couldn’t all sing, but we could all scream, and in punk it wasn’t worthy if we couldn’t all do it. And because at 14, half of what you are experiencing you can’t even name, so what better way to respond than getting yourself alone and doing something equally nameless? But that was 1984. Why is a 46-year-old man still putting on “Darling Nikki” to karaoke a seven-second scream?

Because nowadays I find myself needing catharsis even more than antacid. On TV there’s much to scream about, but as with road rage, there’s no release. I play “Darling Nikki” loud enough to drown out my own voice. I ignore the song’s context, though its descent into psychosexual hell can apply to any personal or political torment. And when the music drops out and it’s just me and Prince, I let my voice rip so hard, even my eyes scream. This is 2017. There is more than enough to scream about.","Letters of Recommendation: ‘Twin Peaks,’ Screaming Karaoke and More",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/magazine/culture-issue-letters-of-recommendation-twin-peaks-get-out-screaming-karaoke.html

Whenever a mass shooting shocks America, people ask if tighter gun-control measures could have prevented the slaughter.

Gun violence researchers say that no law can eliminate the risk of mass shootings, which are unpredictable and represent a small minority of gun homicides over all. But there are a handful of policies that could reduce the likelihood of such events, or reduce the number of people killed when such shootings do occur. And several of them have strong public support.

These are findings from surveys we conducted a year ago about the recurring problem of gun violence in the United States. We asked dozens of researchers in criminology, law and public health to assess a range of policies often proposed to prevent gun deaths. We also conducted a national poll to measure public support for the same set of measures.

The policies in the upper right corner of our matrix are those that were deemed effective and popular. The most effective one, according to our experts, would be restricting gun sales to anyone found guilty of a violent crime. Under federal law, such limitations apply to those convicted of felonies or domestic violence crimes. That idea has not been debated much among federal policy makers.

Expanding background checks for gun purchasers to a wider range of gun sales was also judged effective and popular. It is an idea that was considered by Congress in 2013, but failed to win enough votes to become law. Some popular measures, like strengthening sentences for illegal gun possession, were deemed less effective. And some measures that experts thought could reduce deaths, such as banning all semiautomatic weapons, were less popular, though a majority of people in our survey still approved.

In general, the public was more accepting of measures limiting the types of people who could obtain weapons than of restrictions on the types of guns and accessories available on the market.

The attack at a Las Vegas concert on Sunday was unusual even among mass shootings. Stephen Paddock, the shooter, appeared to have used modified semiautomatic weapons that fired at the rapid pace of a machine gun. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has proposed legislation that would prohibit so-called bump stocks, the devices found on several of his guns. At least some Republicans in Congress have expressed openness to the idea.

We did not ask specifically about “bump stocks,” but we did ask about a broader set of gun modification restrictions that were part of a 1990s law known as the assault weapons ban, and about outlawing large-capacity ammunition magazines that enable rapid fire. Our experts thought both ideas could reduce the death toll from mass shootings, but they were not among the most popular ideas with the public.

Select Measures That May Help Prevent Mass Shootings NOTE: Starred measures have been passed by legislature or ballot initiative but have not yet been fully enacted.

SOURCE: Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence

When we developed our list of measures, we focused on policies that were not part of federal law. And we gathered ideas from advocates on the left and the right – some part of the mainstream political conversation, and some extremely unlikely to be considered.

No state has adopted more than a handful of the ideas our experts deemed to be effective, but some states have adopted more of our experts’ preferred measures than others. Nevada has adopted relatively few. In the accompanying table, we compared Nevada with California, which has been particularly aggressive about passing gun-control measures, and Mississippi, which is among the most permissive in its approach to firearms. The table omits policies that could be instituted only by the federal government.

What Has Nevada Done?

In 2016, Nevadans narrowly approved a ballot measure that called for instituting a universal background check for all gun purchases. Currently, people who buy guns from a federally licensed dealer must undergo a background check, but not those who buy guns from individuals, including at gun shows or through internet classified sites.

The ballot initiative has not yet been enacted. The governor and attorney general, who oppose the policy, have said it is unenforceable because the F.B.I. has not agreed to conduct the checks for the states, as specified in the measure. Advocates have protested, and are preparing to bring a lawsuit this month if no further action is taken.",How to Reduce Mass Shooting Deaths?

“Ukraine, with the exception of the Baltic States, is the only post-Soviet republic which is not authoritarian,” said Serhii Plokhii, a Harvard professor and the author of a history of Ukraine. And unlike the three Baltic States, which enjoyed brief periods of independence between the First and Second World Wars, Ukraine has only an acute awareness of centuries of subjugation by outside powers, among them Poland, Austria and Russia, that left its people inherently wary of authority.

“What is Ukraine’s national idea? It is resistance to authority,” said Taras Chornovil, a former adviser to Mr. Yanukovych.

Ukraine’s painful history as a put-upon appendage has left it ill-equipped to curb unruly habits at odds with the rule-based, scandal-shy order of the European Union, which it aspires to join.

“Its attempts to stay democratic while building a nation are often messy, its oligarchs all powerful and, given the virtual absence of state control over media and oligarchic competition, post-Soviet corruption is out in the open,” Mr. Plokhii said.

Ukraine’s domestic intelligence service, or S.B.U., its powers of surveillance greatly enhanced by monitoring equipment provided by the United States after Mr. Yanukovych decamped to Russia, has added its own highly selective and distorted form of transparency by leaking information about alleged wrongdoing, often for political or financial gain.

Controlled by Mr. Poroshenko, the S.B.U. has become a tool in domestic political and business battles, with anti-corruption activists accusing it of working to undermine, not help, their cause.

While still politically influenced, Ukrainian law enforcement is no longer the swamp of incompetence and corruption it once was. It has been able to monitor Mr. Manafort’s former business associates and turn up evidence of Russian hacking in the 2016 United States election, in part owing to American technical support.

The Central Intelligence Agency tore out a Russian-provided cellphone surveillance system, and put in American-supplied computers, said Viktoria Gorbuz, a former head of a liaison office at the S.B.U. that worked with foreign governments.

Ms. Gorbuz’s department translated telephone intercepts from the new system and forwarded them to the Americans. “This team would translate and immediately, 24 hours a day, be in full cooperation with our American colleagues,” she said.

It is unclear whether any phone intercepts relevant to the election meddling investigation have gone to the American authorities. But a Ukrainian law enforcement official has given journalists partial phone records of former associates of Mr. Manafort.

Dismantling Russian spy gear, however, proved far easier than purging Russian power, which has shadowed Ukraine constantly since it declared independence in 1991 but became far more aggressive in recent years.

They wait on a platform at the Milan train station in 1970, their many suitcases secured with rope, their bags filled to the brim. A box of panettone, a Milanese holiday specialty, accompanies this family of travelers, suggesting Christmastime. Dressed for the cold, the family of five — parents, children, and an older woman wearing black from head to toe — gaze to the right, pondering perhaps their unknown destinies. We see them in Gianni Berengo Gardin’s photograph, shot at mid-distance from above, a portrait of Italy as a migrant nation.

I know these people.

Photo

No, they are not my family, but they could be. My parents left their respective mountain towns for New York City two decades earlier than those in the photo, fleeing the destruction, the penury and the hopelessness of post-World War II Italy.

The family on the platform could have easily been one of the multitudes of migrating Italians I encountered on trains when I lived in Milan and Bologna in the mid-1970s, traveling between their hometowns and northern Italian cities, Switzerland, Germany, and other enchanted places of drudgery, sacrifice and desires, temporary stops along an unending journey toward security.

Indeed, Italians keep leaving now, not with the same desperation of the undereducated masses that changed the course of nations in North and South America beginning in the 19th century, but with college degrees and smartphones in hands, grasping for opportunities their country remains incapable of providing.

These images from the mid-20th century capture the ubiquity and possibility of travel and escape, from the gaggle of scugnizzi (street urchins) hitching a ride on the back of a Neapolitan tram to a couple cuddling in their bathing suits, nestled between train tracks. I know them too, having met them in my own travels across the peninsula, heard about them in family stories on both sides of the Atlantic, and encountered them through the countless viewings of films by the likes of Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni.

Photo

The 31 black-and-white images displayed in the London gallery exhibition of Gardin’s work, “The Italians,” are, for the most part, those he made in the midcentury, when Italy hovered between agrarian provincialism and an internationally touted cosmopolitanism. The meta-image of an Asian tourist posing for a photographic portrait against a Mediterranean backdrop highlights Italy as destination, in stark disparity to the fleeing migrant family.

Contrasts are a leitmotif for Gardin, as seen with the seven girls in communion whites delighted by a dark-haired dog before them, or the jangle of men on a train, caught in mirrored reflections. The pairing of Italy with style and leisure is found in the photos of an elegantly veiled woman in sunglasses and pearls aboard what appears to be a Venetian water taxi, and the portly man in bathing trunks beatifically splayed on an outcrop, the sea below a resounding swirl.

Photo

Gardin is a master of the patterned panorama, vistas of startling beauty shot from above: In one image a donkey-driven plow cuts a billowing swath across an astonishingly stark landscape and in another, two men scurry across a plank in a flooded Piazza San Marco. These are captured flashes of haunting revelation.

His images are not merely of the real, the documented — they are also reveries of the imagination. Lovers, clothed but barefoot, embrace on a beach. A blanket, a pair of shoes and vinyl records in the foreground.

I know them, too.

Mr. Obama, who has been doing quite well financially since leaving the White House, has not yet written a check, but the president of Occidental, Jonathan Veitch, said the former president was high on his list of asks.

“I am going all over the world asking people for money,” he said. “Why wouldn’t I ask him?”

“There are not many liberal arts colleges that educate a president,” Mr. Veitch said. “We are very proud of the fact and very proud of him. We thought this would be a great way to honor him and have our students emulate the values he represents.”

Mastodons, rhinoceroses and saber-toothed cats once roamed Southern California.

We know because of the bones and footprints they left behind in places like Rainbow Basin, in the Calico Mountains just north of Barstow.

Administered by the Bureau of Land Management, the area owes its name to the pink, green, orange and brown sediments that form the basin’s walls.

Over eons, tectonic forces and erosion have lifted the rock and exposed zigzagging strata, made colorful by differing stages of iron oxidation.

It’s a mecca for geologists.

“It’s quite spectacular,” said Robert Hilburn, a Barstow paleontologist. “People come from all over the United States and sometimes all over the world.”

Rainbow Basin was once a lush marshland populated by a unique array of prehistoric animals whose fossils remain scattered across what is now a parched desert.

“Everything that you have on the African savanna today, they had here — except one,” said Mr. Hilburn, who is also vice president of the Mojave River Valley Museum.

Which one? “No man,” he said.

Rainbow Basin is accessible to visitors at the end of a long dirt road. You can walk miles of trails or stay at nearby campsite.

“He doesn’t just say he’s going to do this,” Mr. Mowery said. “He gets thrown out of office over it. And then he gets re-elected.”

In order to fill the Senate seat that Attorney General Jeff Sessions held for 20 years, Mr. Moore must pass one more test: a special election in December against the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor who is a formidable rival, especially by the diminished standards of Alabama Democrats.

Although Mr. Trump said on Friday that Mr. Moore “has a very good chance of not winning” in December, strategists in both parties expect the state’s voters to choose Mr. Moore, who was one of the public figures who stirred doubts about the birthplace of Barack Obama.

If he is elected to the Senate, Mr. Moore will have gotten there as a rare retail politician with a penchant for reciting Blackstone’s Commentaries on common law. At the same time, and to greater political benefit, Mr. Moore, a former professional kickboxer, exhibits traits that many Alabamians see in themselves and seek in their elected officials: He is outwardly pious and prone to political pugilism, self-assured and satisfied with standing alone.

“Roy Moore is Huey Long with religion,” said Jim Zeigler, a Republican who is the state auditor. “Huey Long would tell it like it is. He ran against the establishment, he defeated the establishment, he would not compromise with the establishment. Roy Moore does all those things, but he has a biblical worldview.”

Yet Mr. Moore, who twice ran unsuccessfully for governor, is far from universally beloved in this state. For many people in Alabama, he remains part novelty, part demagogue and part embarrassment, his reputation marred not by bribes or sex scandals but by his brand of stubborn populism. More than once, Mr. Moore has found himself rebuffing comparisons to George C. Wallace, the governor who said in 1963 that he wanted “segregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever.”

Mr. Moore is “a one-issue man, and all of the other things fall to the side,” said Joel Sogol, a lawyer from Tuscaloosa who has tangled with Mr. Moore. “Either you accept those issues from his position or you don’t, and there’s a lot of folks here who accept them.”

Mr. Moore’s fame stems almost entirely from years of pitched legal battles over Ten Commandments displays on public property and over the authority of the federal courts to recognize same-sex marriages. Cast aside, even by some in his own party, as a bigot and a hatemonger, Mr. Moore has turned high-decibel clashes with his critics — he blamed “atheists, homosexuals and transgender individuals” for one conflagration — into opportunities.

In Alabama politics, Mr. Sogol said: “He’s an outsider who has a flag to hold on to. His flag is Christianity, the Bible. There are a lot of people in this area who think that is the No. 1 thing in the world.”

During his periodic exiles from public office, Mr. Moore helped to steer public debate using a nonprofit organization called the Foundation for Moral Law, which says it “exists to restore the knowledge of God in law and government and to acknowledge and defend the truth that man is endowed with rights, not by our fellow man, but by God!”

The organization, which Mr. Moore’s wife now leads, was the subject of a complaint filed to the Internal Revenue Service last week, accusing the group of “repeatedly and expressly” advocating Mr. Moore’s election to the Senate, in conflict with its tax-exempt status. Mr. Moore says the criticism of the organization is politically motivated.

Though he has done little to excise himself from the clamor of evangelical politics, Mr. Moore sometimes complains about being regarded solely as a culture warrior.

“They put me in a religious thing because I acknowledge God,” he said in an interview. “I regret voters don’t hear me talk about laws and all the things I do otherwise in government. When I was on the court, I dealt with everything.”

Service in the Senate presents similarly sweeping challenges, and the Capitol Hill establishment is not likely to roll out a welcome mat for Mr. Moore. He said throughout the campaign that he would be a gadfly, not an obedient follower of the party line laid down by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, whose allies spent heavily in Alabama trying to help Mr. Strange keep his seat.

“McConnell and all of those people in Washington know I’m not to be controlled,” said Mr. Moore, whose campaign won the support of Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News and Mr. Trump’s onetime chief strategist. “I’m not going to be managed, I’ve never been,” Mr. Moore said.

Though he is dismissive of his party’s leadership, he is no one’s idea of a centrist, and would probably vote the same way as Mr. McConnell on most issues. Like nearly every Southern Republican running for a statewide office this year, he has campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act, protecting gun rights, increasing military spending and toughening immigration enforcement.

Yet longtime observers of the man whom many know simply as Judge Moore sometimes struggle for a neat, overarching description of his approach to public policy, beyond simple populism. In his years on the bench, he stayed at something of a remove from the pro-business orthodoxy of the Republicans who have won near-absolute power in Alabama in recent years, and for an array of reasons, business leaders have chronically kept their distance from him.

“He’d probably be considered conservative by some standards, less so by others,” said Jere Beasley, a trial lawyer who once served as a Democratic lieutenant governor and who donated to Mr. Moore’s campaign.

Mr. Beasley praised Mr. Moore for a ruling he handed down on arbitration, but other decisions give his judicial record a texture that surprises both supporters and critics. In occasional dissents, for instance, Mr. Moore voiced support for overhauling sentencing laws that some say are too harsh and too rigid. Writing in a robbery case last year, Mr. Moore said, “There is a difference between justice and overkill.” In another case, he argued that a life sentence for a nonviolent drug crime had shown “grave flaws in our statutory sentencing scheme.”

“He is a populist,” Mr. Zeigler said of Mr. Moore, whose campaign had a fraction of the financial support that Mr. Strange attracted. “I don’t think he intends to be. He just is.”

It is a model that has long proved politically effective. And on Tuesday, at least, it overcame more than $10 million in advertising spending by Mr. Strange’s allies.

“It’s almost the same appeal that Trump has, but it comes from a totally different place,” Mr. Mowery said. “The state’s motto is, ‘We dare defend our rights.’ It kind of starts right there: A lot of people feel Roy Moore is the guy who’s done that.”","Alabama Republicans Bet on Roy Moore, a Familiar Rebel, for Senate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-senate.html

How did you feel when you found out you would be CoverGirl’s newest ambassador?

Aging has been good for me. You develop confidence, you’re able to handle the knocks a little easier. I model for my age. I’m not trying to hide it and say I’m 50. I’m so proud that I’m going be 70.

I don’t dye my hair. It’s so fabulous. I had brown hair for so long. I was always getting my roots done. Sometimes I did it myself because I couldn’t afford to go to a hair salon. When I turned 60, I decided to see what color I am underneath. I started dyeing my hair a very light blond and then I let it grow out. I cut it very short.

When did you first start modeling?

At 15. I was a science nerd. I have two science degrees. I enjoyed the sciences, nutrition, so I always modeled part time, thinking it would end. And it hasn’t, of course. “Just getting started” is my hashtag. I had three kids in three years, so that slowed me down somewhat. I was 28 and the oldest model in the city.

What advice would you give to young models today?

Be nice to everybody. Keep your brain active. Read a lot.

Did you ever involve your kids in your modeling work?

When I didn’t have a nanny, the shows weren’t long, so they would have their books and sit in the front row. I tried to get them to model, but they found it boring. They didn’t have iPads back then. When you’re on set you stand a lot and you wait, wait, wait. Tosca was doing runway with me and she was about 11, and they did her hair in a style she hated and she refused to step on the runway. And I said, “That’s the end of your modeling career.” And that was fine with me, too.

What do you love about makeup?

For me, it makes a huge difference because my face is pretty plain, and I’m very fair with very few eyebrows and very short eyelashes. Makeup transforms me. I feel like I’m in disguise when I walk my dog without makeup on.

I was 12 or 13 when I started experimenting. At 15, I was modeling. I had to do my own hair and makeup. I also made my own clothes because I grew up in South Africa, where fashion was six months behind because of the seasons.

We wore a lot of makeup. It took us an hour to get ready. The eyelashes on top, the black eyeliner in the crease of the eye that you can see in photos from the ‘60s, the beehive hairstyle.

The modeling industry has a lot of issues with eating disorders and underweight workers. What’s your perspective on that as someone who studies nutrition?

There are models who are naturally skinny, but the thing is that many of them are emaciated. You can tell because they have hirsutism. There’ll be some hair on their face. It’s to protect their body and keep it warm because they’re too skinny. They also don’t have good energy. I’m surprised how many of them can do so many shows.

Read the latest on the Las Vegas shooting with Friday’s live updates.

The night began as a celebration. Thousands gathered in Las Vegas for one last night of song at a long-awaited country music festival. They had driven in from towns all over California. They had flown in from Alaska, Tennessee, West Virginia. They were teachers, police officers, secretaries, retirees.

Many had planned for weeks, even months, this weekend of relaxation. Some came with elaborate plans amid the music: a reunion with old friends, a wedding anniversary, even a marriage proposal.

Then came gunfire — sudden and rapid and seemingly endless. When it was over, 58 people had been killed and hundreds more injured, making the attack at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Oct. 1 one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history.

The victims included 36 women and 22 men. The oldest was 67, the youngest 20. Here are their stories.

Hannah Ahlers

Hannah Ahlers, 34 and a mother of three, grew up listening to country music and was a huge fan. She went to the concert on Sunday with her husband, Brian Ahlers, whom she had met in high school. They had been married 17 years, and lived in Beaumont, Calif.

Her brother, Lance Miller, confirmed Ms. Ahlers’s death. Her family described her as having “loved life and people.”

“She was our sunshine,” they said in a statement.

She was a homemaker, an active member in her children’s schools and community, and was very involved with extracurricular activities, including her daughter’s volleyball team.

“She wasn’t too good for anybody,” Mr. Ahlers said. “Beautiful, inside and out.”

Heather Alvarado

Heather Alvarado, a wife and mother of three from Utah, had traveled with her family to attend the concert in Las Vegas.

“It is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge the passing of Heather Warino Alvarado, wife of Cedar City firefighter Albert Alvarado,” Sgt. Jerry Womack, a spokesman for the police department in Cedar City, Utah, said in a statement.

A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ms. Alvarado’s family described the 35-year-old as a wife, mother, sister, friend and “so much more.” She was “always the first to help out,” the page said, and “anyone she comes across she makes them feel like family.”

Dorene Anderson

Dorene Anderson, 49, of Anchorage loved ice hockey.

Or at least she loved the Alaska Aces, a minor league team whose fans were known for ringing cowbells painted with the Aces insignia to show their support during games.

“Dorene was our treasurer of the cowbell crew this past year and a wonderful, generous person who was a friend to many,” wrote Marie English, a fellow fan, on the fan club’s Facebook page.

She was also “the most amazing wife, mother and person this world ever had,” her husband, John Anderson, wrote in a statement issued by his employer, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.

He and his family members, Mr. Anderson wrote, are grieving.

So are Aces fans, who are holding a candlelight vigil for Ms. Anderson on Tuesday at the Sullivan Arena, where the Aces (who are moving to Maine) have played. “We ask you wear an Aces jersey, cowbell crew shirt, or anything cowboys-related,” read a post on the fan page. “Bring your cowbell.”

Carrie Barnette

With a small inheritance from her grandparents, whom she had helped care for during long illnesses, Carrie Barnette, 34, last year bought a home in Riverside, Calif. It was a personal milestone for the Disney food service employee.

A music festival aficionado of sorts, she had posted video of parts of this country music concert to Facebook, and noted that she was having more fun in Las Vegas than she had at Stagecoach, a California festival.

“That was Carrie,” a cousin, Janice Chambers, said. “She just liked to go out and do things.”

“We mourn a wonderful member of the Disney family: Carrie Barnette,” Disney’s chief executive, Robert Iger, said on Twitter on Monday night.

Ms. Barnette worked as a cook at the Pacific Wharf Cafe, a waterfront restaurant at a Disney park in Anaheim, and was the proud owner of a basset hound, Lucy.

“O.K. everybody I just entered Lucy in this,” she posted on Facebook last month, of a calendar contest to raise money for a local animal shelter. “I really hope she can win and make the cover.”

Jack Beaton

In the last photo that Jack Beaton posted on his Facebook page on Sunday evening, his companions can be seen lounging on the grass, holding beers and smiling at the camera, lights from the country music festival twinkling in the background.

“Day Three Route 91 Vegas!” he wrote in the caption.

Hours later, Mr. Beaton, of Bakersfield, Calif., was killed while shielding his wife, Laurie, from gunfire, his family said.

His father-in-law, Jerry Cook, told BakersfieldNow.com that Mr. Beaton had covered his wife’s body with his own, and was shot. “He told her he loved her,” he said. “Laurie could tell he was slipping. She told him she loved him and she would see him in heaven.”

Mr. Beaton, 54, was gregarious and always helping other people; a family man who adored driving his truck with his hat on sideways, Mr. Cook said.

Mr. Beaton’s son, Jake, paid tribute to his father on Facebook. “Lost my best friend,” he wrote. “I love you so much more than you could ever imagine. Please watch over our family. You will forever be remembered as our hero!”

Steve Berger

Whatever Steve Berger did, he always seemed to be at the top of his game.

He was an all-star high school basketball player in Wauwatosa, Wis., his father, Richard Berger, told MPR News, and went on to play for St. Olaf College in Minnesota. In 2007, his friend Josh Decker brought him to EFS Advisors, a company in Cambridge, Minn., where he would spend the last 10 years and earn accolades from Mpls.St.Paul Magazine and Twin Cities Business.

As a financial adviser, “Steve was able to touch thousands of lives, enhancing the ability of his clients to retire earlier and/or in a better financial position,” the company said in a statement.

Mr. Berger had three children, between the ages 8 and 15, and was in Las Vegas to celebrate his 44th birthday. The week before, he and his father had spoken about his bet on the Wisconsin-Northwestern football game, his father told The Las Vegas Review-Journal.

“I said, ‘Steve, be careful,’” his father recalled.

Candice Bowers

On Sunday night, Candice Bowers, 40, was taking a rare weekend away from her home and responsibilities in Orange County, Calif., listening to music with a friend at the Jason Aldean concert.

When the gunfire began, Ms. Bowers and her friend dove under a table, then became separated in the chaos, her grandmother, Patricia Zacker, told The Orange County Register. Ms. Bowers leaves behind three children and a large extended family, relatives said.

“Candice left this world doing what she loved, dancing to country music among loved ones,” a GoFundMe page begun for her children said. “She will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.”

Denise Salmon Burditus

Whenever Tony Burditus was away from Denise Salmon Burditus, his wife of 32 years, she sent him selfies, nearly always featuring one of her big, broad smiles.

“I can’t say enough — her smile,” Mr. Burditus, of Martinsburg, W.Va., said in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “If I was out of town or something I would get a selfie, on her way to the gym, or on her way to school. I would get a huge smile,” he said.

“If I didn’t get it, I would text her back and she would send me one back with a smile.”

That same smile beamed from a photo she and her husband took together in front of the music festival stage, not long before the shooting. She posted the photograph on Facebook.

As the shooting began, Mr. Burditus said the couple mistook the sound as pyrotechnics. “We stood there for a second and she asked me if it was gunfire and I told her, ‘No.’ And then it was during the second burst that we knew,” Mr. Burditus said. They tried to get away.

“I was leading her through the crowd,” he said. But she was shot, and Mr. Burditus said he “immediately knew her wound was fatal. She was unconscious from the time she was struck.” Ms. Burditus was 50.

Sandy Casey

Over the course of a carefree weekend in Las Vegas, they kept bumping into one another around the festival: at least a half dozen teachers, principals and school psychologists who worked for the Manhattan Beach School District in Southern California, taking a brief escape from their responsibilities to listen to live music.

The school district said on Monday that Sandy Casey, 34, a special-education teacher originally from Vermont, was killed in the shooting. The other staff members from the district were physically unharmed.

Ms. Casey taught middle school and had worked for the district for nine years, an energetic person who delighted in her students, the superintendent, Mike Matthews, said.

“She was a person who brings light wherever she is,” he said. “She has a classroom full of light and hope and caring.”

Ms. Casey’s fiancé, Chris Willemse, an instructional assistant for the district, was with Ms. Casey in Las Vegas. He wrote on Facebook: “As I sit and mourn such a beautiful life gone too fast, all I can say is look up and watch the birds fly high and free today, as that’s where I feel you smiling down upon all of us. I love you baby girl! Love you to pieces!”

Andrea Castilla

Photo

It seemed like the Route 91 Harvest Festival would be the perfect place for Andrea Castilla, a sales associate at Sephora in Huntington Beach, Calif., to celebrate her 28th birthday. Her sister, Athena, would be there with her fiancé, and Andrea and her boyfriend, Derek Miller, decided to join them.

And there was to be a surprise, according to People.com: Mr. Miller had been planning to propose.

He never had the chance. Ms. Castilla was killed in the attack, according to a text message from her aunt, Marina Castilla Parker, who posted photos to Facebook of Ms. Castilla beaming at the festival with her sister and their partners.

In an interview with People, Athena Castilla said she and her fiancé tried to keep Ms. Castilla from being stepped on after she fell. Athena said that strangers had helped put Andrea into the back of a truck for the drive to the hospital.

“I was holding onto her head and trying to keep her from losing so much blood, talking to her, kissing her, telling her she was going to make it,” Athena Castilla said. “We all did our best to help her get through it. We did the best we could.”

Denise Cohen

Photo

Denise Cohen was never bored, or boring. Ms. Cohen, 58, was the “life of the party,” her younger sister, Kristal Vogel, said: “the first one to be out and the last one to go to bed.”

She loved to be outdoors, whether on a beach or at a festival like Route 91, which she attended with her boyfriend, Derrick Taylor, who also died. She was particularly excited to see Jason Aldean, whom Ms. Vogel had seen live a few days before. “‘I can’t wait to see Jason Aldean’ — that’s all I heard all weekend,” Ms. Vogel said.

Ms. Cohen had two sons, both in their 30s, and lived in Carpinteria, Calif., near Santa Barbara. She had recently started working for Team HOA, a division of McFarland Financial that focused on homeowner association accounting.

Austin Davis

Photo

Austin Davis, 29, a pipe fitter from Riverside, Calif., made the trip to Las Vegas with Thomas Day Jr., a softball buddy who also died.

The two played “fast-pitch softball” together, Berta Garcia, the coed director for USA Softball of Southern California, told The Riverside Press-Enterprise. “Tom kind of guided him.”

A member of the United Association, the union representing pipe fitters, Mr. Davis “had a swing like no other,” another softball friend said.

After the shooting, Mr. Davis’ girlfriend, Aubree Hennigan, had posted urgent pleas for help on social media as she and his parents sought news of his whereabouts. Before receiving confirmation of his death, she wrote on Facebook: “My everything … Please come home to us.”

A “Homerun Derby” was being planned, in honor of Mr. Davis and Mr. Day. “I will be there for my man and I would love to see everyone,” Ms. Hennigan wrote.

Thomas Day Jr.

Photo

Thomas Day Jr., 54, was a contractor who worked in a branch of his father’s home-building business in Corona, Calif. He had traveled to Las Vegas to attend the concert with three of his grown children and a group of friends.

His father, Thomas Day Sr., said he received a call from his grandson late on Sunday: The three adult children and the friends were in hiding, the grandson said, but Mr. Day had been shot in the head.

The elder Mr. Day, who lives in Las Vegas, said his son, who was divorced, was a “great dad” who often attended concerts with his children.

He had not been able to see the body or bury his son. “They still have him,” he said.

Christiana Duarte

Christiana Duarte, 22, had a gorgeous singing voice. And she was much like her parents, a family friend, Danette Meyers, said. “She was very giving,” Ms. Meyers said.

Ms. Duarte had gone to the country music festival with her brother’s girlfriend, Ariel Romero. Both women were shot, Ms. Meyers said. Ms. Romero had been through surgery and was expected to recover, Ms. Meyers said.

Ms. Duarte’s father, Michael, is a longtime employee of the Los Angeles prosecutor’s office, where he has regularly consoled the victims of crimes and their families, she said. Now his own family was wrestling with loss.

“I can’t tell you how this has hit all of us,” Ms. Meyers said. “This is just unbelievable. This senseless, violent act is just killing us all.”

Stacee Etcheber

Photo

After the first round of shots, Stacee Etcheber’s husband, Vincent, told her to run, he told family members. An off-duty officer with the San Francisco Police Department, he stayed behind to try to help.

Then the second round came.

Mr. Etcheber’s father, Jean, who was babysitting the couple’s two children, 10 and 12, at their Novato, Calif., home, said the family was given confirmation of Ms. Etcheber’s death on Monday night.

Ms. Etcheber, 50, was a hairdresser whose Facebook profile picture shows her working on her beach handstand next to her daughter.

“Please pray for our family during this difficult time,” Ms. Etcheber’s brother-in-law, Al Etcheber, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday morning.

Brian Fraser

Brian Fraser, 39, was in his element at the Jason Aldean concert on Sunday night, his family said. He had just moved closer to the stage in the hopes that his favorite song, “Dirt Road Anthem,” was coming soon.

Moments later, he was fatally shot. His companions — his wife, Stephanie, and other family members and friends — survived.

“A bigger-than-life man taken far too soon,” his sisters-in-law wrote on a GoFundMe page. “Brian was a rock of love and support to his family.”

A vice president of sales for Greenpath, a mortgage firm, Mr. Fraser lived in La Palma, Calif., and graduated from California Polytechnic State University.

“Brian Fraser impacted everyone who crossed his path with his infectious positive energy, his tenacious will to succeed, and his willingness to help others,” his employer said in a statement.

Keri Galvan

Photo

Keri Galvan, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., had three children, and they were her world. On her Instagram page, she called herself a “super tired super mama of 3.” On Facebook, she posted a photograph of herself standing next to a new Lexus S.U.V., and wrote: “New baby to accommodate allllllllll the babies.”

“They always went to Disneyland together,” Isaac Galvan, her father-in-law, said. “She was just a great mother.”

The children are 10, 4 and 2, according to a GoFundMe page set up by Ms. Galvan’s sister, Lindsey Poole.

Ms. Galvan, 31, who had worked for a decade as a server at Mastro’s Steakhouse in Thousand Oaks, attended the music festival in Las Vegas with her husband, Justin Galvan, and some of their friends.

“Her days started and ended with doing everything in her power to be a wonderful mother,” Ms. Poole said.

Dana Gardner

Photo

Dana Gardner, the deputy recorder of San Bernardino County, Calif., began working for the county 26 years ago as a document clerk, a county spokesman, David Wert, said in an email. Ms. Gardner, 52, was “known for her ‘can-do’ attitude and vibrant energy,” Bob Dutton, the county’s assessor, recorder and clerk, wrote on Facebook.

“Everybody here is still in shock,” Mr. Dutton told The San Bernardino Sun. “They’re waiting for her to walk through the door.”

In a Facebook message, Kayla Gardner, Dana Gardner’s daughter, said: “She spent our whole childhood making sacrifices and doing anything and everything she could for us.”

She added later, “As we got older and became adults, for the first time in her life she stopped worrying about taking care of us and started to take care of herself. She started traveling, spending time with her friends, and enjoying her life the way she wanted. As her children, it was so enjoyable to see her so vibrant and full of life, and that is how we will always remember her.”

Angela Gomez

Photo

When the daughter of Angela Gomez’s cheerleading coach died four years ago, Ms. Gomez was quick to appear at the coach’s door to offer her sympathies. In an interview with The Press-Enterprise, her coach from Riverside Polytechnic High School, Lupe Avila, recalled Ms. Gomez, 20, as “one of the most genuine and loyal people you could ever meet.”

Ms. Gomez, a nursing student from Riverside, Calif. who was known as Angie, was in Las Vegas with her boyfriend when the shooting began.

Rocio Guillen

Rocio Guillen and her fiancé, Christopher Jaksha, left their two children with Mr. Jaksha’s parents for some rare time alone: a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend’s birthday.

Each night they were away, they made video calls to say good night, blowing kisses at Sophia, 17 months, and Austin, who was born in August, said Mr. Jaksha’s mother, Donna.

“We Facetimed all weekend,” Ms. Jaksha said. “We would say ‘Look, it’s mommy and daddy. Look at the cowboy hats.’”

Ms. Guillen, 40, was shot in the thigh as she ran from the shooting with Mr. Jaksha. She was placed in a police car, and an officer applied a tourniquet, but she did not survive.

The couple met when they worked at a Chili’s restaurant as managers. They shared a home in Eastvale, Calif., and both worked at California Pizza Kitchen restaurants nearby as they planned for their wedding. Ms. Guillen has two sons from a previous marriage, according to Ms. Jaksha. “I already considered her to be my daughter-in-law,” Ms. Jaksha said.

Charleston Hartfield

Photo

Charleston Hartfield, 34, an off-duty Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officer, had written a book not long ago. “Memoirs of a Public Servant,” was published in July and focused on his day-to-day work, his time on the force and his interactions on the streets of Las Vegas.

“Every time you talked to him, your life would be better,” Stan King, a friend whose son played football on a team, the Henderson Cowboys, that Officer Hartfield had coached. “You wished you were 10 percent of what that guy was.”

Officer Hartfield, who had served on the police force for 11 years, was memorialized in a candlelight vigil attended by hundreds.

Fellow officers and friends remembered the man they called Charlie or Coach Chucky, or even, occasionally, “Captain America” as knowledgeable and experienced, a patriot and a wit.

“I know that none of us here really planned on saying goodbye to Charlie so soon, but I’m glad we get to send him off in our way, not somebody else’s way,” said Steve Grammas, the president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association.

Chris Hazencomb

Chris Hazencomb, 44, of Camarillo, Calif., had a modest birthday celebration with his mother, Maryanne Hazencomb, 69, last Wednesday. They ran errands, picked up fried chicken, and, as they did every Wednesday, watched an episode of “The Little Couple” that Mr. Hazencomb had recorded the previous day.

The mother and son had always lived together, and worked in tandem to care for Mr. Hazencomb’s father, who was ill for a decade before he died. Mr. Hazencomb had something to look forward to, as well: The Route 91 Harvest music festival, which he was attending with his best friend’s wife. (The best friend, it turned out, hated country music.)

Ms. Hazencomb got the news Sunday night. Mr. Hazencomb had been shot in the head. Ms. Hazencomb rushed to Sunrise Hospital, in Las Vegas, leaving Camarillo at 3 a.m. Mr. Hazencomb was on a ventilator, Ms. Hazencomb said, and officials told her he would not survive.

“He looked like he was sleeping,” Ms. Hazencomb said. Members of her extended family gathered in the hospital room. After getting last rites from the Catholic Church, he was taken off life support.

Ms. Hazencomb said her son had died shielding his best friend’s wife from bullets. “He’d give you the shirt off his back,” Ms. Hazencomb said.

Jennifer Irvine

Jennifer Irvine, 42, built her own legal practice in San Diego, specializing in family law. But there was also time for hobbies like snowboarding and Taekwondo — and for her friends and country music.

“She did go to a lot of concerts,” Jason Irvine, Jennifer’s brother, said, as he waited at the Las Vegas Convention Center to pick up her belongings.

Ms. Irvine had attended the festival in Las Vegas with a group of girlfriends, some of whom had posted pictures of their group, wearing jean shorts and cowboy boots, grinning in front of the festival banner.

“She was there with three other friends who were able to leave when it started, but unfortunately Jennifer was not one of those who was able to leave,” Mr. Irvine said.

Nicol Kimura

Photo

Nicol Kimura, 38, of Placentia, Calif., was part of a close-knit group of 16 friends who always spent time together, said Ryan Miller, one of the people in the group. To the children of those friends, Ms. Kimura was simply Auntie Nicol, he said — a playmate who was eager to host tea parties, color with them and craft.

“Just a beaming light,” Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview.

Seven of the friends went to the concert in Las Vegas; they had already been to several other concerts this year, but they were especially excited to attend the weekend’s Route 91 Harvest Festival, Mr. Miller said.

The group of friends was together when shots first rang out, Mr. Miller said. Soon, everyone had hit the ground.

As the gunfire continued, another friend, about 20 feet away, yelled out that Ms. Kimura had been hurt; she was bleeding from her side.

“We couldn’t pull her to safety,” Mr. Miller said.

Jessica Klymchuk

Jessica Klymchuk, 34, from the province of Alberta in Canada, had been visiting Las Vegas with her boyfriend, The Globe and Mail reported. She was a school librarian, a bus driver and the mother of four children.

Carly Kreibaum

Late Sunday afternoon, Carly Kreibaum’s Facebook page showed the smiling proof of a girls’ weekend in full swing: a picture of Ms. Kreibaum with two friends at the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas — a cafe, canal and gondolas in the background.

At the concert that evening, Ms. Kreibaum, 33, a mother of two from Sutherland, Iowa, was fatally shot, a family member said. Her friends survived.

Back in northwest Iowa, her small community of 600 has been in mourning for Ms. Kreibaum, who studied art education at Wayne State College in Nebraska and worked at Walmart.

She lived with her husband, Chris, and their children, Dalten and Cambri, on a farm just outside town, according to The Des Moines Register.

On Facebook on Tuesday, Mr. Kreibaum thanked family and friends for their support, saying he was en route to Las Vegas. A local church set up a fund for donations for the Kreibaum family, and on Wednesday evening, it opened up the church, inviting those who wanted to talk, pray or deal with their grief.

Rhonda LeRocque

When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Rhonda LeRocque flew down with other members of her church to help the victims.

At home in Tewksbury, Mass., her sister told The Boston Globe, she showed the same kindness and devotion to her husband, Jason, and their 6-year-old daughter. The three were together at the Route 91 festival when the shooting began.

Ms. LeRocque, 42, was active in her local Jehovah’s Witnesses church and worked for the design company IDEO, which confirmed her death in a Facebook post.

“For more than 10 years she cared for her work family at IDEO Cambridge with the same warmth, love and devotion she showed everyone in her life,” the company wrote. “Nobody helped us build community quite like Rhonda.”

Victor Link

When Victor Link, of Orange County, Calif., was struck by gunfire, he had his own rescue crew right beside him.

“Rob, his best friend, who is a firefighter and a paramedic, picked my son up and carried him to a safer place and tried to resuscitate him,” Mr. Link’s father, Loyd, said on Tuesday. “But it didn’t happen.”

Mr. Link, 55, worked in the financial services industry and lived with his partner, Lynne Gonzales. He had a son, Christian, from a previous marriage, his father said.

“My son took a bullet to the chest,” he said.

Jordan McIldoon

Jordan McIldoon, 22, a mechanic from Maple Ridge, British Columbia, was among the dead, a family member said. His parents described him to CBC News in Canada as outdoorsy, about to begin trade school, and on the trip to Las Vegas with his girlfriend. They were expecting him to return home on Monday evening.

“We only had one child,” they told CBC News. “We just don’t know what to do.”

Kelsey Meadows

Photo

There were two Ms. Meadows who were well known in the halls of Taft Union High School in Taft, Calif.: Stacy, who has worked at the school for 35 years, and Kelsey, her daughter, a substitute teacher.

Kelsey Meadows, who was 28, was killed in the shooting, leaving behind her parents, brother and sister-in-law, “along with an entire community that loved and respected her,” the school said in a statement.

The younger Ms. Meadows graduated from Taft Union High School in 2007 and returned in 2012 to work there as a teacher — alongside her mother, who worked in information technology. “Kelsey was smart, compassionate and kind,” Mary Alice Finn, the principal, said in an email. “She had a sweet spirit and a love for children.”

Brad Meadows, her brother, informed friends of her death on Facebook “with an absolutely shattered heart,” he wrote.

Calla Medig

Photo

Calla Medig could not stop chattering to her co-workers at Moxie’s Grill and Bar, a restaurant in Edmonton, Alberta, where she was a bartender and server, about her upcoming trip to Las Vegas.

“I even gave her a hard time because I don’t like country music,” said her boss, Scott Collingwood. “I told her, ‘You’re going to be out there two-stepping. And she said, ‘There’s nothing wrong with two-stepping!’”

Ms. Medig, 28, was a warm and funny presence in the restaurant, where she had worked for two years.

She was so dependable and levelheaded that when Mr. Collingwood couldn’t reach her by phone, text or Facebook in the aftermath of the shooting on Sunday night, he immediately feared the worst.

“Calla is super responsible,” he said. “I just knew.”

Ms. Medig was scheduled to fly back home on Wednesday. Thursday was important to her. It was to have been her first day at the restaurant after being promoted to manager.

Sonny Melton

Photo

When Sonny Melton and his wife, Heather Gulish Melton, heard the sound of gunshots in Las Vegas on Sunday night, he grabbed her and began to run.

“I felt him get shot in the back,” Ms. Gulish Melton told WCYB, a television station in northeast Tennessee. “I want everyone to know what a kindhearted, loving man he was, but at this point, I can barely breathe.”

Mr. Melton, 29, was described in Facebook tributes as a kind spirit, a registered nurse who worked for much of 2016 in the surgical unit at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital in Jackson, Tenn.

“He was a very kind, compassionate, genuine person who lived life to the fullest, and he took great care of our patients,” said Amy Garner, a spokeswoman for the hospital. Union University, a college in Jackson, Tenn., said Mr. Melton was a 2015 graduate of the school and worked in the emergency department at Henry County Medical Center.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Melton and his wife had been married only a year and had traveled from Tennessee for the music festival.

“When the bullets began raining down from above, Sonny shielded her from danger, selflessly giving up his life to save hers,” Ms. Sanders said on Monday.

Pati Mestas

Photo

Not long before the shooting began, Pati Mestas posted a video on Facebook. It showed her jumping up and down in front of the stage at the Route 91 festival, having made her way up to the front of the crowd.

“That was the type of person she was,” her cousin Tom Smith said. “If you could do it and if it wasn’t wrong, she would do it.”

Ms. Mestas, 67, was partly retired from her job as a deli manager at a Shell convenience store in Corona, Calif., and was spending all the time she could with her three children, eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild, Mr. Smith said. He saw her in March, he recalled, and she had never seemed so happy.

“When she did something, she did it 100 percent,” Mr. Smith said. “She was faithful to her family, to her friends, a very strong Christian, and she couldn’t get enough out of life.”

Austin Meyer

Austin Meyer, 24, hoped to own an auto repair shop, his sister, Veronica Meyer, told KSBW, a television news station in Monterey, Calif.

Mr. Meyer had recently moved from his home near Monterey to Reno, Nev. to earn a degree in transportation technologies at Truckee Meadows Community College.

He was a fan of Bobby Bones and the Raging Idiots, one of the acts performing at the Route 91 festival, which he attended with his fiancée, Dana Getreu.

“He was a wonderful young man and my future son-in-law,” Ms. Getreu’s father, Gary Getreu, said in a statement released by the college. “The loss and grief his family and mine feel at this time is beyond belief.”

Adrian Murfitt

Photo

Adrian Murfitt, 35, had been working 16-hour days all summer as a commercial salmon fisherman in his home state of Alaska. It was time for a break.

He gathered up two of his childhood friends and booked tickets for a country music festival, just as he had done last year, according to his sister, Shannon Gothard.

“He had such a great time when he went before, and he wanted to treat himself for a successful fishing season,” Ms. Gothard said from Anchorage.

Mr. Murfitt was an Alaskan to the core. Since he was a toddler, he loved playing hockey, she said; he could fix almost anything mechanical; he was devoted to his dog, Paxson, a Western Siberian Laika.

Ms. Gothard said the family had pieced together her brother’s last minutes from Brian MacKinnon, a friend who was with him at the concert on Sunday night. “He was just having a good time, enjoying himself and got shot in the neck,” she said of her brother. A woman standing next to Mr. Murfitt was shot in the head, Mr. MacKinnon told the family. He watched as medics tried to resuscitate Mr. Murfitt, though the medics told Mr. MacKinnon to leave the scene for his own safety.

“Sadly, he died in my arms,” Mr. MacKinnon wrote on Facebook. “I don’t really know what else to say at this time. I’m really sorry.”

Rachael Parker

Rachael Parker, a police records technician from Manhattan Beach, Calif., was off duty when she was shot. She died in the hospital, the Manhattan Beach Police Department confirmed in a statement.

She was 33 and had worked at the department for 10 years.

Jennifer Parks

Photo

As children growing up in California, they were always together, so close that their names seemed to run together into one: Jenny-and-Bobby.

“She said, ‘I am going to marry Bobby,’” said Jennifer Parks’s aunt, Rhonda Boyle. “I guess she always had a little crush on him.”

They became high school sweethearts and later married. And they were together on Sunday night in Las Vegas, when Ms. Parks, 36, was fatally shot while attending the concert with her husband, Bobby Parks. Mr. Parks was wounded in the arm and a finger, her family said.

The Westside Union School District, where she worked, said Ms. Parks “will be remembered for her sense of humor, her passion for her work, her devotion to her students, and her commitment to continuing her own learning and to taking on whatever new projects came her way.”

Ms. Parks was a mother of two, a kindergarten teacher and a volleyball coach in Lancaster, Calif.

“She had a heart of gold,” Ms. Boyle said.

Carrie Parsons

Carrie Parsons, 31, a manager at the Seattle office of the employment firm Ajilon, was on a “girls trip” to the festival, a friend, Laura Cooper, told KOMO, a local television news station.

Ms. Parsons had posted photographs on social media and wrote “Night made,” after the performance of Eric Church, her favorite country music artist, KOMO reported.

Lisa Patterson

Photo

Lisa Patterson was determined that her three children, now 19, 17 and 8, would grow up to be fearless.

She pushed them to take part in school plays so that they would be confident taking risks. She drove them to softball practice so that they would learn teamwork. She made sure they performed community service, while juggling her own volunteer work and helping to run her husband’s small hardwood flooring business, without the aid of a housekeeper or nanny.

The trip to Las Vegas, with a group of mom friends from her church, was a departure for Ms. Patterson, 46, of Lomita, Calif., who was typically too occupied to take time out for herself. But her love of all types of music was well known to her friends and family, who would often be induced to sing with her in the car, loud enough to provoke looks from others sitting in traffic nearby.

The children, said her close friend, Deborah Beckman, learned to simply smile back.

“She has brought them up to really stand on their two feet,” Ms. Beckman said. “And I thank God because I think that will help them to be able to deal with it.”

John Phippen

Photo

When the gunfire began on Sunday night, John Phippen, and his son, Travis, followed the same urgent instinct: to try to save people.

John Phippen, 56, who ran a home remodeling company in Santa Clarita, Calif., and Travis, 24, an emergency medical technician, covered the bodies of strangers with their own. They crawled toward the wounded and used belts as tourniquets to try to stop their bleeding, his son said in a local television news interview.

Then John Phippen was shot.

“I got over there as fast as I could and I put my arm around him,” Travis Phippen said.

With the help of a bystander, they got John Phippen away from the area, but he did not survive.

“He told me that he loved me and he wanted everybody to know how much he loved them,” the younger Mr. Phippen said.

Melissa Ramirez

Photo

Melissa Ramirez, 26, grew up in California’s Antelope Valley amid a big and close-knit extended family that she often visited on weekends when she attended college, at California State University, Bakersfield.

Her love of country music drew her to the festival in Las Vegas, her cousin, Fabiola Farnetti, said on Tuesday. When the two were in high school, they spent summers working alongside Ms. Ramirez’s parents selling fruit and vegetables for a local farm company at flea markets in the area.

The daughter of Mexican immigrants who became United States citizens, Ms. Ramirez majored in business and had recently received a promotion at the car insurance company where she worked, her cousin said.

“She always helped her parents, and just wanted to be there,” Ms. Farnetti said.

The family had held out hope that she had survived the shooting, but her father identified her remains at the Las Vegas morgue early on Tuesday.

On her Instagram account, she posted photographs of her dog, a boxer, her young niece and, most recently, from her trip to Las Vegas.

Jordyn Rivera

Jordyn Rivera, 21, a health care management student at California State University, San Bernardino, spent part of last summer in London for the school’s study abroad program.

“We will remember and treasure her for her warmth, optimism, energy and kindness,” the university’s president, Tomas Morales, wrote in an email on Tuesday to employees and students.

A member of the health education honor society, Eta Sigma Gamma, Ms. Rivera was “a total sweetheart with piercing eyes & a beautiful smile,” a fellow student, Natasha Lavera, wrote on Facebook.

Ms. Rivera, of La Verne, Calif., had traveled to the concert with her mother, a friend told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

She would have graduated next year.

Quinton Robbins

An aunt of Quinton Robbins, 20, who worked as a recreation assistant for the city of Henderson, Nev., wrote on Facebook that her nephew was among the dead.

“I can’t say enough good about this sweet soul,” the aunt, Kilee Wells Sanders, wrote of Mr. Robbins. “Everyone who met him loved him. His contagious laugh and smile.”

Outside of his job with the city of Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas, Mr. Robbins coached flag football for 5-year-olds, his brother’s flag football team and softball teams. He also coached basketball along with his uncle at a high school, and was finishing certification to be a full-time coach for the Clark County School District.

Mr. Robbins had been thrilled to score tickets to the music festival. “He was a big country music fan and he and his girlfriend were excited to go,” said James DiNicola, Mr. Robbins’s friend and colleague at the Henderson recreational department. “It was a last-minute thing.”

Cameron Robinson

Cameron Robinson, 28, had taken Monday off from his job as a management analyst for the city of Las Vegas to attend the country music festival with his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley.

The creator of a smartphone app that eased navigation for attendees of the city government’s annual conferences, Mr. Robinson was a frequent volunteer at city events, and had been given a promotion last summer, according to Brad Jerbic, the city attorney for Las Vegas and a family friend.

“He was driven, but not so driven that he didn’t know how to enjoy life,” Mr. Jerbic said.

Mr. Robinson was shot in the neck, Mr. Jerbic said. He died shortly after 10 p.m. Sunday night, in Mr. Eardley’s arms.

Tara Roe Smith

Tara Roe Smith, 34, of Alberta, an educational assistant, was separated from her husband during the attack, according to The Edmonton Journal.

“Tara was an aide in my granddaughter’s preschool class,” wrote Viola Anderson, a resident of Okotoks, where Ms. Roe Smith lived, on a GoFundMe page set up by a friend. “She will be missed.”

The mother of two young sons, she grew up in Manitoba, where the community is “heartbroken,” a family friend told CTV Manitoba.

“It is with sadness, shock, and grief that we confirm the loss of a Foothills School Division staff member,” John Bailey, superintendent of the school district where Ms. Roe Smith worked, wrote in a statement posted on the district’s website. “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected by this unimaginable attack.”

Lisa Romero-Muniz

Last year, Lisa Romero-Muniz’s husband, Chris, forgot their wedding anniversary. This year he was determined to make it up to her.

So he made a grand gesture, planning a four-day weekend in Las Vegas and buying tickets to see her favorite country singer, Jason Aldean. Mr. Muniz, who worked long hours at a refinery, and Ms. Romero-Muniz, 48 and a high school secretary in Gallup, N.M., left on Thursday for Las Vegas, more than a six-hour drive away.

“She was beyond excited,” said Rosie Fernandez, her friend and supervisor at the high school where they worked. “For her husband to remember her anniversary and do all of that, this was a big thing for her.”

Ms. Romero-Muniz’s death, confirmed by officials at the school where she worked, left her colleagues and community shaken, her co-workers said.

Born and raised in the small city of Gallup, she was a mother of three grown children and a secretary at Miyamura High School, where she was responsible for disciplining students who got into trouble. Ms. Romero-Muniz had a warm personality and a big laugh, always teasing her co-workers, Ms. Fernandez said.

“We were known as the two loudmouths of the office,” Ms. Fernandez said. “She knew 90 percent of the kids at this school. She would talk to them like she was talking to her own children. I’d hear her saying, ‘I know you can do better than this.’”

On Monday morning, administrators put up posters around the school so that students could write on them how they were feeling. A candlelight memorial is planned for Monday evening.

Christopher Roybal

Christopher Roybal went to the concert with his mother, Debby Allen, to celebrate his 29th birthday.

The two had become separated at the event, Ms. Allen told local television stations, and when the gunfire started, she ran but then tried to return to the festival grounds to look for him.

“I just kept saying, ‘My son, my son, where is my son?’” Ms. Allen said. “This guy wouldn’t let me go back in. He goes: ‘You have to run away from the gunfire, not towards the gunfire.’”

Mr. Roybal had recently moved to Denver from Colorado Springs, where he was the general manager at a Crunch gym, which announced his death on its Facebook page.

He was a Navy veteran who had served stints in Afghanistan. In a Facebook post in July, he had recalled the emotions of battle: “The anger stays, long after your friends have died, the lives you’ve taken are buried and your boots are placed neatly in a box in some storage unit.”

Brett Schwanbeck

Growing up in Arizona with five siblings, Brett Schwanbeck, 61, was a brother who loved to joke around and have fun. He had the most beautiful smile ever, his sister, Robin Martin, said. “He was very, very full of life,” she said.

Mr. Schwanbeck had gone to the Route 91 festival with his fiancée, Anna Orozco, who he had been planning to marry in January. Photographs of the couple on Facebook show them posing on the concert grounds, the gleaming Mandalay Bay resort in the background.

Mr. Schwanbeck, a retired truck driver who lived in Bullhead City, Ariz., had met Ms. Orozco in high school in Ash Fork. Their romance blossomed much later.

Ms. Martin said she tried to speak to her brother after the shooting while he was on life support in the hospital, hoping that he could hear her.

“Family meant everything to him,” she said.

Bailey Schweitzer

At Infinity Communications and Consulting, the Bakersfield, Calif., company where Bailey Schweitzer worked as a receptionist, Ms. Schweitzer “was always the ray of sunshine in our office on a cloudy day,” Fred Brakeman, the company’s president, said. “No one could possibly have a bad day when Bailey was around. If you have ever called or visited our office, she was the perky one that helped direct you to the staff member you needed.”

Before graduating, Ms. Schweitzer was a cheerleader at Centennial High School in Bakersfield and a frequent volunteer at the Bakersfield Speedway, which her family owned, The Bakersfield Californian reported. A co-worker, Katelynn Cleveland, told the newspaper that Ms. Schweitzer, 20, had been looking forward to the Route 91 music festival for weeks.

Laura Shipp

The staff at the Chili’s restaurant in Arroyo Market Square in Las Vegas knew it was Friday when Laura Shipp, 50, took her seat by the bar and ordered her favorites: Smoked wings and a Presidente Margarita.

“Like clockwork she would be there Friday night, first seat at the bar,” said Chris Atkinson, a manager at the restaurant, over a Facebook message.

The wings were not the only draw. Ms. Shipp’s son, Corey, 23, a marine reservist, was a bartender and server there, and she liked to be around him. She was so well-liked, Mr. Atkinson said, that he and Corey’s other friends took to calling her “Mama Shipp.” And Corey Shipp liked having her around.

“These two seemed like, even if they weren’t family, they would still be best friends,” Mr. Atkinson said.

Corey Shipp moved to Las Vegas first, and Laura Shipp followed. “Corey was her only and Laura was his only,” said Steve Shipp, 47, Ms. Shipp’s brother, who confirmed her death.

They loved the Dodgers and country music, which is what brought them to the festival. Corey Shipp was not harmed, but he could not find his mother despite a frantic search that involved many members of the Chili’s staff.

“It took about 28, to 30 hours, just even to figure out that she had passed,” Mr. Shipp, the brother, said.

Erick Silva

The security staff working at the Route 91 festival were the first to help, and Erick Silva, 21, of Las Vegas was one of them. Mr. Silva, who was assigned to a position near the front of the stage, began trying to help audience members escape over a barricade.

As he worked to usher others away, he was shot, and was later pronounced dead in the hospital, Jay Purves, the Nevada vice president of Mr. Silva’s employer, Contemporary Services Corp., said in an email.

Two other C.S.C. employees were also shot, but they survived, Mr. Purves said. “Watching the many video clips on YouTube and social media, you see our men and women in the yellow shirts jumping right into the middle of the chaos as it started to help those who were shot.”

Mr. Silva worked long hours on the job. “When he wasn’t helping me, he would always go where he was needed the most to help out in any way possible,” James Garrett, a co-worker, wrote in a Facebook tribute.

“He never complained about anything.”

The company will name one of its training centers after Mr. Silva, Mr. Purves said.

Susan Smith

Susan Smith, 53, was a lover of country music, a devoted mother to a son and daughter, a wife and a popular office manager at an elementary school in Simi Valley, Calif.

“A wonderful person,” said her father, Tom Rementer, through tears.

She had gone to Las Vegas with friends. They survived the shooting.

Brennan Stewart

Photo

A year ago, Brennan Stewart posted on Facebook a video of himself performing the country song “You Should Be Here.” It has gone viral in recent days. Grieving families and friends — and not just his — have seen it as a touchstone after the Route 91 shooting.

In his original post on Oct. 4, 2016, Mr. Stewart wrote that he had taken a “slower approach” to the song, written by the musician Cole Swindell in 2015 after the death of his father. “Thoughts on this one!?” Mr. Stewart asked.

“Solid performance. Rest in peace, Brennan,” read one of dozens of recent replie+s on the old thread.

A tribute to the love of country music that propelled Mr. Stewart, 30, of Las Vegas, and so many others to the music festival, the video has been shared over a thousand times.

“This is one of those moments that’s got your name written all over it,” Mr. Brennan sings. “You know that if I had just one wish, it’d be that you didn’t have to miss this.”

“You should be here.”

Derrick Taylor

A California corrections officer in charge of inmates who volunteer to fight forest fires, Derrick Taylor, 56, of Oxnard, Calif., had been stationed in the northern tip of the state last month, where a fire had been burning for weeks.

He made it home just in time to leave for the trip he had planned with his girlfriend, Denise Cohen, to attend the music festival in Las Vegas. The couple both died in the attack. In his job and in his personal relationships, Mr. Taylor, his younger son Kyle, 31, said, was kind, generous — and honest.

When he was in college, the younger Mr. Taylor recalled, his father sometimes called to make sure he was in class. He also insisted that his grandchildren leave video games behind while he escorted them to the park or on hikes. Friends the younger Mr. Taylor had not heard from since high school contacted him after hearing about his father’s death. They remembered him as a kind of “second dad.”

“He was someone who cares enough to hold you accountable,” Mr. Taylor said, “for who you could be and who you should be.”

Neysa Tonks

Neysa Tonks, 46 and a mother of three from Las Vegas, had brought “so much joy, fun and laughter” to her workplace, according to her employer, Technologent.

Her father, Chris Davis, told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that Ms. Tonks was a devoted parent to her sons, Kaden, Braxton and Greysen, and a generous member of her community, every year delivering hundreds of backpacks with supplies to people who needed them.

Michelle Vo

Michelle Vo was one of those people who didn’t waste time.

In the last few months, she was a whirlwind of new hobbies — paddle boarding, golf, even surfing, said a close friend, Casey Lubin. She had already been all over Europe and Southeast Asia. Next on her list was Iceland — she was determined to travel there by herself.

Ms. Vo and Ms. Lubin had met through a mutual friend. “He was like, ‘You have to meet this girl, the two of you are meant to be friends,’” Ms. Lubin said. “She’s like a shark. She’s a go-getter. She’s so inspiring.”

Ms. Vo, 32 and an insurance agent from Los Angeles, was by herself at the concert on Sunday when she befriended a stranger, Kody Robertson, of Ohio. Ms. Vo was standing next to Mr. Robertson when she was shot.

Kurt Von Tillow

Kurt Von Tillow, 55, was “the most patriotic person you’ve ever met,” his brother-in-law, Mark Carson, told KCRA, a local NBC News station for Cameron Park, Calif., the small town in the Sierra foothills near Sacramento where Mr. Von Tillow lived.

Mr. Von Tillow had traveled to Las Vegas for the concert with family members. His wife and daughter escaped unharmed, Mr. Carson said. Mr. Von Tillow’s sister was shot in the thigh and his niece in an ankle. Both were expected to recover.

Mr. Von Tillow’s wife told family members she was herded out of the area by the authorities amid the chaos of the shooting scene, Mr. Carson said. “That was probably the hardest part for her — having to leave him there,” he said.

On Monday, friends and family gathered at the Cameron Park Country Club, where Mr. Von Tillow was a member. At his home, family members set up a memorial with an American flag, and played the national anthem.

“Guarantee you, he’s covered in red, white and blue right now, with a Coors Light in his hand, smiling with his family and listening to some music,” Mr. Carson told the television station.

Bill Wolfe Jr.

Bill Wolfe Jr., a wrestling and Little League coach in Shippensburg, Pa., went to Las Vegas with his wife, Robyn, to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Only Robyn came home.

“It is with the most of broken hearts, the families of Bill Wolfe Jr. and his wife Robyn share that Bill has been confirmed to be among the deceased as a result of the mass attack in Las Vegas,” the Shippensburg Police Department said on Facebook. “Please continue to hold our entire family as well as those affected across the nation in your unending prayers.”

Mr. Wolfe, 42 and a coach at Shippensburg Greyhound Wrestling, was also an employee of the engineering consulting firm Dewberry and a former president of the Shippensburg Wrestling Booster Club.

“He was just a good guy,” the current president of the booster club, Cory Forrester, told Penn Live. “He was a go-to kind of guy, a guy you could depend on, a kind of guy you could be proud to be around.”",The Victims of Las Vegas: Remembering Their Lives,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/us/vegas-victims-names.html

Of the six 14-letter entries, five have never appeared before. (THREE-CAR GARAGE is the exception and has appeared only once before, in a larger Sunday grid.)

17A: Many of the smaller entries have purposely vague clues as well. This is how you know your weekend has arrived. “Gross” can mean lots of things. Furthermore, EARN has a lot of senses beside “make, exclusive of deductions.”

22A: I was pretty sure “Cinnabon feature” was either “aroma” or SWIRL, so I waited for a crossing.

30A: O. HENRY’s “The Ransom of Red Chief” was a story published in “The Saturday Evening Post” and is about the kidnapping of a rich man’s child. He’s such a handful that the criminals wind up paying to have him taken back. This has become a very popular plotline over the past century.

Constructor Notes

Going to keep this short, because I honestly don’t remember much about this puzzle. I see from my files that it dates back to May 2015, a month before my high school graduation. That whole time period is a blur for me: My last AP tests, throwing my cap in the air, saying goodbye to old friends, feeling anxious about starting college, etc. Apparently I was making themelesses as well — not a huge surprise. Looking at the puzzle now, I’m pleased with how it turned out. I must have been trying to mix things up by doing triple stacks of 14s, and I like my choices of long entries (especially the wacky-looking MI CASA ES SU CASA at 1-Across). I also appreciate how relatively smooth and trivia-free the rest of the grid is. Might have gone for a little more zing were I building this puzzle today, but at the same time, the relative lack of crosswordese allows for a lot of nice cluing opportunities. Speaking of which, big ups to Will, Joel, and Sam for improving so many of the clues. Didn’t remember the originals, but looking back on them now, I feel their replacements are definitely better. Hope you enjoy — maybe it’s time for me to start solving my old puzzles!

“McConnell has become synonymous with gridlock,” said Richard C.

Allies of Mr. McConnell poured millions into the runoff contest, painting Mr. Strange as a reliable Trump loyalist and Mr. Moore as a lifelong, untrustworthy politician.

That was not quite true.

With Democrats across the country energized by the election of Mr. Trump, some analysts say Democrats now have an outside chance to pick up the seat — even in a deeply conservative state like Alabama. But if Mr. Moore wins, he will almost certainly be a wild card in the Senate, where Mr. McConnell is already struggling to keep the 52 Republicans in line.

“The stakes here are high,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McConnell. “His majority of 52 is slim, and it’s even slimmer when you consider at any given time there are four to six of them who are contrarians. So if you take out a Luther, who is not a contrarian, and you throw in a Roy Moore, who’s going to be a contrarian, that makes the majority even less effective and productive.”

And it could get worse — much worse. Buoyed by Mr. Moore’s victory, conservatives like the former Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, now speak of separating “Trumpism” from Mr. Trump, and they are throwing themselves behind insurgent populists around the country.

Already, Trumpist candidates have emerged to challenge Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona in Republican primary races next year.

In Mississippi, Mr. Bannon is courting another firebrand, State Senator Chris McDaniel, to challenge Senator Roger Wicker, who embodies low-key country-club Republicanism.

And Mr. Bannon and allies are looking for a populist candidate to run for Tennessee’s Senate seat, which opened up Tuesday when Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, announced that he would not run for re-election.

Victories by such candidates would drastically remake the Senate, and could threaten Mr. McConnell’s leadership. Already, conservatives are smelling blood.

“If this was a football team and you lost this many times, you’d start firing the coaches,” said David Bozell, the president of For America, a conservative advocacy group.

Richard A. Viguerie, the conservative direct-mail guru, called Mr. Moore’s victory “a stunning rejection of Mitch McConnell’s corrupt and incompetent leadership.”

But in the Senate, Mr. McConnell has a deep well of support within his conference, in part because he is so effective a raising money to re-elect his fellow Republicans. He also has a thick skin.

“Senator McConnell is not a hot personality,” said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, an organization of social conservatives. “He doesn’t have real high highs, and he doesn’t have real low lows, and he’s been at this a long time, and he’s smart enough and wise enough to know that there are good days and not so good days in this business.”

Senate Republicans are clearly frustrated by the legislative gridlock that has gripped the chamber, especially the on-again, off-again effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The latest attempt ended Tuesday when Mr. McConnell concluded that he did not have the votes to pass the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill, which would have taken money spent under the law and given it to the states in the form of block grants.

“I wasn’t sent up here to sit around and talk,” complained Senator John Kennedy, a freshman Republican from Louisiana. “I was sent up here to make ordinary Americans’ lives better.”

Harvey Weinstein Harassment Allegations

3. Weinstein’s statement about the ’60s and ’70s is correct, as far as it goes.

Such behavior was certainly considered rude, even caddish and the decent men I knew wouldn’t do it.

However, it was not then considered sexual harassment; it certainly was not regarded as anything that you could lose your job over, or be prosecuted over. It was widely regarded as a matter of internal restraint on the man’s part and a matter of lack of internal restraint on the part of the occasional woman who would slap a man in the face.

That said, that was then, this is now. And it’s been “now” for a couple decades. It’s long past time for Harvey to have gotten with The Program. He certainly should know that the ’60s and ’70s aren’t going to excuse anything now.

My small experiment, with my daughter as the guinea pig, drove home to me the profound shift in our relationship with technology. For generations, our trust in it has gone no further than feeling confident the machine or mechanism will do what it’s supposed or expected to do, nothing more, nothing less. We trust a washing machine to clean our clothes or an A.T.M. to dispense money, but we don’t expect to form a relationship with them or call them by name.

Today, we’re no longer trusting machines just to do something, but to decide what to do and when to do it. The next generation will grow up in an age where it’s normal to be surrounded by autonomous agents, with or without cute names. The Alexas of the world will make a raft of decisions for my kids and others like them as they proceed through life — everything from whether to have mac and cheese or a green bowl for dinner to the perfect gift for a friend’s birthday to what to do to improve their mood or energy and even advice on whom they should date. In time, the question for them won’t be, “Should we trust robots?” but “Do we trust them too much?”

With some trepidation, I watched my daughter gaily hand her decisions over. “Alexa, what should I do today?” Grace asked in her singsong voice on Day 3. It wasn’t long before she was trusting her with the big choices. “Alexa, what should I wear today? My pink or my sparkly dress?”

In April, Amazon unveiled the Echo Look, a $199 Alexa add-on that features a hands-free selfie camera controlled by your voice. The device doesn’t just hear you, it sees you. According to Amazon, the Style Check feature uses “machine-learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists” to judge different outfits, awarding them an overall rating to decide which is “better” based on “current trends and what flatters you.”

The images it takes of you happen to be stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud until you delete them. And while the fashion-savvy assistant helps you decide what to wear, it has an ulterior motive: to sell you clothing, including choices from one of Amazon’s own apparel lines, such as Lark & Ro and North Eleven, started in 2016.

It’s these kinds of intersections – like this small collision between robot “helpfulness” and a latent commercial agenda — that can make parents like me start to wonder about the ethical niceties of this brave new bot world. Alexa, after all, is not “Alexa.” She’s a corporate algorithm in a black box.

Grace doesn’t like it when I tell her what to wear. How would she feel about Alexa judging her? Would she see it as helpful or crushing? This could well be one of our parenting tasks in the near future — preparing our children for the psychological repercussions of such personal interactions with computer “people.”

Still, the next generation is likely to feel very differently about machines than we do. In a study conducted by M.I.T. Media Lab, 27 children, aged between 3 and 10, interacted with A.I. devices and toys including Alexa, Google Home, Julie (a chatbot) and, finally, Cozmo (a robot in the form of a toy bulldozer). The researchers asked the children how they felt about the devices in terms of intelligence, personality and trust. The younger children seemed to see the agents as real people and asked them personal questions: “Hey, Alexa, how old are you?” and “What are you?” Some thought the device had multiple personalities. “She doesn’t know the answer,” said one child, wisely. “Ask the other Alexa.”

Almost 80 percent of the children thought Alexa would always tell the truth. Some of the children believed they could teach the devices something useful, like how to make a paper plane, suggesting they felt a genuine, give-and-take relationship with the machines.

How do we teach our children to question not only the security and privacy implications but also the ethical and commercial intentions of a device designed by marketers?

Our kids are going to need to know where and when it is appropriate to put their trust in computer code alone. I watched Grace hand over her trust to Alexa quickly. There are few checks and balances to deter children from doing just that, not to mention very few tools to help them make informed decisions about A.I. advice.

Mr. McConnell could be an anchor around incumbents in the same fashion as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who is routinely used to undermine Democratic candidates. The loudest applause Mr. Moore received during an election-eve rally came when he declared, “Mitch McConnell needs to be replaced.”

In a memo about the Alabama election that circulated among Republican donors, Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a “super PAC” closely allied with Mr. McConnell, said primary voters were intensely angry and inclined to blame Republicans for dysfunction in Washington.

“The Republican Congress has replaced President Obama as the bogeyman for conservative G.O.P. primary voters,” Mr. Law wrote, cautioning that the president was helping to amplify that point of view: “This narrative is driven by Trump himself, and it resonates with primary voters who believe the Republican Congress ‘isn’t doing enough’ (as we frequently heard in focus groups) to advance the president’s agenda.”

Mr. Law, whose group spent more than $10 million to prop up Mr. Strange, said in the memo that Republicans had been damaged by “the Obamacare repeal fiasco,” and said they should expect to fight hard-right primary candidates in Mississippi and Nevada, among other states.

The convulsive mood on the right has considerably reshaped the political map for 2018, making a favorable list of Senate races somewhat less hospitable to Republicans. Two Republican senators, Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona, have seen their poll numbers collapse after clashing with Mr. Trump and embracing unpopular legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

In Tennessee, Senator Bob Corker, a well-liked lawmaker from a traditional Republican mold, on Tuesday became the first Senate Republican to announce that he would not seek re-election in 2018. His departure is likely to yield a contentious Republican primary, much like the one just concluded in Alabama.

The Alabama race “is going to inspire a lot of people,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview in Montgomery on Tuesday night.

Mr. Bannon said he had held discussions about the Tennessee race with Mark E. Green, a state senator who was nominated to be Mr. Trump’s Army secretary before withdrawing after facing scrutiny for his past statements about gay and transgender people. Tennessee could be the site of the next major populist-versus-establishment conflagration if Gov. Bill Haslam responds to entreaties to enter the race.

Mr. Bannon also said he aimed to oust Mr. Heller, Mr. Flake and Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Ed Martin, a former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, said Mr. Bannon had also inquired about the state’s Senate race, in which the Republican establishment has rallied around Josh Hawley, the state attorney general, as an opponent for Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat.

After leaving the White House last month, Mr. Bannon returned to his perch at Breitbart News, and has been using the hard-right website and his close ties to the Mercer family, New York-based conservative donors, to create a new, insurgent power base.

It remains unlikely that Republicans will lose control of the Senate next year, because the playing field of races is tilted so strongly in their direction. The party is defending just eight seats, mostly in strongly conservative states, compared with 25 seats held by Democrats or independents who caucus with them.

Yet the pitfalls Republicans have encountered so far have created unexpected opportunities for Democrats, and the party is assessing even long-shot races where there is the possibility of an upset. In Tennessee, a solidly Republican state, several new Democrats are considering the race for Mr. Corker’s seat: Mayor Andy Berke of Chattanooga said in a statement that he would explore a bid “in the coming weeks,” and State Senator Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville legislator, is also eyeing the race. One Democrat, James Mackler, a lawyer and Iraq war veteran, is already running.

And in conservative Alabama, both Democrats and Republicans believe Mr. Moore’s nomination may put the seat at risk in a Dec. 12 general election, when he faces Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor who is the Democratic nominee.

Mr. Jones is scheduled to campaign with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. next week, and said in an interview on Tuesday that he would seek support from Republican and independent voters who may be repelled by Mr. Moore, who was removed from the bench for defying Supreme Court rulings and has called in the past for banning homosexuality.

In a sign of Mr. Moore’s vulnerability, Mr. Law’s memo described him as off-putting to “business-oriented Republicans,” who “recoil at Moore’s grandstanding.”

It is not only Republican senators who could find themselves cast out by conservative challengers next year. A parade of candidates, aligning themselves explicitly with Mr. Trump, is lining up to take on House Republicans whom they view as insufficiently loyal to the president. If enough Republican lawmakers are ousted in primaries, or forced to spend millions just to secure renomination, it could give Democrats a better chance to pick up the two dozen seats they need to take a majority.

“I think incumbents are extremely vulnerable,” said Barry Moore, an Alabama state representative challenging Representative Martha Roby, a Republican who called on Mr. Trump to withdraw from the presidential race late last fall. “The American people are sending a message that there’s nothing getting done in D.C., and we’re going to have to replace a lot of those people.”

A spokesman for Ms. Roby, Todd Stacy, noted that she and “her House colleagues have voted to repeal Obamacare, roll back Obama regulations, repeal Dodd-Frank, fund border wall construction, rebuild the military, reform the V.A. and tax reform got rolled out today.”

Still, the alarm is most acute in the Senate. Party strategists have seen private polling in a number of states that shows Mr. McConnell deeply unpopular with his fellow Republicans. In Arizona they have found Mr. Flake trailing his primary challenger, Kelli Ward, a former state senator, by a significant margin.

This month, Senator John McCain, Mr. Flake’s Arizona colleague, staged something of a gentle intervention, urging Mr. Flake to move more aggressively to repair his standing in the party, according to two Republicans briefed on the conversation.

Mr. Bannon taunted Mr. Flake on Tuesday night, suggesting that if the Arizona senator “doesn’t get a better poll in the next 30 days, you’re going to see him step down or the establishment is going to make him” — a possibility Mr. Flake’s campaign spokesman discounted.

“He is running,” said Will Allison, a spokesman for Mr. Flake.

In Mississippi, Mr. Wicker, a former chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has been gearing up early in anticipation of a revolt on the right, hiring a veteran campaign manager, Justin Brasell, and branding himself on social media as a fierce ally of Mr. Trump.

But Chris McDaniel, a Mississippi state senator who nearly toppled Mr. Wicker’s colleague, Thad Cochran, in a 2014 primary, said that Mr. Moore’s victory made a challenge against Mr. Wicker “more compelling” and that he would decide by the end of October. He said he had spoken multiple times with the Mercers in recent months and had received assurances of support.

A great many hunters and gun owners are like me. We are not “gun nuts,” stockpiling weapons in the name of some future apocalypse. We exercise our Second Amendment rights in a way that is palatable to most people who otherwise oppose guns — we’re the bridge that connects the two sides of the chasm in the national debate. Even the N.R.A. recognizes this, which is why it tries to enhance its legitimacy by identifying as a sportsmen’s group, though few of its stances reflect the will of sportsmen. Hunters are accustomed to following nuanced gun laws (gun calibers and ammunition types are limited depending on the season and species we’re hunting, for example), so we understand that common-sense regulation doesn’t mean an end to bearing arms. And because we see the brute power of a gun every time we kill an animal, we are regularly reminded of why guns need to be regulated.

We also have an interest in drafting sensible gun laws now, rather than waiting for an avalanche of pent-up frustration to generate a policy response so long overdue that it overreaches. If we don’t want onerous regulations to infringe on a tradition we love, then we can’t afford to stay quiet as body counts rise and politicians offer no more than thoughts and prayers.

The N.R.A. doesn’t represent gun owners like me, but the problem is that no one else really does, either. Americans who don’t own guns are represented by an array of nonprofits that share their wish to crack down on gun violence with gun laws that are as restrictive as possible. Gun owners are hesitant to get behind these groups because we first want to understand their nuanced views on gun laws. Details matter to us.

Last year I joined the board of a small nonprofit in Oregon called Gun Owners for Responsible Ownership. This group was founded by gun owners and relatives of victims of a 2012 mass shooting at a mall near Portland. The killer stole his rifle from a friend, who left the weapon unsecured and containing a full magazine of ammunition.

Our group is trying to do important, mostly apolitical work — handing out free gun locks, training doctors to talk to patients about safe firearm storage, offering basic information about guns to the news media so they can report about the issue more accurately. But we are frequently met with suspicion or disdain by gun owners who think we’re secretly out to disarm them.

We do very little lobbying, though our board endorsed a proposal signed into law in Oregon this year to issue protection orders to keep guns temporarily out of the hands of people who, in a situation like sudden extreme distress, pose a clear threat to themselves or others. Suicides account for 60 percent of the nation’s more than 33,000 firearm deaths a year. Many suicides are impulsive acts, so even minor barriers — akin to putting guardrails on bridges, for example — can save lives.

By the time my boys are hunters, I hope there are more sensible gun laws, such as those that close loopholes on background check requirements, restore funding for research on gun violence and regulate modified semiautomatic guns just as strongly as we do the automatic guns they are altered to mimic. I also hope my sons take a broad view of what it means to be a responsible gun owner. Responsible ownership is about more than safe storage and careful handling of one’s own firearms — it’s also about making sure that as a society we have effective laws to keep guns out of unsafe hands.

And yet, does this calm prove that South Koreans really are as indifferent as we might seem? Has everyone really managed to transcend the fear of war? No, it is not so. Rather, the tension and terror that have accumulated for decades have burrowed deep inside us and show themselves in brief flashes even in humdrum conversation. Especially over the past few months, we have witnessed this tension gradually increasing, on the news day after day, and inside our own nervousness. People began to find out where the nearest air-raid shelter from their home and office is. Ahead of Chuseok, our harvest festival, some people even prepared gifts for their family — not the usual box of fruit, but “survival backpacks,” filled with a flashlight, a radio, medicine, biscuits. In train stations and airports, each time there is a news broadcast related to war, people gather in front of the television, watching the screen with tense faces. That’s how things are with us. We are worried. We are afraid of the direct possibility of North Korea, just over the border, testing a nuclear weapon again and of a radiation leak. We are afraid of a gradually escalating war of words becoming war in reality. Because there are days we still want to see arrive. Because there are loved ones beside us. Because there are 50 million people living in the south part of this peninsula, and the fact that there are 700,000 kindergartners among them is not a mere number to us.

One reason, even in these extreme circumstances, South Koreans are struggling to maintain a careful calm and equilibrium is that we feel more concretely than the rest of the world the existence of North Korea, too. Because we naturally distinguish between dictatorships and those who suffer under them, we try to respond to circumstances holistically, going beyond the dichotomy of good and evil. For whose sake is war waged? This type of longstanding question is staring us straight in the face right now, as a vividly felt actuality.

In researching my novel “Human Acts,” which deals with the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military dictatorship turned to the armed forces to suppress student protests against martial law, I had to widen the field to include documents related not only to Gwangju but also to World War II, the Spanish Civil War, Bosnia and the massacres of Native Americans. Because what I ultimately wanted to focus on was not one particular time and place but the face of universal humanity that is revealed in the history of this world. I wanted to ask what it is that makes human beings harm others so brutally, and how we ought to understand those who never lose hold of their humanity in the face of violence. I wanted to grope toward a bridge spanning the yawning chasm between savagery and dignity. One of the many things I realized during my research is that in all wars and massacres there is a critical point at which human beings perceive certain other human beings as “subhuman” — because they have a different nationality, ethnicity, religion, ideology. This realization, too, came at the same time: The last line of defense by which human beings can remain human is the complete and true perception of another’s suffering, which wins out over all of these biases. And the fact that actual, practical volition and action, which goes beyond simple compassion for the suffering of others, is demanded of us at every moment.

The Korean War was a proxy war enacted on the Korean Peninsula by neighboring great powers. Millions of people were butchered over those three brutal years, and the former national territory was utterly destroyed. Only relatively recently has it come to light that in this tragic process were several instances of the American Army, officially our allies, massacring South Korean citizens. In the most well-known of these, the No Gun Ri Massacre, American soldiers drove hundreds of citizens, mainly women and children, under a stone bridge, then shot at them from both sides for several days, killing most of them. Why did it have to be like this? If they did not perceive the South Korean refugees as “subhuman,” if they had perceived the suffering of others completely and truly, as dignified human beings, would such a thing have been possible?

Now, nearly 70 years on, I am listening as hard as I can each day to what is being said on the news from America, and it sounds perilously familiar. “We have several scenarios.” “We will win.” “If war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, 20,000 South Koreans will be killed every day.” “Don’t worry, war won’t happen in America. Only on the Korean Peninsula.”

To the South Korean government, which speaks only of a solution of dialogue and peace in this situation of sharp confrontation, the president of the United States has said, “They only understand one thing.” It’s an accurate comment. Koreans really do understand only one thing. We understand that any solution that is not peace is meaningless and that “victory” is just an empty slogan, absurd and impossible. People who absolutely do not want another proxy war are living, here and now, on the Korean Peninsula.

When I think about the months to come, I remember the candlelight of last winter. Every Saturday, in cities across South Korea, hundreds of thousands of citizens gathered and sang together in protest against the corrupt government, holding candles in paper cups, shouting that the president should step down. I, too, was in the streets, holding up a flame of my own. At the time, we called it the “candlelight rally” or “candlelight demonstration”; we now call it our “candlelight revolution.”

We only wanted to change society through the quiet and peaceful tool of candlelight, and those who eventually made that into a reality — no, the tens of millions of human beings who have dignity, simply through having been born into this world as lives, weak and unsullied — carry on opening the doors of cafes and teahouses and hospitals and schools every day, going forward together one step at a time for the sake of a future that surges up afresh every moment. Who will speak, to them, of any scenario other than peace?","While the U.S. Talks of War, South Korea Shudders",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/opinion/sunday/south-korea-trump-war.html

In 2001, nearly four decades later, scientists scaled the rock, a third-of-a-mile-high, and discovered a small group of living tree lobsters dining on tea tree at night. It turned out they were not extinct.

But some scientists worried these tree lobsters might actually be a distinct species because they looked mysteriously different from the preserved Lord Howe tree lobsters. Their legs were skinnier with smaller spines and the little stubs sticking out from the abdomen called cerci were slightly off. They were darker. It wasn’t clear if they’d always been on Ball’s Pyramid or if birds, mistaking them for nesting material, carried them there. The two islands were never connected by land, and the insects couldn’t swim.

The researchers collected living specimens to create a new population of tree lobsters that could be reintroduced to the wild if the ones on Ball’s Pyramid ever disappeared. Now thousands of living descendants and eggs from the Ball’s Pyramid couple are held in zoos and museums around the world.

But more recently, Dr. Mikheyev and his colleagues managed to reveal that the genetic differences between Lorde Howe and Ball’s Pyramid insects were within the range of the same species. This meant that they had to make sense of stick bugs’ massive genome — about a quarter bigger than the human genome. They did this by comparing genetic samples from living Ball’s Pyramid tree lobsters with material extracted from Lord Howe specimens preserved in museums. Age, inbreeding, environment or diet might explain their new look.

The finding could make it possible to restore the insects to their former home on Lord Howe island.

But rats remain a problem on the island, where they have killed off five bird species and around a dozen invertebrates, and still threaten 70 other species.

Following years of research and debate, the Lord Howe Island Board decided in September to go ahead with a rat eradication program. Beginning in mid-2018, helicopters will drop cereal laced with rat poison onto the island.

If all goes to plan, threatened or endangered species like ground lizards, snails and the Little Mountain Palm could then recover on this World Heritage site.

The tree lobsters may be able to return, too. Confirming their identity was important because the consequences of introducing a new species mistaken for an old one to Lord Howe Island were unpredictable.

Return candidates must also be chosen. Would they come directly from Ball’s Pyramid, or their captive bred descendants? Ideally, the most genetically diverse tree lobsters have the best shot at recolonization. This means more genetic analysis.

“We are talking about our nation’s unity,” he said.

Mr. Puigdemont is expected to address the regional Parliament on Tuesday, when Catalan leaders could declare independence, citing the results of a referendum that the national government and the courts had said was illegal and ordered suspended.

The rally on Sunday was organized to show that the referendum, which attracted international attention for a police crackdown that left hundreds injured, did not represent all Catalans. They are, in fact, deeply split over independence.

Drivers flying Spanish flags from their windows blasted staccato beeps of their horns in support of people wearing Spanish flags over their shoulders like capes. As helicopters hovered overhead, a river of supporters of Spanish unity snaked from Urquinaona Square down Via Laietana and past the city’s cathedral to its historic train station, where politicians read manifestoes in favor of a united Spain.

Along the way, thousands chanted, “Long Live Spain, Long Live Catalonia,” “I am Spanish, I am Spanish,” and “Puigdemont to Prison.” They waved Spanish, Catalan and European Union flags and wore stickers of all three on their chests.

The rally — estimated by the police at 350,000 people, though organizers said it was twice that — also served as a coming-out party of sorts for the national flag, which for decades has carried a stigma associated with the far-right groups nostalgic for the Franco dictatorship.

“Everyone thinks waving the Spanish flag means we are right wing or fascists,” said Alfredo Matías, 47, who held one edge of an oversize Spanish flag. “But we are not. We are just patriotic. It should be like the flag in America. And this is a big opportunity to make that happen.”

Mr. Rajoy, in his interview, also suggested that the time had come for the flag’s stigma to be lifted.

“People have the right to say, I’m Spanish, I’m proud of it and proud of my Constitution,” he said, adding that everyone in the country had a right to defend “your symbols, your flag, your hymn.”

He said his message to Spaniards was that “they have a government who will defend, as it is its obligation, the national unity and sovereignty.”

Nadia Borrallo, a 31-year-old pharmacist from nearby Sant Boi de Llobregat, said the independence movement had tried to convince the world that all of Catalonia was on its side. “This is the reality,” she said, a Spanish flag draped over her shoulders. “Look around: I see a united people.”

As she approached a Spanish flag carpeting the street in front of a paella restaurant, she said that it looked as if Spain’s soccer team had won the World Cup.

“When Spain wins, they chant, ‘I am Spanish, I am Spanish,’ ” she said. “Now they say, ‘I don’t feel Spanish, I want my independence.’ It’s nonsense.”

As demonstrators jeered at balconies hanging pro-independence flags, organizers and security forces cleared paths for politicians and celebrity supporters of Spanish unity who had lined up at the front of the rally.

“I feel very enthusiastic and optimistic,” said Mario Vargas Llosa, the Nobel Prize-winning author who became a Spanish citizen in the 1990s and has spoken out in favor of conservative Spanish causes.

They followed a flatbed truck loaded with four speakers blasting the voices of organizers who heralded demonstrators as “the silent majority.”

Until now, supporters of independence have been the most vocal, especially after the violence on the day of the referendum gave momentum to their cause. Supports of Spanish unity complained that the regional police force, the Mossos D’Esquadra, appeared to refuse a national order to block the referendum.

Supporters of independence had thrown flowers at their feet, but the demonstrators on Sunday cursed their name. The Catalan police force — the leader of which is facing sedition charges in Madrid — was almost nowhere to be seen along the rally’s route.

Instead, the officers standing outside the National Police Headquarters bathed in the adoration of demonstrators. Officers posed for selfies, received hugs and heartfelt handshakes and smiled broadly as the demonstrators chanted, “You are not alone” and “This is our police.”

“The referendum was illegal, and these police followed their instructions,” said Danile Basteller, 51, from Barcelona. He said the police had been treated shabbily: “We are here to show them they are not alone.”

Jose Luis Rencé, a retired soldier clad in his fatigues, agreed. “The law has to be followed,” he said. “With the law, everything. Without the law, nothing.”

In front of the seat of the regional government, Manuel Perales Álvarez, a 54-year-old garbage collector, shouted at the stone-face Mossos officers standing guard.

“With what authority will you present yourself,” he screamed. “You have no shame.”

Lucas Fernández, 66, from Barcelona, stood next to him, holding a Spanish flag and yelling, “Long live Spain” toward Mr. Puigdemont’s office.

“He clearly is going to receive the message, but he is pretending he is deaf to us,” Mr. Fernández said of the Catalan president. “He doesn’t listen to the people — only to the supporters of independence around him.”

Sergi Miquel, a lawmaker from Mr. Puigdemont’s party, saw little to worry about. “The demonstrations are fine,” he said. “But I don’t think anything changes, because the referendum and the Catalan elections had clear results.”

Photo“My aim was not to concentrate on the war or the ruined buildings,” Ms. Kuleshova said.
But the vast majority of visitors are Russians, and they come to Abkhazia for cheap prices and Soviet nostalgia.
While Abkhazians are happy for the economic boost, Ms. Kuleshova said, they are still waiting for the kind of development that could lead to a sustainable future.
“They want more tourists and they want more opportunities,” Ms. Kuleshova said.","More than 20 years after Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a bloody, year-long proxy war decried by Georgian authorities as illegal and a step towards “de facto annexation,” only four United Nations member states — Nicaragua, Venezuela, Nauru and Russia— recognize Abkhazia, a small territory on the eastern coast of the Black Sea bordering the Caucasus Mountains.

Abkhazia is a time capsule. Many buildings, constructed during its days as a Soviet republic, are pockmarked with bullet holes from the 1992 conflict. The economy is weak and dependent on tourism from Russian visitors. Young people with means attend college outside the territory — and stay there after graduation.

But Abkhazia — which, in the local language, means “land of the soul”— is more than its decay and its disputed political status, said the Russian photographer Ksenia Kuleshova. She began photographing there in 2015 as an undergraduate at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Hanover, Germany, and has returned three times since to work on an ongoing project.

Photo

“My aim was not to concentrate on the war or the ruined buildings,” Ms. Kuleshova said. “I didn’t want to concentrate on the negative side. I wanted to find the soul.”

Ms. Kuleshova grew up hearing about Abkhazia from her parents, who vacationed there before the war and remembered it as “a beautiful country with mountains and tasty vegetables and fruits.” When she arrived in Sukhumi, the territory’s capital, for the first time three years ago, she found its appearance unsettling.

“You come there and you feel it’s another world, that this country slept for a while because they didn’t restore buildings after the war,” she said.

Photo

She overcame her shock and got to work, connecting with locals through a friend of her parents. She was looking, she said, for signs of joy, and she found them in abundance. She attended soccer games and horse races and parades, met folk dancers and socialites and zookeepers, and watched people play in the first big snowfall in Sukhumi in nearly eight years. Once, she went to three weddings in a day.

“I wanted to show something beautiful and I wanted to show that there’s happiness,” she said.

But there was no escaping history. While bullet holes are not the focus of her photos, they sometimes appear in the background. And in her conversations with Abkhazians, talk often turned to the war.

“It was a very cruel war and almost every family lost someone,” she said. “They can’t forget it.”

Photo

There has been some change in Abkhazia’s prospects recently. After years of stagnation, business along the Black Sea coast has picked up. Avtandil Gartskiya, Sukhumi’s tourism minister, told The New York Times in 2016 that 1.5 million foreign visitors were expected that year—up from 92,000 a decade earlier. But the vast majority of visitors are Russians, and they come to Abkhazia for cheap prices and Soviet nostalgia. While Abkhazians are happy for the economic boost, Ms. Kuleshova said, they are still waiting for the kind of development that could lead to a sustainable future.

“They want more tourists and they want more opportunities,” Ms. Kuleshova said. “But the main point is they want to be recognized by the world.”

“I’m not playing Alexis but Fallon has inherited a lot of her gusto,” Ms. Gillies said.","The new show arrives Oct. 11 on the CW, whose youth-centered programming has lately relied, with middling results, on superheroes. It has been not so much created as concocted by Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz — who sold soap to an Axe body wash generation with “Gossip Girl” and “The O.C.” — as a layer cake of nostalgia and novelty to tempt both extremes of the 18-49 demographic so coveted by advertisers.

Photo

“We’re changing up the point of entry,” Mr. Schwartz said. “If you were a fan of the original, it honors the spirit of that. And then those new to the show should be ready for a fun, twisted serial.”

“Downton Abbey” and “Billions” have showed that viewers still enjoy the foibles of the rich. But reboots have become iffy propositions, with originals readily available on Amazon Prime and in DVD box sets. The revival of “Dallas,” on TNT, was canceled after three seasons in 2014, even with the draw of original cast members. “Dynasty” has none thus far (one, Gordon Thomson, called the new show “an abomination” in an interview with The Daily Beast). Some fans, however, have hopefully proposed Heather Locklear, the original Sammy Jo and another “Melrose” veteran, to play Alexis, Cristal’s archrival.

But she was nowhere in evidence here this summer on a cavernous soundstage, which was home to an update of the Carrington mansion, where this reporter spent many happy escapist hours as a pre-teen, learning nothing less than how to be a woman.

“Lip-plumping treatments,” Mr. Show, compactly handsome at 55, was muttering in between takes, rolling the phrase around in his mouth like one of the top-shelf brandies Mr. Forsythe’s Blake Carrington favored. “Lip-plumping treatments.”

Blake had just delivered to his headstrong daughter, Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies), the bad news that their family name had been trademarked by her mother, his ex-wife Alexis, for a cosmetics line.

Photo

The “Dynasty” name was also tarnished by the time Mr. Show met Mr. Spelling, whose Holmby Hills, Calif., mansion seemed a version of Blake Carrington’s, on “Melrose.” He remembered the older man as strict and stingy, using so-called honey wagons to remove sewage rather than install proper plumbing, but also possessing a certain thespian gravitas.

“Aaron used to say, putting his hands up and framing your face in a very square, ‘just your face’ way, ‘My shows are all about character,’” Mr. Show said during a break in taping, sitting at a dining table surrounded by expensive art. “He filmed straight-on, close to camera. You could tell an Aaron show in less than a second.”

The new “Dynasty,” in contrast, has Ms. Savage and Mr Schwartz’s own distinct aesthetic. Scenes are shorter: three or four minutes as opposed to six or seven. Skirts are also shorter. Music is louder. Lighting is dimmer. Slo-mo is occasionally deployed. And knowing references are rife, including to Trumps, Kardashians and Murdochs.

That the White House currently contains a real-estate tycoon— familiar from the ’80s, yet — and his scions makes “Dynasty” seem particularly resonant, though of course tangling bloodlines are a dramatic device as old as the ancient Greeks. “From the Clintons to the Kennedys, this isn’t a new thing, our fascination with these really powerful families,” said Nathalie Kelley, who plays Cristal. “But one thing we’ve talked about which is interesting is patriarchy — how much it has shifted, and how much it’s stayed the same.”

The former Krystle (Linda Evans) had been Blake’s secretary, positioned in perpetual saintly opposition to the devious Alexis and meekly tiptoeing around the Carrington mansion like the nameless heroine of Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca.”

Photo

“In the original Blake is shutting the door in her face because she has to have a meeting and she’s trying to get a word in about the china or something,” Ms. Kelley said. “She’s not really given much to do besides be beautiful and look after the house.”

This Cristal begins in public relations and goes on to contest fiercely with Fallon to become chief operating officer of the Carrington energy company.

She is also young enough to be his daughter, though Ms. Kelley argued that at 33 she is past an age that could provoke eye rolls. “When I first met with Josh and Stephanie, I was like, ‘I think Cristal needs to be at least in her 30s,’” she said. “I don’t think women around the world are going to be happy with this rich billionaire in his 50s dating someone who’s under 30, and that threshold makes a big difference.”

As Mr. Show put it: “People are younger today. The whole show’s younger.”

Indeed if any demographic is neglected in the new version, it is the Modern Maturity set. Ms. Collins was 48 when she first swept into the courtroom when Blake was being tried for the murder of his son Steven’s male lover; Mr. Forsythe was 63. Later additions from the golden age of Hollywood, Diahann Carroll and Rock Hudson, were in their 50s — the latter’s death of AIDS in 1985 provoking a national conversation about whether he’d jeopardized Ms. Evans’s health with their onscreen kiss.

As the cast awaits its Alexis, conflict has been heightened between Cristal and Fallon: a role played first by Pamela Sue Martin, then known for “Nancy Drew” and “The Poseidon Adventure,” and subsequently by the British actress Emma Samms, in one of those switcheroos that soap viewers are supposed to accept unblinkingly but now discuss for years afterward in searchable online forums. (A casting change for Steven was attributed to plastic surgery following an explosive accident on an oil rig, but producers decided simply to ignore Fallon’s change in appearance.)

Photo

As embodied by Ms. Gillies, Fallon has been upgraded from a somewhat lost soul, climbing in and out of beds and winsomely up trees — and later, on a spin-off called “The Colbys,” being abducted by aliens — to an ambitious businesswoman, still sleeping with the chauffeur but now also leaning in with a steely glare.

Ms. Gillies, 24, said she had admired Ms. Collins since seeing her in “The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas” as a child and now regularly retweets the older woman’s Throwback Thursday hashtags to her own 4.6 million followers (thanks mainly to her role on “Victorious”). “I’m not playing Alexis but Fallon has inherited a lot of her gusto,” Ms. Gillies said. “She’s less passive than at least Pamela Sue Martin was — she had a relaxed nature. I wouldn’t say that my Fallon is as relaxed, for better or for worse. I think she’s got a lot more bite.”

She is also entwined enough with Blake that some early viewers have suggested her character resembles Ivanka Trump, and for them Ms. Gillies has developed a one-line rejoinder: “I have better shoes,” she said, striding away in a pair of Christian Louboutin heels.

Neither iteration of “Dynasty” can be separated from its devotion to materialism and the one percent. “I just have memories of how white the rooms were, the carpet — that’s what the rich have,” said Ms. Patrick, the showrunner, who grew up in Atlanta.

But the very rich are not only different from you and me, but from how they used to be. The 2017 Colbys made their money in tech, the Carrington children are concerned about the environment and everyone accepts differences in race and sexual orientation unblinkingly. The once dithering Steven is now “gay and proud,” Ms. Patrick said. “That’s not his issue with his father; it’s that he’s a liberal.”

Mr. Show said he thought “this Blake has a lot more pathology” than his predecessor. Crew members were hammering behind him at the opulent set, with its staircase built for flouncing down O‘Hara-style, and twinkling chandeliers.

“He tells untruths when he doesn’t need to and I don’t know why yet, I’m developing the character,” Mr. Show said. “I’m taking that as seriously as I possibly can, and then it cuts to a catfight.”","A ‘Dynasty’ for Generation ‘Gossip Girl’ (Mom Can Watch, Too)",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/arts/television/dynasty-reboot-cw.html

I don't know how many times they were on base, but (the batters in the) 6, 7, 8 spot, those guys were on base all night, being productive, driving runs in.""

The trio reached base a combined nine times, and Los Angeles turned an early 2-0 deficit into a 7-2 advantage with three rallies, capped by a four-run surge in the fifth.

Barnes, usually the Dodgers' backup catcher, reached base three times and got the night's biggest hit with that fifth-inning double. As for Puig, he has five hits, four RBIs and an uncountable number of tongue-wags, bat-licks and obscure celebratory gestures in just two games.

""It tells you that this team is prepared,"" said Forsythe, who scored three runs in the second playoff game of his career. ""The big thing for us is the guys that aren't in (the lineup every day) are wanting to prove something, and I think that gives them a little added edge. They come out with a chip on their shoulder, and they want to get the job done. They're not scared to do it. They want to do it.""

Greinke is probably the Diamondbacks' best chance to stop the Dodgers from scoring their way out of every problem.

""If you've got to pick one guy to stop this situation we're in, I think we've found the right guy in Zack Greinke,"" Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.

Ray had been outstanding in five regular-season starts against the Dodgers, but he had just two days of rest after pitching in relief during Arizona's wild-card win over Colorado, and the left-hander struggled mightily with his control from the first inning.

Ray walked four of nine batters early on, but the Dodgers didn't get their first hit until Forsythe, Barnes and Puig delivered consecutive singles in the fourth in a go-ahead rally.

""I think with the wild-card game, it kind of threw things out of whack a little bit, but that's the format,"" said reliever Archie Bradley, who struck out Jansen in a rare at-bat for the Dodgers closer. ""You have to win that game to get here. So it's about trying to use this off day the best we can to get healthy. The series is not over.""

Drury kept it close with his no-doubt shot in the seventh on Brandon Morrow's first pitch, but the Dodgers rallied for another run in the bottom half.

Roberts went to Jansen after Daniel Descalso's one-out double off Josh Fields in the eighth, and the vaunted closer reprised his multiple-inning dominance from last October, mowing down five straight batters, getting David Peralta on a groundout to end it.

NO JT NO PROBLEM

Justin Turner drove in five runs in the Dodgers' 9-5 victory in Game 1, which began with a four-run first inning against Arizona's Taijuan Walker. Turner went 1 for 4 in Game 2 and popped out with the bases loaded to end the seventh, but the Dodgers didn't even need their slugging third baseman.

SHORT START

Rich Hill made it through just four innings for the Dodgers, yielding three hits and three walks. The veteran struggled with his control and never found a groove, but stranded runners in scoring position in the second and third innings to keep it close.

AMPLE WORK

Kenta Maeda got the victory by getting three outs of middle relief. The Japanese right-hander didn't make the Division Series rotation, but Roberts plans to use the 13-game winner as a specialist against right-handed batters.

BIG CROWD

With 54,726 fans in attendance, the Dodgers had their largest crowd in Chavez Ravine since 2012, before renovations to the venerable stadium. The crowd also was one of the season's loudest, egged on by Puig's enthusiasm and by Hill, who held up a cardboard sign in the seventh inning exhorting fans to get loud.

UP NEXT

Greinke couldn't make it through four innings in the Diamondbacks' wild-card game, but nobody around the Dodgers doubts the $206.5 million right-hander who won 51 games in three years with Los Angeles. Darvish went 4-3 with a 3.44 ERA in two months with the Dodgers, but the Japanese star yielded just one earned run in 19 1/3 innings over his final three starts before the postseason.

On Wednesday, Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Price, said in an email that Mr. Price supported an internal review of his travel. She said that Mr. Price takes criticism over his travel “very seriously and has taken it to heart.”

“The secretary has initiated an internal departmental review of the procedures and processes that we go through for official travel,” Ms. Oakley wrote.

In recent days, Mr. Price has defended himself by saying he has a busy travel schedule, and on Saturday, Mr. Price told Fox News that he would stop traveling on private jets until a review of his activities was completed.

“We’ve taken many, many trips in cars — sometimes four and five hours at a time,” he told the network.

According to the senior administration official, Mr. Trump is less perturbed by the actions of two other cabinet members who have fallen under recent scrutiny for their spending: Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Mr. Pruitt recently took the unusual step of installing a $25,000 soundproof booth in his office to conduct secure communications, and Mr. Mnuchin inquired about using a military plane for his honeymoon in Europe last month. He also took a government plane on a trip that included a viewing of the solar eclipse on Aug. 21 in Kentucky. That trip fell under scrutiny when Mr. Mnuchin’s wife, Louise Linton, took a stranger to task on Instagram for criticizing the couple’s luxurious lifestyle.

The president has publicly defended Mr. Mnuchin, whose trips came under an official review after the trip to Kentucky. Responding to an ABC News report that Mr. Mnuchin had taken a $25,000 trip to Washington from New York, accompanied by Elaine Chao, the secretary of transportation, the president told reporters to check their facts.

“Why don’t you check your records before you make a statement,” Mr. Trump said to reporters on Sunday. “As I understood it — I don’t know much about it — I haven’t heard about it, but I understand he never took that flight.”

On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into the travel of Mr. Trump’s senior administration members. The investigation, opened by Representatives Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the committee’s chairman, and Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the panel’s ranking Democrat, will examine the use of private and government travel by senior officials, and will request passenger names, destinations and the source of payment for each trip, among other details. The committee is requesting all related documents by Oct. 10.

Ethics experts are critical of the spending activities of Mr. Trump’s cabinet members, many of whom were wealthy before they entered public service. Richard W. Painter, an ethics counsel in the George W. Bush White House and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said that his weekly jaunts to Trump-owned resorts have created a culture of entitlement in the administration.

“Every time they’ve gone to Mar-a-Lago, it’s a couple of million just to haul Air Force One down there,” Mr. Painter said, referring to Mr. Trump’s private club in Florida. “Those other guys say, ‘Gee, I’m important too, I ought to get a private jet. I shouldn’t wait to sit around and have Delta Air Lines kick me around.’”

Matthew Dallek, an associate professor at George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management who studies political history, said that accusations of overspending have plagued nearly every modern presidency: John H. Sununu, the chief of staff for President George Bush, came under fire in 1991 for taking a government limousine to New York from Washington to attend a stamp auction. (He later resigned.) In 1994, David Watkins, the White House director of administration for President Bill Clinton, resigned after taking a $13,129 trip aboard a Marine presidential helicopter to play golf in Maryland.

“The consequences have been swifter” in the past, Mr. Dallek said. “People have lost their jobs for lesser offenses.”

At least two cabinet members have publicly said that they foot the bill for their travel: Betsy DeVos, the billionaire education secretary, uses her own private jet in her travels around the country “at zero cost to U.S. taxpayers,” according to her spokeswoman, Elizabeth Hill.

Linda McMahon, the former chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment and the current administrator of Small Business Administration — and another billionaire in Mr. Trump’s cabinet — covers the cost on private planes “out of her own pocket,” according to her spokeswoman, Carol Wilkerson.",Tom Price’s Spending Habits Catch Trump’s Attention: ‘I’m Not Happy About It’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-price-chartered-air-travel.html

“The president has free speech rights, too,” Mr.","But in weighing in on the Georgia lawsuit and in vowing to voice support in similar cases in coming weeks, Mr. Sessions drew on so-called statements of interest, a technique used aggressively by the Obama administration to push the boundaries of civil rights laws. They are a legal tool, historically reserved for matters of national security and diplomacy, used to interject the federal government in private disputes.

In the Georgia case, an evangelical Christian student sued administrators last year at Georgia Gwinnett College, a public institution, saying they had limited his ability to proselytize.

According to the lawsuit, the student, Chike Uzuegbunam, an undergraduate at the time, had distributed evangelical Christian materials outside the school library. The college’s administration stopped him because he was not within designated free-speech zones and had not obtained a permit.

Mr. Uzuegbunam later reserved a place outside the school’s food court, within a free-speech zone, and began “discussing the brevity of life and how all men and women have fallen short of God’s commands,” according to the lawsuit. After students complained, administrators said Mr. Uzuegbunam’s “open-air speaking” had disturbed the peace, and they restricted it.

Justice Department lawyers argued in the statement of interest that school administrators were unjustified in silencing Mr. Uzuegbunam simply because other students had been “uncomfortable.”

Casey Mattox, a senior lawyer at the Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing Mr. Uzuegbunam, said the Justice Department’s support was heartening.

“It’s a boost for the broader free speech movement that the federal government is taking First Amendment rights very seriously,” said Mr. Mattox, whose organization is also representing a student arrested last year for distributing copies of the Constitution on the campus of Kellogg Community College in Battle Creek, Mich.

Mr. Sessions also mentioned that case in his remarks on Tuesday.

“The American university was once the center of academic freedom — a place of robust debate, a forum for the competition of ideas,” Mr. Sessions said. “But it is transforming into an echo chamber of political correctness and homogeneous thought, a shelter for fragile egos.”

Condemning a violent protest at Middlebury College, in Middlebury, Vt., that this year shut down a speech by the author Charles Murray, Mr. Sessions noted that some of the dissenters had worn masks, “a common tactic also used by the detestable Ku Klux Klan.”

The debate about how to interpret the First Amendment on college campuses has divided university faculties, with some arguing for unrestricted speech, no matter how inflammatory, and others advocating boundaries be established in an age of internet trolling and cyberbullying.

At the University of California, Berkeley, the faculty is divided on the issue. Last week, a Free Speech Week event featuring the conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled.

Mr. Sessions invoked a recent appearance at Berkeley by the conservative writer Ben Shapiro, the former editor at large of Breitbart News, whom he described as a “Harvard trained lawyer who has been frequently targeted by anti-Semites for his Jewish faith, and who vigorously condemns hate speech on both the left and right.”

“To my knowledge,” Mr. Sessions said, “no one fainted, no one was unsafe.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at Berkeley and a First Amendment scholar, said he was pleased about Mr. Sessions’s advocacy for free speech. “I think it’s great that the attorney general of the United States is coming down on the side of free speech — I would hope liberals and conservatives can agree,” he said.

But Mr. Chemerinsky, who has co-written a new book, “Free Speech on Campus,” said he thought Mr. Sessions failed to fully consider the balance of freedom of expression with public safety.

“This university spent $600,000 to facilitate Ben Shapiro coming, and it was estimated if Milo Yiannopoulos came, it would cost $1 million,” he said. “It’s not sustainable for this campus on a weekly basis to facilitate free speech while protecting public safety. Where is that line to be drawn? It’s a really hard question.”

Further stoking the debate about First Amendment rights, Mr. Sessions joined Mr. Trump in criticizing professional athletes who have declined to stand for the national anthem to raise awareness of police brutality and racial injustice.

“The president has free speech rights, too,” Mr. Sessions said in response to a question from the audience. “If they take a provocative act, they have a right to be condemned, and the president has a right to condemn them, and I would condemn their actions.”

Some dissenting students and faculty at Georgetown — where Tiffany Trump, the president’s youngest daughter, is newly enrolled in the law school — called the administration’s message inconsistent.

“There’s hypocrisy here,” said Peter B. Edelman, who teaches constitutional law at Georgetown. “Just as the president has shown a lack of respect for freedom of speech, the attorney general comes to make use of his freedom of speech at our law school.”

Mr. Sessions requested Tuesday’s appearance — the subject and time of which was chosen before Mr. Trump’s remarks about the N.F.L. — according to Randy Barnett, a professor of constitutional law who helped organize the event. Attendance was invitation-only, he said, in order to promote a “civil” tone.

Mr. Sessions urged the students to appreciate their ability to speak out. “As you exercise these rights, realize how precious, how rare and how fragile they are,” he said.

In “most societies throughout history,” he added, “openly criticizing the government or expressing unorthodox opinions could land you in jail, or worse.”","Sessions Calls for ‘Recommitment’ to Free Speech on Campus, Diving Into Debate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/politics/jeff-sessions-campus-free-speech-georgetown.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Whether the strategy will work is another matter. The plan rests on the premise that Mr. Trump has done nothing wrong — something the president has repeatedly told his lawyers and said publicly — and some lawyers connected to the investigation say that Mr. Cobb has been too willing to take the president at his word. If the White House moves too hastily, they argue, materials could end up in Mr. Mueller’s hands that might damage the president and other administration officials.

Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, previously expressed fears that the document production could set a bad precedent for future administrations. Mr. Cobb has told aides that the White House should move deliberately and carefully, but not drag its feet.

Others doubt that Mr. Mueller will publicly clear Mr. Trump anytime soon, even if the documents and interviews do not show that he committed a crime. Mr. Mueller is building cases against two of Mr. Trump’s former advisers, Paul J. Manafort and Michael T. Flynn. Should either man cooperate with investigators, it might change Mr. Mueller’s view of how Mr. Trump fits into the Russia investigation.

Nevertheless, the president’s advisers have concluded that this strategy represents their best chance to lift the cloud hanging over the administration.

“Good for them if they can pull it off,” said Barbara Van Gelder, a prominent Washington white-collar lawyer who served in the Justice Department with Mr. Mueller. She said he was highly unlikely to give the White House any assurances as long as the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn were open.

“Mueller’s not going to make a statement,” she said, “because he’s not going to want to claw it back.”

Mr. Comey had similar concerns. While F.B.I. agents investigated whether Mr. Trump’s associates had any connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Comey privately told Mr. Trump and members of Congress that the president was not personally under investigation. At least twice, however, he refused requests by Mr. Trump to say so publicly. Mr. Comey later told Congress that he did not want to make a public declaration that he might have to amend after further investigation.

One administration official said it was not yet clear how the White House would make its request for Mr. Mueller to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump, and there have been delays in getting documents to the special counsel. The internal White House review of the documents is not yet complete, and Mr. Mueller does not plan to interview many key White House officials until his team has reviewed all the documents he requested.

Mr. Cobb and several White House lawyers have spent weeks reviewing documents related to numerous subjects, including Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey, and his role in July in drafting a misleading statement to The New York Times about Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016.

Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors have indicated that they plan to ask detailed questions about that statement, written aboard Air Force One, which withheld the purpose of the June 2016 meeting: to get damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government’s efforts to help Mr. Trump.

Some of Mr. Trump’s associates remain suspicious of the special counsel and his team of aggressive prosecutors.

“While it would be good to clear the air on this entire issue so that the president can focus on governing, it presupposes that Mueller is an honest broker, and that he would not take nothing and make it into something, which would be my concern,” said Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser.

Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump’s, said the White House should challenge Mr. Mueller if he investigates anything beyond whether Mr. Trump or his associates colluded with the Russian campaign to disrupt the election.

But White House officials say they do not want a repeat of some of the tactics used in the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton battled an independent counsel in court and in the media as the investigation dragged on for years. Since Mr. Cobb joined the White House, Mr. Trump’s team has significantly muted its criticism of Mr. Mueller.

One sign of the White House’s willingness to cooperate is that officials are strongly considering letting Mr. McGahn speak to investigators about his private conversations with Mr. Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Many presidents insist that conversations with their White House counsel be kept secret under the principle of executive privilege, but Mr. McGahn is seen by some as a witness who could be helpful to Mr. Trump.

Mr. McGahn was involved in the discussions about firing Mr. Comey, and officials believe he would say that Mr. Trump was warned that firing Mr. Comey would only prolong the Russia investigation. Lawyers believe that would help make the case that Mr. Trump was not trying to obstruct justice when he fired the F.B.I. director.

Even as the White House pushes for a swift resolution of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, administration officials are bracing for fallout from the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors have signaled that they intend to indict Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, who is under scrutiny for tax and foreign lobbying matters.

But lawyers in the case say they see no evidence yet that Mr. Manafort will face charges of conspiring with Russia to disrupt the election.

The White House also hopes for a favorable report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian election interference and several related matters. The committee’s leaders said this week that they planned to release a public report about their findings.

That report could be finished before Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Although committee leaders said they would leave any criminal matters to the Justice Department, a determination by the committee that none of Mr. Trump’s associates assisted the Russian campaign would be a boon for the White House even if Mr. Mueller refuses to publicly clear Mr. Trump.

“They want them to write a report saying ‘no collusion,’” said Ms. Van Gelder, the defense lawyer. “And then they can let Mueller twist in the wind.”","Hoping to Have Trump Cleared, Legal Team Eases Resistance to Inquiry",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/trump-russia-legal.html

Was Israel’s special relationship with Germany, too, now in danger?

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hastened to say that it was not, announcing Tuesday that he had spoken with Chancellor Angela Merkel. He congratulated her on winning and expressed confidence that Israel and Germany would only deepen their ties.

But Mr. Netanyahu added that Israel was “concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism” on both the political right and left, and noted that “there are two different things: denying the Holocaust and denying responsibility.” He called on Ms. Merkel’s new government to “act to strengthen the forces in Germany that take on the historical responsibility.”

Among the opposition, Amir Peretz, a Knesset member from the left-of-center Zionist Union, wrote on Twitter in German that the election was “a bad day for Germany democracy, with the entry of xenophobes and open anti-Semites into the Bundestag.”

Yet like so much else dividing Israeli society today, the advances by the Alternative for Germany, or the AfD, as it is known, seems to provide more of an excuse for political recriminations and partisan bile than a source of common Jewish ground.

On the right, there was newfound scorn, and worse, for Israeli expatriates in Germany.

Aryeh Eldad, a former Knesset member and medical professor, wrote in Maariv of his revulsion at the “20,000 Israelis who moved from Israel to Germany of their own free will,” whether for “cheaper housing and cheaper cottage cheese” or to live under “the wonderful German democracy” out of a “distorted” leftism. Both groups, he said, were “emotional cripples.”

“These Israelis,” Mr. Eldad wrote, “are not like the dog that comes back to eat his own vomit, but rather like the vomit that returns to the dog that spewed it.”

On the left, there was renewed criticism for the Israeli government that so many left behind when they moved to Germany.

Michael Sappir, a 29-year-old in Tel Aviv who earned a degree in linguistics at the University of Leipzig, in Saxony, and now works in high tech, said the election “makes me think twice about the idea of moving there again, both as a Jew and a leftist.”

But, he added, “the situation in Germany is much, much better than here, where the governing coalition is composed mostly of parties that are intellectually akin to the AfD.” He said, “What’s considered the terrifying right wing there is on many policy points just mainstream here.”

View all New York Times newsletters.

Even after Sunday’s election, Mr. Sappir said, he still believes he would be safer in Germany than in Israel. “The norms of governance, the rule of law, there is much stronger,” he said. “Here I feel like an embattled minority. There I know that we’re a much bigger minority, and there’s at least a pretty broad anti-fascist consensus.”

Eldad Beck, an Israeli journalist and author of a book on German-Jewish relations, said left-wing Israelis in Germany who were surprised by Sunday’s vote were “suffering from blindness.” But he also said that he knew some Israelis in Germany who had voted for the AfD “because they consider the arrival of so many Muslims and the violence, terror and criminality a big problem that has to be stopped.”

Indeed, feelings about the subject do not fall into neat categories, even among left-leaning Israelis.

Mr. Weinberger, the marketing executive in Berlin, said he believed that, aside from anti-Merkel sentiment, what had driven Germans to the AfD was an understandable emotion: “There are strong feelings of fear,” he said. “It’s part of human nature at some point. And some of them I’m sure are really concerned about this open-door policy. It affects their lives.”

Shai Levy, 44, a Jerusalem-born filmmaker in Berlin, said he was saddened to see Israel and the Jewish people fueling the resurgent right wing “because they have a common enemy; being anti-Muslim is considered to be good for the Jews.”

He sees many Israelis newly arrived in Berlin tensing up at the sight of people in Muslim head scarves, a “reflex of phobia for Muslims,” he said, adding: “I know it because I had it. I needed to get rid of it.”

Where Germany goes from here, and how Israel and Israelis will adjust, will depend less on Ms. Merkel than on those who succeed her when she leaves the stage, said Mr. Beck, the author of “Germany, at Odds.”

“As long as Merkel is chancellor, the special relationship is O.K.,” he said. “But Israelis will have to make a special effort, otherwise things are going to fall apart.”

He said that the millions of Muslims who have arrived in Germany in recent years would inevitably influence the country’s politics.

“I’m not so sure the young generations of German politicians feel as connected to Israel and to the past,” he warned. “And I don’t see yet that Israel is really making an effort to convince them why it is doing certain things and why it’s important to do those things.”

Younger Israelis, too, can be frustrating to their elders.

To Miki Goldman, 92, a survivor of Auschwitz and other concentration camps who later helped collect evidence against Adolf Eichmann, diplomacy is one thing, but emigrating to Germany another.

“Undoubtedly Germany of today is a democracy, but it still has a kernel of something else that could become dangerous,” he said. “We can be in good relations with Germany, but why do young Israelis have to forget the fate of their fathers and go back there?”

But some Israelis in Germany insisted they were neither forgetful nor naïve.

Ruthi Grossman, 24, a student who moved to Berlin last year, said she still planned to stay there.

“I think it’s just part of the world moving toward dark times,” she said of the rightward drift. “But I do trust Germany more than I trust any other country in the world to deal with it morally, because of that history.”","Is Germany Still a Haven for Israelis?

The federal government doesn’t collect data on forensic patients’ lengths of stay, crimes or treatment.
review declared James unfit for release, James requested that the court appoint him an independent evaluator and grant him a hearing.
Among the hospital’s 937 forensic patients, there were 1,908 incidents of seclusion and restraint in 2014.","In 1996, when James was 20, the police responded to a frantic 911 call near the house where he lived with his mother. At the scene, the officers found a woman bloodied and in distress. She said that James had lured her inside for a housekeeping interview — and that he’d been screaming when he started ripping her clothes off and beating her. The cops later picked him up at his grandmother’s house, a few miles away. At the police station, James signed a statement saying he understood his rights. He waived the right to representation. He signed a confession. (He and his mother now claim that the confession was coerced and that he is innocent.) When doctors subsequently evaluated him, they found him so unstable that they ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He was remanded to a hospital for several months, then sent back to jail, where he regressed again, then sent back to the hospital for several more months, stabilized once again, then sent back to jail, where in preparation for his trial, he was returned to the hospital to be evaluated for mental illness. Doctors diagnosed borderline-personality disorder, his mother says — which enabled him to plead “not responsible by reason of insanity.”

James says that he understood the plea he took. In the abstract sense, he did. But the specifics of it were as mysterious to him and his family as they are to most people. Before he was arrested, James and his mother were set to move to Georgia, where they had relatives, and where Ann had friends and a job lined up. After his plea deal, Ann says, she “put everything on hold,” for what she thought would be a few years.

Instead, James, now in his 40s, has been in the hospital for almost two decades. This isn’t because he was sentenced to 20 years, or to 25. He was not sentenced at all; he is technically, legally, not responsible. The court believes beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the act he was accused of, a prerequisite for the state to accept an insanity plea. The plea does not, however, prescribe or limit the duration of his stay. The laws that govern the practice of committing people who are acquitted because of mental illness dictate that they be hospitalized until they’re deemed safe to release to the public, no matter how long that takes.

James’s insanity acquittal placed him in an obscure, multibillion-dollar segment of domestic detention. According to a 2017 study conducted by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, more than 10,000 mentally ill Americans who haven’t been convicted of a crime — people who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity or who have been arrested but found incompetent to stand trial — are involuntarily confined to psychiatric hospitals. Even a contributor to the study concedes that no one knows the exact number. While seemingly every conceivable data point in America’s prison system is meticulously compiled, not much is known about the confinement of “forensic” patients, people committed to psychiatric hospitals by the criminal-justice system. No federal agency is charged with monitoring them. No national registry or organization tracks how long they have been incarcerated or why.

In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled, in Foucha v. Louisiana, that a forensic patient must be both mentally ill and dangerous in order to be hospitalized against his will. But in practice, “states have ignored Foucha to a pretty substantial degree,” says W. Lawrence Fitch, a consultant to the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors and former director of forensic services for Maryland’s Mental Hygiene Administration. “People are kept not because their dangerousness is because of mental illness. People stay in too long, and for the wrong reasons.”

Michael Bien, a lawyer who helped bring a successful lawsuit against the California prison system on behalf of prisoners with psychiatric illnesses, concurs. “Under constitutional law, they’re supposed to be incarcerated only if they’re getting treatment, and only if the treatment is likely to restore sanity,” he says. “You can’t just punish someone for having mental illness. But that’s happening.”

In the visiting room in New York that Sunday, as the hours went by, families came and went. Ann settled in. On James’s birthday, she brings a party: relatives, presents, a cake. And almost every week, on every visiting day, she and James try to make a life here together at the hospital — because it now seems possible that he could die there.

The insanity defense has been part of the American judicial system from its founding, carried over from our English forebears. British law has long reflected the moral sense that society has a duty not to punish people who can’t comprehend or control their crimes. But the insanity defense has always sat uneasily with the public, which tends to regard it as a means to escape justice. In the United States, such sentiments reached fever pitch in 1981, when a 25-year-old named John Hinckley Jr., hoping to win Jodie Foster’s heart, tried to assassinate President Reagan, wounding the president and three others, including James Brady, the White House press secretary, who was left permanently disabled. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity (N.G.R.I., as it is frequently abbreviated) and sent to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington. The country was outraged. Dan Quayle, then a senator from Indiana, called the verdict “decadent” and said the insanity defense “pampered criminals.” His Senate colleague Strom Thurmond equated it to a free ride.

In fact, despite its reputation as a “get out of jail free” card, the insanity defense has never been an easy way out — or easy to get. After a defendant is charged, the defendant, her lawyer or a judge can request evaluation by a psychiatrist. A defendant may be found incompetent to stand trial and committed for rehabilitation if she isn’t stable enough or intellectually capable of participating in the proceedings. If she is rehabilitated, she may be tried; if she cannot be, she may languish in a psychiatric hospital for years or decades. But mental illness is not exculpatory in itself: A defendant may be found mentally ill and still competent enough to stand trial. At that point, the district attorney may offer an insanity plea — some 90 percent of N.G.R.I. verdicts are plea deals. If the district attorney doesn’t offer a plea, or the defendant doesn’t take it, the case goes to trial. The defendant may still choose insanity as a defense, but then her case will be decided by a jury.

If N.G.R.I. was always difficult to get, it became even harder after Hinckley. With the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, Congress restricted the judicial definition of “insanity” to only the most severe cases. Some states — Idaho, Utah, Kansas and Montana — have eliminated the defense altogether. In trials in which it is attempted, doctors may disagree, and jurors are often influenced by emotional considerations. Today, only an estimated one-120th of 1 percent of contested felony cases end in a successful N.G.R.I. defense — that is, the prosecutor disputes the insanity defense, the case goes to trial and the jury finds the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity. In addition, the legal standards for “insanity” vary among states; some define it as a defendant’s inability to know the crime was wrong or the inability to act in accordance with the law, but most define it, post-Hinckley, as only the first of these. At the trial of James Holmes, who killed 12 people and injured 70 in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., one psychiatrist testified that he was mentally ill but that he knew right from wrong and should be considered “sane.” Another testified that he was mentally ill and incapable of reason (and, by extension, guilt). All four who examined him agreed that he had some form of schizophrenia. Jurors rejected his insanity plea.

And when an N.G.R.I. defense does succeed, it tends to resemble a conviction more than an acquittal. N.G.R.I. patients can wind up with longer, not shorter, periods of incarceration, as they are pulled into a mental-health system that can be harder to leave than prison. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled, in Jones v. the United States, that it wasn’t a violation of due process to commit N.G.R.I. defendants automatically and indefinitely, for the safety of the public. (Michael Jones, who was a paranoid schizophrenic, had been hospitalized since 1975, after pleading N.G.R.I. to petty larceny for trying to steal a jacket.) In almost all states, N.G.R.I. means automatic commitment to a psychiatric facility. In most states, like New York, there is no limit to the duration of that commitment. In the states that do have limits, like California, the limits are based on the maximum prison sentence for the offense, a model that belies the idea of hospitalization as treatment rather than punishment. As Suzanna Gee, an attorney with Disability Rights California (a protection and advocacy agency with counterparts in every state), points out, the law allows two-year extensions as patients approach a “top date,” the limit set on their confinement. And so, she says, “it can be extended in perpetuity.”

James’s mother, Ann, now knows the predicament of forensic confinement well. At some point during James’s stay at the state hospital, she became an advocate for mentally ill offenders. “It’s like a roach motel,” she says. “At least in prison, inmates know they’re leaving. Once you check into the hospital, it’s hard to check out.”

Though forensic detentions get little attention, they can range from ethically questionable to flagrantly unconstitutional and illegal. In 1983, a national study found that N.G.R.I. patients often lost their freedom for twice as long as those actually convicted of the same offense. A study of N.G.R.I. patients in seven states between 1976 and 1985 found that in four of those states, they were confined for less time than people who were found guilty, and that in three, they were confined for longer. Scant research, conducted decades ago, seems to constitute the most recent survey of the fate of the country’s forensic commitments.

“There’s not been a lot done,” Fitch says. The federal government doesn’t collect data on forensic patients’ lengths of stay, crimes or treatment. In some cases, neither do the state or local departments in charge of their custody. In 2015, I began collecting, via request or the Freedom of Information Act, all individual length-of-stay data by legal status that existed in each state and Washington. Colorado, Wyoming, Arkansas, Missouri, California, Maine, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Ohio and South Carolina said they simply didn’t have that information. Alabama may or may not: In response to repeated queries, it “decided not to release forensic data,” and hospital reports are excluded from its public-records law.

Many of the above states have reported legal status and average lengths of stay. In 2014, Fitch, on behalf of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, estimated, based on states’ self-reported average lengths of stay, that the national average for all N.G.R.I.s was around five to seven years. He says he finds that “horrendous,” given that civil commitments with the same diagnoses as forensic commitments can get out in under 30 days. There is no accepted body of research to suggest that lengthy institutionalization leads to better treatment outcomes. On the contrary, says Marthagem Whitlock, an assistant commissioner in Tennessee’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, “The deeper penetration into the system usually means more complications for the individual.” There are, as Fitch acknowledges, “people who don’t respond to treatment or who refuse treatment.” But, he argues, “it should almost never be necessary to hospitalize people that long.”

According to the state records collected for this article, in 2015, Florida had 24 N.G.R.I. patients who had been hospitalized for longer than 15 years. Texas had 27. Connecticut had 40, and Georgia had 43. New York and Washington had around 60 apiece. That’s six of the 28 states from which such data can be extrapolated, along with the District of Columbia. In those states — which exclude thousands of N.G.R.I. patients — a significant portion of N.G.R.I. patients had been hospitalized more than two years. Nearly 1,000 had been hospitalized for five to 15 years. More than 400 had been in for longer than 15. Of these, more than 100 had been in longer than 25 years and at least 60 for more than 30. And those numbers don’t present the whole picture, either: Many factors, like hospital transfers or conversion to civil commitment, can start the clock over or obscure patients’ histories. In many cases, Gee says, when patients reach out to Disability Rights California to advocate on their behalf, “if they’d not pled N.G.R.I. and just gone to prison, they might have gotten out earlier.”

Which is not to say there aren’t protocols for release. Most states do have a formal review process to judge whether N.G.R.I.s no longer fit commitment criteria: They are no longer mentally ill or are no longer dangerous as a result of their mental illness. Some states review cases on a schedule — every year, say, or in the case of New Hampshire, every five years. In others, patients (or their lawyers) have to request the review. Doctors can recommend patients for discharge at any time. Patients’ lawyers can also file writs of habeas corpus or petitions for restoration of sanity to have their cases heard in court.

At the psychiatric facility where James is a patient, as at every New York state hospital, cases are reviewed every two years or so, in a joint process by the hospital and the Office of Mental Health (O.M.H.) in Albany. In 2002, when the hospital and O.M.H. review declared James unfit for release, James requested that the court appoint him an independent evaluator and grant him a hearing.

That doctor found that he wasn’t dangerous and was ready to be transferred. The judge agreed and ordered it.

But James didn’t leave.

“Even the mechanisms for getting out,” says Pat McConahay, communications director for Disability Rights California, “are not really mechanisms for getting out.”

James’s almost-transfer 15 years ago fell under the jurisdiction of Guy Arcidiacono, now 61, the district attorney in charge of the Suffolk County Forensic Psychiatric Litigation Unit, who has handled 130 N.G.R.I. cases over 25 years. After the judge approved James for transfer, Arcidiacono and the Suffolk County district attorney’s office, joined by the New York State attorney general’s office, which represents the hospital, appealed to have the transfer order overturned. Under another judge, it was.

James’s police files are terrible to read. There was never a trial, but the allegations are disturbing. They include a statement by the woman whom the police responded to near his house saying that James sexually assaulted her, beat her unconscious, then threw her down the basement stairs. She told the police that when she came to, naked, she realized she was locked in. This, you might presume, was the basis for the rape and kidnapping charges that James said put him in the state hospital.

“Well,” Arcidiacono clarified when I contacted him, “there were two cases, actually.”

Two months earlier, James had been arrested based on another woman’s statement, taken at the emergency room, that she was pinned by her throat and raped in an empty field. (In his statement, James said she had agreed to have sex with him in exchange for crack, and that he didn’t actually intend to make good on his promise.) Charges were filed, and James was released to his mother’s custody — Arcidiacono says there’s no record of why, but it could have been because James hadn’t been indicted yet. When James pleaded N.G.R.I. to the subsequent attack, the charges from the first incident were lumped together with the new ones: in total, second-degree kidnapping, second-degree assault, second-degree aggravated sexual abuse, first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree rape and third-degree robbery.

“You can see in his case,” Arcidiacono said, “that they were serious charges.”

Like most district attorneys, Arcidiacono has substantial discretion when an N.G.R.I. patient comes up for review. Any time a hospital wants to release or transfer an N.G.R.I. patient, his office can demand a hearing. In contesting transfer or release, Arcidiacono can compel the patient to be examined by a doctor he selects. Even if that doctor agrees that the patient is ready to leave, the district attorney can still contest the release. Arcidiacono has done this and won. If a patient does win release or transfer (in New York, a forensic patient is almost always transferred to a civil, less secure facility for another unspecified amount of time before release), the district attorney can appeal, as in James’s case. When you’re dealing not with facts but with opinions, Arcidiacono told me, “reasonable people can differ.”

He went on to explain: “There are two considerations here. What is good for the defendant, and also, the safety of the public. And that’s the difficult part of these cases, balancing those two interests.”

All this adds up to a difficult path to freedom for some N.G.R.I.s. In most states, as in New York, the courts have final review over forensic releases and transfers, and judges have the prerogative to side with the prosecution regardless of what doctors advise. Cas Shearin, director of investigations and monitoring at Disability Rights North Carolina, recalls a 1988 case in which, during an alcohol-related psychotic break, a man shot four strangers he thought were demons. “Year after year after year, his treating doctors went to the judge and said, ‘He’s ready to be released.’ ” The hospital where he was committed gave him increasing leave privileges, including reporting to a full-time job and visiting a girlfriend with whom he had children. After 21 years of incarceration and seven psychologists and psychiatrists testifying that he was no longer mentally ill and posed no threat to the public, he was released — though the judge still ordered that he submit to random drug tests for a year.

Politics, says Joel Dvoskin, a former New York State Office of Mental Health forensic director, can determine if “you’re going to stay locked up for a really long time, regardless of whether it’s safe to let you go.” Elected judges, fearing bad publicity, may be loath to release an offender into the community. As Ira Burnim, legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, a national advocacy organization based in Washington, explains the situation: “You have a mechanism to confine, for the protection of the public, these individuals when they’re mentally ill and dangerous, and the further you stray from that, the less it’s legally justified.”

John Hinckley Jr. became a famous example. Last September, Hinckley was released from St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, 35 years after being found not guilty. It had been two decades since his doctors declared his mental illnesses in full remission, which should have provided the basis for his release. “That anyone can justify keeping him in the hospital” for so long, Fitch says, “is just nuts.”

The question, according to Dvoskin, “becomes one of risk tolerance. America has become — to an extreme level that’s almost impossible to exaggerate — a risk-intolerant society.” Fears of people with mental illness persist, even though, according to the best estimates, only 4 percent of violent acts in the United States are uniquely attributable to serious mental illness. One study has found that those with mental illness are actually less likely to be seriously violent than the general population. (In addition, some N.G.R.I.s have been acquitted of nonviolent crimes, like public-order offenses, traffic offenses and prostitution.) Even if a mentally ill person has committed a crime, says Chris Slobogin, director of the criminal-justice program at Vanderbilt University Law School, “it doesn’t mean they’re going to do it again,” especially because their encounter with the forensic psychiatric system means they’ve received treatment. “This is a group of people that are incredibly stigmatized and misunderstood in terms of how dangerous they are.”

Recidivism for N.G.R.I.s is relatively low. Whereas, nationally, recidivism for released prisoners is above 60 percent, “people who are found N.G.R.I. tend to go back out into the community, and they tend to do really, really well,” Fitch says. The arrest rate for people in Maryland on conditional release, a kind of mental-health parole from the hospital, is less than half the arrest rate of the general population in the state. “If you provide treatment of illness and provide the supports they need, then they don’t reoffend,” Fitch says. As a 2016 study of N.G.R.I. recidivism in Connecticut — which has a post-release supervision program, too — also concluded: “The vast majority of individuals are not rearrested.”

It is not sober data analysis, however, that sticks in the public’s mind — or influences judges’ rulings. Hearing that a man in Nebraska whose most recent diagnosis was “cannabis abuse, unspecified” had been in the hospital for 37 years may evoke less sympathy or outrage when you learn that he killed six people, three of them children. Two of his victims he raped. One of them was dead when he did it. The other one, who was alive for the assault, was 10.

“It’s not an easy population to represent,” Bien says. “No one likes these people.”

On Nov. 21, 2011, after months of having delusions about aliens, conspiracies and poison, Houston Herczog, then 21, partly decapitated his father, Mark. Six days earlier, Mark Herczog had written a letter to God (“God — Help!”) asking him to save his newly unrecognizable son. After Houston was arrested in the bloodied family kitchen, he told the police: “The look in his eyes! I had to!”

I heard about the murder from my mother. Houston is my distant cousin, though I had never met him or his immediate family. During his trial, as psychiatrists testified about a psychotic break related to an onset of schizophrenia, his family — my family — prayed that he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent somewhere for treatment. Charged with first-degree murder, Houston was facing 25 years to life. When he was found N.G.R.I. and sent to nearby Napa State Hospital, it was a relief.

It wasn’t until he was inside that any of us realized, from the mounting anxiety in his phone calls, the rules and restrictions that governed the possibility of his getting out.

Houston has now been in the hospital for four years. In 2015, I visited him there for the first time. After passing through a prison fence and four locked doors, I sat with him in an all-beige room. Schizoaffective disorder is the current diagnosis, and he is stable on medication, though he has periods of deep hopelessness. He struggles with what he has done; at the beginning of his incarceration, when, pharmacologically stabilized for the first time, he was suddenly lucid, he couldn’t do anything but lie in bed and cry. But he also struggles with the uncertainty of how long his confinement will last. Had he been convicted and received the minimum sentence, he would be out before his 50th birthday. His “top date,” according to his hospital paperwork, is Dec. 31, 2600 — 587 years after he was admitted.

Houston doesn’t dispute that he did what he did, but he does dispute the basis for his continued detention. “What are they rehabilitating?” he asked me that day, shaking his legs up and down when the caffeine from a Mountain Dew Code Red kicked in, his blue eyes wide behind wire glasses. He held his hand up, ticking the points off on his fingers. “Not a pattern of violent behavior, since I have no record of violent behavior before my crime. Is it my insanity? Because the treatment for my disease is medication, and I’m medicated and stable now.” And he is — high-functioning as you please. Before we began talking about his incarceration, he kept trying to engage me in a debate about feminist theory.

When he calls, Houston sometimes apologizes for not having much to say about his life — what would he have to say? — in limbo as it is. He would love to have a girlfriend, his first, but it seems unlikely to happen at the hospital. (“You know, I came here for the women,” he joked once.) He spends a portion of his unnumbered, many-numbered days arguing with staff about how many packets of sweetener he’s allowed to use at a time. (Patients are restricted to two at lunch; he likes his tea quite sweet.) His schedule consists of shuffling from group activity to group activity in a beige uniform, between feedings of institutional food three times a day, mind-numbing TV in the background, no internet or cellphones.

Houston’s plan is to wait until he has been hospitalized for at least five years before he bothers to file any writs or petitions for release. That number has nothing to do with what he thinks of his mental state but with comments his first social worker at Napa made: that because of what he did, he can’t possibly be let go for a long time. (When reached for comment about whether this was a plausible conversation, a spokesman for the hospital said, “A patient with a determinate sentence length of life for a high-profile crime might end up staying in the hospital for many years. It is reasonable and therapeutic for a treatment team to discuss these realities with patients.”)

Houston’s sister Savannah says that she gets it — the urge to confine forever someone who did something horrific. Savannah was home the night her brother killed their father. Only 17 at the time, she “had to walk past them to get the phone” to call 911. When she ran to her room to dial, Houston followed her, still holding a knife, but stopped when she shut the door on him. “Part of me thinks he should still have to pay in some way, whether he was in his right mind or not,” she says. “It’s hard though, too, because it is ‘not guilty.’ I have to remind myself of that a lot. I think that’s because I was there. I saw it happen.” But, she went on, “it’s my brother, and obviously I don’t want him to spend his whole life there, because even seeing what he has to eat makes me want to cry. Being there just deteriorates him more and breaks his spirit. He realizes what he did and where he is, and he’s depressed.”

Not everyone in the family is so sympathetic, says Houston’s half sister, Cameron McDowell, 43. “We have some family members who just hate him and will never forgive him. It was just such an awful thing. And I wish Dad were here every day. I can’t even imagine what he went through that night — oh, God, it was so awful.” But, she says, “he’s gone. And we have Houston now. We have to support him. This is going to sound strange, but I’ve not once been mad at him. I really, truly, passionately believe that it’s not the person that commits the crime. It’s the illness.”

At the same time, she understands why people are afraid. Cameron’s own husband isn’t yet comfortable with the idea of Houston’s hanging around their two young kids; though he loves Houston, he’s “a little bit freaked.” “I hope my husband will change his mind when Houston gets out,” she says. She, too, worries about what will happen after his release, though for entirely different reasons. “Is he going to be so institutionalized that he won’t know how to live? That’s what breaks my heart for him.”

Like Houston’s sisters, the judicial and medical systems struggle to find a balance between the blamelessness of N.G.R.I. patients and the gravity of many of their crimes. The rights of the patient are always weighed against the public good, a standard that may include a more or less explicit desire for retribution. Those who provide treatment for forensic patients, says Michael Norko, professor of psychiatry at Yale and director of forensic services for the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, “still have to answer to a court, or to the board, or to the court of public opinion. Every facility has people in it who have so violated a community, a community that is so angry, so hurt, that they’re basically pariahs.” He recalls one patient who shot a police officer; at hearings for his release, a crowd of uniformed cops repeatedly showed up and stood silently, facing the review panel. The question of a patient’s hospitalization can be “reduced to people’s grief, people’s anger, people’s fear — and the complexity of the patient’s rights and their recovery, all of those complexities get overshadowed very quickly.” When I asked Norko what happened to the patient who shot the officer, he said, “Well — well, eventually, he died.”

Because diagnoses and treatment assessments cannot predict future behavior, the standards for involuntary confinement — degree of mental illness and dangerousness — are necessarily subjective. Emotions and prejudice easily come into play, even from experts. A 2003 study in The American Journal of Forensic Psychology, for example, showed that doctors are more likely to find minorities incompetent to stand trial and more likely to diagnose psychotic disorders in African-Americans. At Napa, I spoke with a patient, a friend of Houston’s, who pleaded N.G.R.I. to a murder charge and had been hospitalized for nearly 20 years. When he was granted a hearing in which, according to court transcripts, multiple clinicians recommended his release, one doctor dissented — a doctor with whom he had had an ugly dispute and who, another doctor testified, wasn’t objective. The patient’s release was denied.

Stephen Seager, a 67-year-old psychiatrist who was at Napa for five years, writes openly about his own reactions to his patients in his 2014 memoir, “Behind the Gates of Gomorrah: A Year With the Criminally Insane.” He describes being in the hallway with a group of them heading to lunch as being “engulfed in a wave of hungry psychopaths.” When one of his patients tells him a story about his childhood, he writes, “I didn’t like thinking that some of the men even had childhoods.” Asked in court about a patient’s diagnosis, he gave the admitting diagnosis — bipolar disorder, manic with psychotic features — though he writes that he knew he wasn’t currently mentally ill. But he did think he was dangerous. When I asked him about this, he said: “The point is they’re supposed to be dangerous because they’re mentally ill, but if they get better and they’re still dangerous, what do you do?” He is well aware of the import of expert testimony in retention decisions. “Most of the time,” he said, “judges take our opinion on it.

“I look for the safety of the community,” he went on. “I live here. Sometimes you just have to say something for everybody’s best interest, regardless of whether they’re mentally ill or not.”

Of patients who “just never quite get better,” in doctors’ estimations, Seager said: “Oh, they’ll be here till they die.”

Napa State hospital’s vast, drought-dry campus is roamed by a pack of screeching peacocks. At 1,255 beds, it is one of the largest state psychiatric hospitals in the country. For most of his time there, Houston has been on what’s called a discharge unit, with one to three roommates, where it’s possible to get privileges like walking to the visitors’ center alone. After a bout of suicidal thoughts, he was moved, indefinitely, to a locked unit where all activities and access to the courtyard are supervised.

Houston’s treatment consists of up to 20 hours of group classes a week. His schedule at one point included Emotional Management, Substance Recovery, Current Issues in Mental Health, Self-Esteem, Fitness/Easy Exercise, Leisure Skills/Computer, Fitness/Weight Lifting, Discharge Planning, Wellness Recovery Action Plan, Coping Skills/Fitness, Leisure Skills/Journal and Conditional Release Prep. He says they watch a lot of videos. I once talked to a fellow patient of Houston’s on the phone who said he was heading to a class where the day’s lesson was learning to make cheesecake.

“Cheesecake!” he said. “Imagine that.”

State forensic hospitals vary widely in size — anywhere from just one ward to 1,500 beds — and they also vary in the activities and treatments they offer. Public psychiatric hospitals across the country may be accredited by an independent nonprofit called the Joint Commission. But it doesn’t require, for a start, the use of evidence-based therapies. One-on-one psychotherapy can be hard to get. (Houston began receiving such therapy only after his mother spent two years asking for it, his family says. Napa declined to comment, citing privacy laws.) State mental-health agencies may not be required to report what kind of care hospitals are giving, unless something goes so wrong that it attracts the attention of federal authorities. (Many do, however, voluntarily participate in national data-collection systems.)

The American archetype of bad mental-health practices is the movie “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”: doped-up patients locked away from society to suffer and, ultimately, to perish. Some advocates argue that the conditions at psychiatric institutions aren’t always much better. Until recently, Oregon State Hospital, where “Cuckoo’s Nest” was filmed, may in ways have been worse.

In 2006, The Oregonian won a Pulitzer Prize for its exposé of the institution. It reported that there was a male staff member who worked on one ward for only a year in the late ’80s but still managed to sexually abuse six female patients; there was a wrongful-death suit in 2003; a rape lawsuit in 1995 that accused the hospital of what The Oregonian described as a “longstanding pattern of sex abuse,” some of it by a staff member who, the paper reported, had nearly been fired the year before, “after he and several other staff asphyxiated a patient while restraining him for refusing to take off his shoe.”

The problems weren’t unique to Oregon: Nebraska state psychiatric hospitals settled two major lawsuits, one in 1996 and another in 2006, which claimed that staff members and patients raped and sexually assaulted female patients; two lawsuits have been brought against Massachusetts in the last 10 years by families of forensic patients who were subjected to illegal restraining methods, one whose condition declined and another who died. Napa had more than 4,000 reported patient-on-patient or patient-on-staff assaults in 2014; in 2010, a staff member was killed.

Today Oregon State Hospital still has the towering 1883 brick face of the “Cuckoo” era, but inside, it’s all sparkling new facilities, yoga props and a physical-therapy pool — thanks, in part, to a state senator, Peter Courtney. On a 2004 tour of the hospital, Courtney was astonished to learn of 3,600 badly corroded cans of cremains in an outbuilding, still unclaimed. Around the same time, after the death of yet another patient, the Justice Department became involved. Oregon State is now the first state psychiatric hospital in the nation to use “collaborative problem solving,” instead of, say, automatic “seclusion and restraint” of patients who start to become difficult. Courtney pushed funding for the reforms through Oregon’s State Legislature and brought in a new superintendent, Greg Roberts.

“Very often when you find serious problems, the problem is one of three things: leadership, leadership or leadership,” Roberts says. (A notable problem of leadership was found at Napa: The man who was its executive director between 2007 and 2010, Claude Edward Foulk, is now serving 248 years in prison for sexually molesting children.) Before Roberts came to Oregon, he was the person New Jersey sent to take over “problematic” hospitals that had “a serious negative incident or series of negative incidents.” He revamped three there, one of them twice.

More than 10 years into its transformation, Oregon State has come a long way. But, Roberts acknowledges, it still has a long way to go. Among the hospital’s 937 forensic patients, there were 1,908 incidents of seclusion and restraint in 2014. And while Roberts’s reforms included securing timely releases for patients — between 2012 and 2015, the hospital discharged 90 percent of its “guilty except insanity” (Oregon’s N.G.R.I.) patients with “top dates” early — it still has several patients who’ve been in for more than 15 years, who it acknowledges long ago ceased to be dangerous. Staff recently discharged one patient who had been in for more than 30.

Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of other places for forensic patients to go. When the push to deinstitutionalize psychiatric patients began in the 1970s, many inpatient facilities were shut down or downsized in favor of community integration and outpatient services, which never adequately materialized because of a lack of funding. But institutions have remained the preferred repository for forensic patients, who fill an increasing share of the remaining 42,000 state psychiatric hospital beds. In Pennsylvania, the proportion of forensic patients increased by 379 percent between 1988 and 2008. In California, some 90 percent of approximately 7,000 state-hospital patients are now forensic. Nationwide, nearly one-third of “consumers” in state hospitals in 2007 were forensic, and that number is “rapidly expanding,” according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa). In the last 10 years, forensic patients’ costs jumped to $4.25 billion from $2.5 billion; forensic patients now account for 43.9 percent of total state psychiatric hospital expenditures. This means less room for others who might be seeking psychiatric care, while at the same time, states have cut billions from mental health, leaving even scantier outpatient systems. In Hawaii, as a 2015 Samhsa report notes, “There is no voluntary admission to the [state psychiatric] facility because of the volume of admissions from the court system.” The same lack of services that contributes to people’s reaching a mental-health crisis that ends in arrest also keeps people institutionalized longer afterward.

Whitlock, of Tennessee’s mental-health department, says that there are N.G.R.I. patients whom her state’s hospitals are trying to discharge but for whom they “just can’t find a provider.” Under her lead, Tennessee, more than any other state, has been trying not to commit forensic patients to begin with. Since 1974, it has done its pretrial competency evaluations on an outpatient basis, no insignificant matter given that elsewhere these can take six months or longer. In 2009, the state also started doing post-N.G.R.I. evaluations to see if N.G.R.I.s even needed hospitalization, also on an outpatient basis. “We did not think there was a need to spend 60 or 90 days in the hospital to determine if N.G.R.I.s fit the involuntary-commitment standard,” Whitlock says. “Once you get someone into the hospital, it’s hard to get the court to take them back out. We could probably determine it in a day.” Now only 55 percent of Tennessee’s N.G.R.I.s are committed. Their typical length of stay ranges between seven months and 4.5 years, and they get out, on average, in about two. The state’s new initiative adds to the body of evidence that less hospitalization doesn’t lead to higher crime rates. Since Tennessee stopped automatically committing N.G.R.I.s, says Jeff Feix, the state’s director of forensic services, “the recidivism rate we have is no different than it was before.”

Despite the clinical benefits and cost savings — in 2015, according to a Samhsa report, the average annual cost of one forensic patient, nationwide, was $341,614 — Tennessee’s model is still unusual. There is no outcry, from the public or politicians, for alternatives to indefinitely institutionalizing N.G.R.I.s. After 45 years of studying the issue and filing lawsuits on behalf of patients, Michael Perlin, an emeritus professor at New York Law School and an expert on mental-disability law, thinks he knows why: “Everybody except for people who take the Constitution seriously and people who are in the hospital are happy the patients are there. Prosecutors, police, they’re glad they’re not going anywhere. I believe that the disability rights community has never gotten substantially involved in the issue because some of the people have been charged with very horrific crimes.”

As he put it: “This is an area that everybody kind of wishes would go away.”

Nearly two decades into James’s confinement, it remains unclear if he will ever be considered fit for release. He says that currently his entire medication regimen consists of “fish oil twice a day, calcium, vitamin D and two Kool-Aids and prune juice and Metamucil.” In the 2004 appellate court overturning of his transfer, the hospital doctor testifying in favor of his continued retention pointed out that there was no medication for his diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder — just therapy, to which he was resistant. The hospital forensic committee said that they believed James was insufficiently willing to take responsibility for his actions. One of his doctors called him “sexually preoccupied”; the appellate court concluded that “the disorder will continue to cause him to be dangerous at least until such time as he decides he wants to change and begins working seriously with his treatment providers.”

The court-appointed psychiatrist at the hearing two years earlier, when James was ordered for transfer, said quite the opposite. In his opinion, James “acknowledged the wrongfulness of his actions, and although he does not show much remorse or regret for his actions as a result of limited insight, he certainly realizes that what he did was wrong and against the law.” He said that James “has benefited from [the state psychiatric facility] as much as he will benefit, and at this point he could be transferred to a civil hospital, where he will continue to benefit from the structured environment and continue to receive individual treatment, hoping that he will eventually gain further insight.” But in its appeal at that time, as in every review since, the hospital successfully petitioned to retain him.

How much James’s perceived dangerousness is due to his illness and how much to his extended hospitalization can be difficult to untangle. During a phone call last year, he confessed that lately he’d been “going through a lot of crap.” He was referring to recent fights on the ward. The 2004 appeal notes that he was assaulted twice in 2002 and “got into an altercation with another patient” that year; all of the incidents read as demerits against him. Such disputes are not uncommon for patients with personality disorders, says Norko, the Yale professor and clinician. A hospital is generally “not a good place for them,” he says. “Clinically you try very hard not to hospitalize people who have personality disorders. They can’t quite seem to ever get it right. To them it looks like: ‘The staff want me to do this, they want me to do that, they keep changing the rules,’ and they don’t understand the rules, and they get into arguments, they get into fights. It’s all part of their personality disorder, which in itself isn’t necessarily all that dangerous, but it’s kind of hard to move somebody along when their record is dotted with all of these altercations.”

Perhaps the most cleareyed view of the compromises inherent in N.G.R.I. commitments comes from Paul Appelbaum, professor and director of the division of law, ethics and psychiatry at Columbia University. Appelbaum acknowledges that some N.G.R.I.s are “unnecessarily detained for a longer period than what seems to be warranted by their mental disorder and its impact on their likelihood of being violent in the future.” But, he says, such exaggerated concerns about public safety may be necessary to the survival of the insanity defense. “There are injustices that are imposed on individuals,” Appelbaum says. “But I also see at a 30,000-foot level why the system works that way, and recognize perhaps the paradox that if it didn’t work that way, we might lose the insanity defense altogether, or at the very least have an even more restrictive system that we have to deal with.”

For many, Appelbaum says, an N.G.R.I. verdict is still superior to a conviction. “It exempts them from a formal finding of guilt, which can be important later in their lives. It enables them to serve their time of confinement in what is generally a much better and safer environment than an overcrowded state prison.” While one way to look at indefinite confinement is as an unbearable uncertainty, another is that it offers hope: “Compared to a life without the possibility of parole, you know, maybe that’s better.”

Yet for the insanity defense to live up to the moral imperative it was designed to embody — exculpating those with diminished responsibility for their acts — better mechanisms for evaluating release will need to be adopted, Slobogin says. In an attempt, in part, to protect N.G.R.I.s’ constitutional rights to be released when they don’t fit commitment criteria, the American Bar Association recently revised its criminal-justice mental-health standards, which were adopted in 1986. The association recommended that forensic patients be detained only if there is clear and convincing evidence — a standard that, if it had to be quantified, means about 75 percent certainty — that they’re mentally ill and dangerous; the current legal burden of proof in most jurisdictions is a “preponderance of the evidence,” or 51 percent certainty.

“It’s immoral to deprive someone of liberty because you’re mad at them for being found N.G.R.I.,” says Slobogin, who was on the task force. “Under our new standards, after a year you have to have very strong proof of dangerousness, or you can’t detain them.” But the standards are just recommendations, and some states didn’t even follow the ones from the ’80s. Slobogin concedes that in many jurisdictions, they may have no impact at all.",When ‘Not Guilty’ Is a Life Sentence,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/when-not-guilty-is-a-life-sentence.html

“I was scared,” he said. “I never saw anything like that in my life.”

His prospects are grim. His pregnant wife had fled to Dibis a week before him, but it was unlikely he would see her or their expected child, their first, anytime soon. His elder brother was killed in combat. His father and little brother, one too old to pledge to the Islamic State and the other too young, had disappeared.

The interrogator, Lt. Pisthiwan Salahi, said Mr. Mohemin was not only an Islamic State soldier but also a member of an elite suicide squad known as the Seekers of Martyrdom, according to informers. If convicted of that affiliation by an Asayish court, his sentence would be long; if he was connected to any killings, possibly lifelong.

Mr. Mohemin’s narrative differed. “I was just a common soldier,” he said. “I never killed a civilian. I wasn’t even on the front line.” The lieutenant scoffed at him. “Well, twice I was on the front line, just for a day, but not against the Kurds,” Mr. Mohemin said. More scoffing. “Well once against the Kurds, but only shooting from a distance. I couldn’t see anyone.”

Kurdish officials have been perplexed by the number of fighters who have surrendered. Many of the militants said they were ordered by their leaders to turn themselves in to the Kurds, who were known to take prisoners instead of killing them. But Capt. Ali Muhammed Syan, chief of the Asayish interrogators in Dibis, said even the fighters did not seem to know why their leaders were telling them to quit. “Maybe it’s some deal,” he said. “Maybe it’s just bad morale, I don’t know.”","ISIS Fighters, Having Pledged to Fight or Die, Surrender en Masse",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/world/middleeast/isis-iraq-surrender.html

Don’t worry, be happy — it might make your flu shot more effective.

A new study suggests that older people who are in a good mood when they get the shot have a better immune response.

British researchers followed 138 people ages 65 to 85 who got the 2014-15 vaccine. Using well-validated tests in the weeks before and after their shots, the scientists recorded mood, stress, negative thoughts, sleep patterns, diet and other measures of psychological and physical health. They assessed their antibody response to the vaccine with blood tests at four and 16 weeks after their injections. The study is in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.

Greater levels of positive mood were associated with higher blood levels of antibodies to H1N1, a potentially dangerous flu strain, at both four and 16 weeks post-vaccination. No other factors measured were associated with improved immune response.

The authors acknowledge they were not able to control for all possible variables, and that their observational study does not prove cause and effect.

The senior author, Kavita Vedhara, professor of health psychology at the University of Nottingham, said that many things could affect vaccine effectiveness, but most are not under a person’s control — age, coexisting illness or vaccine history, for example.

“It’s not there aren’t other influences,” she said, “but it looks like how you’re feeling on the day you’re vaccinated may be among the more important.”",An Upbeat Mood May Boost Your Flu Shot’s Effectiveness,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/well/live/an-upbeat-mood-may-boost-your-flu-shots-effectiveness.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Disney had experimented with building a streaming platform on its own, to mixed results. It also toyed with the idea of buying Twitter.

But Mr. Iger was impressed with BamTech. Based in Manhattan’s Chelsea Market, a former factory for the National Biscuit Company, the 850-employee company has a strong track record — no serious glitches, even when delivering tens of millions of live streams at a time. BamTech also has impressive advertising technology (inserting ads in video based on viewer location) and a strong reputation for attracting and keeping viewers, not to mention billing them.

“BamTech really is as good as it gets,” said Mike Vorhaus, president of Magid Advisors, a media and technology consultant.

BamTech grew out of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, or Bam for short, which was founded in 2000 as a way to help teams create websites. By 2002, Bam was experimenting with streaming video as a way for out-of-town fans to watch games.

Soon, Bam developed technology that attracted outside clients, including the WWE, Fox Sports, PlayStation Vue and Hulu. HBO went to Bam in 2014 after failing to create a reliable stand-alone streaming service on its own. Could Bam get HBO up and running — in just a few months?

Bam built HBO Now for roughly $50 million, delivering it just in time for the Season 5 premiere of “Game of Thrones,” which went off flawlessly. “They were nothing short of herculean for us,” said Richard Plepler, HBO’s chief executive.

In 2015, Bam decided to spin off its streaming division, calling it BamTech. With an eye toward its own direct-to-consumer future, particularly with ESPN, Disney paid $1 billion in 2016 for a 33 percent stake and an option to buy a controlling interest in 2020. To run the stand-alone company, M.L.B. and Disney recruited Michael Paull, 46, from Amazon, where he oversaw the introduction of Prime Video.

Disney started talking about the inevitable shift toward streaming in 2006, according to Kevin Mayer, Disney’s chief strategy officer. But the world’s largest entertainment company had to be careful: It could not embrace a new business model at the expense of its still highly profitable existing one — at least not until it saw a tipping point.

So Disney, along with other television companies, first tried something called TV Everywhere. Introduced in 2010, it allowed people to watch television shows on mobile devices as long as they “authenticated” themselves as current cable or satellite subscribers. But that cable bundle-saving effort proved cumbersome and never completely caught on.

About three years ago, Disney started to look at streaming more aggressively. Disney experimented with going it alone, quietly developing an app called DisneyLife. Introduced in November 2015 in Britain, DisneyLife offered old Disney movies and television series, children’s e-books, games and music. Subscriptions cost about $13 a month.

The lesson from that was without new movies, or at least exclusive content, interest was limited. Disney soon cut the subscription price in half. After two years, analysts estimate that DisneyLife has only about 437,000 subscribers. (It was never introduced outside Britain.)

Disney also weighed a bid for Twitter. “We thought Twitter had global reach, a pretty interesting user interface and a compelling way that we might be able to present and sell the content that our company makes to the consumer,” Mr. Iger said at a Vanity Fair conference last Tuesday. Ultimately, though, Disney passed. Twitter’s growing reputation as a platform where hate speech can be disseminated would have posed a problem for the Disney brand.

So when Mr. Iger decided in June that the time had come to reposition Disney’s television division for growth by offering its sports, movies and television programming directly to consumers, he asked BamTech to accelerate Disney’s option to take a controlling interest. By early August, Disney had agreed to spend an additional $1.58 billion to bring its BamTech stake to 75 percent.

Most analysts cheered Disney’s streaming plans, but some investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach. One reason is cost.

Start-up expenses are unknown, but Disney has signaled that they will be huge. (Analysts estimate that marketing alone could easily run $150 million annually.) Disney has also not announced how much it will charge for subscriptions to the still-unnamed services. (Analysts are guessing $5 to $9 a month.) What is certain: To stock its own offerings, Disney plans to pull content from other services — Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm movies will eventually disappear from Netflix — eliminating an enormous, reliable revenue stream.

Michael Nathanson, a media analyst, estimates that Netflix, for instance, pays Disney $325 million annually to license those films. Also moving to one of the services will be reruns of Disney Channel shows, which generate roughly $500 million annually in third-party licensing fees, according to Doug Mitchelson, an analyst at UBS.

At the same time, Disney has pledged to make original movies and series for its nonsports service, easily adding $150 million in costs.

There has also been some sniping about how much Disney paid for BamTech. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference last month, Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, boasted that his company’s All Access and Showtime streaming services had been built internally.

“We didn’t go buy BamTech for a zillion dollars,” he said.

Disney contends that a big part of BamTech’s value has been overlooked. Down the road, as other media companies move toward streaming, BamTech intends to sign them up as clients.

“That’s going to be a massive business, and BamTech is going to be a massive winner in it,” Mr. Mayer, Disney’s chief strategist, said in an interview.

Still, by the end of next year, BamTech will lose one important customer: HBO, which is moving to a global platform built by its own tech team. “They understood from the very beginning that eventually we would grow our way to independence,” Mr. Plepler said.

For some, Disney’s track record with digital acquisitions is the biggest concern.

Whenever the company has wandered away from content-related mega-purchases (Pixar, Marvel), results have been disappointing. Misfires include the social media-focused game maker Playdom, purchased for $563 million in 2010, and the online video network Maker, bought for $500 million in 2014.

Disney.com has also given the company headaches, with managers trying a series of redesigns and strategic retrenchments.

This time may well be different, in part because failing isn’t an option. And, in a contrast to those smaller acquisitions, Mr. Iger has pledged to devote much of his time over the next 21 months — he insists he will retire in July 2019 — to the twin streaming initiatives. BamTech’s remaining minority owners, M.L.B. and the National Hockey League, also have an interest in the effort succeeding.

Mr. Paull, a Harvard M.B.A. with experience at Sony Music, will report to Mr. Mayer, who joined Disney in 1993 before leaving in 2000 to run Playboy.com. He soon returned to Disney to work on Go.com, a web portal that eventually failed, and other Disney websites, including ESPN.com, before moving to strategic planning.

Though BamTech has proved its streaming bona fides, it still lacks the algorithms and the personalization skills that have helped propel Netflix to success. To fill that gap, Mr. Paull recently hired the former chief technology officer of the F.B.I. to be the head of analytics.

BamTech’s headquarters are a massive sprawl. Inside the darkened “transmission operations center” on a recent afternoon, walls of monitors displayed hundreds of live events — baseball, golf, hockey, boxing, a speech by President Trump — being streamed to somewhere at that moment.

Outside the operations room, in a series of alcoves, including one that used to house an oven where Oreos were baked, employees monitor games and are the first line of defense if something goes wrong with a stream. They’re nicknamed the Night’s Watch, from HBO’s “Game of Thrones.”

The level of engineering required for that enormous volume of content is no small matter. Each bit of streamable content has to be made to fit a dizzying number of requirements. Start with web browsers, ranging from Safari to Chrome or Explorer, all of which have slightly different demands. It also has to fit every iPhone and Android phone. And then there are connected living room devices like Apple TV.

“The complexity there is incredible,” Mr. Paull said during a tour. “It’s thousands and thousands of different applications we need to build to support that entire ecosystem. Then you add in international and the complexities of languages, currencies, payment mechanisms.”

He added, “That’s one of the big, big barriers to entry if you want to have a scaled digital video service.”",Disney’s Big Bet on Streaming Relies on Little-Known Tech Company,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/media/bamtech-disney-streaming.html

In June, Mr. Hackett announced that Ford would import a new version of its Focus small car from China.","Putting more emphasis on introducing new trucks and S.U.V.s while also managing the transition to vehicles that lack an internal-combustion engine, or even a driver, will require a dual focus.

Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com, said Ford might find the transition difficult. “Straddling the now and the future will be tricky especially in terms of profitability,” she said.

At an appearance in New York that was also webcast, Mr. Hackett acknowledged that the company faced significant challenges. “The decision to change is not easy — culturally or operationally,” he said, adding that the approaches that have brought success in the past “are really no guarantee of future success” as the industry is reshaped.

An immediate area of emphasis will be connected vehicles, which collect data about their operations and surroundings that can be used to improve safety and provide new digital services. “Our vehicles will be smart and connected,” Mr. Hackett said.

By 2019, all new Ford models in the United States will be able to transmit data back to the company or its business partners, a step toward creating mobility services like ride-hailing and traffic avoidance. The company is planning a similar rollout in China. By 2020, 90 percent of all new models, regardless of market, will offer such connectivity.

As part of that push, Ford is developing software that will enable vehicles to communicate with one another and with sensors along roadways and in traffic lights.

Ford’s initiatives come as the industry’s incumbents are scrambling to match outsiders like Tesla, Google and Uber, who are making big advances in automotive technology. On Monday, General Motors presented a plan to introduce 20 all-electric models by 2023, including two in the next 18 months.

In addition to revisiting its development priorities, Mr. Hackett vowed that Ford would become more efficient, cutting billions in material costs and engineering expenses over the next five years. Ford has average profit margins of about 6 percent in recent years, short of its goal of 8 percent. “That’s not good enough,” Mr. Hackett said.

Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of the office furniture manufacturer Steelcase, joined Ford’s board in 2013 and its executive ranks last year. His predecessor as chief, Mark Fields, had come under pressure because of a decline in profits and a sagging stock price.

While Mr. Fields was a polished salesman and marketer, the company struggled to plot a course as the industry was reshaped by electric vehicles, autonomous technology and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.

It was a reversal of fortune for Ford, which had been the only one of the three Detroit automakers to escape bankruptcy as the recession and financial crisis set in.

When he arrived, Mr. Hackett promised to review all of Ford’s businesses and operations, and prepare a plan within about 100 days for improving its “fitness” and strategic direction. Since then, he has said little in public.

In June, Mr. Hackett announced that Ford would import a new version of its Focus small car from China. Ford had planned to build a $1.5 billion plant in Mexico but canceled it in January after it met stiff opposition from Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect.

In the four and a half months since Mr. Hackett’s ascent, Ford has elevated its share price by 14 percent, including 2 percent in Tuesday’s trading session. But in the same period, G.M.’s shares have risen 33 percent, and Fiat Chrysler’s are up 71 percent.

Ford reported net income of $2.04 billion in the quarter that ended June 30, an increase of almost 4 percent from the same period a year ago. But the rise came mainly because of a big profit in its credit arm and a cut in its tax bill. Its auto operations in North America suffered a 19 percent drop in operating profit in the quarter.",Ford Chief Outlines Investment Shift Away From Passenger Cars,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/business/ford-chief.html

The price-cut agreement comes with a bonus: Top American oncologists will simplify complex cancer-treatment guidelines for underequipped African hospitals, and a corps of IBM programmers will build those guidelines into an online tool available to any oncologist with an internet connection.

Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, “Merry Christmas!” Mr. Paddock kept walking.
The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen.","When it came to guns, Mr. Michel said, “he was not a novice.”

The son of a bank robber and a secretary, Mr. Paddock grew up lower middle class in Southern California in the 1960s. From an early age, he focused on gaining complete control over his life and not having to rely on anyone. He cycled through a series of jobs he thought would make him rich, Eric Paddock said.

“He went to work for the I.R.S. because he thought that’s where the money was, but it turned out the money wasn’t there,” the younger Mr. Paddock said. “He went to the aerospace industry but the money wasn’t there either. He went to real estate and that’s where the money was.”

Stephen Paddock began buying and refurbishing properties in economically depressed areas around Los Angeles, teaching himself how to put in plumbing and install air-conditioning. By the late 1980s, “we had cash flow,” said Eric Paddock, who added that he had given his life savings to his older brother to invest and eventually became a partner in his company, because “that’s the kind of guy he was. I knew he would succeed.”

“He helped make my mother and I affluent enough to be retired in comfort,” he said.

With success came a rigidity and uncompromising attitude, along with two failed marriages, both short and childless. Stephen Paddock started gambling. Some who met him described him as arrogant, with a strong sense of superiority. People in his life bent to his will, even his mother and brother. He went out of his way for no one.

“He acted like everybody worked for him and that he was above others,” said John Weinreich, 48, a former executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, where he saw Mr. Paddock frequently from 2012 to 2014. When Mr. Paddock wanted food while he was gambling, he wanted it immediately and would order with more than one server if the meal did not arrive quickly enough.

Mr. Weinreich said he would get irritated and “uppity about it.”

Mr. Paddock was uncompromising but he was also smart.

“I would liken him to a chess player: very analytical and a numbers guy,” Mr. Weinreich said. “He seemed to be working at a higher level mentally than most people I run into in gambling.”

Mr. Paddock cherished his solitude, his brother said. In 2003, he got his pilot’s license after training in the Los Angeles area, eventually taking the extra step to get an instrument rating so that he could legally fly in cloudy conditions with limited visibility. He bought cookie-cutter houses in Texas and Nevada towns with small airports so that he could park his planes. He was utterly unremarkable.

“This guy paid on time every time and did not cause any problems at any time,” said Lt. Brian Parrish, the spokesman for the Police Department in Mesquite, Tex., where he rented a hangar for $285 a month from 2007 through 2009. He also stored planes at the small airport in Henderson, Nev., from 2002 to 2010, an airport spokesman said, though it is not clear he ever lived at the local addresses to which they had been registered.

Even in death, Mr. Paddock seemed to stay true to his ways. He remained in control, answerable to no one but himself. He was ensconced in a carpeted hotel suite. He was wearing gloves, as he often did to protect his sensitive skin. He shot himself before the police broke into his room. A piece of paper with numbers written on it lay on a table near his body.

“If Steve decided it was time for Steve to go, Steve got up and left,” Eric Paddock said. “He did what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it.”

The ‘Most Boring’ Son

Mr. Paddock was the oldest, and least angry, of four boys growing up in the 1950s, said another brother, Patrick Benjamin Paddock II, 60, an engineer in Tucson. Stephen Paddock was born in Iowa, the home state of their mother, Irene Hudson.

“My brother was the most boring one in the family,” Patrick Paddock said. “He was the least violent one in the family, over a 30-year history, so it’s like, who?”

Their father, Patrick Benjamin Paddock, also known as Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was mostly absent, living a life of crime even before the boys were born. A 1969 newspaper story described him as a “glib, smooth talking ‘confidence man,’ who is egotistic and arrogant.”

His rap sheet was long and included writing bad checks, stealing cars and robbing banks. He was on the F.B.I.’s most wanted list. The agency described him as an avid bridge player, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 245 pounds, who “has been diagnosed as being psychopathic, with possible suicidal tendencies.”

Stephen Paddock learned resourcefulness and self-reliance from an early age. In 1960, when he was 7, his father went to prison for a series of bank robberies and the family moved to Southern California.

The boys’ mother raised them alone on a secretary’s salary, the younger Patrick Paddock said. The brothers would fight over who would get the whole milk. Powdered milk, less tasty but cheaper, was the norm. Their mother never explained where their father was.

“She kept that secret from the family,” Patrick Paddock said.

Stephen Paddock graduated from John H. Francis Polytechnic Senior High School in the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1971, according to a Los Angeles Unified School District official. Richard Alarcon, a former Los Angeles city councilman, who lived near the Paddocks, said their neighborhood was working class, with a Japanese community center and tidy ranch houses bought with money from the G.I. Bill.

Mr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with “a kind of irreverence. He didn’t always stay between the lines.”

He recalled a competition to build a bridge of balsa wood, without staples or glue. Mr. Paddock cheated, he said, using glue and extra wood.

“Everybody could see that he had cheated, but he just sort of laughed it off,” Mr. Alarcon said. “He had that funny quirky smile on his face like he didn’t care. He wanted to have the strongest bridge and he didn’t care what it took.”

A Knack for Making Money

Mr. Paddock spent his 20s and 30s trying to escape the unpredictability of poverty. He worked nights at an airport while going to the California State University, Northridge, his brother Eric said, and then at jobs with the Internal Revenue Service and as an auditor of defense contracts. But it was real estate that ultimately lifted Mr. Paddock to financial freedom.

In 1987, he bought a 30-unit building at 1256 W. 29th Street in Los Angeles, near the University of Southern California, according to property records. His brother Eric Paddock said the buildings they bought were not “Taj Mahals, but they were nice safe places.”

Crucially, they were excellent investments: Stephen Paddock more than doubled his money on his California holdings, which included at least six multifamily residences, according to property records. He made money in Texas, too. In 2012, he sold a 110-unit building in Mesquite, outside Dallas, for $8.3 million.

He was a good landlord. He kept the rents low, responded promptly to his tenants’ complaints, learned all their names and made sure they were happy. When one reliable tenant complained about a rent increase, he took half off the difference. He designed the ownership structure so his family would profit and installed his mother in a tidy house just behind the apartment complex in Mesquite, Tex.

Mr. Paddock had an apartment in the complex, but he mostly lived elsewhere. He had been married twice, but the apartment looked like a bachelor pad, said Todd Franks, a real estate broker in Dallas. “What you would expect from a 25-year-old single guy.”

To Mr. Franks, Mr. Paddock stood out because it was unusual for the landlord of a property that size to pay such close attention to the day-to-day running of his complex.

“He was frustrated by people who did stupid things,” Mr. Franks said.

He was also willing to fight to defend what was his. During the riots in Los Angeles in the 1990s, he went to the roof of an apartment complex he owned in a flak jacket and armed with a gun, waiting for the rioters, Mr. Franks said.

Though Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually — Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit — Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.

“He was a tough negotiator,” Mr. Franks said. “He wanted his price. His terms. He was a very savvy businessman.”

The House Advantage

By the 2000s, with both of his marriages long over, casinos became Mr. Paddock’s habitat. He liked being waited on, seeing shows and eating good food.

“He likes it when people go, ‘Oh, Mr. Paddock, can I get you a big bowl of the best shrimp anybody had ever eaten on the planet and a big glass of our best port?” Eric Paddock said.

Gambling made him feel important, if not social.

“You could tell that being in that high-limit gambling environment would lift him up,’’ said Mr. Weinreich, the Atlantis casino host in Reno. “He liked everyone doting on him.”

He sometimes called for company, inviting his brother Eric and his children for a free weekend in a luxury suite. But mostly he stayed alone.

A couple of years ago, Mr. Paddock stayed in one Las Vegas hotel gambling for four months straight, said a gaming industry analyst here who was briefed on Mr. Paddock’s gambling history.

The analyst described him as a midlevel high roller, capable of losing $100,000 in one session, which could extend over several days. He said Mr. Paddock may have lost that amount at the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas within the last few months.

Playing a slot machine can be mindless and is usually a guaranteed win for the casino. That is not what Mr. Paddock played. His game, video poker, requires some skill. Players have to know the history of a particular machine. They can do that by reading a pay table, which tells them what each possible winning hand pays out.

One of the ways that video poker players get an advantage is to play casino promotions, which essentially pay out bonuses to winners, said Richard Munchkin, author of “Gambling Wizards: Conversations With the World’s Greatest Gamblers.” A gambler like Mr. Paddock will often “lock” a machine, meaning he or she monopolizes it and makes sure no one else uses it during a gambling session.

For one casino promotion, Mr. Paddock showed up two hours early, locked two machines and played them for 14 hours straight, Mr. Munchkin said, based on information he had compiled from other gamblers who were there at the time. The promotion lasted 12 hours, he said, “but he wanted to play for two hours before anybody got those machines. He knew they were the best machines based on pay tables.”

Mr. Paddock “knew the house advantage down to a tenth of a percent,” he said.

As for the mystery of why Mr. Paddock would go on a shooting rampage at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and then kill himself, most in the gambling industry do not believe it had anything to do with money.

He was in good standing with MGM Properties, the owner of the Mandalay and the Bellagio, according to a person familiar with his gambling history. He had a $100,000 credit limit, the person said, but never used the full amount.

The Absent Neighbor

Mr. Paddock spent so much time in casinos that he was mostly a ghost in the neighborhoods where he had homes.

Colleen Maas, a neighbor of Mr. Paddock’s in Reno, said she had not seen him once in a year and a half, despite walking her dog three times a day and going to line dancing events with his girlfriend, Ms. Danley, at the community center.

He did travel. On his 60th birthday, April 9, 2013, he flew to the Philippines on Japan Airlines and stayed for five days, according to a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. The family of Ms. Danley, his girlfriend, lived there and she was visiting the country at the time. The couple went again for his birthday the following year.

When he did appear at his Reno home, he could be curt. Another neighbor, John McKay, recalled a day when he was hanging Christmas lights on a railing in his front yard when Mr. Paddock walked by. Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, “Merry Christmas!” Mr. Paddock kept walking. “He said nothing,” Mr. McKay said. “Not a word. No eye contact.”

Even more baffling, when Mr. McKay tried to strike up a conversation with Mr. Paddock about Donald Trump during the election campaign, he got no response.

“Almost everyone has a reaction to Trump,” said Mr. McKay’s wife, Darlene.

Ms. McKay said that she would usually get up early each morning to watch the sunrise and, when Mr. Paddock was at his home, she would see him dressed in his gym clothes walking to the community center for a workout. Ms. McKay recalled something peculiar: “He always walked across the street and would never pass in front of our house.”

Mr. McKay said that he rarely saw a window or a door open at the house. One day he saw Mr. Paddock’s garage door open, and noticed a large safe inside.

It is not clear what set Mr. Paddock on his path to destruction. As early as 2010, he could no longer fly his planes. His medical certificate expired, according to Federal Aviation Administration records, and there are no indications that he renewed it.

Mr. Paddock bought his last house in Mesquite, Nev., a retirement community of 18,000 people about 90 minutes from Las Vegas that attracts golfers and gamblers from around the country. He seems to have paid in cash, according to property records, and, as he did with other houses, spent very little time there.

His neighbors added personal touches to their yards — decorative pots, plants of all colors and sizes. Mr. Paddock’s house was unadorned. One of the few things neighbors remembered about him was the solid-panel fence he erected. The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen. On Thursday, investigators had left. A tiny paint-splattered easel, its brush drawer open and empty, stood in the back yard.

Ms. Danley worked in Mesquite. She took a job booking sports bets at a local casino called the Virgin River, where gamblers sat together in rows watching horse races and waitresses circled in tight black skirts.

Several days a week, she attended morning mass at a local Catholic church, said Leo McGinty, 80, a fellow parishioner who knew her from the casino.

Ms. Danley dressed smartly and modestly, he said. She usually sat alone.",Who Was Stephen Paddock? The Mystery of a Nondescript ‘Numbers Guy’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/stephen-paddock-vegas.html

No longer. This summer Marriott International changed its cancellation policy at hotels in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America, across almost all of its brands (MVW and Design Hotels are exceptions) to 48 hours before arrival. In some hotels, to avoid a penalty you must cancel 72 hours in advance. Hilton has moved to a stricter cancellation policy as well.

Automatic gratuities are also becoming more common, particularly at resorts and some urban hotels. These are gratuities for the staff that are added to your bill — though Professor Hanson said some travelers have reported being unaware of this as they handed a tip to the bellman.

There are even fees at some places for the in-room safe. Professor Hanson said it goes something like this: You check in and two days later you check out and there’s a $2 daily charge on your bill. “But I didn’t use the safe,” you say. The hotel’s response is that it’s a charge for the availability — not necessarily the use of — the safe.

It may also dawn on you that the $4.95 daily “minibar restocking fee” on your bill is in addition to the cost of whatever you take out of the minibar. The Snickers you had may cost $3, but if you factor in the restocking fee, that makes it a $7.95 candy bar.

Groups that book events at hotels are seeing new or higher charges for things like the set-up and breakdown of meeting rooms, as well as for bartenders and other staff.

Like airlines that rack up ancillary fee revenue by charging for every little thing, hotels are finding ways to get travelers to keep opening their wallets. Baggage holding fees, for example. Say you have an evening flight, but checkout is at noon. Some hotels will charge you a few dollars to store your bags until you’re ready to leave.

Photo

Now let’s say you arrive early. Hotels have typically let travelers into their room if it’s available. But today some places are charging extra. This is increasingly common in Las Vegas where some hotels allow you to pay for early access when booking. It seems to be working in Sin City, but Professor Hanson said it may not necessarily take off in other markets where many families would simply sprawl out in the lobby, with lots of luggage and perhaps a few bags of McDonald’s, and wait, he said.

Parking is another example. At suburban hotels where you used to park free, increasingly there’s gated parking for a charge.

One bright spot amid all these charges? High speed internet access fees have gone down or been made free for basic access or for loyalty members, primarily because travelers were so put off by them. “This one fee and surcharge gets more complaints than any other,” said Professor Hanson. Until now, the fee was always increasing.

The disclosure of fees has improved in recent years, yet the Federal Trade Commission says complaints about the fees and the way they hamper comparison shopping persist. When you initially search for a hotel room, the price shown is typically the room rate — without taxes and all those fees.

Additionally, the meaning of certain charges can be vague. A mandatory gratuity at some resorts, for instance, may be referred to as a “service charge,” and it may be a whopping 10 percent of the nightly rate each day. If you book through a third-party site, the charges can be even harder to spot.

Photo

So why not just include the fees in the room rate?

There are a number of reasons, though the only one that possibly benefits the consumer is that if fees were included in the nightly rate, they would be subjected to municipal occupancy taxes.

Unless all hotels are forced to display the room rate plus any mandatory charges, any hotel that chooses to do so is at a disadvantage. Previous research by Professor Hanson has shown that travelers pay close attention to room rates, and that a few dollar difference can shift market share.

So what can you do to avoid being surprised by fees?

Whether you book online or by phone, Professor Hanson said to confirm on the phone with the hotel what, if any, fees and surcharges will be added to your bill. Then ask for the agent’s identification number or name. This will help protect you from any unforeseen charges because you’ll be able to provide details about your conversation.

He added that it’s far easier to get a fee or surcharge waived in advance rather than complaining afterward. If you’re staying someplace for a week on business and don’t plan on using the amenities, he said you can request an accommodation on the fee when booking, or right after (as opposed to asking when you’re checking out, when charges would have to be reversed and a manager summoned).

Dozens of states attorneys general have been investigating resort fees and surcharges. In January, the Consumer Protection division of the Bureau of Economics of the Federal Trade Commission published an analysis of hotel resort fees that found that “separating mandatory resort fees from posted room rates without first disclosing the total price is likely to harm consumers by increasing the search costs and cognitive costs of finding and choosing hotel accommodations.”

But, for now at least, the burden is on the traveler to unearth fees and surcharges — and then factor them into (what’s left of) their vacation budget.","Hotels Rake in Record Fees, and Travelers Foot the Bill",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/travel/hotels-rake-in-record-fees-and-travelers-foot-the-bill.html

SAN JUAN, P.R. — Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico discussed the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and the needs of island residents with a reporter from The New York Times on Tuesday. Here are his remarks, edited for length and clarity.

Q. What keeps you up at night?

A. The safety of the people of Puerto Rico. I haven’t slept much. It’s been very intense, but I am committed to making sure that during this emergency period we have our people safe, we can make sure they are alive, getting food and water. After we stabilize the situation, we can think about how to rebuild Puerto Rico.

Q. What’s your biggest worry?

A. Here’s my worry: the perception that this is just, for lack of a better term, this was a regular hurricane impact. This is a major catastrophic event here. Puerto Rico, within the span of two weeks, received two Category 4-5 hurricanes. That has never happened anywhere. The devastation has been enormous.

Q. Have you spoken to President Trump?

A. I have spoken to him at least five times. A few hours ago, I was in the Situation Room briefing him. He has been acting proactively. He issued two pre-landfall emergency declarations for Puerto Rico. That had never been done before. He declared Puerto Rico a disaster area practically while the storm was still hitting Puerto Rico.

Q. What do you tell him? The phones are down; the lines are around the streets and back; hospitals are closed. Where do you begin to tell him what you need?

A. There are several priorities. The health care situation, making sure we have hospitals running, making sure we have situational awareness of those hospitals.

We have fuel in Puerto Rico, the distribution has been a little slow. We have been hard pressed to find bus drivers; we are hard pressed to communicate with people. It’s been a little slower than expected.

Q. What happened to the drivers?

A. Several things. There has been severe devastation on many parts of the island. There are places still disconnected in terms of roads. People can’t get out of where they are at. If you happen to be a driver that was there, you can’t leave.

Second, and this is happening to all our government employees: There has been a reduced percentage of people who have reported. Some have reported to say, “Hey we’re stuck, we can’t leave.” So those are the reasons. We are finding more of them. Things are moving.

Again, the anxiety builds because people feel there is no fuel, when there is. And we made some progress there: 48 hours ago, we had 181 gas stations open, and now we have 450.

Q. How many are there total?

A. 1,100

Q. For there to be this level of a communication failure, was there a failure of some kind, was it an inevitable act of God and nobody’s fault, or was there a problem somewhere?

A. If we are going to talk about the root causes, our energy infrastructure had not been maintained properly for, you know, over a decade. We had a very, very weak energy infrastructure. I came in eight months ago, and one of our objectives was to go to the private sector and see how we can refurbish and renew this infrastructure. It was subject to collapse even when there wasn’t an emergency or an event like this.

Communications are essentially down. It affects essentially everything. In terms of some underlying problems that we had, sure, I would significantly point to a few: the power generation structure. It was old, it was unmaintained.

Vulnerable housing, houses made out of wood. They just didn’t stand a chance. They just didn’t stand a chance. That’s why our efforts five days before the storm was, “Hey, if you are in a flooded area, or in wooden housing, or mudslide region, get out or you will lose your life.”

Q. How is it that there are hospitals without generators and satellite phones?

A. Most hospitals have generators; they ran out of fuel. What we are doing in terms of fuel is making sure it gets to hospitals.

Some capability of sat coms should be around the island. We didn’t have it. What we have been doing is, provisionally, I’ve been going personally and my team has been going personally to different sides of the island and handing over sat phones to the mayors so they can communicate.

But again, once the infrastructure collapsed, in terms of the energy grid, and because we had many obstacles in the roads, and some communities were essentially cut off, those things aggravate one another. There’s no communication, there’s no direct linking, and that’s why this became an enormous challenge.

Q. How long will it take to restore power?

A. It depends. Pockets will be restored earlier. There was severe devastation. To give you a sense, Irma came by, Irma shook the power grid. We had to revamp it. It took us about 10 days to get to 97 percent. Not one tower was harmed. I saw personally at least 30 towers, in pieces, collapsed. This is completely different. We are going to need generators.

Q. Are you pleased with the pace of aid, the relief?

A. Here’s the thing, and I want to be very clear with this. I am very pleased with the consideration the president has given to Puerto Rico. He has been on top of it, at least personally in communication with me and communication with some of our officials as well as his officials. However we still need more, and the president understands that, and his team understands that.

Because it was an unprecedented event, on an island, that’s something needs to be considered. This is not a Category 3 hurricane going to Florida, causing severe devastation but also having the access of people in Georgia, New York and so forth driving down and giving you the resources. We have to actually bring them down by boats or airplanes. And adding to that, air traffic control has been clogged. We are working at about a 20 percent clip. With that 20 percent, when we notified the administration, they took action quickly, they opened alternative airports that would alleviate the need for more resources to come to San Juan.

Q. You were tough yesterday in your words and suggested Puerto Ricans were being treated as second-class citizens. Presumably you meant in comparison to Texas and Florida, which were recently hit by storms.

A. I was [giving] a warning essentially to Congress, to take action. I wanted to make sure, and I think that message got across, that people know [our] people are U.S. citizens.

Q. I’ve had people on social media tell me that they hoped Puerto Ricans would not be able to come to the United States, because we’ve already met the 50,000 refugee cap.

A. So this is why there needs to be some orientation on this front, which is one of the reasons that the federal government also needs to act. If it doesn’t act, one of the outcomes is a massive exodus of Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, and can fly in and fly out without any sort of paperwork, they just need to buy a plane ticket. That will cause deep demographic turmoil for us here in Puerto Rico and it will cause deep demographic turmoil in the states where they go as well.

Q. You talked about a humanitarian crisis. Are you worried about disease?

A. My words yesterday were to warn about a possible humanitarian crisis. We don’t want the United States to have a humanitarian crisis, and it could happen here in Puerto Rico.",What Keeps Puerto Rico’s Governor Awake at Night,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/governor-puerto-rico-rossello-hurricane.html

As such, “Blade Runner 2049” stands in relation to “Blade Runner” almost exactly as K stands in relation to Deckard before the two meet: as a more docile, less rebellious “improvement,” tweaked and retrofitted to meet consumer demand.","Speaking of avatars of alienation, K moves through his days with the unhurried shuffle and downcast baby blues of Ryan Gosling. This is impeccable casting. Mr. Gosling’s ability to elicit sympathy while seeming too distracted to want it — his knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa — makes him a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time. He is also, in 2017, something close to what Harrison Ford was 35 years ago: the contemporary embodiment of Hollywood’s venerable ideal of masculine cool, a guy whose toughness will turn out to be the protective shell encasing a tender soul.

At first, of course, we must take that sensitivity on faith. K does his grim job thoroughly and without complaint, showing the weary, cynical patience of an old-time shamus. His commander (Robin Wright) is a human who believes that everything depends on policing the border between her kind and K’s. The whole point of “Blade Runner,” though, is that such boundaries are always blurred and porous. K comes home each night from work to the company of Joi (Ana de Armas), his devoted girlfriend, who happens to be a commercially produced artificial intelligence application.

We are prepared to acknowledge the pathos and the paradox of her condition, which is a version of K’s own. The idea that synthetic humans harbor feelings, desires and dreams — that they are mirrors of us, that we are replicas of them — has long been a staple of speculative cinema. “Blade Runner 2049” does not wander as deep into this ontological thicket as, say, Steven Spielberg’s “A.I.” or Spike Jonze’s “Her,” but like those movies it uses the conceit of the suffering cyborg as ethical and emotional ballast, a spur to the audience’s curiosity as well as our compassion. A political theme also asserts itself: These replicants are an enslaved labor force; their exploitation is the fuel on which this civilization runs.

There is a something to think about here, a fair amount to feel and even more to see. Mr. Villeneuve has conspired with the cinematographer, Roger A. Deakins; the production designer, Dennis Gassner; and the special effects team to create zones of strangeness that occasionally rise to the level of sublimity. The movies Mr. Villeneuve has directed — his recent English-language features include “Sicario,” “Prisoners” and “Arrival” — are full of violence and psychological intensity, but what distinguishes them from other high-end genre spectacles is an unnerving calm, as if he were exploring and trying to synthesize the human and mechanical sides of his own sensibility.

Movies are by their nature hybrids of technology and sentiment, machines for the delivery of human emotion. The first “Blade Runner” approached this as a philosophical problem and an artistic challenge. Mr. Scott used imagery borrowed from old Hollywood, German Expressionism and the nascent art of music video to create a dazzlingly artificial environment where authenticity was out of the question. Except, of course, that it was the question: How do we know what is real, ourselves included?

“I know what’s real,” says the hero of that movie when — at long last! — he shows up in this one. K finds Deckard, the original Blade Runner (Mr. Ford, as if I needed to tell you), in an abandoned Las Vegas casino, surrounded by shimmering bottles of whiskey and primitive 3-D projections of Elvis and Frank Sinatra. Mr. Gosling, suddenly overmatched in the masculine cool department, acquits himself well enough, and Mr. Ford does exactly what you expect him to do.

Which is not something I’m going to explain, at least as far as it relates to the story. The studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics not to reveal plot points. That’s fair enough, but it’s also evidence of how imaginatively impoverished big-budget movies have become. Like any great movie, Mr. Scott’s “Blade Runner” cannot be spoiled. It repays repeated viewing because its mysteries are too deep to be solved and don’t depend on the sequence of events. Mr. Villeneuve’s film, by contrast, is a carefully engineered narrative puzzle, and its power dissipates as the pieces snap into place. As sumptuous and surprising as it is from one scene to the next, it lacks the creative excess, the intriguing opacity and the haunting residue of its predecessor.

As such, “Blade Runner 2049” stands in relation to “Blade Runner” almost exactly as K stands in relation to Deckard before the two meet: as a more docile, less rebellious “improvement,” tweaked and retrofitted to meet consumer demand. And the customers are likely to be satisfied. But now and then — when K and Deckard are knocking around the old gambling palace; when K visits an enigmatic mind-technician played by Carla Juri — you get an inkling that something else might have been possible. Something freer, more romantic, more heroic, less determined by the corporate program.

Then again: Who knows at this point if that sense of loss, of lost possibility, is even real? It might be nothing more than an artificially implanted memory.

Perhaps no group epitomizes the differences between the legacy left and the grass-roots resistance like Indivisible.
Indivisible would “gladly” accept a check from Mr. Soros or his foundation, said an official with the group, Sarah Dohl.

“Having a thousand flowers blooming at the beginning of a new era is generally a good thing,” Mr. Stein said.","Mr. James’s committee is among more than three dozen outfits that have started or reconfigured themselves since the election to try to harness the surge in anti-Trump activism. In addition to political committees, grass-roots mobilization nonprofits and legal watchdog groups, there are for-profit companies providing technological help to the new groups — essentially forming a new liberal ecosystem outside the confines of the Democratic Party.

While the new groups gained early traction mostly on the strength of grass-roots volunteers and small donations — and with relatively meager overall budgets — they are beginning to attract attention from the left’s most generous benefactors.

“We’re in a disruptive period, and when we get through it, the progressive infrastructure landscape may look different,” said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate at least $200,000 a year to recommended groups. “There may be groups that have been around that don’t rise to the challenge, and there may be some new groups that do rise to the challenge, while others fade away.”

The Democracy Alliance has helped shape the institutional left, steering more than $600 million since its inception in 2005 to a portfolio of carefully selected groups, including pillars of the Clinton-aligned establishment like the think tank Center for American Progress and the media watchdog Media Matters.

But this year, the Democracy Alliance hired Archana Sahgal, a former Obama White House official, to help the new anti-Trump groups, and it suspended its intensive vetting and approval process to recommend donations to a host of groups created since last fall’s election.

The Democracy Alliance distributed a “resistance map” to its donors in July including new groups focused on converting the anti-Trump energy into electoral wins, such as Flippable, Swing Left and Sister District, as well as legal watchdog groups and others focused on mobilizing protesters, such as Women’s March and Indivisible.

Perhaps no group epitomizes the differences between the legacy left and the grass-roots resistance like Indivisible. Started as a Google document detailing techniques for opposing the Republican agenda under Mr. Trump, the group now has a mostly Washington-based staff of about 40 people, with more than 6,000 volunteer chapters across the country. The national Indivisible hub, which consists of a pair of nonprofit groups, has raised nearly $6 million since its start, primarily through small-dollar donations made through its website.

Yet Indivisible has also received funding from the tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, as well as foundations or coalitions tied to Democracy Alliance donors, including the San Francisco mortgage billionaire Herbert Sandler, the New York real estate heiress Patricia Bauman and the oil heiress Leah Hunt-Hendrix.

And an advocacy group funded by the billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros, a founding member of the Democracy Alliance and one of the most influential donors on the left, is considering a donation in the low six figures to Indivisible. Mr. Soros has already donated to a host of nonprofit groups playing key roles in the anti-Trump movement, including the Center for Community Change, Color of Change and Local Progress.

Indivisible would “gladly” accept a check from Mr. Soros or his foundation, said an official with the group, Sarah Dohl. But, she added, the group is committed to ensuring that money from major donors does not become a majority of the group’s revenue “because we want to maintain our independence both from the funders and from the party.”

The group may start a political committee that could support primary challenges in 2018 against Democratic incumbents, Ms. Dohl said.

“It’s not a secret that we would like to move the Democratic Party further left,” she said, adding that “the party will only get to where it needs to go if it has groups like ours pushing them to do the right thing.” She cited her group’s aggressive opposition to Republicans’ initial efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act at a time when she said Democratic congressional leaders “didn’t really have a strategy.”

Established liberal groups like the Center for American Progress haven’t always been as forceful, Ms. Dohl said, though she added that the think tank “has gotten better at calling on Democrats to stand up and speak more boldly than they have in the past.”

The think tank, known as CAP, has engendered resentment from others on the left for casting itself as a leader of the anti-Trump movement and raising money off the resistance nomenclature. Within a few weeks of the election, CAP’s sister organization, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, was offering T-shirts emblazoned with the word “Resist” in exchange for donations of $40 or more. The campaign raised about $450,000 for ThinkProgress, the journalism arm of the action fund, which had its lawyers look into trademarking the iconography.

Daniella Leger, a CAP official, explained in a statement that the group’s legal team was merely exploring “a standard question” about whether to trademark the logo. “The immediate response was no — resistance belongs to everyone,” she said.

But the embrace by CAP has some anti-Trump activists complaining privately that the group is anathema to the anti-establishment fervor animating the resistance, and it is siphoning away resources from the new groups.

The divisions have sometimes spilled into public view.

The leader of a group founded by Mr. Sanders called Our Revolution castigated the Democratic establishment as arrogant “dictators” who want to control the “terms of unity” after her group’s activists were met by barricades outside the Washington headquarters of the Democratic National Committee when they visited in July to deliver petitions supporting a liberal policy platform.

And Ms. Hunt-Hendrix has urged progressive donors to boycott Democratic establishment-aligned groups like the centrist think tank Third Way and the nonprofits spearheaded by David Brock, the former conservative journalist who became a leading Clinton supporter and founded Media Matters and the opposition research outfit American Bridge.

Those groups represent a “neoliberal wing of the Democratic Party” that embraces “broken tactics” and an “uninspiring” agenda “more focused on defeating the right than on creating an economy and society that lifts up all people,” Ms. Hunt-Hendrix wrote in an op-ed article this year for Politico.

Matt Bennett, an official at Third Way, challenged predictions that the new wave of resistance activism would substantially shift the axis of the party. “The idea that all the energy in the Democratic Party is on the far left is premature, and is going to turn out to be the worst prediction of the 2020 cycle,” he said.

Mr. Brock and Ms. Leger both said that their groups have been providing research, polling, training and other resources to the new groups, which they cast as a boon to the left, rather than a threat to more established groups.

“The resistance is strongest when everyone has access to our resources,” Mr. Brock said. Ms. Leger said, “These grass-roots groups play a different, unique role, and their energy is something the progressive movement hadn’t seen in decades.” And a D.N.C. spokeswoman, Xochitl Hinojosa, praised the new groups for their work to “bring about progressive change and elect Democrats.”

Yet one major Democratic donor, the Virginia real estate developer Albert J. Dwoskin, said the fluidity in the universe of liberal groups would cause some donors to sit on the sidelines “to wait to see which ones have any legs whatsoever.” And veteran Democratic operatives are concerned that the proliferation could further fracture the left, widening ideological divisions and leaving groups fighting for resources.

That doesn’t bother Dmitri Mehlhorn, a political adviser to Mr. Hoffman, the billionaire founder of LinkedIn, who has brought a venture capital approach to politics, seeding a wide array of new groups on the left.

“The Democratic Party has been fractured,” Mr. Mehlhorn said. “We believe that by investing in different people and groups to try different techniques that good ideas will emerge.”

Among Mr. Hoffman’s donations are at least $1 million each to two of the groups suing Mr. Trump’s campaign, his administration, businesses and associates — United to Protect Democracy, started this year by a former Obama White House lawyer, and Integrity First for America, which will be unveiled later this year by the pioneering New York trial lawyer Roberta A. Kaplan.

A Silicon Valley-like competition between start-ups might not be the best thing for the left right now, warned Rob Stein, a longtime Democratic strategist who helped create the Democracy Alliance to provide structure to the institutional left.

“Having a thousand flowers blooming at the beginning of a new era is generally a good thing,” Mr. Stein said. “But when you’ve got your back against the wall, too many new blooms can cause message and operational cacophony.”

He warned that the combination of ideological and structural divisions, along with a national party weakened by changes in campaign finance laws, could “make it very, very difficult for progressives and Democrats to drive a coherent message in 2018, and to align behind a single candidate in 2020.”","The ‘Resistance,’ Raising Big Money, Upends Liberal Politics",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/democrats-resistance-fundraising.html

WASHINGTON — Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater, is seriously considering a Republican primary challenge for a Senate seat in Wyoming, potentially adding a high-profile contender to a fledgling drive to oust establishment lawmakers with insurgents in the mold of President Trump.

Mr. Prince appears increasingly likely to challenge John Barrasso, a senior member of the Senate Republican leadership, according to people who have spoken to him in recent days. He has been urged to run next year by Stephen K. Bannon, who is leading the effort to shake up the Republican leadership with financial backing from the New York hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah.

Over the weekend, Mr. Prince traveled to Wyoming with his family to explore ways to establish residency there, said one person who had spoken to him.

If he runs, Mr. Prince would face formidable obstacles in seeking to unseat Mr. Barrasso, a popular and genial but low-profile senator who will have the full backing of Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and the well-funded political committees loyal to him. Mr. Prince, who has never run for public office, has been a controversial figure for years, as Blackwater faced a welter of ethical and legal problems over its work for the military in places like Iraq, including an episode in 2007 in which its employees killed 17 civilians in Baghdad.

Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.
While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers.
Women began to become interested when Makandjé, the oldest of these women and leader of the Women Coal Producers Association of the Parc du Pont, dared to venture into this field.
This year, 33 percent of their profit will go to the women’s cooperative of charcoal producers of “Sissi Barra” in San Pedro.","In the charcoal fields of San Pedro, a bustling port city in the southwest Ivory Coast, hundreds of women and children — some barely school-age — toil day and night among heaps moldering wood, waste water and air thick with smoke. Driving rain, withering heat and sawdust storms come with the job. This used to be men’s work. Not anymore.



Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively women’s work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.



As Joana Choumali learned when she began documenting the women in 2013, men are happy to sell wood, San Pedro’s largest export, and let women keep the filthy, back-breaking work of making charcoal. Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.



Three years later, Ms. Choumali’s project, “Sissi Barra (The Work of Smoke),” illustrates the harsh reality for women with few choices, the poorest of the poor, in the Ivory Coast. While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers. Her conversation with Evelyn Nieves has been condensed and edited.

Q.

What drew you to this topic?

A.

I was passing by this park at the entrance of the town, an immense expanse of coal-black soil, and hundreds of busy people around smoke-filled ovens. I then noticed that they were mostly women. I was intrigued by the contrast between the harshness of the place and the presence of these women, adolescents and little children.

Photo

Q.

Do you know why the industry has gone from all male to almost all female?

A.

At first, this work was exclusively masculine. Women began to become interested when Makandjé, the oldest of these women and leader of the Women Coal Producers Association of the Parc du Pont, dared to venture into this field. She first started assisting male producers, then started her own oven. Today, she has inspired hundreds of women follow her example. Men progressively deserted the charcoal field. Now, most of the men we meet around these fields are wood sellers or carpenters. Charcoal fields are usually near wood manufacturers.

Q.

What did you witness in your three years of documenting the “work of smoke” that stands out?

A.

Some women, like Makandjé, are widows; some are part of a polygamous marriage or have been repudiated. Except for one, Awa, they have no other qualifications, and have no choice but start to work in this field to survive.

All the decisions are made together. I was impressed by the solidarity and unity between the women. They support each other. They have a joint financial arrangement where they contribute equally to save money. I was inspired by the strength, the resilience and the dignity they have.

Q.

What are they made of? Who builds them?

A.

The ovens are made of wood and sawdust left by the carpenters and wood manufacturers. The women build them themselves. The last day of my stay one of the women invited me to work with them. I collected the trash wood from manufacturers that they sometimes use because they can’t afford to pay for good wood. Then we placed the wood in a very specific way to make the oven. It takes a whole day or more to build an oven, depending on the size, and each oven is made for only one time. They can’t be reused.

Photo

Q.

What are some of the hazards?

A.

The sawdust is very light and it is a powder and as the place is very windy, this sawdust enters the eyes and the nose, and sticks on the skin. The eyes are irritated. My eyes and nose were irritated the first day, so I had to wear glasses and a mask to avoid the smoke and the wind with sawdust.

Then there is a lot of heat on the floor from all these ovens which are on fire underneath.

After when the charcoal is ready, they break the oven and collect the hot charcoal and put into bags with their hands. The charcoal is sharp and hot. They need gloves.

So they need masks, proper work shoes, boots for example, and gloves. They do not have enough tools to work, since it’s too expensive for them to buy one for each of them. They share their tools. During the rainy season, the mix of mud and sawdust becomes a sort of moving mud. They also need boots. And as they do not have raincoats, some of them protect themselves with pieces of plastic they find or go without protection from the rain.

After trying to work with them for a day I got sick. The work is physically hard. I couldn’t do it for more than two hours. Everything is done by hand.

Q.

What do you plan to do with this project?

A.

This project, made possible with the support of the Magnum Foundation Emergency Grant in 2016 and the Prince Claus Fund, is finished. I am very happy because next month, I will go back to San Pedro to introduce the team of “The Poplin Project,” a socially responsible brand of artisanal textiles that wants to empower women and to create a future for underprivileged kids by working with small local organizations and cooperatives. This year, 33 percent of their profit will go to the women’s cooperative of charcoal producers of “Sissi Barra” in San Pedro. The aim is to finance a drinking water system, to build a safe recreation room for the women and children and to help the young girls get an education.

“He doesn’t just say he’s going to do this,” Mr. Mowery said. “He gets thrown out of office over it. And then he gets re-elected.”

In order to fill the Senate seat that Attorney General Jeff Sessions held for 20 years, Mr. Moore must pass one more test: a special election in December against the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor who is a formidable rival, especially by the diminished standards of Alabama Democrats.

Although Mr. Trump said on Friday that Mr. Moore “has a very good chance of not winning” in December, strategists in both parties expect the state’s voters to choose Mr. Moore, who was one of the public figures who stirred doubts about the birthplace of Barack Obama.

If he is elected to the Senate, Mr. Moore will have gotten there as a rare retail politician with a penchant for reciting Blackstone’s Commentaries on common law. At the same time, and to greater political benefit, Mr. Moore, a former professional kickboxer, exhibits traits that many Alabamians see in themselves and seek in their elected officials: He is outwardly pious and prone to political pugilism, self-assured and satisfied with standing alone.

“Roy Moore is Huey Long with religion,” said Jim Zeigler, a Republican who is the state auditor. “Huey Long would tell it like it is. He ran against the establishment, he defeated the establishment, he would not compromise with the establishment. Roy Moore does all those things, but he has a biblical worldview.”

Yet Mr. Moore, who twice ran unsuccessfully for governor, is far from universally beloved in this state. For many people in Alabama, he remains part novelty, part demagogue and part embarrassment, his reputation marred not by bribes or sex scandals but by his brand of stubborn populism. More than once, Mr. Moore has found himself rebuffing comparisons to George C. Wallace, the governor who said in 1963 that he wanted “segregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever.”

Mr. Moore is “a one-issue man, and all of the other things fall to the side,” said Joel Sogol, a lawyer from Tuscaloosa who has tangled with Mr. Moore. “Either you accept those issues from his position or you don’t, and there’s a lot of folks here who accept them.”

Mr. Moore’s fame stems almost entirely from years of pitched legal battles over Ten Commandments displays on public property and over the authority of the federal courts to recognize same-sex marriages. Cast aside, even by some in his own party, as a bigot and a hatemonger, Mr. Moore has turned high-decibel clashes with his critics — he blamed “atheists, homosexuals and transgender individuals” for one conflagration — into opportunities.

In Alabama politics, Mr. Sogol said: “He’s an outsider who has a flag to hold on to. His flag is Christianity, the Bible. There are a lot of people in this area who think that is the No. 1 thing in the world.”

During his periodic exiles from public office, Mr. Moore helped to steer public debate using a nonprofit organization called the Foundation for Moral Law, which says it “exists to restore the knowledge of God in law and government and to acknowledge and defend the truth that man is endowed with rights, not by our fellow man, but by God!”

The organization, which Mr. Moore’s wife now leads, was the subject of a complaint filed to the Internal Revenue Service last week, accusing the group of “repeatedly and expressly” advocating Mr. Moore’s election to the Senate, in conflict with its tax-exempt status. Mr. Moore says the criticism of the organization is politically motivated.

Though he has done little to excise himself from the clamor of evangelical politics, Mr. Moore sometimes complains about being regarded solely as a culture warrior.

“They put me in a religious thing because I acknowledge God,” he said in an interview. “I regret voters don’t hear me talk about laws and all the things I do otherwise in government. When I was on the court, I dealt with everything.”

Service in the Senate presents similarly sweeping challenges, and the Capitol Hill establishment is not likely to roll out a welcome mat for Mr. Moore. He said throughout the campaign that he would be a gadfly, not an obedient follower of the party line laid down by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, whose allies spent heavily in Alabama trying to help Mr. Strange keep his seat.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“McConnell and all of those people in Washington know I’m not to be controlled,” said Mr. Moore, whose campaign won the support of Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News and Mr. Trump’s onetime chief strategist. “I’m not going to be managed, I’ve never been,” Mr. Moore said.

Though he is dismissive of his party’s leadership, he is no one’s idea of a centrist, and would probably vote the same way as Mr. McConnell on most issues. Like nearly every Southern Republican running for a statewide office this year, he has campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act, protecting gun rights, increasing military spending and toughening immigration enforcement.

Yet longtime observers of the man whom many know simply as Judge Moore sometimes struggle for a neat, overarching description of his approach to public policy, beyond simple populism. In his years on the bench, he stayed at something of a remove from the pro-business orthodoxy of the Republicans who have won near-absolute power in Alabama in recent years, and for an array of reasons, business leaders have chronically kept their distance from him.

“He’d probably be considered conservative by some standards, less so by others,” said Jere Beasley, a trial lawyer who once served as a Democratic lieutenant governor and who donated to Mr. Moore’s campaign.

Mr. Beasley praised Mr. Moore for a ruling he handed down on arbitration, but other decisions give his judicial record a texture that surprises both supporters and critics. In occasional dissents, for instance, Mr. Moore voiced support for overhauling sentencing laws that some say are too harsh and too rigid. Writing in a robbery case last year, Mr. Moore said, “There is a difference between justice and overkill.” In another case, he argued that a life sentence for a nonviolent drug crime had shown “grave flaws in our statutory sentencing scheme.”

“He is a populist,” Mr. Zeigler said of Mr. Moore, whose campaign had a fraction of the financial support that Mr. Strange attracted. “I don’t think he intends to be. He just is.”

It is a model that has long proved politically effective. And on Tuesday, at least, it overcame more than $10 million in advertising spending by Mr. Strange’s allies.

“It’s almost the same appeal that Trump has, but it comes from a totally different place,” Mr. Mowery said. “The state’s motto is, ‘We dare defend our rights.’ It kind of starts right there: A lot of people feel Roy Moore is the guy who’s done that.”","Alabama Republicans Bet on Roy Moore, a Familiar Rebel, for Senate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-senate.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists.
“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967.","Catherine Leroy was 21 when she arrived in Vietnam in 1966 with only a hundred dollars, a Leica M2 and a limited professional portfolio. Over the next three years covering the war, she built an exceptional body of work: surviving and documenting a capture by the North Vietnamese Army, parachuting in combat operations with the 173rd Airborne, and being published on the covers of major magazines, including Life and Paris Match.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges. They are candid and revealing, attesting to her resiliency, exposing insecurities, and showing her in moments of triumph, despair, optimism or courage.

Photo

Despite her many strong images, Ms. Leroy had remained relatively unknown, partly because she wasn’t a self-promoter, and partly because women photographers have often been excluded from the medium’s history, especially war photography. Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

After the rocket strikes, Afghan helicopters circled the capital’s diplomatic quarters and the airport for hours. Gen. Salem Almas, the head of criminal investigations for the Kabul police, said Afghan forces had started an operation in the area where the rockets were fired.

He did not provide details on the number of rockets, which were most likely rocket-propelled grenades, but officials at the airport said that many had landed, and that assailants had entered a house behind the airport.

The operation to clear the house lasted about six hours. Najib Danish, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said all of the three attackers in the house were killed.

Mr. Danish said one civilian had also been killed and 11 wounded. Two houses were damaged in the attack on the airport and during government’s response, he said.

American helicopter gunships operating in support of the Afghan special forces caused several civilian casualties when “one of the missiles malfunctioned,” the United States military command said in a statement. It was not clear precisely what the errant missile had struck.

A senior Afghan security official said the assailants had stockpiled so much heavy weaponry in the house behind the airport that a standard clearance operation was impossible and helicopters targeted the area.

One Western official said the insurgent rockets had ignited part of an American weapons depot at a military camp, causing secondary explosions. The airport remained closed to domestic and international flights for much of the day, resuming flights on Wednesday night.

Some officials said Afghan and American aircraft parked at the airport may have been hit. Jalaluddin Ibrahimkhel, a spokesman for the Afghan Air Force, denied this. “The rockets landed in the military and civil parts of the Kabul airport, but it did not damage the runway or any aircraft,” he said.

Capt. Bill Salvin of the United States Navy, a spokesman for the military, also denied reports of aircraft damage and said “nothing in the schedule of the visit changed because of the attack.”

At the time the rockets struck, Mr. Mattis was meeting with Mr. Ghani and Mr. Stoltenberg. Mr. Mattis, who arrived from India, emphasized that President Trump’s new strategy for Afghanistan was an “inclusive” effort to bring stability to South Asia.

The strategy has caused a particularly harsh reaction in Pakistan, which Afghan and American officials contend has long been a safe haven for the Taliban leadership. Mr. Mattis said that the Trump administration would work with Pakistan, but that it would also “watch Pakistan’s choices.”

Mr. Mattis did not provide details on how many more American troops would be arriving in Afghanistan, saying he did not want to share details that could help the enemy. But the lack of transparency has raised concerns, particularly since it was revealed that the United States already had thousands more troops in Afghanistan than officials had declared.

Mr. Ghani emphasized that American and NATO troops stationed in the country would not be “returning to a combat role,” but would be assisting, training, and advising the Afghan forces who are leading the fight.

“We will not abandon you to a merciless enemy trying to kills its way to power,” Mr. Mattis said, emphasizing the American position that a negotiated settlement was the only way out of the 16-year-old war.

The rival claims of responsibility for the rocket assault by both the Taliban and Islamic State pointed to the confusing landscape of the Afghan insurgency. Although the groups have fought territorial battles, American and Afghan officials have expressed concern about their convergence in certain areas.

The officials have been particularly concerned about an overlap in the enabling networks for major attacks planned by the Islamic State branch operating in Afghanistan and the Haqqani Network, an arm of the Taliban.

“There is an increasing collusion, increasing teamwork among the terrorist bands,” Mr. Mattis said.","Pentagon and NATO Leaders, Visiting Kabul, Are Met by Insurgent Rocket Barrage",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/asia/afghanistan-attack-mattis.html

The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

The federal government doesn’t collect data on forensic patients’ lengths of stay, crimes or treatment.
review declared James unfit for release, James requested that the court appoint him an independent evaluator and grant him a hearing.
Among the hospital’s 937 forensic patients, there were 1,908 incidents of seclusion and restraint in 2014.","In 1996, when James was 20, the police responded to a frantic 911 call near the house where he lived with his mother. At the scene, the officers found a woman bloodied and in distress. She said that James had lured her inside for a housekeeping interview — and that he’d been screaming when he started ripping her clothes off and beating her. The cops later picked him up at his grandmother’s house, a few miles away. At the police station, James signed a statement saying he understood his rights. He waived the right to representation. He signed a confession. (He and his mother now claim that the confession was coerced and that he is innocent.) When doctors subsequently evaluated him, they found him so unstable that they ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He was remanded to a hospital for several months, then sent back to jail, where he regressed again, then sent back to the hospital for several more months, stabilized once again, then sent back to jail, where in preparation for his trial, he was returned to the hospital to be evaluated for mental illness. Doctors diagnosed borderline-personality disorder, his mother says — which enabled him to plead “not responsible by reason of insanity.”

James says that he understood the plea he took. In the abstract sense, he did. But the specifics of it were as mysterious to him and his family as they are to most people. Before he was arrested, James and his mother were set to move to Georgia, where they had relatives, and where Ann had friends and a job lined up. After his plea deal, Ann says, she “put everything on hold,” for what she thought would be a few years.

Instead, James, now in his 40s, has been in the hospital for almost two decades. This isn’t because he was sentenced to 20 years, or to 25. He was not sentenced at all; he is technically, legally, not responsible. The court believes beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the act he was accused of, a prerequisite for the state to accept an insanity plea. The plea does not, however, prescribe or limit the duration of his stay. The laws that govern the practice of committing people who are acquitted because of mental illness dictate that they be hospitalized until they’re deemed safe to release to the public, no matter how long that takes.

James’s insanity acquittal placed him in an obscure, multibillion-dollar segment of domestic detention. According to a 2017 study conducted by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, more than 10,000 mentally ill Americans who haven’t been convicted of a crime — people who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity or who have been arrested but found incompetent to stand trial — are involuntarily confined to psychiatric hospitals. Even a contributor to the study concedes that no one knows the exact number. While seemingly every conceivable data point in America’s prison system is meticulously compiled, not much is known about the confinement of “forensic” patients, people committed to psychiatric hospitals by the criminal-justice system. No federal agency is charged with monitoring them. No national registry or organization tracks how long they have been incarcerated or why.

In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled, in Foucha v. Louisiana, that a forensic patient must be both mentally ill and dangerous in order to be hospitalized against his will. But in practice, “states have ignored Foucha to a pretty substantial degree,” says W. Lawrence Fitch, a consultant to the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors and former director of forensic services for Maryland’s Mental Hygiene Administration. “People are kept not because their dangerousness is because of mental illness. People stay in too long, and for the wrong reasons.”

Michael Bien, a lawyer who helped bring a successful lawsuit against the California prison system on behalf of prisoners with psychiatric illnesses, concurs. “Under constitutional law, they’re supposed to be incarcerated only if they’re getting treatment, and only if the treatment is likely to restore sanity,” he says. “You can’t just punish someone for having mental illness. But that’s happening.”

In the visiting room in New York that Sunday, as the hours went by, families came and went. Ann settled in. On James’s birthday, she brings a party: relatives, presents, a cake. And almost every week, on every visiting day, she and James try to make a life here together at the hospital — because it now seems possible that he could die there.

The insanity defense has been part of the American judicial system from its founding, carried over from our English forebears. British law has long reflected the moral sense that society has a duty not to punish people who can’t comprehend or control their crimes. But the insanity defense has always sat uneasily with the public, which tends to regard it as a means to escape justice. In the United States, such sentiments reached fever pitch in 1981, when a 25-year-old named John Hinckley Jr., hoping to win Jodie Foster’s heart, tried to assassinate President Reagan, wounding the president and three others, including James Brady, the White House press secretary, who was left permanently disabled. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity (N.G.R.I., as it is frequently abbreviated) and sent to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington. The country was outraged. Dan Quayle, then a senator from Indiana, called the verdict “decadent” and said the insanity defense “pampered criminals.” His Senate colleague Strom Thurmond equated it to a free ride.

In fact, despite its reputation as a “get out of jail free” card, the insanity defense has never been an easy way out — or easy to get. After a defendant is charged, the defendant, her lawyer or a judge can request evaluation by a psychiatrist. A defendant may be found incompetent to stand trial and committed for rehabilitation if she isn’t stable enough or intellectually capable of participating in the proceedings. If she is rehabilitated, she may be tried; if she cannot be, she may languish in a psychiatric hospital for years or decades. But mental illness is not exculpatory in itself: A defendant may be found mentally ill and still competent enough to stand trial. At that point, the district attorney may offer an insanity plea — some 90 percent of N.G.R.I. verdicts are plea deals. If the district attorney doesn’t offer a plea, or the defendant doesn’t take it, the case goes to trial. The defendant may still choose insanity as a defense, but then her case will be decided by a jury.

If N.G.R.I. was always difficult to get, it became even harder after Hinckley. With the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, Congress restricted the judicial definition of “insanity” to only the most severe cases. Some states — Idaho, Utah, Kansas and Montana — have eliminated the defense altogether. In trials in which it is attempted, doctors may disagree, and jurors are often influenced by emotional considerations. Today, only an estimated one-120th of 1 percent of contested felony cases end in a successful N.G.R.I. defense — that is, the prosecutor disputes the insanity defense, the case goes to trial and the jury finds the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity. In addition, the legal standards for “insanity” vary among states; some define it as a defendant’s inability to know the crime was wrong or the inability to act in accordance with the law, but most define it, post-Hinckley, as only the first of these. At the trial of James Holmes, who killed 12 people and injured 70 in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., one psychiatrist testified that he was mentally ill but that he knew right from wrong and should be considered “sane.” Another testified that he was mentally ill and incapable of reason (and, by extension, guilt). All four who examined him agreed that he had some form of schizophrenia. Jurors rejected his insanity plea.

And when an N.G.R.I. defense does succeed, it tends to resemble a conviction more than an acquittal. N.G.R.I. patients can wind up with longer, not shorter, periods of incarceration, as they are pulled into a mental-health system that can be harder to leave than prison. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled, in Jones v. the United States, that it wasn’t a violation of due process to commit N.G.R.I. defendants automatically and indefinitely, for the safety of the public. (Michael Jones, who was a paranoid schizophrenic, had been hospitalized since 1975, after pleading N.G.R.I. to petty larceny for trying to steal a jacket.) In almost all states, N.G.R.I. means automatic commitment to a psychiatric facility. In most states, like New York, there is no limit to the duration of that commitment. In the states that do have limits, like California, the limits are based on the maximum prison sentence for the offense, a model that belies the idea of hospitalization as treatment rather than punishment. As Suzanna Gee, an attorney with Disability Rights California (a protection and advocacy agency with counterparts in every state), points out, the law allows two-year extensions as patients approach a “top date,” the limit set on their confinement. And so, she says, “it can be extended in perpetuity.”

James’s mother, Ann, now knows the predicament of forensic confinement well. At some point during James’s stay at the state hospital, she became an advocate for mentally ill offenders. “It’s like a roach motel,” she says. “At least in prison, inmates know they’re leaving. Once you check into the hospital, it’s hard to check out.”

Though forensic detentions get little attention, they can range from ethically questionable to flagrantly unconstitutional and illegal. In 1983, a national study found that N.G.R.I. patients often lost their freedom for twice as long as those actually convicted of the same offense. A study of N.G.R.I. patients in seven states between 1976 and 1985 found that in four of those states, they were confined for less time than people who were found guilty, and that in three, they were confined for longer. Scant research, conducted decades ago, seems to constitute the most recent survey of the fate of the country’s forensic commitments.

“There’s not been a lot done,” Fitch says. The federal government doesn’t collect data on forensic patients’ lengths of stay, crimes or treatment. In some cases, neither do the state or local departments in charge of their custody. In 2015, I began collecting, via request or the Freedom of Information Act, all individual length-of-stay data by legal status that existed in each state and Washington. Colorado, Wyoming, Arkansas, Missouri, California, Maine, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Ohio and South Carolina said they simply didn’t have that information. Alabama may or may not: In response to repeated queries, it “decided not to release forensic data,” and hospital reports are excluded from its public-records law.

Many of the above states have reported legal status and average lengths of stay. In 2014, Fitch, on behalf of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, estimated, based on states’ self-reported average lengths of stay, that the national average for all N.G.R.I.s was around five to seven years. He says he finds that “horrendous,” given that civil commitments with the same diagnoses as forensic commitments can get out in under 30 days. There is no accepted body of research to suggest that lengthy institutionalization leads to better treatment outcomes. On the contrary, says Marthagem Whitlock, an assistant commissioner in Tennessee’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, “The deeper penetration into the system usually means more complications for the individual.” There are, as Fitch acknowledges, “people who don’t respond to treatment or who refuse treatment.” But, he argues, “it should almost never be necessary to hospitalize people that long.”

According to the state records collected for this article, in 2015, Florida had 24 N.G.R.I. patients who had been hospitalized for longer than 15 years. Texas had 27. Connecticut had 40, and Georgia had 43. New York and Washington had around 60 apiece. That’s six of the 28 states from which such data can be extrapolated, along with the District of Columbia. In those states — which exclude thousands of N.G.R.I. patients — a significant portion of N.G.R.I. patients had been hospitalized more than two years. Nearly 1,000 had been hospitalized for five to 15 years. More than 400 had been in for longer than 15. Of these, more than 100 had been in longer than 25 years and at least 60 for more than 30. And those numbers don’t present the whole picture, either: Many factors, like hospital transfers or conversion to civil commitment, can start the clock over or obscure patients’ histories. In many cases, Gee says, when patients reach out to Disability Rights California to advocate on their behalf, “if they’d not pled N.G.R.I. and just gone to prison, they might have gotten out earlier.”

Which is not to say there aren’t protocols for release. Most states do have a formal review process to judge whether N.G.R.I.s no longer fit commitment criteria: They are no longer mentally ill or are no longer dangerous as a result of their mental illness. Some states review cases on a schedule — every year, say, or in the case of New Hampshire, every five years. In others, patients (or their lawyers) have to request the review. Doctors can recommend patients for discharge at any time. Patients’ lawyers can also file writs of habeas corpus or petitions for restoration of sanity to have their cases heard in court.

At the psychiatric facility where James is a patient, as at every New York state hospital, cases are reviewed every two years or so, in a joint process by the hospital and the Office of Mental Health (O.M.H.) in Albany. In 2002, when the hospital and O.M.H. review declared James unfit for release, James requested that the court appoint him an independent evaluator and grant him a hearing.

That doctor found that he wasn’t dangerous and was ready to be transferred. The judge agreed and ordered it.

But James didn’t leave.

“Even the mechanisms for getting out,” says Pat McConahay, communications director for Disability Rights California, “are not really mechanisms for getting out.”

James’s almost-transfer 15 years ago fell under the jurisdiction of Guy Arcidiacono, now 61, the district attorney in charge of the Suffolk County Forensic Psychiatric Litigation Unit, who has handled 130 N.G.R.I. cases over 25 years. After the judge approved James for transfer, Arcidiacono and the Suffolk County district attorney’s office, joined by the New York State attorney general’s office, which represents the hospital, appealed to have the transfer order overturned. Under another judge, it was.

James’s police files are terrible to read. There was never a trial, but the allegations are disturbing. They include a statement by the woman whom the police responded to near his house saying that James sexually assaulted her, beat her unconscious, then threw her down the basement stairs. She told the police that when she came to, naked, she realized she was locked in. This, you might presume, was the basis for the rape and kidnapping charges that James said put him in the state hospital.

“Well,” Arcidiacono clarified when I contacted him, “there were two cases, actually.”

Two months earlier, James had been arrested based on another woman’s statement, taken at the emergency room, that she was pinned by her throat and raped in an empty field. (In his statement, James said she had agreed to have sex with him in exchange for crack, and that he didn’t actually intend to make good on his promise.) Charges were filed, and James was released to his mother’s custody — Arcidiacono says there’s no record of why, but it could have been because James hadn’t been indicted yet. When James pleaded N.G.R.I. to the subsequent attack, the charges from the first incident were lumped together with the new ones: in total, second-degree kidnapping, second-degree assault, second-degree aggravated sexual abuse, first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree rape and third-degree robbery.

“You can see in his case,” Arcidiacono said, “that they were serious charges.”

Like most district attorneys, Arcidiacono has substantial discretion when an N.G.R.I. patient comes up for review. Any time a hospital wants to release or transfer an N.G.R.I. patient, his office can demand a hearing. In contesting transfer or release, Arcidiacono can compel the patient to be examined by a doctor he selects. Even if that doctor agrees that the patient is ready to leave, the district attorney can still contest the release. Arcidiacono has done this and won. If a patient does win release or transfer (in New York, a forensic patient is almost always transferred to a civil, less secure facility for another unspecified amount of time before release), the district attorney can appeal, as in James’s case. When you’re dealing not with facts but with opinions, Arcidiacono told me, “reasonable people can differ.”

He went on to explain: “There are two considerations here. What is good for the defendant, and also, the safety of the public. And that’s the difficult part of these cases, balancing those two interests.”

All this adds up to a difficult path to freedom for some N.G.R.I.s. In most states, as in New York, the courts have final review over forensic releases and transfers, and judges have the prerogative to side with the prosecution regardless of what doctors advise. Cas Shearin, director of investigations and monitoring at Disability Rights North Carolina, recalls a 1988 case in which, during an alcohol-related psychotic break, a man shot four strangers he thought were demons. “Year after year after year, his treating doctors went to the judge and said, ‘He’s ready to be released.’ ” The hospital where he was committed gave him increasing leave privileges, including reporting to a full-time job and visiting a girlfriend with whom he had children. After 21 years of incarceration and seven psychologists and psychiatrists testifying that he was no longer mentally ill and posed no threat to the public, he was released — though the judge still ordered that he submit to random drug tests for a year.

Politics, says Joel Dvoskin, a former New York State Office of Mental Health forensic director, can determine if “you’re going to stay locked up for a really long time, regardless of whether it’s safe to let you go.” Elected judges, fearing bad publicity, may be loath to release an offender into the community. As Ira Burnim, legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, a national advocacy organization based in Washington, explains the situation: “You have a mechanism to confine, for the protection of the public, these individuals when they’re mentally ill and dangerous, and the further you stray from that, the less it’s legally justified.”

John Hinckley Jr. became a famous example. Last September, Hinckley was released from St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, 35 years after being found not guilty. It had been two decades since his doctors declared his mental illnesses in full remission, which should have provided the basis for his release. “That anyone can justify keeping him in the hospital” for so long, Fitch says, “is just nuts.”

The question, according to Dvoskin, “becomes one of risk tolerance. America has become — to an extreme level that’s almost impossible to exaggerate — a risk-intolerant society.” Fears of people with mental illness persist, even though, according to the best estimates, only 4 percent of violent acts in the United States are uniquely attributable to serious mental illness. One study has found that those with mental illness are actually less likely to be seriously violent than the general population. (In addition, some N.G.R.I.s have been acquitted of nonviolent crimes, like public-order offenses, traffic offenses and prostitution.) Even if a mentally ill person has committed a crime, says Chris Slobogin, director of the criminal-justice program at Vanderbilt University Law School, “it doesn’t mean they’re going to do it again,” especially because their encounter with the forensic psychiatric system means they’ve received treatment. “This is a group of people that are incredibly stigmatized and misunderstood in terms of how dangerous they are.”

Recidivism for N.G.R.I.s is relatively low. Whereas, nationally, recidivism for released prisoners is above 60 percent, “people who are found N.G.R.I. tend to go back out into the community, and they tend to do really, really well,” Fitch says. The arrest rate for people in Maryland on conditional release, a kind of mental-health parole from the hospital, is less than half the arrest rate of the general population in the state. “If you provide treatment of illness and provide the supports they need, then they don’t reoffend,” Fitch says. As a 2016 study of N.G.R.I. recidivism in Connecticut — which has a post-release supervision program, too — also concluded: “The vast majority of individuals are not rearrested.”

It is not sober data analysis, however, that sticks in the public’s mind — or influences judges’ rulings. Hearing that a man in Nebraska whose most recent diagnosis was “cannabis abuse, unspecified” had been in the hospital for 37 years may evoke less sympathy or outrage when you learn that he killed six people, three of them children. Two of his victims he raped. One of them was dead when he did it. The other one, who was alive for the assault, was 10.

“It’s not an easy population to represent,” Bien says. “No one likes these people.”

On Nov. 21, 2011, after months of having delusions about aliens, conspiracies and poison, Houston Herczog, then 21, partly decapitated his father, Mark. Six days earlier, Mark Herczog had written a letter to God (“God — Help!”) asking him to save his newly unrecognizable son. After Houston was arrested in the bloodied family kitchen, he told the police: “The look in his eyes! I had to!”

I heard about the murder from my mother. Houston is my distant cousin, though I had never met him or his immediate family. During his trial, as psychiatrists testified about a psychotic break related to an onset of schizophrenia, his family — my family — prayed that he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent somewhere for treatment. Charged with first-degree murder, Houston was facing 25 years to life. When he was found N.G.R.I. and sent to nearby Napa State Hospital, it was a relief.

It wasn’t until he was inside that any of us realized, from the mounting anxiety in his phone calls, the rules and restrictions that governed the possibility of his getting out.

Houston has now been in the hospital for four years. In 2015, I visited him there for the first time. After passing through a prison fence and four locked doors, I sat with him in an all-beige room. Schizoaffective disorder is the current diagnosis, and he is stable on medication, though he has periods of deep hopelessness. He struggles with what he has done; at the beginning of his incarceration, when, pharmacologically stabilized for the first time, he was suddenly lucid, he couldn’t do anything but lie in bed and cry. But he also struggles with the uncertainty of how long his confinement will last. Had he been convicted and received the minimum sentence, he would be out before his 50th birthday. His “top date,” according to his hospital paperwork, is Dec. 31, 2600 — 587 years after he was admitted.

Houston doesn’t dispute that he did what he did, but he does dispute the basis for his continued detention. “What are they rehabilitating?” he asked me that day, shaking his legs up and down when the caffeine from a Mountain Dew Code Red kicked in, his blue eyes wide behind wire glasses. He held his hand up, ticking the points off on his fingers. “Not a pattern of violent behavior, since I have no record of violent behavior before my crime. Is it my insanity? Because the treatment for my disease is medication, and I’m medicated and stable now.” And he is — high-functioning as you please. Before we began talking about his incarceration, he kept trying to engage me in a debate about feminist theory.

When he calls, Houston sometimes apologizes for not having much to say about his life — what would he have to say? — in limbo as it is. He would love to have a girlfriend, his first, but it seems unlikely to happen at the hospital. (“You know, I came here for the women,” he joked once.) He spends a portion of his unnumbered, many-numbered days arguing with staff about how many packets of sweetener he’s allowed to use at a time. (Patients are restricted to two at lunch; he likes his tea quite sweet.) His schedule consists of shuffling from group activity to group activity in a beige uniform, between feedings of institutional food three times a day, mind-numbing TV in the background, no internet or cellphones.

Houston’s plan is to wait until he has been hospitalized for at least five years before he bothers to file any writs or petitions for release. That number has nothing to do with what he thinks of his mental state but with comments his first social worker at Napa made: that because of what he did, he can’t possibly be let go for a long time. (When reached for comment about whether this was a plausible conversation, a spokesman for the hospital said, “A patient with a determinate sentence length of life for a high-profile crime might end up staying in the hospital for many years. It is reasonable and therapeutic for a treatment team to discuss these realities with patients.”)

Houston’s sister Savannah says that she gets it — the urge to confine forever someone who did something horrific. Savannah was home the night her brother killed their father. Only 17 at the time, she “had to walk past them to get the phone” to call 911. When she ran to her room to dial, Houston followed her, still holding a knife, but stopped when she shut the door on him. “Part of me thinks he should still have to pay in some way, whether he was in his right mind or not,” she says. “It’s hard though, too, because it is ‘not guilty.’ I have to remind myself of that a lot. I think that’s because I was there. I saw it happen.” But, she went on, “it’s my brother, and obviously I don’t want him to spend his whole life there, because even seeing what he has to eat makes me want to cry. Being there just deteriorates him more and breaks his spirit. He realizes what he did and where he is, and he’s depressed.”

Not everyone in the family is so sympathetic, says Houston’s half sister, Cameron McDowell, 43. “We have some family members who just hate him and will never forgive him. It was just such an awful thing. And I wish Dad were here every day. I can’t even imagine what he went through that night — oh, God, it was so awful.” But, she says, “he’s gone. And we have Houston now. We have to support him. This is going to sound strange, but I’ve not once been mad at him. I really, truly, passionately believe that it’s not the person that commits the crime. It’s the illness.”

At the same time, she understands why people are afraid. Cameron’s own husband isn’t yet comfortable with the idea of Houston’s hanging around their two young kids; though he loves Houston, he’s “a little bit freaked.” “I hope my husband will change his mind when Houston gets out,” she says. She, too, worries about what will happen after his release, though for entirely different reasons. “Is he going to be so institutionalized that he won’t know how to live? That’s what breaks my heart for him.”

Like Houston’s sisters, the judicial and medical systems struggle to find a balance between the blamelessness of N.G.R.I. patients and the gravity of many of their crimes. The rights of the patient are always weighed against the public good, a standard that may include a more or less explicit desire for retribution. Those who provide treatment for forensic patients, says Michael Norko, professor of psychiatry at Yale and director of forensic services for the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, “still have to answer to a court, or to the board, or to the court of public opinion. Every facility has people in it who have so violated a community, a community that is so angry, so hurt, that they’re basically pariahs.” He recalls one patient who shot a police officer; at hearings for his release, a crowd of uniformed cops repeatedly showed up and stood silently, facing the review panel. The question of a patient’s hospitalization can be “reduced to people’s grief, people’s anger, people’s fear — and the complexity of the patient’s rights and their recovery, all of those complexities get overshadowed very quickly.” When I asked Norko what happened to the patient who shot the officer, he said, “Well — well, eventually, he died.”

Because diagnoses and treatment assessments cannot predict future behavior, the standards for involuntary confinement — degree of mental illness and dangerousness — are necessarily subjective. Emotions and prejudice easily come into play, even from experts. A 2003 study in The American Journal of Forensic Psychology, for example, showed that doctors are more likely to find minorities incompetent to stand trial and more likely to diagnose psychotic disorders in African-Americans. At Napa, I spoke with a patient, a friend of Houston’s, who pleaded N.G.R.I. to a murder charge and had been hospitalized for nearly 20 years. When he was granted a hearing in which, according to court transcripts, multiple clinicians recommended his release, one doctor dissented — a doctor with whom he had had an ugly dispute and who, another doctor testified, wasn’t objective. The patient’s release was denied.

Stephen Seager, a 67-year-old psychiatrist who was at Napa for five years, writes openly about his own reactions to his patients in his 2014 memoir, “Behind the Gates of Gomorrah: A Year With the Criminally Insane.” He describes being in the hallway with a group of them heading to lunch as being “engulfed in a wave of hungry psychopaths.” When one of his patients tells him a story about his childhood, he writes, “I didn’t like thinking that some of the men even had childhoods.” Asked in court about a patient’s diagnosis, he gave the admitting diagnosis — bipolar disorder, manic with psychotic features — though he writes that he knew he wasn’t currently mentally ill. But he did think he was dangerous. When I asked him about this, he said: “The point is they’re supposed to be dangerous because they’re mentally ill, but if they get better and they’re still dangerous, what do you do?” He is well aware of the import of expert testimony in retention decisions. “Most of the time,” he said, “judges take our opinion on it.

“I look for the safety of the community,” he went on. “I live here. Sometimes you just have to say something for everybody’s best interest, regardless of whether they’re mentally ill or not.”

Of patients who “just never quite get better,” in doctors’ estimations, Seager said: “Oh, they’ll be here till they die.”

Napa State hospital’s vast, drought-dry campus is roamed by a pack of screeching peacocks. At 1,255 beds, it is one of the largest state psychiatric hospitals in the country. For most of his time there, Houston has been on what’s called a discharge unit, with one to three roommates, where it’s possible to get privileges like walking to the visitors’ center alone. After a bout of suicidal thoughts, he was moved, indefinitely, to a locked unit where all activities and access to the courtyard are supervised.

Houston’s treatment consists of up to 20 hours of group classes a week. His schedule at one point included Emotional Management, Substance Recovery, Current Issues in Mental Health, Self-Esteem, Fitness/Easy Exercise, Leisure Skills/Computer, Fitness/Weight Lifting, Discharge Planning, Wellness Recovery Action Plan, Coping Skills/Fitness, Leisure Skills/Journal and Conditional Release Prep. He says they watch a lot of videos. I once talked to a fellow patient of Houston’s on the phone who said he was heading to a class where the day’s lesson was learning to make cheesecake.

“Cheesecake!” he said. “Imagine that.”

State forensic hospitals vary widely in size — anywhere from just one ward to 1,500 beds — and they also vary in the activities and treatments they offer. Public psychiatric hospitals across the country may be accredited by an independent nonprofit called the Joint Commission. But it doesn’t require, for a start, the use of evidence-based therapies. One-on-one psychotherapy can be hard to get. (Houston began receiving such therapy only after his mother spent two years asking for it, his family says. Napa declined to comment, citing privacy laws.) State mental-health agencies may not be required to report what kind of care hospitals are giving, unless something goes so wrong that it attracts the attention of federal authorities. (Many do, however, voluntarily participate in national data-collection systems.)

The American archetype of bad mental-health practices is the movie “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”: doped-up patients locked away from society to suffer and, ultimately, to perish. Some advocates argue that the conditions at psychiatric institutions aren’t always much better. Until recently, Oregon State Hospital, where “Cuckoo’s Nest” was filmed, may in ways have been worse.

In 2006, The Oregonian won a Pulitzer Prize for its exposé of the institution. It reported that there was a male staff member who worked on one ward for only a year in the late ’80s but still managed to sexually abuse six female patients; there was a wrongful-death suit in 2003; a rape lawsuit in 1995 that accused the hospital of what The Oregonian described as a “longstanding pattern of sex abuse,” some of it by a staff member who, the paper reported, had nearly been fired the year before, “after he and several other staff asphyxiated a patient while restraining him for refusing to take off his shoe.”

The problems weren’t unique to Oregon: Nebraska state psychiatric hospitals settled two major lawsuits, one in 1996 and another in 2006, which claimed that staff members and patients raped and sexually assaulted female patients; two lawsuits have been brought against Massachusetts in the last 10 years by families of forensic patients who were subjected to illegal restraining methods, one whose condition declined and another who died. Napa had more than 4,000 reported patient-on-patient or patient-on-staff assaults in 2014; in 2010, a staff member was killed.

Today Oregon State Hospital still has the towering 1883 brick face of the “Cuckoo” era, but inside, it’s all sparkling new facilities, yoga props and a physical-therapy pool — thanks, in part, to a state senator, Peter Courtney. On a 2004 tour of the hospital, Courtney was astonished to learn of 3,600 badly corroded cans of cremains in an outbuilding, still unclaimed. Around the same time, after the death of yet another patient, the Justice Department became involved. Oregon State is now the first state psychiatric hospital in the nation to use “collaborative problem solving,” instead of, say, automatic “seclusion and restraint” of patients who start to become difficult. Courtney pushed funding for the reforms through Oregon’s State Legislature and brought in a new superintendent, Greg Roberts.

“Very often when you find serious problems, the problem is one of three things: leadership, leadership or leadership,” Roberts says. (A notable problem of leadership was found at Napa: The man who was its executive director between 2007 and 2010, Claude Edward Foulk, is now serving 248 years in prison for sexually molesting children.) Before Roberts came to Oregon, he was the person New Jersey sent to take over “problematic” hospitals that had “a serious negative incident or series of negative incidents.” He revamped three there, one of them twice.

More than 10 years into its transformation, Oregon State has come a long way. But, Roberts acknowledges, it still has a long way to go. Among the hospital’s 937 forensic patients, there were 1,908 incidents of seclusion and restraint in 2014. And while Roberts’s reforms included securing timely releases for patients — between 2012 and 2015, the hospital discharged 90 percent of its “guilty except insanity” (Oregon’s N.G.R.I.) patients with “top dates” early — it still has several patients who’ve been in for more than 15 years, who it acknowledges long ago ceased to be dangerous. Staff recently discharged one patient who had been in for more than 30.

Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of other places for forensic patients to go. When the push to deinstitutionalize psychiatric patients began in the 1970s, many inpatient facilities were shut down or downsized in favor of community integration and outpatient services, which never adequately materialized because of a lack of funding. But institutions have remained the preferred repository for forensic patients, who fill an increasing share of the remaining 42,000 state psychiatric hospital beds. In Pennsylvania, the proportion of forensic patients increased by 379 percent between 1988 and 2008. In California, some 90 percent of approximately 7,000 state-hospital patients are now forensic. Nationwide, nearly one-third of “consumers” in state hospitals in 2007 were forensic, and that number is “rapidly expanding,” according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa). In the last 10 years, forensic patients’ costs jumped to $4.25 billion from $2.5 billion; forensic patients now account for 43.9 percent of total state psychiatric hospital expenditures. This means less room for others who might be seeking psychiatric care, while at the same time, states have cut billions from mental health, leaving even scantier outpatient systems. In Hawaii, as a 2015 Samhsa report notes, “There is no voluntary admission to the [state psychiatric] facility because of the volume of admissions from the court system.” The same lack of services that contributes to people’s reaching a mental-health crisis that ends in arrest also keeps people institutionalized longer afterward.

Whitlock, of Tennessee’s mental-health department, says that there are N.G.R.I. patients whom her state’s hospitals are trying to discharge but for whom they “just can’t find a provider.” Under her lead, Tennessee, more than any other state, has been trying not to commit forensic patients to begin with. Since 1974, it has done its pretrial competency evaluations on an outpatient basis, no insignificant matter given that elsewhere these can take six months or longer. In 2009, the state also started doing post-N.G.R.I. evaluations to see if N.G.R.I.s even needed hospitalization, also on an outpatient basis. “We did not think there was a need to spend 60 or 90 days in the hospital to determine if N.G.R.I.s fit the involuntary-commitment standard,” Whitlock says. “Once you get someone into the hospital, it’s hard to get the court to take them back out. We could probably determine it in a day.” Now only 55 percent of Tennessee’s N.G.R.I.s are committed. Their typical length of stay ranges between seven months and 4.5 years, and they get out, on average, in about two. The state’s new initiative adds to the body of evidence that less hospitalization doesn’t lead to higher crime rates. Since Tennessee stopped automatically committing N.G.R.I.s, says Jeff Feix, the state’s director of forensic services, “the recidivism rate we have is no different than it was before.”

Despite the clinical benefits and cost savings — in 2015, according to a Samhsa report, the average annual cost of one forensic patient, nationwide, was $341,614 — Tennessee’s model is still unusual. There is no outcry, from the public or politicians, for alternatives to indefinitely institutionalizing N.G.R.I.s. After 45 years of studying the issue and filing lawsuits on behalf of patients, Michael Perlin, an emeritus professor at New York Law School and an expert on mental-disability law, thinks he knows why: “Everybody except for people who take the Constitution seriously and people who are in the hospital are happy the patients are there. Prosecutors, police, they’re glad they’re not going anywhere. I believe that the disability rights community has never gotten substantially involved in the issue because some of the people have been charged with very horrific crimes.”

As he put it: “This is an area that everybody kind of wishes would go away.”

Nearly two decades into James’s confinement, it remains unclear if he will ever be considered fit for release. He says that currently his entire medication regimen consists of “fish oil twice a day, calcium, vitamin D and two Kool-Aids and prune juice and Metamucil.” In the 2004 appellate court overturning of his transfer, the hospital doctor testifying in favor of his continued retention pointed out that there was no medication for his diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder — just therapy, to which he was resistant. The hospital forensic committee said that they believed James was insufficiently willing to take responsibility for his actions. One of his doctors called him “sexually preoccupied”; the appellate court concluded that “the disorder will continue to cause him to be dangerous at least until such time as he decides he wants to change and begins working seriously with his treatment providers.”

The court-appointed psychiatrist at the hearing two years earlier, when James was ordered for transfer, said quite the opposite. In his opinion, James “acknowledged the wrongfulness of his actions, and although he does not show much remorse or regret for his actions as a result of limited insight, he certainly realizes that what he did was wrong and against the law.” He said that James “has benefited from [the state psychiatric facility] as much as he will benefit, and at this point he could be transferred to a civil hospital, where he will continue to benefit from the structured environment and continue to receive individual treatment, hoping that he will eventually gain further insight.” But in its appeal at that time, as in every review since, the hospital successfully petitioned to retain him.

How much James’s perceived dangerousness is due to his illness and how much to his extended hospitalization can be difficult to untangle. During a phone call last year, he confessed that lately he’d been “going through a lot of crap.” He was referring to recent fights on the ward. The 2004 appeal notes that he was assaulted twice in 2002 and “got into an altercation with another patient” that year; all of the incidents read as demerits against him. Such disputes are not uncommon for patients with personality disorders, says Norko, the Yale professor and clinician. A hospital is generally “not a good place for them,” he says. “Clinically you try very hard not to hospitalize people who have personality disorders. They can’t quite seem to ever get it right. To them it looks like: ‘The staff want me to do this, they want me to do that, they keep changing the rules,’ and they don’t understand the rules, and they get into arguments, they get into fights. It’s all part of their personality disorder, which in itself isn’t necessarily all that dangerous, but it’s kind of hard to move somebody along when their record is dotted with all of these altercations.”

Perhaps the most cleareyed view of the compromises inherent in N.G.R.I. commitments comes from Paul Appelbaum, professor and director of the division of law, ethics and psychiatry at Columbia University. Appelbaum acknowledges that some N.G.R.I.s are “unnecessarily detained for a longer period than what seems to be warranted by their mental disorder and its impact on their likelihood of being violent in the future.” But, he says, such exaggerated concerns about public safety may be necessary to the survival of the insanity defense. “There are injustices that are imposed on individuals,” Appelbaum says. “But I also see at a 30,000-foot level why the system works that way, and recognize perhaps the paradox that if it didn’t work that way, we might lose the insanity defense altogether, or at the very least have an even more restrictive system that we have to deal with.”

For many, Appelbaum says, an N.G.R.I. verdict is still superior to a conviction. “It exempts them from a formal finding of guilt, which can be important later in their lives. It enables them to serve their time of confinement in what is generally a much better and safer environment than an overcrowded state prison.” While one way to look at indefinite confinement is as an unbearable uncertainty, another is that it offers hope: “Compared to a life without the possibility of parole, you know, maybe that’s better.”

Yet for the insanity defense to live up to the moral imperative it was designed to embody — exculpating those with diminished responsibility for their acts — better mechanisms for evaluating release will need to be adopted, Slobogin says. In an attempt, in part, to protect N.G.R.I.s’ constitutional rights to be released when they don’t fit commitment criteria, the American Bar Association recently revised its criminal-justice mental-health standards, which were adopted in 1986. The association recommended that forensic patients be detained only if there is clear and convincing evidence — a standard that, if it had to be quantified, means about 75 percent certainty — that they’re mentally ill and dangerous; the current legal burden of proof in most jurisdictions is a “preponderance of the evidence,” or 51 percent certainty.

“It’s immoral to deprive someone of liberty because you’re mad at them for being found N.G.R.I.,” says Slobogin, who was on the task force. “Under our new standards, after a year you have to have very strong proof of dangerousness, or you can’t detain them.” But the standards are just recommendations, and some states didn’t even follow the ones from the ’80s. Slobogin concedes that in many jurisdictions, they may have no impact at all.",When ‘Not Guilty’ Is a Life Sentence,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/when-not-guilty-is-a-life-sentence.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Mueller was appointed in May, after the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, and was given broad latitude to investigate Mr. Trump and his associates. But the statute under which he was appointed affords Mr. Mueller, or other future special counsels, few formal job protections. If he wished, Mr. Trump could order top Justice Department officials to fire Mr. Mueller.

Supporters of the Judiciary Committee measures repeatedly alluded on Tuesday to comments and actions made by Mr. Trump about the investigation that they said made their work necessary. Most saliently, in a late-July interview, Mr. Trump told The New York Times that Mr. Mueller’s team was rife with conflicts of interest and warned that investigators would be crossing a red line if they began to look at Trump family finances beyond any relationship to Russia.

Separating themselves from the Republicans, committee Democrats said those comments, and Mr. Trump’s repeated hostility toward investigators, made the need for action urgent.

“Simply put, I have strenuous concern about President Trump’s respect for the rule of law,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said in an opening statement. “The president must know that Congress will not stand idly by if he attempts to undermine independent criminal investigations.”

The committee’s chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, did not make his leanings toward the bills known, but he made clear in his opening statement that he saw an important role for Congress to oversee special counsel investigations.

The Judiciary Committee is one of several congressional committees investigating Mr. Trump’s links to Russia. The committee’s particular interest stems from Mr. Comey’s firing, but it has outlined a broad investigation into several other matters, from the Obama Justice Department’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email case to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.

Tuesday’s discussion frequently returned to a 1988 Supreme Court case that weighed the constitutionality of the now-expired independent counsel statute, put in place after the Watergate scandal. In the ruling, the court voted 7 to 1 that the counsel statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine and was therefore lawful.

But the decision came with a powerful dissent from Justice Antonin Scalia, which in the years since has gained a widespread following.

Independent counsels, such as Kenneth W. Starr, had considerably broader powers and more latitude than today’s special counsels, but the constitutional scholars and members of the committee repeatedly used the decision and the dissent to make arguments for and against the constitutionality of the proposed protection bills.

Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, both Republicans, appeared most skeptical that the bills were constitutionally supportable.

“The overriding concern I have whenever we are talking about this area is that bad things happen when we depart from the three-branch structure of the federal government,” Mr. Lee said.

Diplomats and their underlings have brokered deals for weapons and drugs, and more mundane products like machine tools and cows. They have also smuggled liquor, cigarettes, luxury cars and anything else that can be imported duty free and then sold at a gain.

“My late father-in-law was an ambassador,” said Marcus Noland, who studies North Korea and is executive vice president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, “and he told me that in India, years ago, it was known within the diplomatic corps that if you wanted to buy beef, you could knock on the backdoor of the North Korean embassy in Delhi. They ran an abattoir in the basement.”

Earning money is a necessity for the embassies — North Korea doesn’t fund them. Instead, they are expected to support themselves and send home any surplus.

Despite the sanctions it is under, North Korea did $6.5 billion in trade last year. Analysts estimate that embassy revenues represent a small sum compared with the country’s other low-profile foreign ventures.

Those included cadres of bodyguards leased to dictators who don’t trust their own citizens, laborers dispatched to work sites around the world who must remit their wages and state-owned companies that export ballistic missiles and other arms to countries like Syria.

In some cases, diplomats get involved with weapons deals. The third private secretary of the North Korean embassy in Beijing doubled as an employee of the Haegeumgang Trading Company. The company, according to a United Nations report, supplied surface-to-air missiles and radar systems to Mozambique. Haegeumgang also sold machine tools, and an ad in 2014 for those products on a Chinese website listed the company headquarters at the same address as the North Korean embassy in Beijing.

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to faxed questions.

Diplomats for the country have been ad hoc entrepreneurs since at least 1976. That year, Norway’s police found through surveillance that every member of the North Korean embassy in Oslo was involved in the import and sale of as many as 10,000 bottles of spirits and 100,000 cigarettes.

Today, sanctions have forced many embassies to curb their ambitions, with some intent on keeping the lowest possible profile.

The North Korean embassy in London sits unobtrusively in Ealing, a suburb-like section of London, just another brick house in a row of them. The difference is a small sign, barely visible from outside the wrought iron fence: “Residence and office, embassy of D.P.R. Korea.”

Aside from black luxury sedans in the driveway, there are rarely signs of life in the building, even to neighbors.

“I’ve never seen anyone go in or out of there,” said Ali Wiseman, a student who lives in a group house two doors down. “And I’ve been here a year.”

His roommate, Rupert Thomson, has seen people there. “I once saw three women working on the lawn out front and they did everything to not look at me,” he said.

The way that the London embassy sustains itself is a mystery. One theory comes from Kim Joo-il, a former member of the North Korean military who defected and moved to London in 2007. He said he often saw embassy employees at a type of Sunday flea market called a car-boot sale.

“They are always there buying secondhand electronics, toys, dolls, kitchen goods,” Mr. Kim said through an interpreter, seated at a restaurant he owns in a London suburb. “Some of these things they are cleaning up and fixing to resell, others they are sending home to North Korea.”

North Korean embassies in the former eastern bloc, where the missions were long ago granted generous square footage, have a more lucrative stratagem.

In Poland, 40 businesses are listed at the address of the North Korean embassy in Warsaw, including a pharmaceutical company, several advertising agencies and a yacht club. How many of these businesses are actually staffed there is unclear.

In Sofia, the embassy owns a number of buildings on two separate properties. One is a complex that includes the embassy itself. Passers-by can pause at a glass display case — standard issue for embassies in the city — filled with photographs. One captures the Supreme Leader beaming at a crowd, others were of missiles that had just been launched.

The event space, known as Terra Residence, is a 15-minute walk east. It’s the former home of the North Korean ambassador, built in the 1980s with dazzle instead of comfort in mind. Photos on Terra’s promotional website show an interior that is essentially a communist take on Versailles — a series of huge and austere halls with chandeliers, gold curtains and paintings of ballerinas.

Terra rents out the space for magazine photo sessions, music videos and television ads, including a handful for national banks and one for the Bulgarian version of “Celebrity Apprentice.” Its main business is weddings, proms and corporate events.

Few attendees, it seems, realize they are spending the evening on North Korean property.

“I knew it was a former embassy building, but I had no idea it was owned by North Korea,” said Bilyana Dimitrova, who attended a friend’s wedding at Terra in September. “The atmosphere was very pleasant.”

A spokeswoman for Terra, Anelia Baklova, wrote in an email that the company has had a long-term lease with the embassy of North Korea that predates the imposition of economic sanctions. When the U.N. approved stricter sanctions, this year and last, Terra “froze” its payments, she said. The company has not been evicted, she wrote, because of the “considerable amount of money” it had spent on renovations and upkeep.

Emails to the embassy were not returned.

Some countries have succeeded in shutting down businesses that rent from North Korea. In May, Germany closed a youth hostel that was operating in what was originally North Korean diplomatic quarters.

The governments of Poland and Bulgaria have so far been unable to end the ancillary activities. A spokesman for the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had repeatedly raised the issue of renting out space with North Korean officials here, urging them to “use properties in Sofia solely for diplomatic and consular activities.”

Terra, unlike its landlord, has tried to become a more agreeable neighbor. People who live across the street say that notices are now taped on the doors of their apartment building a day before there will be fireworks, giving a heads up and promising that the show will end by 10 p.m.

Surprisingly, residents didn’t seem particularly vexed about living near an enterprise that has pumped money into the world’s most repressive and notorious regime. But that may say more about Bulgaria’s government than the dangers of North Korea.

The stabbings — and the presence of a switchblade in the school — stirred complaints from some parents that the school did not have metal detectors and prompted questions from reporters to the mayor and police officials about whether the school should have had them. Eighty-eight of the city’s roughly 1,300 school buildings have metal detectors that are used either full time or part time.

Among students and faculty, though, the talk was of the lives changed.

They are a legal tool, historically reserved for matters of national security and diplomacy, used to interject the federal government in private disputes.

In the Georgia case, an evangelical Christian student sued administrators last year at Georgia Gwinnett College, a public institution, saying they had limited his ability to proselytize.

According to the lawsuit, the student, Chike Uzuegbunam, an undergraduate at the time, had distributed evangelical Christian materials outside the school library. The college’s administration stopped him because he was not within designated free-speech zones and had not obtained a permit.

Mr. Uzuegbunam later reserved a place outside the school’s food court, within a free-speech zone, and began “discussing the brevity of life and how all men and women have fallen short of God’s commands,” according to the lawsuit. After students complained, administrators said Mr. Uzuegbunam’s “open-air speaking” had disturbed the peace, and they restricted it.

Justice Department lawyers argued in the statement of interest that school administrators were unjustified in silencing Mr. Uzuegbunam simply because other students had been “uncomfortable.”

Casey Mattox, a senior lawyer at the Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing Mr. Uzuegbunam, said the Justice Department’s support was heartening.

“It’s a boost for the broader free speech movement that the federal government is taking First Amendment rights very seriously,” said Mr. Mattox, whose organization is also representing a student arrested last year for distributing copies of the Constitution on the campus of Kellogg Community College in Battle Creek, Mich.

Mr. Sessions also mentioned that case in his remarks on Tuesday.

“The American university was once the center of academic freedom — a place of robust debate, a forum for the competition of ideas,” Mr. Sessions said. “But it is transforming into an echo chamber of political correctness and homogeneous thought, a shelter for fragile egos.”

Condemning a violent protest at Middlebury College, in Middlebury, Vt., that this year shut down a speech by the author Charles Murray, Mr. Sessions noted that some of the dissenters had worn masks, “a common tactic also used by the detestable Ku Klux Klan.”

The debate about how to interpret the First Amendment on college campuses has divided university faculties, with some arguing for unrestricted speech, no matter how inflammatory, and others advocating boundaries be established in an age of internet trolling and cyberbullying.

At the University of California, Berkeley, the faculty is divided on the issue. Last week, a Free Speech Week event featuring the conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled.

Mr. Sessions invoked a recent appearance at Berkeley by the conservative writer Ben Shapiro, the former editor at large of Breitbart News, whom he described as a “Harvard trained lawyer who has been frequently targeted by anti-Semites for his Jewish faith, and who vigorously condemns hate speech on both the left and right.”

“To my knowledge,” Mr. Sessions said, “no one fainted, no one was unsafe.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at Berkeley and a First Amendment scholar, said he was pleased about Mr. Sessions’s advocacy for free speech. “I think it’s great that the attorney general of the United States is coming down on the side of free speech — I would hope liberals and conservatives can agree,” he said.

But Mr. Chemerinsky, who has co-written a new book, “Free Speech on Campus,” said he thought Mr. Sessions failed to fully consider the balance of freedom of expression with public safety.

“This university spent $600,000 to facilitate Ben Shapiro coming, and it was estimated if Milo Yiannopoulos came, it would cost $1 million,” he said. “It’s not sustainable for this campus on a weekly basis to facilitate free speech while protecting public safety. Where is that line to be drawn? It’s a really hard question.”

Further stoking the debate about First Amendment rights, Mr. Sessions joined Mr. Trump in criticizing professional athletes who have declined to stand for the national anthem to raise awareness of police brutality and racial injustice.

“The president has free speech rights, too,” Mr. Sessions said in response to a question from the audience. “If they take a provocative act, they have a right to be condemned, and the president has a right to condemn them, and I would condemn their actions.”

Some dissenting students and faculty at Georgetown — where Tiffany Trump, the president’s youngest daughter, is newly enrolled in the law school — called the administration’s message inconsistent.

“There’s hypocrisy here,” said Peter B. Edelman, who teaches constitutional law at Georgetown. “Just as the president has shown a lack of respect for freedom of speech, the attorney general comes to make use of his freedom of speech at our law school.”

Mr. Sessions requested Tuesday’s appearance — the subject and time of which was chosen before Mr. Trump’s remarks about the N.F.L. — according to Randy Barnett, a professor of constitutional law who helped organize the event. Attendance was invitation-only, he said, in order to promote a “civil” tone.

Mr. Sessions urged the students to appreciate their ability to speak out. “As you exercise these rights, realize how precious, how rare and how fragile they are,” he said.

In “most societies throughout history,” he added, “openly criticizing the government or expressing unorthodox opinions could land you in jail, or worse.”","Sessions Calls for ‘Recommitment’ to Free Speech on Campus, Diving Into Debate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/politics/jeff-sessions-campus-free-speech-georgetown.html

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either.

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II.

An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

Of course, the standard claims are being made about the vast stimulative effects of the repatriated cash. They are being met this time with vigorous counterclaims based on the results of the Bush administration’s shot over a decade ago.

Back then, companies found their way around regulations forbidding this use of the money to simply benefit shareholders and corporate chiefs. A Senate commission reported that the top 15 repatriating corporations reduced their overall United States work force by 20,931 jobs, even as share buybacks increased and the annual compensation for their top five executives jumped 27 percent from 2004 to 2005 and another 30 percent the next year.

Pfizer, for instance, brought back $35.5 billion, the largest amount repatriated by a single company during the tax holiday, according to the Senate report. Then it turned around and spent over $20 billion in stock repurchases from 2005 to 2007. By 2007, the aggregate compensation of its top five executives was nearly $13 million higher than in 2004. Its United States payroll was 12,000 smaller.

The pattern was similar across most repatriating companies. Hewlett-Packard, which brought home $14.5 billion, bought back $22 billion worth of stock over the three years and cut its payroll by more than 8,500. The tobacco company Altria, which brought over $6 billion home during the holiday, spent $2.5 billion on share buybacks and bumped pay in the executive ranks by more than $50 million, but cut 6,000 jobs.

A few years back, Ms. Forbes explained to my colleague Floyd Norris how the computer manufacturer Dell had lobbied hard for the holiday — claiming that part of the money would be used to build a plant in Winston-Salem, N.C. “They did bring back $4 billion, and spent $100 million on the plant, which they admitted would have been built anyway,” she said. “About two months after that, they used $2 billion for a share buyback.”

Profits Held Outside the U.S. The 10 companies with the most profit held outside the United States last year, in billions. Apple Pfizer Microsoft G.E. IBM Johnson & Johnson Cisco Merck Google Exxon Mobil $230.2 197.1 124.0 82.0 71.4 66.2 65.6 63.1 60.7 54.0

With a new move afoot to put such holdings back on American books, there is a critical question that is too quickly glossed over: Why do businesses act this way? Why didn’t corporate executives invest more in their businesses and their work forces? Why did they go to the trouble of dribbling around a rule forbidding the use of repatriated profits to pay themselves a bonus? (Note to Congress: Money is fungible.)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Call me naïve. Professor Forbes and her colleagues — indeed, many economists — might swat the question away by arguing that businesses didn’t use the extra cash to invest and employ because they were well-run businesses, well invested and sufficiently staffed to maximize their profitability.

There is truth to this argument. In fact, most corporate investment today comes not from retained earnings but from borrowing. Bringing a foreign profit stash home has little effect on investment incentives.

Still, the question should resonate in an administration that came to power on a promise to address the plight of the working class. Because the working class stands on the other end of a deal with the corporate class. I don’t think it is possible to fully address workers’ demands without understanding, and changing, corporate motivations.

Many forces have shaped this deal, including technology, which replaced workers performing routine tasks, and globalization, which squeezed the margins of many businesses and exposed their workers to competition from cheap labor markets. And yet it would be a mistake to ignore the impact of a corporate ethos that has come to focus on rewarding shareholders and executives at the expense of any other consideration — be it workers’ welfare or even the company’s long-term sustainability. Indeed, workers today amount to little more than a line on the cost side of businesses’ balance sheets, with little claim to its prosperity.

Corporate profits have risen over the last quarter-century, as a share of the nation’s income, even as the workers’ share has shrunk. While executive pay has soared — padded with stock options and shares — the earnings of ordinary workers are below where they were in the 1970s. What’s more, the pensions that ensured workers a retirement perch in the middle class have been replaced by 401(k) savings accounts — which are cheaper for companies but put workers’ retirement prospects at the mercy of the stock market.

“How you divide the pie is a choice,” said Rick Wartzman, who heads the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute of Claremont Graduate University. “It is being carved differently.”

The change has happened across the board. In his book “The End of Loyalty,” published in May by Public Affairs, Mr. Wartzman lays out a shift in corporate culture both in success stories like Coca-Cola and General Electric and in less successful ones, like Eastman Kodak and General Motors. “For workers, the story was the same, whether they were working at a winner or a losing firm,” he said.

The good news is that it is not impossible to modify the behavior of the corporate leaders who have so drastically altered the contract with their work force over the last few decades. While it may be tempting to cast the new breed of executives as selfish villains who somehow lost their sense of right and wrong, the shift in their behavior responded to a shift in the incentives they faced. It was fed by a belief that snaked its way three or four decades ago from the halls of the University of Chicago through investment-bank trading floors and into the corner offices of corporate America: that the interests of corporate managers must be brought into tight alignment with those of shareholders. It was accompanied by one of the most destabilizing propositions in the modern history of corporate governance: This alignment was best achieved by paying corporate managers almost exclusively with stock.

Mihir A. Desai of Harvard Business School argues that this strategy amounted to outsourcing corporate compensation decisions to the capital markets — which have no way of telling whether the rise or fall in shares is caused by executives’ strategies or simply luck. This produced an enormous bubble in chief executive pay — which rose in tandem with the stock. It also made chief executives’ jobs more uncertain, vulnerable to market downturns. And it vastly distorted their behavior, putting every decision at the service of the share price at the close of the quarter.

Professor Desai points out that in the end, this structure does not really serve shareholders, at least not those with an interest in a company’s prosperity more than a few quarters down the road. “Capitalism seems to be serving managers and investment managers at the expense of shareholders,” he wrote.

Changing this behavior is not beyond the reach of policy. Just as changes in the tax treatment of executive pay in the 1990s encouraged stock-based remuneration, tax reforms might motivate corporate executives to invest for the long term rather than for an immediate stock bump — maybe even encourage stable employment and worker training. Until then, offering tax breaks to American corporations seems more likely to line the pockets of executives and shareholders than to improve their long-term prospects or the prosperity of their workers.",Will a Corporate Tax Holiday Give Workers Anything to Cheer?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/business/economy/corporate-tax.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

A clue like “A B C D E F G” doesn’t give solvers much of a hint as to what the 10-letter answer might be on its own; fortunately, the crossings are kind, so it’s not too hard to figure out that these are MUSIC NOTES.

The other letter strings in the theme clues are for you to find. Kudos to Mr. Charlson for a fresh theme.

In nontheme news, I have to say that the long Downs made me smile. I loved SHOT TO HELL for its unexpectedness, and “FROST/NIXON” is a nice, Scrabbly entry to write into the grid.

Tricky Clues

49A: “Strands in a cell?” looks like it refers either to the microscopic type of cell or a jail cell, although strands in a jail cell doesn’t make much sense. The answer refers to microscopic cells and the strands of genetic material within. If you are not sure whether the answer is RNA or DNA, fill in the “NA” and work that first crossing. 40D is AUDI, so the answer is DNA. See? You don’t have to be a scientist to do the crossword.

59D: I thought this one might bring out some of my fellow vegetable gardeners, because I’m sure I’m not the only one who believed that yams were tubers, not ROOTs. Apparently, “all tubers are root crops, but not all root crops are tubers,” and there are many ways to distinguish the part of a plant that grows underground. The main point you should take away from all this is that they’re good for you and you should eat your vegetables.

Constructor Notes

This idea for this theme came from thinking about Schrödinger puzzles, and wondering if I could potentially create one so that entries that contain more than one distinct stand-alone letter, for example, VITAMIN which can be followed by A, B, C, D, E, or K, intersect another such entry. Ideally, the shared possible letters for each pair of theme entries would be some combination of A, B, C and D, so that the revealer MULTIPLE CHOICE could be used. This didn’t end up panning out, but it did lead me, through a somewhat stream-of-consciousness manner of contemplating crossword themes, to come up with the one you see here. The first version of this puzzle had the theme entries VITAMINS, MUSICAL NOTES, CHEMICAL SYMBOLS, GREEK LETTERS and ALPHABET, and was rejected on the basis that ALPHABET was too obvious, and GREEK LETTERS was inconsistent. It was tough to find a new set of symmetrical theme entries, but I’m pleased with the current set. In each case, the category contains other members besides the ones that are composed of a single letter, and the letters are the members of the category themselves rather than being abbreviations, unlike something such as L M S for SHIRT SIZES. I spent a decent amount of time trying to remove the black square between TILE and GREEK and its symmetrical partner to allow for two pairs of long parallel downs, but I didn’t like the compromises on the fill, so I decided to stick to 78 words. Given that this ended up as a Monday (I had expected it to be a Tuesday) and the importance of smooth fill for Monday puzzles, I stand by this decision, and though there aren’t a ton of bonuses here, I’m fond of SHOT TO HELL and some of the mid-length fill like U.S. NEWS and HANSEL (he’s so hot right now). I don’t have a lot to say as far as the clues go, but a few of mine I’m glad to see survive the edit are 49-Across, 9-Down, 31-Down and 56-Down. Though I’m not sure it will be particularly applicable to this puzzle, I like the inside nod in the clue that Will and Joel came up with for AHA. In any case it’s great to be back, and I hope (fingers crossed) that my puzzle will be a pleasant start to everyone’s week.

“We are not here to clip any one president’s wings, but to create a check on any future presidents,” Mr. Tillis said.

Mr. Tillis’s bill, in contrast, would allow for a judicial review process after a special counsel is fired. The attorney general would have to prove good cause for removal, and a panel of three federal judges would have 14 days to reach a decision. The bill was introduced with Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and a bipartisan pair of representatives have introduced parallel legislation in the House.

Mr. Mueller was appointed in May, after the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, and was given broad latitude to investigate Mr. Trump and his associates. But the statute under which he was appointed affords Mr. Mueller, or other future special counsels, few formal job protections. If he wished, Mr. Trump could order top Justice Department officials to fire Mr. Mueller.

Supporters of the Judiciary Committee measures repeatedly alluded on Tuesday to comments and actions made by Mr. Trump about the investigation that they said made their work necessary. Most saliently, in a late-July interview, Mr. Trump told The New York Times that Mr. Mueller’s team was rife with conflicts of interest and warned that investigators would be crossing a red line if they began to look at Trump family finances beyond any relationship to Russia.

Separating themselves from the Republicans, committee Democrats said those comments, and Mr. Trump’s repeated hostility toward investigators, made the need for action urgent.

“Simply put, I have strenuous concern about President Trump’s respect for the rule of law,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said in an opening statement. “The president must know that Congress will not stand idly by if he attempts to undermine independent criminal investigations.”

The committee’s chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, did not make his leanings toward the bills known, but he made clear in his opening statement that he saw an important role for Congress to oversee special counsel investigations.

The Judiciary Committee is one of several congressional committees investigating Mr. Trump’s links to Russia. The committee’s particular interest stems from Mr. Comey’s firing, but it has outlined a broad investigation into several other matters, from the Obama Justice Department’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email case to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.

Tuesday’s discussion frequently returned to a 1988 Supreme Court case that weighed the constitutionality of the now-expired independent counsel statute, put in place after the Watergate scandal. In the ruling, the court voted 7 to 1 that the counsel statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine and was therefore lawful.

But the decision came with a powerful dissent from Justice Antonin Scalia, which in the years since has gained a widespread following.

Independent counsels, such as Kenneth W. Starr, had considerably broader powers and more latitude than today’s special counsels, but the constitutional scholars and members of the committee repeatedly used the decision and the dissent to make arguments for and against the constitutionality of the proposed protection bills.

Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, both Republicans, appeared most skeptical that the bills were constitutionally supportable.

“The overriding concern I have whenever we are talking about this area is that bad things happen when we depart from the three-branch structure of the federal government,” Mr. Lee said.

And so when I see so many Republicans defend Mr. Trump regardless of his actions — invoking defenses that I am certain would enrage them if champions of a President Hillary Clinton had said the same things on her behalf — I’m convinced we’re seeing a severe case of confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one’s existing beliefs.

But here’s the thing: What’s easy to see in others is hard to see in ourselves. I can assure myself that my intellectual integrity is superior to theirs, yet in my honest moments I recognize that I struggle with these same human frailties and flaws.

I have some of the same mental habits that I’m critical of in others.

I know it’s a struggle for me to see Mr. Trump, whom I consider to be malicious, in a disinterested way.

I’m simply saying that for me to see Mr. Trump from a distance, dispassionately, is impossible. So my views of him, even if they are basically accurate, are also incomplete and probably distorted.

Another example: the Iraq war. When I served in the George W. Bush White House, I believed before the war began that it was justified — that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, that he was a particularly malevolent and destabilizing figure, and that it was a military conflict that would liberate an enslaved people.

These presuppositions caused me to ignore, much longer than I should have, the problems inherent in our occupation strategy. I didn’t question early enough the errors we made or how the situation was unraveling.

I recall a lunch in early 2006 with a journalist, George Packer, who had just returned from Iraq. A colleague and I, already worried about the course of the war, wanted to hear his firsthand account. What he described was so troubling that my head nearly dropped into my food. In ways I had not fully understood at the time, I had been filtering out information that ran counter to the narrative I believed. (To President Bush’s great credit, in 2007 — in the face of powerful political headwinds — he embraced the so-called surge strategy that turned the war around.)

I relay all this because confirmation bias is far more difficult to overcome than most of us like to admit. We are ever in search of data that confirms what we want to believe. “Illusion is the first of all pleasures,” Voltaire said.

We’re particularly tempted by delusions if they constitute bricks in the walls we have chosen to build and to live behind. We’re also learning that there is a physiological appeal to confirmation bias (processing information that supports our belief system triggers a dopamine rush) and that our brains are hard-wired to embrace or reject information that confirms or challenges our pre-existing attitudes. Our beliefs are also often tied up with our ideas about who we are individually and our group identity. The result is that changing our beliefs in light of new evidence can cause us to be rejected by our political community. No one likes being accused of disloyalty.

But being on the periphery of my party has given me a renewed appreciation for what Lord Tweedsmuir said. “While I believed in party government and in party loyalty,” he wrote, “I never attained to the happy partisan zeal of many of my friends, being painfully aware of my own and my party’s defects, and uneasily conscious of the merits of my opponent.” I’ve found through hard experience that the view can be clearer from the periphery than from the center of power.

Confirmation bias is deepening political polarization, which is already at record levels. Our political culture is sick and getting sicker, and confirmation bias is now a leading toxin.

It won’t be drained from our political bloodstream by conservatives lecturing liberals or vice versa. We have to begin with people in our own tribe, with people who have standing in our lives. We need to emphasize greater epistemological modesty on our side and greater appreciation for the perspectives of the other side. We have to look within and see ourselves and our limitations with fresh eyes.

To say that we all struggle with confirmation bias is not to say that some individuals don’t overcome it better than others or that some aren’t closer to seeing the truth of things better than others. Objective reality exists, truth matters, and we have to pursue them with purpose and without fear. But in our present moment, truth, including truth that unsettles us, has far too often become subordinate to justifying and defending at all costs our own, often unsound, preconceptions.

“Twitter is a wonderful thing for me, because I get the word out,” he said in a March interview with Fox News. “I might not be here talking to you right now as president if I didn’t have an honest way of getting the word out.”

But if the president’s tweets are the Digital Age version of quips at the Rose Garden podium, what then are we to make of the deletions?

The president regularly deletes tweets with typos and misspellings. Less frequently, but not unheard-of, are erasures that pertain to more significant topics. In March, he posted and deleted a tweet that read: “Meeting with Generals at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Very interesting!”

At least two government watchdog groups, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive, believe that when Mr. Trump deletes a tweet he may be breaking the law.

How would an unlimited right to carry weapons enhance public safety or confidence if you could walk into Milwaukee’s Miller Park with a handgun without any training or a permit? That would be a nightmare for law enforcement and frankly unsettling even for many ardent Second Amendment supporters.

But the national gun rights lobby pushed back hard, targeting me and a radio colleague who thought the idea defied common sense. The headline on one pro-gun website declared, “N.R.A. Calls Out Milwaukee Talk Show Hosts for Ignorant Stance on Right to Carry.”

Darren LaSorte, a former lobbyist for the N.R.A. Institute for Legislative Action, appeared on an internet broadcast, insisting that “it’s embarrassing to see them do that.” By suggesting that people learn to use a gun before carrying it out in public, he said, my colleague and I “probably did more harm to constitutional carry and the fight there than any other people out there, the anti-gunners or anyone else.”

N.R.A. members, he said, “should be actively hammering them.” Many of them did so, as my email overflowed with angry gun-rights activists demanding unfettered concealed carry. But when I opened up the phones to listeners, the response was quite different. As polls suggest, most gun owners take a far more reasonable stance than the gun lobby. My listeners overwhelmingly supported gun rights but thought that requirements for background checks, safety training and permits just made sense.

Despite a costly campaign that flooded legislators with emails and calls, the N.R.A. lost its bid for “constitutional carry” in Wisconsin. But the organization is back again this year, pushing ahead with a new effort to eliminate the licensing and training requirements for concealed carry here and elsewhere. And the N.R.A. remains on the offensive: 12 states allow concealed carry without a permit.

Since we beat the N.R.A. back six years ago, the political environment on guns has shifted quite a bit. President Trump seems to understand not only that the gun issue helped him win states like Michigan and Wisconsin but also that opposition to gun control has now become a central test of loyalty in our tribal politics.

This is what many of the N.R.A.’s critics have been slow to grasp: The N.R.A. has successfully taken the issue of rational gun regulation out of the policy realm and made it a central feature of the culture wars. The issue is no longer simply about bump stock, or assault weapons, or specific regulations, or public safety; the debate over guns has become a subset of the larger cultural clash that pits us against them — liberals versus “normal” Americans. As Kurt Schlichter, a conservative columnist, insisted last week, “Leftists hate our rights because they hate us.”

The N.R.A. has pursued that strategy relentlessly and with great effect. It was hardly a coincidence that it decided to wade into the controversy over N.F.L. players’ kneeling during the playing of the national anthem. The group put out a video called “We Stand,” which linked the themes of freedom, patriotism and guns. “I stand for the children, the spouses and parents whose family made the ultimate sacrifice for us,” the narrator says. “We are all standing. We are the National Rifle Association of America and we are freedom’s safest place.”

In a recent video starring Dana Loesch, a popular radio talk show host, the N.R.A. checked all the boxes of the culture wars. Featuring apocalyptic images of protests and violence, the spot targeted educational indoctrination in the schools, Hollywood leftism and liberal news media bias. “The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth,” Ms. Loesch declares.

The video was part of a larger strategy. Last fall, the N.R.A. started its own television news outlet, known as NRATV. As Adam Winkler, a law professor at U.C.L.A. and the author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,” notes, NRATV does not focus merely on guns. “Now it’s focused on immigration, race, health care,” he told The New Republic. “We’re seeing the N.R.A. become an extreme right-wing media outlet, not just a protector of guns.”

It’s actually more than that. The N.R.A. has effectively turned itself into the Id of the right. Despite the largely symbolic ban on bump stocks, the result is paralysis, both political and moral.

There was a time when the Republican Party could discuss possible reforms to our gun laws: Ronald Reagan himself endorsed the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban that passed in 1994. But today, no matter how horrified decent Republicans are by the carnage, they understand that any meaningful response is now impossible. In the face of unconscionable bloodshed, the party is forced again to argue that there is really no public policy response regarding guns, that there is nothing they can do, besides a largely tactical retreat that will allow the cycle of carnage and cowardice to repeat itself.","N.R.A. and G.O.P., Together Forever",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/opinion/sunday/nra-republicans-gun-lobby.html

SAN JUAN, P.R. — Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico discussed the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and the needs of island residents with a reporter from The New York Times on Tuesday. Here are his remarks, edited for length and clarity.

Q. What keeps you up at night?

A. The safety of the people of Puerto Rico. I haven’t slept much. It’s been very intense, but I am committed to making sure that during this emergency period we have our people safe, we can make sure they are alive, getting food and water. After we stabilize the situation, we can think about how to rebuild Puerto Rico.

Q. What’s your biggest worry?

A. Here’s my worry: the perception that this is just, for lack of a better term, this was a regular hurricane impact. This is a major catastrophic event here. Puerto Rico, within the span of two weeks, received two Category 4-5 hurricanes. That has never happened anywhere. The devastation has been enormous.

Q. Have you spoken to President Trump?

A. I have spoken to him at least five times. A few hours ago, I was in the Situation Room briefing him. He has been acting proactively. He issued two pre-landfall emergency declarations for Puerto Rico. That had never been done before. He declared Puerto Rico a disaster area practically while the storm was still hitting Puerto Rico.

Q. What do you tell him? The phones are down; the lines are around the streets and back; hospitals are closed. Where do you begin to tell him what you need?

A. There are several priorities. The health care situation, making sure we have hospitals running, making sure we have situational awareness of those hospitals.

We have fuel in Puerto Rico, the distribution has been a little slow. We have been hard pressed to find bus drivers; we are hard pressed to communicate with people. It’s been a little slower than expected.

Q. What happened to the drivers?

A. Several things. There has been severe devastation on many parts of the island. There are places still disconnected in terms of roads. People can’t get out of where they are at. If you happen to be a driver that was there, you can’t leave.

Second, and this is happening to all our government employees: There has been a reduced percentage of people who have reported. Some have reported to say, “Hey we’re stuck, we can’t leave.” So those are the reasons. We are finding more of them. Things are moving.

Again, the anxiety builds because people feel there is no fuel, when there is. And we made some progress there: 48 hours ago, we had 181 gas stations open, and now we have 450.

Q. How many are there total?

A. 1,100

Q. For there to be this level of a communication failure, was there a failure of some kind, was it an inevitable act of God and nobody’s fault, or was there a problem somewhere?

A. If we are going to talk about the root causes, our energy infrastructure had not been maintained properly for, you know, over a decade. We had a very, very weak energy infrastructure. I came in eight months ago, and one of our objectives was to go to the private sector and see how we can refurbish and renew this infrastructure.

Communications are essentially down. It affects essentially everything. In terms of some underlying problems that we had, sure, I would significantly point to a few: the power generation structure. It was old, it was unmaintained.

Vulnerable housing, houses made out of wood. They just didn’t stand a chance. They just didn’t stand a chance. That’s why our efforts five days before the storm was, “Hey, if you are in a flooded area, or in wooden housing, or mudslide region, get out or you will lose your life.”

Q. How is it that there are hospitals without generators and satellite phones?

A. Most hospitals have generators; they ran out of fuel. What we are doing in terms of fuel is making sure it gets to hospitals.

Some capability of sat coms should be around the island. We didn’t have it. What we have been doing is, provisionally, I’ve been going personally and my team has been going personally to different sides of the island and handing over sat phones to the mayors so they can communicate.

But again, once the infrastructure collapsed, in terms of the energy grid, and because we had many obstacles in the roads, and some communities were essentially cut off, those things aggravate one another. There’s no communication, there’s no direct linking, and that’s why this became an enormous challenge.

Q. How long will it take to restore power?

A. It depends. Pockets will be restored earlier. There was severe devastation. To give you a sense, Irma came by, Irma shook the power grid. We had to revamp it. It took us about 10 days to get to 97 percent. Not one tower was harmed. I saw personally at least 30 towers, in pieces, collapsed. This is completely different. We are going to need generators.

Q. Are you pleased with the pace of aid, the relief?

A. Here’s the thing, and I want to be very clear with this. I am very pleased with the consideration the president has given to Puerto Rico. He has been on top of it, at least personally in communication with me and communication with some of our officials as well as his officials. However we still need more, and the president understands that, and his team understands that.

Because it was an unprecedented event, on an island, that’s something needs to be considered. This is not a Category 3 hurricane going to Florida, causing severe devastation but also having the access of people in Georgia, New York and so forth driving down and giving you the resources. We have to actually bring them down by boats or airplanes. And adding to that, air traffic control has been clogged. We are working at about a 20 percent clip. With that 20 percent, when we notified the administration, they took action quickly, they opened alternative airports that would alleviate the need for more resources to come to San Juan.

Q. You were tough yesterday in your words and suggested Puerto Ricans were being treated as second-class citizens. Presumably you meant in comparison to Texas and Florida, which were recently hit by storms.

A. I was [giving] a warning essentially to Congress, to take action. I wanted to make sure, and I think that message got across, that people know [our] people are U.S. citizens.

Q. I’ve had people on social media tell me that they hoped Puerto Ricans would not be able to come to the United States, because we’ve already met the 50,000 refugee cap.

A. So this is why there needs to be some orientation on this front, which is one of the reasons that the federal government also needs to act. If it doesn’t act, one of the outcomes is a massive exodus of Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, and can fly in and fly out without any sort of paperwork, they just need to buy a plane ticket. That will cause deep demographic turmoil for us here in Puerto Rico and it will cause deep demographic turmoil in the states where they go as well.

Q. You talked about a humanitarian crisis. Are you worried about disease?

A. My words yesterday were to warn about a possible humanitarian crisis. We don’t want the United States to have a humanitarian crisis, and it could happen here in Puerto Rico.",What Keeps Puerto Rico’s Governor Awake at Night,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/governor-puerto-rico-rossello-hurricane.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Belarus produces top-level technical talent, an inheritance from its Soviet past, said Arkady M. Dobkin, who immigrated to the United States in the 1990s and established a software company there.

Today, Mr. Dobkin is the chief executive of EPAM, which does programing for the world’s leading tech companies and is considered one of the fastest-growing public tech companies in the world.

EPAM’s headquarters is in Newtown, Pa., but its main development hub is in Minsk, where more than 6,000 of its technology specialists work.

“I think it was the absence of oil that made Belarus do this,” said Mr. Dobkin, 57. “Here, universities produce more highly qualified specialists than the internal market needs.”

Many locals say the government’s talk about growing as a tech hub is a comfortable distraction in a country that heavily depends on Russia for cut-rate fuel and political patronage.

Sergei Chaly, an outspoken economist and former government official, calls Belarus “a dying country with bitcoins.”

Yevgeny Lipkovich, a popular blogger who made a career out of ridiculing Belarusian bureaucrats, said the only reason the tech industry had found some success in Belarus is that the government “cannot seize people’s brains.” He joked, “If they want to capture an IT company, what would they get, computers?”

Politics doesn’t seem a big concern for many in the tech crowd, even if young political activists use group chats on the call and messaging app Viber — an Israeli company whose development hub is in Minsk — to coordinate activities and plan rallies.

He visibly swelled with self-satisfaction, as he did weeks later, down in Alabama, celebrating the insurgent Senate candidacy of Roy Moore.

Was Moore’s appeal to Bannon the fact that as recently as last December, he was still promoting the lie that Barack Obama was born abroad? Was it his freak-out over homosexuality, which he has likened to bestiality? Or was it the overarching reality that Moore, like Grimm, makes Republican congressional leaders’ skin crawl? For Bannon, Moore is an instrument of torture, and after he won the Republican primary less than two weeks ago, Bannon and his allies made clear that the scheming and dark fun had only just begun.

In Mississippi they’re trying to persuade Chris McDaniel to wage a Republican primary battle against Senator Roger Wicker, an incumbent up for re-election next year. I’m not entirely sure what Wicker’s crimes against populism are, but I can tell you a bit about McDaniel, who’s a real charmer. After the Women’s March in late January, he wrote a Facebook post that asked: “If they can afford all those piercings, tattoos, body paintings, signs and plane tickets, then why do they want us to pay for their birth control?” Their birth control? There’s some male involvement in unwanted pregnancies and some male investment in preventing them, especially if the male, like McDaniel, is assertively anti-abortion.

On a radio show that he once hosted, McDaniel mocked the idea of learning any Spanish by volunteering his own translations of “mamacita.” “I think it basically means, ‘Hey, hot mama,’ ” he said. “Or, you know, ‘You’re a fine-looking young thing.’ ” He’s a nasty-sounding old thing, which is another way of saying that he’s catnip to the likes of Bannon.

Other Republicans in the Senate who are up for re-election, on Bannon’s hit list and in serious danger of defeat in their primaries include Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Their colleague Bob Corker of Tennessee pre-empted that kind of ordeal by deciding to retire at the end of this term, and Tennessee’s Republican governor, Bill Haslam, resisted entreaties to enter the race and tussle with furious Bannonites.

And so the G.O.P., hardly a paragon of sanity over recent years, is looking loonier than ever. “The formula is to be more aggressive, more outrageous, don’t back down from crazy statements,” one longtime Republican strategist told me. He’s aghast at the fault lines that he sees opening, for instance between Republicans with an appropriate wariness toward Trump and those who demand unwavering fealty to him.

The latter camp includes Nick Ayers, who is Mike Pence’s chief of staff. According to an audiotape obtained by Politico, he recently urged major Republican donors to “purge” Trump-bucking lawmakers by denying them any money and instead funding Republican challengers.

For Democrats aiming to capture the Senate and House majorities, this is in one sense great news. Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes elections for The Cook Political Report, told me that “Republicans’ two toughest Senate races — Nevada and Arizona — are winnable with the incumbents but are going to be very, very rough if the Bannon-backed candidates are the nominees.”

In addition, Duffy said, “You look at Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi — nominating the wrong candidate could potentially put those races in play for Democrats.”

So is Bannon miscalculating horribly and simply out of his gourd? No. He’s not thinking in the conventional terms of Republicans versus Democrats; he’s thinking that “any disruption is a good thing, and that the best way to get what he wants — a white-centered, nationalist America — is to blow up the establishment,” the Republican strategist said. Other Republican operatives concurred.

If Bannon can bend the G.O.P. in its current form to that vision, great. If he can’t, then he might as well destroy it to make room for something else. If Democrats grab the reins of power in the meantime, so be it. He’ll sow and enjoy as much mayhem as he can along the way, and somehow deems that preferable to the status quo.

Moore, McDaniel and Grimm aren’t perfect ideological companions, but they’re chaos candidates, and if they manage to get to Congress and the G.O.P. maintains its majorities there, heaven help us all. Just think about what they’ll inject into the formal debate on Capitol Hill; just think about how much further they’ll warp it. It could make the Tea Party’s ascent in 2010 seem tame.

Think about this, too: Moore was twice removed as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for failing to abide by federal orders. When they came into conflict with his conscience, meaning his extremely conservative interpretation of Christianity, he prioritized the latter. You could call that a triumph of principle. You could also call it a collapse of civic responsibility and respect for the system.

In a separate email, Mr. Maerov, who declined to comment on Saturday, said that “publishing pictures of victims in friendly poses with Harvey will backfire as it suggests they are exculpatory or negate any harm done to them through alleged actions.”

Bob Weinstein wrote Ms. Bloom a disapproving email on Friday morning, shortly before she appeared on “Good Morning America.” He pointed out that Democratic politicians were giving away money that Mr. Weinstein had donated to them, women’s rights organizations were calling for him to be fired and actors and actresses were openly stating how appalled they were. “It is my opinion, that u are giving your client poor counsel,” he wrote. “Perhaps, Harvey as he stated in the NY Times, to the world, should get professional help for a problem that really exists.”

Bob Weinstein declined to comment on Saturday.

The details about the emails came to light one day after a third of the all-male board of the Weinstein Company resigned. The remaining board members announced on Friday that they had hired an outside law firm to investigate the allegations and that Mr. Weinstein would take an indefinite leave of absence.

“I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein,” Ms. Bloom said on Twitter on Saturday morning. “My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.”

Ms. Bloom said on Saturday that there was a large team handling Mr. Weinstein’s defense and that she personally “did not release photos of accusers” to the press. She also denied that her work with Mr. Weinstein created a conflict of interest.

“A conflict is representing two different sides in the same case,” she said. “This is a difficult time for all involved and I wish everyone the best.”

Lanny Davis, another adviser to Mr. Weinstein, is also no longer representing him, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Davis, a lawyer and crisis counselor who served as special counsel to President Bill Clinton, declined on Saturday to discuss his departure. But he and Mr. Weinstein had disagreed over how to handle the sexual harassment allegations, with Mr. Davis advising a more conciliatory tone and approach than Mr. Weinstein seemed willing to adopt.

The allegations of harassment against Mr. Weinstein reach back decades. Women accused him of requesting massages, appearing naked in front of them and asking if they wanted to watch him shower, among other behaviors. The Times investigation found that Mr. Weinstein had settled with at least eight women over the years.

Mr. Weinstein apologized for his behavior and acknowledged that it had “caused a lot of pain.” But he denied many of the allegations and said he intended to sue The Times for failing to give him enough time to respond to them.

Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said that Mr. Weinstein had had two days to respond before the article was published, and that his full statement had been included. “Mr. Weinstein and his lawyer have confirmed the essential points of the story,” she said. “They have not pointed to any errors or challenged any facts in our story.”

In a statement on Friday, four of the Weinstein Company’s remaining board members said that Mr. Weinstein’s leave of absence would begin immediately. The company will be led in his absence by Bob Weinstein, its co-chairman, and David Glasser, its president and chief operating officer.

“As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,” the statement said. “Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board’s independent investigation, and Harvey’s own personal decisions.”

Ms. Bloom, who had been advising Mr. Weinstein over the past year on gender and power dynamics, said on “Good Morning America” that his behavior had been inappropriate. She agreed with an interviewer who characterized his reported actions as illegal.

“It’s gross, yeah,” Ms. Bloom said. “I’m working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful, who says, you know, ‘I have caused a lot of pain.’”

She had previously described Mr. Weinstein as “an old dinosaur learning new ways.”

Ms. Bloom has in the past represented women who brought sexual harassment claims against the actor Bill Cosby and the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. Her work for Mr. Weinstein drew criticism, including from her mother, Gloria Allred, the famed women’s rights lawyer.

“Had I been asked by Mr. Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment,” Ms. Allred said. “While I would not represent Mr. Weinstein, I would consider representing anyone who accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, even if it meant that my daughter was the opposing counsel.”

This year, the Weinstein Company said that it planned to work on a series of television and film projects about the life of Trayvon Martin, based on a pair of books about the teenager. One of the books, “Suspicion Nation,” was written by Ms. Bloom, who announced in April that it would be turned into a mini-series.

After the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were revealed, actresses and others in Hollywood spoke out against him and expressed support for his accusers. They were joined Saturday morning by the MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, who said on Twitter that she was considering walking away from a three-book deal with Weinstein Books.

“I can’t go forward with those books unless Harvey resigns,” she said, adding, “Authors, actors, and moviemakers should not work for any Weinstein company until he resigns. Not a close call.”

President Trump, who himself has been accused of making unwelcome advances toward women, also commented on the matter. Asked about the allegations on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had known Mr. Weinstein “for a long time,” adding, “I’m not at all surprised to see it.”","Lisa Bloom, Lawyer Advising Harvey Weinstein, Resigns Amid Criticism From Board Members",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/lisa-bloom-weinstein-attorney.html

Diplomats and their underlings have brokered deals for weapons and drugs, and more mundane products like machine tools and cows. They have also smuggled liquor, cigarettes, luxury cars and anything else that can be imported duty free and then sold at a gain.

“My late father-in-law was an ambassador,” said Marcus Noland, who studies North Korea and is executive vice president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, “and he told me that in India, years ago, it was known within the diplomatic corps that if you wanted to buy beef, you could knock on the backdoor of the North Korean embassy in Delhi. They ran an abattoir in the basement.”

Earning money is a necessity for the embassies — North Korea doesn’t fund them. Instead, they are expected to support themselves and send home any surplus.

Despite the sanctions it is under, North Korea did $6.5 billion in trade last year. Analysts estimate that embassy revenues represent a small sum compared with the country’s other low-profile foreign ventures.

Those included cadres of bodyguards leased to dictators who don’t trust their own citizens, laborers dispatched to work sites around the world who must remit their wages and state-owned companies that export ballistic missiles and other arms to countries like Syria.

In some cases, diplomats get involved with weapons deals. The third private secretary of the North Korean embassy in Beijing doubled as an employee of the Haegeumgang Trading Company. The company, according to a United Nations report, supplied surface-to-air missiles and radar systems to Mozambique. Haegeumgang also sold machine tools, and an ad in 2014 for those products on a Chinese website listed the company headquarters at the same address as the North Korean embassy in Beijing.

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to faxed questions.

Diplomats for the country have been ad hoc entrepreneurs since at least 1976. That year, Norway’s police found through surveillance that every member of the North Korean embassy in Oslo was involved in the import and sale of as many as 10,000 bottles of spirits and 100,000 cigarettes.

Today, sanctions have forced many embassies to curb their ambitions, with some intent on keeping the lowest possible profile.

The North Korean embassy in London sits unobtrusively in Ealing, a suburb-like section of London, just another brick house in a row of them. The difference is a small sign, barely visible from outside the wrought iron fence: “Residence and office, embassy of D.P.R. Korea.”

Aside from black luxury sedans in the driveway, there are rarely signs of life in the building, even to neighbors.

“I’ve never seen anyone go in or out of there,” said Ali Wiseman, a student who lives in a group house two doors down. “And I’ve been here a year.”

His roommate, Rupert Thomson, has seen people there. “I once saw three women working on the lawn out front and they did everything to not look at me,” he said.

The way that the London embassy sustains itself is a mystery. One theory comes from Kim Joo-il, a former member of the North Korean military who defected and moved to London in 2007. He said he often saw embassy employees at a type of Sunday flea market called a car-boot sale.

“They are always there buying secondhand electronics, toys, dolls, kitchen goods,” Mr. Kim said through an interpreter, seated at a restaurant he owns in a London suburb. “Some of these things they are cleaning up and fixing to resell, others they are sending home to North Korea.”

North Korean embassies in the former eastern bloc, where the missions were long ago granted generous square footage, have a more lucrative stratagem.

In Poland, 40 businesses are listed at the address of the North Korean embassy in Warsaw, including a pharmaceutical company, several advertising agencies and a yacht club. How many of these businesses are actually staffed there is unclear.

In Sofia, the embassy owns a number of buildings on two separate properties. One is a complex that includes the embassy itself. Passers-by can pause at a glass display case — standard issue for embassies in the city — filled with photographs. One captures the Supreme Leader beaming at a crowd, others were of missiles that had just been launched.

The event space, known as Terra Residence, is a 15-minute walk east. It’s the former home of the North Korean ambassador, built in the 1980s with dazzle instead of comfort in mind. Photos on Terra’s promotional website show an interior that is essentially a communist take on Versailles — a series of huge and austere halls with chandeliers, gold curtains and paintings of ballerinas.

Terra rents out the space for magazine photo sessions, music videos and television ads, including a handful for national banks and one for the Bulgarian version of “Celebrity Apprentice.” Its main business is weddings, proms and corporate events.

Few attendees, it seems, realize they are spending the evening on North Korean property.

“I knew it was a former embassy building, but I had no idea it was owned by North Korea,” said Bilyana Dimitrova, who attended a friend’s wedding at Terra in September. “The atmosphere was very pleasant.”

A spokeswoman for Terra, Anelia Baklova, wrote in an email that the company has had a long-term lease with the embassy of North Korea that predates the imposition of economic sanctions. When the U.N. approved stricter sanctions, this year and last, Terra “froze” its payments, she said. The company has not been evicted, she wrote, because of the “considerable amount of money” it had spent on renovations and upkeep.

Emails to the embassy were not returned.

Some countries have succeeded in shutting down businesses that rent from North Korea. In May, Germany closed a youth hostel that was operating in what was originally North Korean diplomatic quarters.

The governments of Poland and Bulgaria have so far been unable to end the ancillary activities. A spokesman for the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had repeatedly raised the issue of renting out space with North Korean officials here, urging them to “use properties in Sofia solely for diplomatic and consular activities.”

Terra, unlike its landlord, has tried to become a more agreeable neighbor. People who live across the street say that notices are now taped on the doors of their apartment building a day before there will be fireworks, giving a heads up and promising that the show will end by 10 p.m.

Surprisingly, residents didn’t seem particularly vexed about living near an enterprise that has pumped money into the world’s most repressive and notorious regime. But that may say more about Bulgaria’s government than the dangers of North Korea.

• China’s slowing economy has opened the door to “business cults” — essentially pyramid schemes that have lured in tens of millions of people with promises of riches or advancement.

Despite a crackdown that began last month, after a 23-year-old college graduate was found dead in Tianjin, the government has warned that the schemes are spreading faster and growing larger. Above, suspected members of one scheme detained in Guangxi province in June.

For the authorities, a key concern is the intense loyalty some groups inspire, which could threaten the Communist Party’s own grip on society.

• Western Australia is in the throes of a methamphetamine epidemic, fueled by the wages of the masses of bored, isolated men drawn to booming mineral mines.

The increasing use of stronger and more addictive crystal meth, or ice, has driven a sharp rise in deaths. The state has responded with stepped-up interdiction and increased prison terms, but also rehabilitation programs, like the one above in Perth.

• Yingluck Shinawatra, Thailand’s former prime minister, can appeal the five-year prison sentence the Supreme Court handed down on Wednesday. She was convicted of mismanaging a rice-subsidy program for farmers.

But she must be physically present in court to do so — and since she fled the country last month, her whereabouts remain unknown.

• India’s tolerance for stray dogs has been on particular display in Mumbai, where the rich lavish them with attention and even the poorest spare them food.

When a few ducked into a river and came out with blue coats, residents quickly traced the reason: a business that dumped blue dye. Luckily, it rapidly fades.

Early this morning at Confucius temples across Taiwan, robed officials performed elaborate ceremonies. The reason: Teacher’s Day, a day of honors for those who impart knowledge on what is believed to be the 2,567th birthday of Confucius, the ancient Chinese sage.

Many other countries designate a special day to celebrate the teaching profession. India commemorates the birthday of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher and the country’s president in the 1960s.

The U.S. celebrates National Teacher Appreciation Week in May.

Many countries have their Teacher’s Day next Thursday, thanks to a global effort started in 1994 by Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, meant to spread respect for the profession.

The world body says that teachers remain underappreciated: “Strangely one of the most central, vital professionals to society does not receive the respect it deserves in some parts of the world.”

So here’s a timeless essay by an American teacher with tips on how to thank a teacher. The gesture won’t be forgotten, she wrote.

Fifty-two United States diplomats and other citizens had been taken captive five months earlier under a new Iranian theocracy hostile to America.
Even Israeli forces have lost their post-Entebbe glow, with blemished missions in Lebanon and Gaza that led to their own men and innocent civilians being killed.
“These guys truly are amazing warriors,” Russell D. Howard, a retired brigadier general who was a special forces commander, told The Cipher Brief, a website focused on security issues.
“In my day, it cost an average of $1 million to train a special forces soldier.","But in a stunning operation that began late on July 3, 1976, Israeli commandos swooped in. They killed the hijackers and dozens of Ugandan soldiers, gathered the hostages and flew them to safety. The raid was carried out with near perfection, though it cost the lives of four hostages and of the commando leader, Lt. Col. Yonatan Netanyahu, the older brother of the current Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

A new era in counterterrorism had dawned. Joshua Shani, a retired Israeli brigadier general, was there, having flown the first C-130 Hercules cargo plane to land at Entebbe. He told Retro Report: “It was like the whole world say, ‘Wow, they have chutzpah, these guys. They are damn good.’”

They were so good that the United States tried something similar in April 1980 to end a hostage crisis in Iran that traumatized this country. Fifty-two United States diplomats and other citizens had been taken captive five months earlier under a new Iranian theocracy hostile to America. From the get-go, this rescue mission, code-named Eagle Claw, would not be an easy assignment for a Delta Force commando unit still in its infancy. “The only difference between this and the Alamo is Davy Crockett didn’t have to fight his way in,” said Mr. Ishimoto, who was an intelligence officer on the Delta Force raid.

Almost everything that could have gone wrong did. Two American helicopters were disabled by severe dust storms over Iran. Separately, a third one broke down. Still another crashed into a tanker aircraft; eight servicemen were killed. It was a disaster that left America humiliated — and left the hostages stuck for nine more months.

But failure can be a powerful teacher. Eagle Claw was. What emerged within a few years was a well-trained, disciplined force of special operators groomed for counterterrorism, hostage rescue and other demanding missions. The force today is perhaps 10 times as big as it was in 1980, when its numbers, Mr. Ishimoto said, were between 6,000 and 8,000. As for successes, one need look no further than the 2011 SEALs raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed.

With Americans weary of war without end since Sept. 11, 2001, President Obama withdrew most conventional soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. At the same time, he turned the Joint Special Operations Command into a dray horse. Its members are just about everywhere: Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, Pakistan, you name it. Their impact can be deadly. But their footprint is lighter, and less costly, than that of a fully decked-out Army operation.

This commando force plainly appeals to Mr. Trump, who has shown scant faith in “soft power,” the use of diplomacy and humanitarian example to win friends and influence nations. His budget proposals have included many billions more for the Defense Department and billions less for the State Department and the Agency for International Development. In his first half-year in office, military special operators were sent on about five times as many lethal missions in what for the United States are non-battlefield countries — Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia — as there had been during Mr. Obama’s final six months.

Relying on them so heavily has a price. Though they make up roughly 5 percent of the total armed forces, they have accounted for at least half of the nation’s combat deaths since 2015. The risks were evident mere days into the Trump presidency when a member of the SEALs was killed on a flawed night mission in Yemen that also left more than a dozen civilians dead.

It’s easy to romanticize commandos. Just ask any Hollywood director. But they are not supermen. Even Israeli forces have lost their post-Entebbe glow, with blemished missions in Lebanon and Gaza that led to their own men and innocent civilians being killed.

Some military experts worry that even though the American teams also have chutzpah and are damn good, they are being asked to do too much too often. “These guys truly are amazing warriors,” Russell D. Howard, a retired brigadier general who was a special forces commander, told The Cipher Brief, a website focused on security issues. “But they’re more than that. They’re smart, flexible, adaptable and unafraid.” The problem, General Howard said, is that “the guys are still deployed all the time.”

“These guys are a national treasure,” he said. “In my day, it cost an average of $1 million to train a special forces soldier. Now it probably costs closer to $1.5 million, and you don’t waste that asset. You use them judiciously when you really need them.”",Special Ops Forces: How Elite Forces Became Military Muscle,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/special-ops-retro.html

For better and worse, some stand-ups are now treated like political oracles on social media. And during times of tragedy, late night talk show hosts regularly deliver solemn monologues. The day before I interviewed Ms. Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel unleashed a scathing broadside against the Graham-Cassidy health care bill that dominated the conversation about the legislation the next morning.

While Ms. Silverman is avoiding that kind of argumentative tactic in her own show, she saw his success as supporting her views about change. “He was not a political person at all until it affected his life,” she said of Mr. Kimmel, referring to his son, who was born in April with a heart ailment. (Mr. Kimmel and Ms. Silverman once dated.) “Sometimes, it takes a personal experience to get woke to things.”

Ms. Silverman, tall and poised, has a warm presence, listening to questions as intently as she answers them. She sometimes shifts between plain-spoken, even folksy slang and her old kewpie doll voice, code-switching between savvy and silly, gimlet-eyed and wide-eyed.

She grew up in Bedford, N.H., in one of few Jewish families in her neighborhood. Her mother ran a community theater and her father inherited the family clothing business, passing along his sense of humor. When Ms. Silverman was a toddler, he taught her how to say a string of curse words. “She’d sit on his lap — short black bangs, adorable round face — and say this, and we’d all laugh,” recalled her older sister Susan Silverman.

Ms. Silverman, whose childhood bedroom ceiling had “I love Steve Martin” written on it, was a comedy prodigy. She told jokes onstage for the first time at 15, and dropped out of college after freshman year at New York University to work clubs; by 22 she joined the cast of “Saturday Night Live.” She lasted only a year, but sketch comedy and sitcoms were never the goal. “She was the rare stand-up back then who didn’t see it as a means,” said Sam Seder, who directed Ms. Silverman in her first film, “Who’s the Caboose?” “Stand-up was the end.”

When asked about her ambition in her first years of New York comedy, she said she wanted to sleep with everyone. “I was so excited about sex once I had it, and I lost my virginity to a comedian, so it was like in front of everyone,” she said. “I was attracted to funny people.” She speaks fondly of her formative days in New York clubs, but also said she now realizes what a “misogynistic culture” she dwelled in.

“I was told: You’re only a real comedian if your material can be said by a male comedian and it still worked,” she said, with exasperation. “I bought that. Looking back, it’s mind-blowing. I accepted talking about the female experience as hack.”

Ms. Silverman eventually pushed past that attitude, telling jokes about sex and dating whose innocent affect belied what she was really saying. Mr. Seder, who dated her in the early 1990s, recalls traveling to New Hampshire with her to perform a benefit given by her mother. On stage Ms. Silverman told a story about how in the middle of licking jelly off her boyfriend’s penis, she realized: “Oh my god, I’m turning into my mother.”

Photo

“I couldn’t believe she did that joke, not just in front of her mother, but her entire world,” Mr. Seder said. “But they laughed.”

Over the next decade, Ms. Silverman developed a reputation as a sharp joke writer and performer, but she burst on the national scene in 2001 after saying a racial slur for Chinese people on “Late Night With Conan O’Brien” that drew condemnation and an apology from the talk show. She debated Guy Aoki, of the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans, on “Politically Incorrect.” “That whole Conan controversy made me famous,” she said. “I’m not proud of it but I have to admit it.”

In 2005, Ms. Silverman had a major breakthrough with “Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic,” an influential Off Broadway show turned feature film where she made elegantly crafted jokes in the voice of a naïvely offensive Jewish woman. Building jokes about rape, the Holocaust, AIDS and race, she used what she calls her “unreliable narrator” character to distance herself from her material.

She received many glowing reviews, but a critique from A.O. Scott in The New York Times made her take a hard look at her act. It argued that her kind of ironic, transgressive humor flatters herself and her audience, playing it safe. “Looking back now, I was playing an ignorant character, but I also really was ignorant,” she said. “When A.O. Scott wrote that, it hit me hard. I just felt like it opened up my mind like a good hallucinogeni …”

Ms. Silverman paused, made a bewildered face and repeated the word “hallucinogenic” several times with slightly different pronunciations, tilting her head in a pantomime of confusion. Twice during the interview, she flamboyantly searched for the right way to say a word; she did it once in her test show, turning it into a self-deprecating verbal pratfall.

“I Love You, America” marries a long-running interest in scatological humor and stomping on taboos with a new, more politically conscious voice. In a video segment where she spends time with a family who never met a Jew before, she bonds with their young boy with the great unifier: a fart joke.

Unlike many veteran comics, Ms. Silverman does not lament that political correctness is ruining comedy, saying she no longer uses words like “retard”; on her test show, she brought up “micro-aggressions.”

“If you’re so scared of changing with the times, then you’re old,” she said. “There are comedians I love to pieces who roll their eyes. ‘Oh, another word I can’t say.’ You don’t know enough words?”

The presidential election was clearly a turning point for Ms. Silverman. On the night Donald J. Trump won, Ms. Silverman was walking her dog when her sister called. “She was sobbing, beside herself, like her guts were coming out,” Susan Silverman said, “but in that conversation, she said we have to start listening to each other and can’t go on like this in our own echo chambers.”

Ms. Silverman’s attitudes about ambition have changed too. She said she now puts her career first, adding that while she loves her current boyfriend — the British actor Michael Sheen — the relationship works because he lives an ocean away. “I’ve watched myself over many years give up a lot of things because I’m in relationships,” she said, describing herself as “oddly subservient” in romance. “I’m older now and I don’t want to do that. I want to make stuff that matters and put my whole self into it.”

Ms. Silverman has done more dramatic acting of late (see the current “Battle of the Sexes”) but after a few narrative pilots for television didn’t work out, she decided she wanted to try something closer to stand-up, a show where she plays herself, looks at the camera and talks to people who don’t necessarily agree with her. But it’s not easy.

She invited the conservative comic Dennis Miller to be a guest, but he turned her down. When she noticed that Ivanka Trump followed her on Twitter, she sent her a direct message, saying she has a chance to make a difference. No response, she said. (“I’ve given up on her since.”) And her forays into red state America for her show — she traveled to a small Texas town where President Trump won by 87 percent and spent a day with a family of Trump voters in a suburb outside New Orleans — have led to culture clashes.

In Louisiana, a female Trump voter complained that President Barack Obama gave away “handouts,” while her family talked about being on Medicaid. Ms. Silverman spends more time listening than fact-checking, which may not satisfy liberals who delight in seeing John Oliver or Samantha Bee eviscerate conservatives. At the same time, it’s hard to see Trump voters thinking this segment is for them either.

The most obviously commercial aspect of the show may be Ms. Silverman’s star power. A live-wire performer, she has a sly, teasing sensibility that has always been far too off-kilter to be blandly relatable. Whether she has enough room to roam will likely be crucial to the show’s success.

Reflecting on her interactions with the family in Louisiana, Ms. Silverman said that she had a good time and found agreement on some issues, like same-sex marriage. When asked if this visit made her more hopeful for change, Ms. Silverman weighed her words carefully. “What makes me hopeful is when you’re face to face you can still enjoy and respect each other,” she said. “Did we change minds? No.”

What’s important, she said, is accepting that you might not always be right. Years of therapy have helped her find the joy in realizing when she is wrong. “I am lucky because most people hate it,” she said. “I’ve dated guys who I love to death but they cannot say sorry. It would kill them to say sorry. To me, I love it. It makes the person I’m talking to feel so good. A total high.”

This was apparent in our interview when we disagreed over how to categorize “I Love You, America.” I saw it as a talk show. Ms. Silverman disagreed, associating that genre with topicality and a guest promoting projects. When I said it’s interesting that she resists the term, she responded sharply that it’s interesting that I want to pigeonhole the show. It was tense, but not for long.

She paused, than flashed a big smile. “O.K., I am a host,” she said. “I don’t care, whatever you want to call it.”

On the show, her guests are people who have undergone a change, and it’s clear that Ms. Silverman puts a premium on transformation (Megan Phelps-Roper, who left the Westboro Baptist Church, an ultraconservative group, will be a future guest).

巴黎——残破的滴水嘴兽和掉落的栏杆柱被塑料管和木板替代。飞扶壁因污染变暗，受雨水腐蚀。小尖塔要靠梁支撑，并用绑带做了固定。

对于每年前往巴黎圣母院那几百万瞠目结舌的游客来说，这些颓丧的迹象并不明显，很多人忙着赞叹精雕细琢的外表，没有注意它的破损与斑驳。

但是近日的一个下午，教堂发言人安德烈·菲诺(André Finot)介绍了建筑的破损情况。指尖轻轻一点，一块石灰岩就破了。

“被腐蚀的石材随处可见，风不断吹，这些零碎的东西不断往下掉，”在教堂屋顶的走道上，菲诺小心翼翼地跨过散落在地上的石块。“整个地方完全失控了。”

那次整修之前的几十年，此地疏于管理，且在法国大革命中遭到部分损毁，维克多·雨果的1831年小说《巴黎圣母院》给它带来了一些关注，其中就提到了建筑的破败状况。

The N.R.A. position made no sense from the standpoint of either public safety or politics. How would an unlimited right to carry weapons enhance public safety or confidence if you could walk into Milwaukee’s Miller Park with a handgun without any training or a permit? That would be a nightmare for law enforcement and frankly unsettling even for many ardent Second Amendment supporters.

But the national gun rights lobby pushed back hard, targeting me and a radio colleague who thought the idea defied common sense. The headline on one pro-gun website declared, “N.R.A. Calls Out Milwaukee Talk Show Hosts for Ignorant Stance on Right to Carry.”

Darren LaSorte, a former lobbyist for the N.R.A. Institute for Legislative Action, appeared on an internet broadcast, insisting that “it’s embarrassing to see them do that.” By suggesting that people learn to use a gun before carrying it out in public, he said, my colleague and I “probably did more harm to constitutional carry and the fight there than any other people out there, the anti-gunners or anyone else.”

N.R.A. members, he said, “should be actively hammering them.” Many of them did so, as my email overflowed with angry gun-rights activists demanding unfettered concealed carry. But when I opened up the phones to listeners, the response was quite different. As polls suggest, most gun owners take a far more reasonable stance than the gun lobby. My listeners overwhelmingly supported gun rights but thought that requirements for background checks, safety training and permits just made sense.

Despite a costly campaign that flooded legislators with emails and calls, the N.R.A. lost its bid for “constitutional carry” in Wisconsin. But the organization is back again this year, pushing ahead with a new effort to eliminate the licensing and training requirements for concealed carry here and elsewhere. And the N.R.A. remains on the offensive: 12 states allow concealed carry without a permit.

Since we beat the N.R.A. back six years ago, the political environment on guns has shifted quite a bit. President Trump seems to understand not only that the gun issue helped him win states like Michigan and Wisconsin but also that opposition to gun control has now become a central test of loyalty in our tribal politics.

This is what many of the N.R.A.’s critics have been slow to grasp: The N.R.A. has successfully taken the issue of rational gun regulation out of the policy realm and made it a central feature of the culture wars. The issue is no longer simply about bump stock, or assault weapons, or specific regulations, or public safety; the debate over guns has become a subset of the larger cultural clash that pits us against them — liberals versus “normal” Americans. As Kurt Schlichter, a conservative columnist, insisted last week, “Leftists hate our rights because they hate us.”

The N.R.A. has pursued that strategy relentlessly and with great effect. It was hardly a coincidence that it decided to wade into the controversy over N.F.L. players’ kneeling during the playing of the national anthem. The group put out a video called “We Stand,” which linked the themes of freedom, patriotism and guns. “I stand for the children, the spouses and parents whose family made the ultimate sacrifice for us,” the narrator says. “We are all standing. We are the National Rifle Association of America and we are freedom’s safest place.”

In a recent video starring Dana Loesch, a popular radio talk show host, the N.R.A. checked all the boxes of the culture wars. Featuring apocalyptic images of protests and violence, the spot targeted educational indoctrination in the schools, Hollywood leftism and liberal news media bias. “The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth,” Ms. Loesch declares.

The video was part of a larger strategy. Last fall, the N.R.A. started its own television news outlet, known as NRATV. As Adam Winkler, a law professor at U.C.L.A. and the author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,” notes, NRATV does not focus merely on guns. “Now it’s focused on immigration, race, health care,” he told The New Republic. “We’re seeing the N.R.A. become an extreme right-wing media outlet, not just a protector of guns.”

It’s actually more than that. The N.R.A. has effectively turned itself into the Id of the right. Despite the largely symbolic ban on bump stocks, the result is paralysis, both political and moral.

There was a time when the Republican Party could discuss possible reforms to our gun laws: Ronald Reagan himself endorsed the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban that passed in 1994. But today, no matter how horrified decent Republicans are by the carnage, they understand that any meaningful response is now impossible. In the face of unconscionable bloodshed, the party is forced again to argue that there is really no public policy response regarding guns, that there is nothing they can do, besides a largely tactical retreat that will allow the cycle of carnage and cowardice to repeat itself.","N.R.A. and G.O.P., Together Forever",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/opinion/sunday/nra-republicans-gun-lobby.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, representing state regulators, has long opposed association health plans, saying they are bad for consumers because they can operate outside some state consumer-protection laws. In addition, the state regulators said this year in a letter to Congress, proposals to allow such purchasing groups “could actually increase the cost of insurance for many small businesses whose employees are not members of an association health plan.”

But Mr. Trump has presented such plans as a potential solution for millions of Americans. He stated his intentions on Sept. 27 as he left the White House for a trip to Indiana.

“I am considering an executive order on associations, and that will take care of a tremendous number of people with regard to health care,” Mr. Trump said then. “I’ll probably be signing a very major executive order where people can go out, cross state lines, do lots of things, and buy their own health care. And that will be probably signed next week. It’s being finished now. It’s going to cover a lot of territory and a lot of people — millions of people.”

Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he had been working with the Trump administration to clear the way for association health plans, which he said would allow more people to obtain good coverage at a lower cost.

“The health care debate is not over,” Mr. Paul said. “Conservatives are still fighting for free-market reforms to the health care system. I am excited to be working with President Trump on this initiative.”

Since 2001, every nationwide election in Thailand has resulted in victories for Mr. Thaksin or political forces loyal to him. But judicial actions and a pair of army coups have unseated each of these governments.

Mr. Thaksin’s sister was removed from office in May 2014, after the Constitutional Court found her guilty of abuse of power. The same month, the army orchestrated its latest coup, one of a dozen successful putsches carried out since Thailand abandoned absolute monarchy in 1932.

Thailand’s politics are cleaved, roughly, between the rural poor, who have supported the populist policies of politicians aligned with Mr. Thaksin’s family, and a traditional ruling class that has dismissed the Shinawatra clan as corrupt, power-hungry and dangerously divisive.

A security crackdown on street protests by Mr. Thaksin’s supporters in 2010 resulted in more than 90 deaths in downtown Bangkok.

Since then, Thailand has experienced periods of martial law, and its economic growth has trailed that of other Southeast Asian nations. The country’s current Constitution, drafted under the oversight of a junta that calls itself the National Council for Peace and Order, curtails democratic institutions. It stipulates that the upper house of Thailand’s Parliament, for instance, is appointed, rather than elected.

The junta, led by Mr. Prayuth, has promised elections next year. But with Ms. Yingluck and her brother in self-imposed exile, and many in the top echelons of Pheu Thai sidelined by various legal rulings, it is unclear how effectively the party’s supporters will be able to campaign.

Last month, a former commerce minister who served in Ms. Yingluck’s cabinet was sentenced to 42 years in prison in connection with the rice program.

At the courthouse on Wednesday, some of Ms. Yingluck’s supporters sounded philosophical about both the verdict and the exile of the Shinawatra siblings.

“Maybe it is good that they both aren’t here, because now the other side can stop saying we are Shinawatra slaves,” said Rungrawee Chaloenpol, a market vendor, breaking down in tears. “Now we can fight for true democracy without having the Shinawatra name attached to us.”","Yingluck Shinawatra, Ex-Leader Who Fled Thailand, Gets 5-Year Sentence",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/asia/thailand-yingluck-sentence.html

Jurich met with members of the university’s board Wednesday morning but left after only five minutes. Pitino met with the trustees soon after Jurich. His meeting, too, was short; one reporter waiting outside noted that the driver of the vehicle that delivered Pitino did not turn off its engine while he was inside.

On Tuesday evening, Pitino denied any knowledge of, or responsibility for, the accusations detailed in the federal charges, saying in a statement: “These allegations come as a complete shock to me. If true, I agree with the U.S. Attorney’s Office that these third-party schemes, initiated by a few bad actors, operated to commit a fraud on the impacted universities and their basketball programs, including the University of Louisville.”

Pitino was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, recognition for a four-decade coaching career in college basketball and the N.B.A. With 770 wins over parts of 32 seasons, Pitino ranks 12th on the Division I career victories list — although that figure could change pending the appeal of the N.C.A.A. penalties announced in June. He is also the only college coach to win national titles with two different colleges, Kentucky and Louisville — although that distinction, too, could change if Louisville is forced to vacate its 2013 championship.

The reasons for the potential erasure of dozens of his wins at Louisville, and his second N.C.A.A. championship, are allegations, some of which Louisville has accepted, that a former basketball staff member who had played under Pitino hired prostitutes to entertain recruits and players in an on-campus dormitory.

While the N.C.A.A. has vacated victories and even Final Four appearances, it has never stripped a championship from the winner of its signature annual tournament.

While in that case the N.C.A.A. accepted Pitino’s explanation that he had no knowledge of the actions of the assistant found to be responsible, it nonetheless found that he had failed in his broader obligation to monitor his staff. Pitino and Louisville have disputed that conclusion, which led to his suspension, pending appeal, for the first five games of Atlantic Coast Conference play this season.

Tuesday’s federal charges, which also implicated the global marketing director for Adidas basketball, four assistant coaches at other Division I programs and several other men involved in college basketball, detailed a scheme to funnel money to two prospects in order to attend a university whose description matches Louisville, and of doing so with the knowledge of two unidentified coaches at the school. It was not clear whether the man the complaint calls Coach-2, who is characterized as having significant leverage at Adidas (which sponsors Louisville), is Pitino.

Born in New York City and raised on Long Island, Pitino never lost the thick accent he earned during a childhood in the region, and first made his name with an improbable Final Four run with Providence in 1987. His career also included less successful stints in the N.B.A., with the Knicks and the Boston Celtics.

Most notably, he revived the two beloved college programs in the Bluegrass State, first leading the University of Kentucky, starting in 1989, out of heavy N.C.A.A. sanctions and to three Final Fours, including the 1996 national title, and then leading the Cardinals to three Final Fours and another national title.

The fact that Pitino was not fired outright could be financial. Pitino, according to a USA Today database, is the nation’s highest paid college basketball coach, at more than $7.7 million a year, and his contract includes language that gives him 10 days to contest a firing for cause.

“They’re both highly talented and accomplished gentlemen,” Ms. Spear said. “They complement each other.”

Mr. Cox, the estate’s executor, declined to be interviewed for this article. But many have been unable to resist making a quick mental inventory of Mr. Bergé’s holdings: the paintings, the furniture, the libraries and the cash; an auction of his and Mr. Saint Laurent’s personal collection fetched hundreds of millions in 2009. (The interest Mr. Bergé held in the French daily Le Monde has already been divested.)

Those who pictured Mr. Cox shuttlingluxuriously among the homes Mr. Bergé kept in Paris, Normandy, St.-Rèmy-de-Provence, Marrakesh and Tangier will be disappointed, according to Quito Fierro, the chief administrative officer of the Jardin Majorelle Foundation. The foundation is a subsidiary of the Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent Foundation that operates, along with the museum in Marrakesh, the public Majorelle Garden and a museum of Berber culture there.

The vacation house Mr. Bergé built in Normandy was not his, Mr. Fierro said; he simply retained the right to use the house after selling it and Château Gabriel, on the same grounds, following Mr. Saint Laurent’s death.

And the other residences — including Villa Mabrouka in Tangier, which has been on and off the market in recent years with an asking price of around $10 million — will be sold to benefit the umbrella foundation, whose presidency has passed from Mr. Bergé to Mr. Cox, Mr. Fierro said.

No one should be worried about Mr. Cox’s housing, however. Villa Oasis, the lavish Orientalist fantasy where Mr. Bergé lived in Marrakesh, is part of the Majorelle Foundation, but is Mr. Cox’s in all but name, a perk that comes with the guardianship of Mr. Saint Laurent’s artistic legacy.

For all the clucking and tallying, Mr. Cox and Mr. Berge’s wedding was met with little more than a nod by those who track the movements of the forbidding and glamorous, if increasingly diminished, clan that surrounded Mr. Saint Laurent.

Christopher Gibbs, a neighbor in Tangier, where Mr. Cox has a residence of his own, called him “a saintly figure, which could not be said of Pierre.” Mr. Gibbs, a retired dealer in high-bohemian antiques who dressed the sets for the Mick Jagger film “Performance,” praised Mr. Cox for being “such a wonderful support to Pierre, through thick and thin, and for so many years. I weep for Madison having all this responsibility. It’s beyond the call of duty.”

Jane Kramer, in her takedown of Mr. Bergé in The New Yorker in 1994, put Mr. Bergé’s unsaintliness another way, writing, “He has a lugubrious, rather terrifying self-regard.” He appears “undisturbed by the tempering plain truths of self-reflection,” she wrote, noting that his wrath was “legendary.”

Mr. Bergé had more than one “L’Amour Fou” (crazy love), the name he gave the 2010 documentary about him and Mr. Saint Laurent. In published letters he wrote to Mr. Saint Laurent after the designer died, he made Mr. Cox’s place in the hierarchy of his heart clear.

“With you, Madison remains the most important relationship of my life.” He arrived “when alcohol and drugs had taken possession of you.”

“Thanks to Madison, probably, I weathered the storm,” Mr. Bergé continued. “He gave me what I needed: his youth, culture, courage, integrity, love.”

“I didn’t leave you,” Mr. Bergé went on to write. “I could have during this time with Madison, I almost did. Finally, it was he who’d had enough, who left.”

“You loved him, hated him, then loved him again.”

Maria Callas could not have sung the strangulated story of Mr. Bergé, Mr. Saint Laurent and Mr. Cox any better.

In 1976, nearly two decades after meeting, Mr. Bergé broke romantically from Mr. Saint Laurent. Still, jealousy and possessiveness ran high, and the men remained business partners.

Accounts of the Cox-Bergé introduction vary. Mr. Cox has placed it in Paris in 1978; Annabelle d’Huart, a jewelry designer and member of the old Saint Laurent tribe, puts their first meeting in New York a year earlier, when Mr. Cox was a student at Parsons. At the time, Mr. Bergé was involved with Joël Le Bon, who was in charge of the music for the Saint Laurent shows and worked for Interview magazine in Paris.

”I introduced Joël to Madison, they fell in love, and Madison followed Joël to Paris, transferring to Parsons there,” Ms. d’Huart said.

Mr. Bergé got to know Mr. Cox better during a trip they took with her and Mr. Le Bon. to the Aeolian Islands the following summer.

According to Mattia Bonetti, a furniture designer who knew Mr. Cox in Paris in the 1980s, “Madison was first with Joël, then Yves, then finally Pierre.”

After the holiday in the Aeolians, “Madison ascended quickly in the Saint Laurent clan,” Ms. d’Huart said. “Joël no longer measured up and was dropped. The clan was like a tank that rolled over you, then moved on, laughing loudly and shrugging, ‘Who cares?’ Joël died of AIDS, forgotten.”

Mr. Bonetti said that in the beginning, Mr. Cox and Mr. Bergé “saw each other, not in a hidden way, but separate from Yves, to avoid scenes.” Over dinner one night when Mr. Cox had stepped away from the table, Mr. Bonetti said Mr. Bergé asked him, “‘What do I have to do to keep him?’ I told him, ‘You have to give Madison everything, and I don’t mean materially, because otherwise he’s going to leave.’”

Mr. Bergé felt obliged to engage someone else for the garden at Gabriel, because of the tension that using Mr. Cox would have created with Mr. Saint Laurent. The job fell to a Louis Benech, who would later turn his hand to the Tuileries.

“I said to Pierre that I didn’t see the point of my working at Gabriel when he could hire his friend,” Mr. Benech recalled. “‘Too complicated,’” he said. “‘Period.’”

Peter Dunham, a decorator in Los Angeles, met Mr. Cox in Paris during his early years with Mr. Bergé. “Pierre really didn’t allow Madison to have friends,” Mr. Dunham said. “He lived a very controlled, gilded-cage existence.”

Jane Stubbs, an antiquarian bookseller, was commissioned by Mr. Bergé to create a Morocco-theme library for a guest room at Mabrouka. She remembered “arriving in Tangier with Madison and waiting at the luggage carousel. His phone rang. It was Pierre. ‘Where have you been? You were supposed to get in at 5:25.’ It was 5:27.”

The triangle collapsed during Christmas 1987, when, as Mr. Bergé wrote, Mr. Saint Laurent began hiding tumblers of whiskey from him behind the Jacques Grange taffeta curtains at Gabriel.

Mr. Cox retreated to New York, opening an office and remaking his life with Konstantin Kakanias, a cartoonist. Mr. Bergé took up with Robert Merloz, a young designer he backed with company money. Mr. Merloz’s collection flopped.

Christopher Mason, a musician and social chronicler, said that when Mr. Cox left him, “Pierre was flabbergasted. He couldn’t believe anyone would dare walk out on him.”

Mr. Cox also enjoyed, and was sometimes inconvenienced by, what might be called “amitiés amoureuses” (pararomantic friendships), with Ms. Stubbs and Marian McEvoy, the author of “Glue Gun Decor: How to Dress Up Your Home — from Pillows and Curtains to Sofas and Lampshades.”

Mr. Cox, with a B.F.A. in environmental design and an address book fortified by Mr. Bergé’s, has never lacked business. His clients include Michael Bloomberg, Marella Agnelli, Lauren Santo Domingo and Anne Bass, who let him loose on a thousand acres in Litchfield County, Conn.

At one point Nancy Novogrod, a former magazine editor, expressed interest in hiring Mr. Cox in Litchfield. But the message came back that he had given Ms. Bass an exclusive.","For Madison Cox, Widower of Pierre Bergé, C’est Compliqué",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/fashion/pierre-berge-madison-cox-yves-saint-laurent.html

After the “X Case” of 1992, in which a 14-year-old rape victim was prevented from traveling to Britain for an abortion, voters passed a constitutional amendment that left the ban intact but recognized a woman’s right to travel abroad. Another amendment, also passed in 1992, permitted Irish women to obtain information on abortion services overseas, which had been prohibited by the state.

Much of the impetus for the new constitutional effort stems from the case of Savita Halappanavar, 31, an Indian-born dentist who died of sepsis after miscarrying in a Galway hospital in 2012. Having learned that her 17-week-old fetus would not live, Ms. Halappanavr repeatedly asked the staff to terminate the pregnancy to relieve her own worsening condition. She was told that her pregnancy could not be terminated while the fetus had a heartbeat.

An inquiry determined that recent interpretations of the Eighth Amendment had found therapeutic terminations to be permissible, but the medical staff’s uncertainty over the law and the lack of clear legislation contributed to a delay in her treatment.

The case helped build momentum for a citizens’ constitutional assembly, which this year recommended that the Eighth Amendment be repealed or amended, and that legislation be introduced to allow abortion, effectively on request.

A number of social and economic factors have made contemporary Ireland a more liberal country that the one that passed the Eighth Amendment. Not least among these is an erosion in the status of the Roman Catholic Church, weakened by scandals over the sexual abuse of children and the treatment of marginalized women in bleak church-run laundries, where many died and were buried anonymously.

The 1983 campaign to ban abortion, backed by bishops and Catholic lay groups, represented the high-water mark for institutional Catholic power in Ireland, coming just four years after Pope John Paul II drew huge crowds in the first papal visit to the country. While a significant majority describe themselves as Catholic, few now adhere to the church’s teachings in matters like divorce, contraception, sex outside marriage or gay rights.

An Irish Times poll in May showed that large majorities supported legal changes allowing abortion in cases of rape or serious risk to the physical or mental health of the mother, but less than a quarter of people supported changes making it legal under all circumstances.

Leaders of the Repeal the Eight campaign are likely to be buoyed by another liberal constitutional effort, the 2015 referendum that legalized same-sex marriage, though the country’s well-organized anti-abortion activists will find much in the polls to encourage their own hopes.

Traditionally cautious, Ireland’s mainstream politicians may huddle as close as they can to the middle ground. Mr. Varadkar’s own position is somewhat ambiguous.
