BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Catalonia’s capital Barcelona on Sunday to express their opposition to declaring independence from Spain, showing how divided the region is on the issue.

A crowd estimated by local police to number 350,000 waved Spanish and Catalan flags and carried banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”. They poured into the city center after politicians on both sides hardened their positions in the country’s worst political crisis for decades.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Saturday he would not rule out removing Catalonia’s government and calling a fresh local election if it claimed independence, as well as suspending the wealthy region’s existing autonomous status.

The stark warning came days before Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the region’s parliament, on Tuesday, when he could unilaterally declare independence.

The anti-independence demonstration, which included Catalans and people from other parts of Spain, underlined how the dispute has riven the region itself, coming less than a month after a million people rallied in the same city to support independence.

“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said during Sunday’s rally. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.”

The northeastern region of 7.5 million people, which has its own language and culture, held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 in defiance of a Spanish court ban.

More than 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who voted backed secession, according to Catalan officials. But that turnout represented only 43 percent of the region’s 5.3 million eligible voters as many opponents of independence stayed away.

The Spanish government sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers fired rubber bullets and charged crowds with truncheons in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and dramatically escalated the dispute.

CATALONIA‘S IMPORTANCE

Losing Catalonia is almost unthinkable for the Spanish government.

It would deprive Spain of about 16 percent of its people, a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. Catalonia is also the top destination for foreign tourists, attracting about a quarter of Spain’s total.

There is widespread opposition to a Catalan breakaway among people in the rest of the country.

The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia. The board of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis will meet on Monday to discuss moving its head office elsewhere in Spain, a source familiar with the matter said.

Concern is growing in EU capitals about the impact of the crisis on the Spanish economy, the fourth largest in the euro zone, and on possible spillovers to other economies.

Some European officials are also worried that any softening in Spain’s stance towards Catalan independence could fuel secessionist feelings among other groups in Europe such as Belgium’s Flemings and Italy’s Lombards.

‘DRASTIC SOLUTIONS’

Until this weekend, Rajoy has remained vague on whether he would take the unprecedented step of triggering Article 155 of the constitution, the so-called nuclear option which enables him to sack the regional government and call a local election.

However, asked if he was ready to do so, Rajoy told El Pais newspaper on Saturday: “I don’t rule out anything that is within the law ... Ideally, we shouldn’t have to take drastic solutions but for that not to happen there would have to be changes.”

Rajoy also said he planned to leave in Catalonia the 4,000 national police the government had shipped in for the referendum, until the crisis was over.

He ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said he is open to - and added the issue would not force a snap national election.

Sunday’s demonstration in Barcelona was organized by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society to mobilizes what it believes is a “silent majority” of citizens in Catalonia who oppose independence.

“The people who have come to demonstrate don’t feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”

The rally was addressed by Nobel prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who has dual Spanish and Peruvian nationality. He told reporters it showed many Catalans “don’t want the coup d‘etat the Catalan government is fostering”.

Tens of thousands of people had gathered in 50 cities across Spain on Saturday, some defending Spain’s national unity and others dressed in white and calling for talks to defuse the crisis.",Thousands protest in Barcelona against Catalan independence,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/thousands-protest-in-barcelona-against-catalan-independence-idUKKBN1CD0E8

The defeat of ultra-nationalist parties in the Netherlands and in France earlier this year gave European leaders the sense that fear of a far-right surge had, after all, been misplaced. As it turns out, it was the relief that was misplaced.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

Jarrett Blanc: Trump's Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Friday pushed back the unveiling of the company’s big rig truck until mid-November, tweeting that the electric vehicle maker was diverting resources to fix production bottlenecks of its new Model 3 sedan and to help Puerto Rico.

Musk said Tesla’s Model 3 was “deep in production hell” echoing his own comments in July, when he showed off some of the first cars of that model.

The Model 3 could help Tesla approach its goal of becoming more of a mass market producer. Recent comments have tempered expectations about the speed of the increase in production, though.

Musk’s comments came after the close of stock trading on Friday. The company’s shares fell 0.8 percent in extended trading.

The Palo Alto, California-based company delivered just 220 Model 3 sedans and produced 260 in the third quarter. It had planned to produce more than 1,500.

Musk also tweeted the company was diverting resources to increasing battery production to help hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, where most residents remain without electricity.

Earlier this week Tesla reported that “production bottlenecks” had left it behind the planned ramp-up for the Model 3.

In response to a Tesla customer asking if he would get his car delivered this year, Musk tweeted, “December will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now.”

A Wall Street Journal report said parts of Model 3 were being made by hand as recently as early September, adding to production delays. (on.wsj.com/2kt5E17)

Musk also said Tesla would reschedule the unveiling of its semi-truck to Nov. 16 as it focuses on fixing production issues tied to Model 3 and increases battery production for Puerto Rico.

The unveiling of the truck, called Tesla Semi, has been delayed for the second time this year. Musk had initially said the truck would be unveiled in September, but he later rescheduled it to late October.

“Semi specs are better than anything I’ve seen reported so far. Semi eng/design team work is aces, but other needs are greater right now,” Elon replied to a twitter user who asked him about the specifications of the semi-truck.

Reuters in August reported that the truck would have a working range of 200-300 miles.

Earlier in the day, Musk said the company will send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out power on the island over two weeks ago.",Tesla delays big rig truck debut; Model 3 in 'production hell',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-truck/tesla-delays-big-rig-truck-debut-model-3-in-production-hell-idUSKBN1CB2NQ

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo is like a zombie feasting on Verizon’s brains. Marni Walden, a top executive at the $200 billion U.S. telecom group, is leaving just a day after the internet firm she helped to acquire tripled its tally of customer accounts exposed to a 2013 hack. While the company suggests the timing is a coincidence, it’s clear that Yahoo is a problem that continues to fester.

Verizon disclosed that Walden will exit at the end of the year in a two-sentence regulatory filing on Wednesday. The 50-year-old executive vice president was a rising star and a rare female in the upper ranks, who could have been a credible successor to Chief Executive Lowell McAdam. As the head of media, Walden also oversaw the creation of Oath, a combination of acquired 1990s internet brands Yahoo and AOL, to help shore up Verizon’s digital advertising offerings.

Even if buying Yahoo had a certain business rationale, it has proven to be a real pain in the side. Two hacking incidents revealed last year nearly scotched the deal. Verizon wrangled a $350 million price cut from Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, but that may have been too little. On Tuesday it emerged that all 3 billion of Yahoo’s user accounts were compromised.

Verizon said that Walden’s departure and the latest revelation were unrelated. She is pursuing outside opportunities because she was unlikely to be the next chief executive, the Wall Street Journal reported. Others now in the running to replace McAdam, 63, include John Stratton, head of global operations, and Hans Vestberg, who once led Ericsson and is now Verizon’s chief technology officer.

Either of those would suggest that Verizon is now more interested in building out a fiber network than reinventing the media landscape. At least it only plunked down $9 billion for Oath. Meanwhile, rival AT&T is still splashing out on satellite distribution and media, paying some $175 billion for DirecTV and Time Warner. It ought to learn from Verizon’s experience: risky deals may come back to haunt.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico bond insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd (AGO.N) said late on Friday it voluntarily withdrew a complaint that challenged the legality of the island’s fiscal turnaround plan, citing the devastating impact of Hurricane Maria.

The move may temporarily ease Puerto Rico’s financial problems as it struggles to get back on its feet after Maria hit last month, destroying the electrical grid and leaving most of the island’s 3.4 million inhabitants without power.

Assured Guaranty, along with a second insurer MBIA Inc (MBI.N), filed their lawsuit against the island’s government and a federally appointed financial oversight board on May 3, a day after Puerto Rico announced a historic restructuring of its public debt.

“While we continue to believe the current fiscal plan is illegal, we have determined to voluntarily dismiss our complaint without prejudice at this time due to the crisis in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, and the high likelihood that the fiscal plan will have to be revised,” Dominic Frederico, chief executive of Assured Guaranty said in a statement.

The lawsuit contended the fiscal plan, approved in March by the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, violated provisions of the 2016 Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA and the U.S. Constitution.

Puerto Rico in May filed a form of bankruptcy under the Title III provision in the PROMESA law. The island’s capital structure has 18 public agencies owing a combined $120 billion in bond and pension debt.

Frederico said the focus should be on restoration and relief for Puerto Rico, not on their arguments, at least for the time being.

“If insufficient progress is made in developing a new fiscal plan that complies with PROMESA and respects Assured Guaranty’s constitutional, statutory and contractual rights, Assured Guaranty will refile the lawsuits at an appropriate time,” the statement said.

In May, when the lawsuit was filed, the two firms had about $9 billion at stake in the island’s debt crisis. Assured could be on the hook for as much as $5.4 billion in bondholder losses on defaulted debt, while MBIA’s National Public Finance Guarantee Corp has about $3.6 billion of exposure.

The plan, prior to the hurricane, forecast the island having only $800 million a year to service debt, likely meaning major haircuts for bondholders.","Assured Guaranty pulls Puerto Rico lawsuit, cites hurricane",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CC0J9-OCABS

Oggi Maurizio Lupi, capogruppo alla Camera del partito del ministro degli Esteri Angelino Alfano, ha ribadito che Ap non voterà il sostegno al governo su questo punto e non uscirà neanche dall‘aula al Senato, cosa che avrebbe fatto calare il quorum.

Nelle scorse settimane il Pd, convinto che il provvedimento non avesse la maggioranza, aveva rinunciato a farlo calendarizzare.

Ma ieri sera il ministro Delrio, esponente Pd vicino al segretario Matteo Renzi, sostenitore del provvedimento, ha detto: “Non so se ci sarà la maggioranza o meno. Se non ce la facciamo, amen... se non ci sono i numeri ne prenderemo atto, ma ci si prova fino alla fine”. Delrio però non ha fatto riferimento alla questione della fiducia.

Se il governo dovesse chiedere la fiducia al Senato, dove gode di una maggioranza abbastanza risicata, e poi perdere, le dimissioni sarebbero inevitabili. Un rischio che l‘esecutivo potrebbe non voler correre, almeno prima dell‘approvazione della legge di Bilancio, che presenterà alle Camere entro il 20 ottobre.

Ma il voto con cui mercoledì scorso Palazzo Madama ha approvato il Def, con 181 sì, anche grazie all‘Ala dell‘ex berlusconiano Denis Verdini, ora fa ben sperare l‘esecutivo. Al punto da far dire alla fonte governativa che il tentativo di far passare lo Ius soli potrebbe avvenire anche prima del Bilancio.

Perché pur se una parte consistente del gruppo Ap-Ncd voterebbe contro, ci sarebbe il sostegno dei verdiniani, di Mdp e dei senatori di Sinistra Italiana (come ha confermato a Reuters oggi il senatore Stefano Fassina), oltre che di parlamentari sparsi di altri gruppi.

“Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid,” Trump said in a tweet. “...Hasn’t worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, making fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!”

Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.

The president has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from Pyongyang’s nuclear threats.

Earlier this week, during a meeting with top U.S. military leaders and their spouses, Trump told reporters it was the “calm before the storm.” Asked for clarification then on what he meant, Trump said: “You’ll find out.”

Speaking to reporters on Saturday ahead of a trip to North Carolina, Trump said he had nothing more to clarify.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders referred to Iran and North Korea the following day when asked about Trump’s “calm before the storm” comments.

Asked on Saturday about Trump’s tweet, Sanders said she had nothing to add to the president’s comments.

The Pentagon referred a question for clarification to the White House and said the Defense Department’s job was to “present the president military options and carry out orders.”

Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. On Sunday he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government.

Trump said on Saturday that he had a good relationship with his secretary of state despite some disagreements.

”We have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes I’d like him to be a little bit tougher, but other than that we have a very good relationship,” he said.

A Russian lawmaker on Friday was quoted saying North Korea was preparing to test a long-range missile that it believes can reach the west coast of the United States. Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament’s international affairs committee, was part of a Russian delegation that visited Pyongyang from Oct. 2-6, according to Russian RIA news agency.

The lower house of parliament is due to start voting on Tuesday on an electoral law supported by the country’s main right- and left-wing parties. Unlike the current system, it would allow the formation of broad coalitions before a vote, a factor likely to hurt 5-Star, which refuses to join alliances.

“The only aim (of the law) is to allow others to gang up on us,” 5-Star lawmaker Danilo Toninelli said on Sunday, a day after a parliamentary committee signed off on the new proposal.

For the traditional parties, “the important thing is to stop the 5-Star,” he said.

A national vote is due to be held during the first half of 2018, between March and May.

Polls show Matteo Renzi’s ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD), which proposed the new law, is neck-in-neck with the 5-Star. But if the PD runs in alliance with smaller centrist and left-wing parties, together they would likely surpass the 5-Star, now led by the 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio.

The new law may be even more beneficial to Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party and the far-right Northern League, which also back the bill. In a coalition, polls show they could win the most votes.

“The wind is blowing in the sails of the center-right and of Forza Italia,” the lower-house speaker of Berlusconi’s party, Renato Brunetta, said.

But polls give neither Renzi’s center-left or Berlusconi’s center-right enough votes to govern alone, suggesting a right-left alliance may be the only way to form a government after the election.

The bill could pass as early as this week in the Chamber, after which it would go to the Senate for approval. The risk is that it could be sunk by dozens of secret votes in which parliamentarians can break with the official party line.

Secret voting is what killed a previous election law proposal in June that initially had been supported by the 5-Star Movement.

The 5-Star catapulted into parliament in 2013 with nearly a quarter of the national vote, but it has struggled to further expand its support. It has vowed to rescue Italy from the clutches of what it says is a corrupt political system.

Five-Star’s policies include the introduction of universal income support for the poor, rewriting European Union public spending limits, and phasing out fossil fuels. It now says holding a referendum whether to dump the euro, which had been a pillar of its platform, is not a priority.

The proposed election law would distribute almost two-thirds of the seats in parliament on a proportional basis, while a third would be decided in a first-past-the-post vote on specific candidates.

Coalitions would need to get 10 percent of the national vote to get into parliament, while parties running alone would need only 3 percent. Candidates would be chosen by party chiefs.",Italy's main parties back election law that isolates 5-Star,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-election-lawmaking/italys-main-parties-back-election-law-that-isolates-5-star-idUSKBN1CD0L5?il=0

The warning came after the White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump would announce new U.S. responses to Iran’s missile tests, support for “terrorism” and cyber operations as part of his new Iran strategy.

“As we’ve announced in the past, if America’s new law for sanctions is passed, this country will have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km range of Iran’s missiles,” Guards’ commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, according to state media.

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the United States, according to state media, and issued a stark warning to American troops.

“If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world particularly in the Middle East,” Jafari said.

The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are Iran’s most powerful internal and external security force. The Quds Force, the IRGC’s foreign espionage and paramilitary wing, and individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are on the US list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

Iran sees the Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State as an existential threat to the Islamic Republic where the majority of the population are Shi‘ites.

On June 7, Islamic State claimed an attack on Tehran’s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, killing 18 people. The Guards fired missiles at Islamic State bases in Syria on June 18 in response.

Guards commanders have framed their military involvement in Iraq and Syria, where they are fighting to support the government of President Bashar al-Assad, as a fight against Islamic State.

Dozens of members of the Guards, including senior commanders, have been killed in Syria and Iraq.

MISSILE PROGRAM

The website for state TV reported Jafari as adding that the United States was mistaken if it thought it could pressure Iran into negotiating on regional issues.

Jafari also said that Tehran would ramp up its defense capabilities, including its missile program, if the U.S. undermined a nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers.

Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions.

However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel.

“The Americans should know that the Trump government’s stupid behavior with the nuclear deal will be used by the Islamic Republic as an opportunity to move ahead with its missile, regional and conventional defense program,” Jafari said, according to state media.

The prospect of Washington backtracking on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis in the shape of North Korea.

If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. U.N. inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms.

The Guards navy was also carrying out a military exercise on Sunday in the Gulf, an area of tension with the U.S. navy in recent months.

More than 110 vessels were involved in the exercise, including some that have rocket and missile capabilities, a state media report quoted a Guards commander as saying.",Iran warns U.S. against imposing further sanctions,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CD083

AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish army reconnaissance team scouted out Syria’s Idlib province on Sunday, a senior Syrian rebel said, before an expected military operation to impose peace in the bitterly contested Syrian northwest.

“When we don’t go to Syria, Syria comes to us,” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party. “If we didn’t take our measures, bombs would fall on our cities.”

Turkey says it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed, aiming to implement a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area, the most populous pocket of Syria still in rebel hands.

Although Turkish officials say they are helping the rebels from within Turkey, in past interventions they have also sent troops across the frontier.

Any incursion could bring them into conflict with powerful jihadists from al Qaeda’s former Syrian branch, although there were signs on Sunday that they were working to avoid a confrontation.

Local sources said the Turkish military vehicles were escorted into Idlib by a convoy of fighters from the group, which has joined a jihadist alliance called Tahrir al-Sham and disavowed links to the network founded by Osama bin Laden.

Nonetheless, the jihadists and the Turkish military earlier exchanged fire nearby, underscoring the tension as Turkey builds up its forces and the rebel groups it backs prepare to enter Idlib.

“We will never allow a terror corridor that begins in Afrin and goes to the Mediterranean,” Erdogan said, referring to the stretch of Turkey’s southern border which is controlled on the Syrian side by Kurdish fighters and Tahrir al-Sham.

Related Coverage Erdogan says Turkey working with Syria rebels to implement Idlib accord

Turkey has been one of the biggest supporters of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the six-and-a-half-year war, but its focus has moved from ousting him to securing its own border against jihadist and Kurdish groups.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim stressed the importance of ensuring de-escalation near the border, following an agreement reached in Astana, Kazakhstan last month that was backed both by the Turks and by Russia, which supports Assad.

“We will ensure safety in Idlib, and will cooperate with Russia,” Yildirim said.

Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former Nusra Front, which was al Qaeda’s Syrian branch until last year when it changed its name and broke allegiance to the global network, has been a formidable military force since early in the conflict.

Since early this year it has battled other rebel groups as it tried to gain control over areas including Idlib.

UNDER ESCORT

Idlib and neighboring parts of northwest Syria are now home to more than 2 million people, many of them refugees from other formerly rebel-held regions that fell to pro-government forces.

A local resident and another local rebel said they had seen Turkish military vehicles enter Idlib and then travel under Tahrir al-Sham escort along a road.

The senior Syrian rebel said the reconnaissance team went to Sheikh Barakat, a location that overlooks both rebel-held areas of Aleppo province, adjacent to Idlib, and the Kurdish-controlled area of Afrin.

Erdogan gave no details of the operation, but said it was going ahead “without problems at the moment”.

Turkey’s biggest security concern on the frontier is the Kurdish YPG militia, which as part of a U.S.-backed alliance is fighting against Islamic State in eastern Syria. Ankara regards the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey.

Mortars were fired from the area under YPG control near to the location where the Turkish reconnaissance team was operating, the senior rebel said.

“The Turkish team is on its way back. Its mission has been accomplished. They visited areas of disengagement and locations where the Turkish army would be positioned,” the rebel said.

Reuters witnesses, local people, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said earlier on Sunday the Turkish military and Tahrir al-Sham had clashed near the village of Kafr Lusin in Idlib.

Tahrir al-Sham began the exchange by firing on a Turkish bulldozer removing sections of a border wall and Turkish artillery returned fire, they said. The area was later quiet.

Rebel groups that will take part - drawn from the Euphrates Shield campaign that Turkey backed with armor and troops in another part of Syria to the east since last year - said on Saturday they expected the Idlib operation to start very soon.

Tahrir al-Sham said “the lions of jihad and martyrdom will be waiting to pounce” against any incursion into Idlib.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it has approved HP Inc’s (HPQ.N) $1.1 billion purchase of Samsung Electronics’ (005930.KS) printer business with certain restrictions, citing concerns about the U.S. firm’s dominance of the domestic laser printer market.

HP announced the deal in September 2016, hoping to disrupt the $55 billion copier market by focusing on multifunction printers and more deeply embedding mobile and cloud printing technologies to its product solutions.

It hoped at the time to close the transaction within 12 months, pending regulatory review.

In a statement issued late on Thursday, the Ministry of Commerce said sale of A4 format laser printers by HP in China should be done on “fair and reasonable” terms and the firm must report every six months on their prices and related data to the ministry.

HP must not buy any stakes in other A4 printer manufacturers in China even if they are a minority equity investment, it said.

It must not adapt its printers to restrict compatibility with third-parties or claim in advertising that its printers are not compatible with other suppliers, the ministry said.

HP expects to close the acquisition in the fourth quarter which ends on Dec. 31, a spokeswoman said in an email. She declined to comment on the regulatory process.

Samsung was not immediately available for comment.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil producers may need to take “some extraordinary measures” next year to rebalance the oil market, the OPEC secretary-general said on Sunday.

“There is a growing consensus that ... a rebalancing process is under way. We are gradually but steadily achieving our common and noble objectives,” Mohammad Barkindo told reporters at the India Energy Forum organized by CERAWeek in New Delhi.

“To sustain this into next year, some extraordinary measures may have to be taken in order to restore this stability on a sustainable basis going forward,” he said, without elaborating.

Saudi Arabia and Russia helped secure a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 rival producers to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March 2018 in an effort to reduce a glut.

Barkindo said consultations were under way for the extension of the OPEC-led pact beyond March 2018 and that more oil producing nations may join the supply pact, possibly at the next meeting of OPEC in Vienna on Nov. 30.

He also said that Nigeria and Libya, who are exempted from the pact, “are making progress towards full recovery” of production, after which they could join the OPEC-led agreement.

Oil futures fell more than 2 percent on Friday, ending Brent crude’s longest multi-week rally in 16 months as oversupply concerns reappeared as producers have started hedging future drilling. [O/R]

But Barkindo said he was not worried about the rise in U.S. shale oil and gas output.

“It is a big market and demand is very strong. Between the first half and second half this year, demand growth is almost about 2 million barrels (per day), which is very robust,” he said. “So everybody has a role to play.”

On Friday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he hoped to reach a consensus with Russia and other major oil producers on the future of the deal before November’s meeting.

Falih was speaking in Moscow two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was possible that the supply reduction deal could run to the end of next year, although Russia has not made any commitment.",Extraordinary steps may be needed in 2018 to rebalance oil market: OPEC's Barkindo,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-india/extraordinary-steps-may-be-needed-in-2018-to-rebalance-oil-market-opecs-barkindo-idUSKBN1CD0HN

MANILA (Reuters) - Trust and satisfaction in Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on Sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall.

Net satisfaction, used by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) as a rating of the president’s performance, was down 18 points from the second quarter to 48, classified as “good” in the survey of 1,200 Filipinos conducted in the last week of September.

Duterte’s net trust rating, which gauges public sentiment about his personality, was “very good” at 60 points, down from “excellent” 75 he achieved in the previous poll.

The survey was conducted just a few days after thousands of Filipinos rallied to denounce Duterte, his anti-drug crackdown and what they called an emerging dictatorship.

Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in the crackdown and other SWS polls conducted in September indicated doubts about the validity of official accounts of the 3,800 cases where police killed drug suspects.

The SWS survey did not ask respondents to give a reason for the rating of Duterte, who took office in June 2016. Duterte’s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results.

Political analyst Ramon Casiple, head of the country’s Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said it was normal for a president’s rating to fall during his time in office, but concern over the high death toll in his signature war on drugs will have weighed on sentiment.

Activists accuse Duterte of inciting police to kill drug dealers and users, which he denies. Police reject allegations they are executing suspects and say deaths occurred because victims had violently resisted arrest.

Casiple said that though the poll still showed Duterte had the support of Filipinos, he should take it seriously.

“This is a real diminution of his popularity and it serves as a wakeup call for him to stop it further going down,” Casiple said of the poll.

“However, this is still a comfortable figure and far from the threshold of unpopularity.”

Based on SWS methodology for net trust ratings, a score of 70 and above is considered excellent, 50 to 69 is very good, 30-49 good and 10-29 moderate.

While his political opponents chide him for his authoritarian style and intolerance of dissent, Duterte enjoys a cult-like following and support from millions of Filipinos, who see him as the best hope for change in a country with rampant crime and a yawning gap between rich and poor.","Philippine president sees biggest ratings dip, but popularity intact",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-politics-duterte/philippine-president-sees-biggest-ratings-dip-but-popularity-intact-idUSKBN1CD0NJ

The new duty follows a preliminary finding that Bombardier sold 75 CSeries jets below cost to Delta Air Lines Inc in 2016.
The duties are expected to heighten trade tensions between the United States, Canada and Britain, where CSeries wings are made.

The decision underscored the defensive trade policy of U.S. President Donald Trump, and could effectively halt sales of Bombardier’s innovative new plane to U.S. airlines by quadrupling the cost of the jets imported to the United States.

The Commerce Department proposed a 79.82 percent antidumping duty on Friday, on top of a 219.63 percent duty for subsidies announced last week.

The new duty follows a preliminary finding that Bombardier sold 75 CSeries jets below cost to Delta Air Lines Inc in 2016. The total was well above the 80 percent Boeing sought in its complaint.

The proposed duties would not take effect unless affirmed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) early next year.

The duties are expected to heighten trade tensions between the United States, Canada and Britain, where CSeries wings are made. The United States, Canada and Mexico also are negotiating to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement.

After the first duty was announced on Sept. 26, Canada and Britain threatened to avoid buying Boeing military equipment, saying duties on the CSeries would reduce U.S. sales and put thousands of Bombardier jobs in their countries at risk.

“This is a disappointing statement but hardly surprising given last week’s preliminary ruling sided with Boeing,” a British government spokesman said on Saturday.

“We continue to make all efforts alongside the Canadian government to get Boeing to the table to resolve the case.”

Bombardier shares were last up 0.5 percent to C$2.20. Some analysts said the muted response reflected a view that the penalties might not actually be applied.

Boeing, the world’s largest plane maker, hailed the decision and hinted at an alternative for Bombardier.

“These duties are the consequence of a conscious decision by Bombardier to violate trade law and dump their CSeries aircraft to secure a sale,” Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement.

“Bombardier always has the option of coming into full compliance with trade laws,” Boeing added.

Canada’s foreign ministry said Boeing was “manipulating the U.S. trade remedy system” to keep the CSeries out of the country.

Canada is in “complete disagreement” with the decision and would keep raising concerns with the United States and Boeing, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

To win its case before the ITC, Boeing must prove it was harmed by Bombardier’s sales, despite not using one of its own jets to compete for the Delta order.

Bombardier said it was confident that the ITC would find Boeing was not harmed, calling the Commerce Department decision a case of “egregious overreach.”

Delta said the decision was preliminary and it was confident the ITC “will conclude that no U.S. manufacturer is at risk” from Bombardier’s plane.

Boeing has said the dispute was about “maintaining a level playing field” and was not an attack on Canada or Britain.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the decision affirmed Trump’s “America First” policy.

“We will ... do everything in our power to stand up for American companies and their workers,” Ross said in a statement.

But the industry is not so simple. More than half of the purchased content of each CSeries aircraft comes from U.S. suppliers, Bombardier has said. The plane supports an estimated 22,700 jobs and Bombardier’s aerospace division spent $2.14 billion in the United States last year, according to the company and documents seen by Reuters.

Boeing has said the CSeries would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada and Britain and a $2.5 billion equity infusion from the province of Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015.",U.S. backs 300 percent in duties on Bombardier after Boeing complaint,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-bombardier-commerce/u-s-backs-300-percent-in-duties-on-bombardier-after-boeing-complaint-idUSKBN1CB29X

A Democratic aide said the Trump administration would have to abandon such efforts before it could reach a healthcare deal with Republicans.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would be open to cutting a one-year or two-year deal with Democratic rivals as a way to kick-start reform of the nation’s healthcare system, a key campaign pledge made by Trump and the Republican Party.

Republicans fell short several times this year in their drive to repeal former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic legislation, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a promise the party has campaigned on for seven years.

Trump has been frustrated by the failure, openly taunting Republicans as “total quitters” and “fools” this summer over their inability in the Senate to replace Obamacare.

“If we made a temporary deal, I think it would be a great thing for people, but it’s really up to them (Democrats),” Trump told reporters at the White House.

“So if we could do a one-year deal or two-year deal as a temporary measure, you’ll have block granting ultimately to the states, which is what Republicans want,” Trump said.

Earlier on Saturday Trump said he had called Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to gauge interest in working on what he called a “great” healthcare bill to replace Obamacare.

“I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill,” Trump wrote on Twitter earlier on Saturday. “ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!”

Axios first reported Trump’s call to Schumer on Friday.

Schumer said Trump had told him during the phone call on Friday that he wanted to try again to repeal and replace Obamacare.

“I told the president that’s off the table,” Schumer said in a statement. “If he wants to work together to improve the existing health care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions.”

Schumer pointed to bipartisan efforts by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray to repair Obamacare as “a good place to start.”

Alexander pulled out of the talks last month as a new Republican bill to repeal Obamacare gained momentum. After that bill collapsed, Alexander said he would again consult with Murray.

Although Democrats have been mostly united against Trump’s agenda, there is a precedent for a bipartisan deal. Last month, Trump sided with Democrats in a surprising debt limit deal that blindsided Republicans and left conservative groups aghast.

But there are still wide policy differences between Democrats and Trump. His administration on Friday undermined requirements under Obamacare that employers provide insurance to cover women’s birth control.

A new rule will allow businesses or non-profit organizations to lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide contraceptives coverage in health insurance with no co-payment.

A Democratic aide said the Trump administration would have to abandon such efforts before it could reach a healthcare deal with Republicans.

SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - Jolyon Palmer said farewell to the Renault team on Sunday and probably Formula One as well.

The under-performing Briton is being replaced by Spaniard Carlos Sainz for the remaining four races of the season and left the Japanese Grand Prix with no more points than the eight he arrived with.

All of those were scored in one race, in Singapore where he was sixth out of just 12 finishers, leaving 15 other complete blanks.

Palmer managed only one point in all of 2016 when Renault had just taken over the failing Lotus team and were struggling with an uncompetitive car.

Asked about his plans for 2018, he told Sky Sports television that he did not know.

“When I‘m sat on the plane on the way back home, probably it will sink in that certainly I won’t be driving for Renault again and maybe not in Formula One again,” he said.

“I‘m out and that’s Formula One. These things happen. It’s a shame but I’ll move on. There’s plenty to life out there and I‘m about to find out what it is.”

Renault had announced on Saturday that they and Palmer, son of former racer Jonathan, had agreed a parting of the ways.

“I‘m feeling alright,” said the 26-year-old former GP2 champion, who started his last race from 18th place after engine-related grid penalties were applied and ended up 12th.

“I respect the decision and wish the team still the best for the future, Carlos the best and we go our separate ways.”

While Palmer has struggled, highly-rated German team mate Nico Hulkenberg has finished in the points on six occasions this year and scored 34 points.

“The stress levels have been pretty huge this year,” Palmer added.

“It’s been a very tough season for many reasons and each weekend turning up with some question marks, with the pressure coming on more and more as the season hasn’t unfolded like we’d hoped.”",Palmer looks to new horizons after Formula One exit,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CD0QB-OCASP

Under grey skies and intermittent rain, over two thousand people gathered in central Moscow’s Pushkin Square and chanted “Russia will be free” and “Russia without Putin” before walking towards the Kremlin and parliament.

Police briefly detained a few people, but did not charge anyone. It was a different story at rallies in other cities however, and the OVD-Info monitoring group, a non-profit organization, said at least 262 people had been detained in 27 towns.

In St Petersburg, Putin’s home town, a Reuters witness saw riot police roughly detain at least 11 people. OVD-Info said at least 66 people had been detained in the city.

Navalny, who is serving a 20-day jail term for violating rules on public meetings, called the rally in Moscow and other cities to coincide with Putin’s 65th birthday.

Putin, who has dominated Russia’s political landscape for almost 18 years, is widely expected to run for what would be his fourth term.

Navalny hopes to run too, despite the central election commission declaring him ineligible due to a suspended prison sentence he says was politically-motivated.

One of the Moscow protesters held a homemade poster of Putin sitting on a mountain of banknotes, wearing a crown with the legend: “Happy Birthday you little thief!”

Others carried posters citing their right to protest, some waved Russian flags, and a few carried inflatable yellow ducks, a jokey reference to Navalny accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of owning a lavish estate with a duck house.

Medvedev called the claims politically-motivated nonsense.

In St Petersburg, some 1,500 activists waving red and white banners gathered in a square before heading for the city’s main street shouting “Putin is a thief” and “Free Navalny”.

PROTESTS MORE MODEST IN SIZE

The size of Saturday’s Moscow rally and others across Russia looked far more modest than Navalny-backed mass protests in March and June, which were widely recognized to be some of the biggest since 2012.

Many of the Moscow protesters were teenagers or in their twenties.

Carrying a yellow duck, Ulugbek Apsapayev, 17, said he had turned up because he wanted a better future for Russia.

“The duck is a sign that we support Alexei Navalny who also wants only good things for the country. But unfortunately we only have Vladimir Putin and his gang in power.”

Putin is popular across the country however, especially outside major cities where his strong leadership style and tough foreign policy stance go down well. He is expected to confirm later this year that he will run for another six-year term.

Opinion polls show he would comfortably beat Navalny if the opposition leader was allowed to run. Navalny says such polls are meaningless because there is no fair political competition.

Putin spent his birthday taking congratulatory calls from other world leaders, and chaired a security council meeting.

Authorities had refused to approve most of Saturday’s rallies, but Navalny says Russians’ right to protest is enshrined in the constitution.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - On paper, Catalonia looks viable as an independent state. The region which accounts for around a fifth of Spain’s economy has gross domestic product roughly comparable to Finland’s. Its residents are on average richer and more likely to have a job than other Spaniards. Nevertheless, the economic odds are stacked against the secessionists.

First, Catalonia may become much less wealthy if it breaks away. Some large companies are taking steps to transfer their registered headquarters out of the region following the Oct. 1 independence referendum that was branded unconstitutional by the central government. They include Banco Sabadell, Spain’s fifth-largest lender, which decided on Thursday to move its legal base to Alicante. The more likely independence becomes, the greater the chances that jobs and actual activity shift elsewhere.

Second, breaking away would trigger harmful disputes over tax and debt with Madrid, which trenchantly opposes a divorce. Granted, Catalonia pays more in taxes to the central government than it receives in spending. But unilaterally declaring independence would not necessarily allow the region to stand on its own. Citizens and businesses might face duplicate tax demands from Barcelona and Madrid. In the event of a standoff, companies with branch offices in Spain could be presented with bills for the whole business.

There’s also the thorny issue of how to smooth out Catalan debt obligations, which it currently does with the help of state liquidity. Net borrowing from the central government surpassed 50 billion euros at the end of 2016, equivalent to three-quarters of Catalonia’s total debt, according to Fitch. The credit rating firm also points out that more than a quarter of debt outstanding at the end of 2016 comes due over the next three years. And that’s assuming Catalonia can escape without taking on any of Spain’s sovereign debt, currently equivalent to around 100 percent of national GDP.

A final problem is what currency Catalonia would use. Even if independence were recognised by other countries, the region is unlikely to remain a part of the euro zone. Granted, it could always create a currency that is pegged to the euro. But a newly-created Catalan central bank would need access to foreign exchange reserves that the central government has no interest in handing over.

O britânico Hamilton, que largou da pole position, cruzou a linha de chegada 1,2s à frente de Max Verstappen, da Red Bull, abrindo 59 pontos de vantagem na liderança do campeonato. Daniel Ricciardo, companheiro de Verstappen, ficou em terceiro.

Vettel, por sua vez, não passou da quarta volta, abandonando a prova nos boxes.

O alemão, que já estava 34 pontos atrás de Hamilton antes da prova, sofreu o terceiro revés no mesmo número de corridas, e agora suas esperanças estão depositas em que Hamilton sofra o mesmo tipo de má sorte nas quatro etapas finais da temporada.

“Eu só poderia sonhar em ter uma vantagem dessa”, disse Hamilton em entrevista no pódio ao ex-piloto de F1 Takuma Sato, vencedor das 500 Milhas de Indianápolis neste ano.

“Eu não diria que estou com uma mão (na taça)”, acrescentou mais tarde. “Ainda tem 100 pontos em disputa, então vou continuar com o pé no acelerador”.

A vitória deste domingo foi a 61ª da carreira de Hamilton e a terceira no circuito de Suzuka. O triunfo aconteceu um dia após o piloto de 32 anos ter registrado o novo recorde no circuito de 5,8km no treino classificatório de sábado.

Com a atual vantagem conquistada sobre Vettel, Hamilton pode assegurar o título já na próxima corrida, em Austin, no Texas, em 22 de outubro.

Valtteri Bottas, que largou em sexto devido a um punição por uma troca de câmbio, lutou até o final para terminar em quarto com sua Mercedes. O também finlandês Kimi Raikkonen, que também sofreu punição no grid relacionada ao câmbio, foi o representante único da Ferrari no fim da prova, em quinto.

Para Fermin Seda, de 68 años y jubilado en la ciudad sureña de Salinas, no hay duda.

“Quiero (que tengamos) categoría de estado”, dijo Seda. “Creo que sería mejor que como estamos ahora”.

El estatus de Puerto Rico como estado libre asociado a EEUU implica que 3,5 millones de ciudadanos americanos no pagan impuestos federales, ni votan en las elecciones presidenciales, ni reciben fondos federales de manera proporcional en programas como el sanitario Medicaid para los más desfavorecidos.

Para José Fuentes, presidente para el Consejo de Estabilidad de Puerto Rico, una organización proestatal en Washington, Puerto Rico habría estado en una mejor posición para hacer frente al huracán María si hubiera tenido los ingresos y el poder político de un estado.

Convertirse en un estado fortalecería la posición política de la isla, que actualmente solo tiene un miembro del Congreso -que no cuenta con derecho a voto-, y aumentaría sus posibilidades para conseguir ayudas federales, dijo Fuentes.

Maria fue la mayor tormenta que ha golpeado Puerto Rico en 90 años y la devastación que produjo “realmente impulsa la situación para un tratamiento igualitario para Puerto Rico”, dijo Jake Johnston, un investigador internacional asociado al think tank Center for Economic and Policy Research de Washington.

La economía estancada de Puerto Rico y su creciente deuda han dejado a la isla con una infraestructura antigua, vulnerable y los edificios ahora tienen una capacidad muy limitada para ser reconstruidos, dijo Johnston.

La débil infraestructura no pudo contra los fuertes vientos y el agua de Maria y probablemente obstaculizó la labor de los servicios de emergencias, ya que los equipos tuvieron que hacer frente a un corte del suministro eléctrico prácticamente total, y a la falta de agua, petróleo y comunicaciones, dijo.

VOTO A FAVOR

Cambiar la cuestión de si es un estado ha sido un fuerte debate. Los puertorriqueños votaron mayoritariamente a favor de serlo en junio, con un 97 por ciento de los apoyos, aunque la participación fue de menos de un cuarto de los votantes inscritos.

“¿Cómo podemos tener todavía un territorio colonial de más de 3,5 millones de habitantes estadounidenses sin acceso a los mismos derechos o a tener el mismo poder político?”, dijo el lunes el gobernador Ricardo Rossell. Rossello, que hizo campaña a favor de la condición de estado, dijo en junio que el Congreso debería actuar.

Hacer de la votación no vinculante una realidad requiere acción por parte del Congreso, pero no es probable que la cámara, controlada por los republicanos, ni el Senado intervengan para favorecer a un territorio que vota a los demócratas.

La cantidad de fondos federales que entran y salen de la isla cambiaría de forma dramática si fuese un estado: recibiría hasta un 76 por ciento de más fondos federales de los cuatro mayores programas de EEUU que tienen repercusión en los estados, incluyendo el Medicaid y el ingreso suplementario de seguridad (Supplemental Security Income), según un análisis de 2014 de la Oficina de Cuentas del Gobierno (GAO, por sus siglas en inglés) del Gobierno de EEUU. Sin embargo, a cambio, los puertorriqueños tendrían que pagar más impuestos federales.

Una cosa que no cambiaría si Puerto Rico consiguiera la condición de estado de EEUU es su posición con respecto a la Agencia Federal de Gestión de Emergencias: las obligaciones de la FEMA hacia Puerto Rico son las mismas que hacia un estado.

Los líderes democráticos del Congreso y algunos residentes en Puerto Rico han acusado a la Administración republicana de ser más lentos en su respuesta ante el desastre que si este se hubiera producido en la península. Pero la FEMA ha defendido sus esfuerzos en la isla.

“Me voy a la cama todas las noches sabiendo que he hecho todo lo que he podido para reunir todos los recursos federales” para la isla, dijo el administrador de la FEMA Brock Long a la CNN la semana pasada.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities.","(Reuters) - The news out of South Korea is dominated by political instability, but inside the country, strong and stable relationships between academia and industry continue to drive economic growth and technological innovation. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - “Blade Runner 2049” is heading for a downbeat $31.5 million opening weekend at 4,058 sites in North America.

Sunday’s estimated result throws serious doubt onto what had been high hopes for a box office success story. In one of the most surprising turnarounds in recent years, “Blade Runner 2049” fell far short of expectations, which had been in the $45 million to $50 million range at the start of the weekend amid stellar reviews, strong advance ticket sales, and the revered status of 1982’s original “Blade Runner.”

Instead, the film grossed only a moderate $12.7 million on Friday, including $4 million from Thursday night previews. Saturday saw an 11% decline to $11.4 million and Sunday’s projected total was $7.4 million.

The key factors for the under-performance were the movie’s 163-minute running time -- which limits the number of showings each day -- plus far less traction among younger moviegoers than anticipated.

“The core of enthusiastic and loyal ‘Blade Runner’ fans were over 25 and predominantly male and propelled the film as expected to the top spot, but a lengthy running time and lesser interest among females made it tougher for the film to reach the original weekend box office projections,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore.

According to PostTrack, males over 25 represented 50% of the audience and females over 25 were 27%, while males under 25 represented 15% of moviegoers and females under 25 were 8%. Males gave the movie an A CinemaScore, while females gave it a B+.

Warner Bros. is handling domestic distribution on “Blade Runner 2049,” starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, through its output deal with Alcon Entertainment. Financed by Alcon and Sony and laden with special effects, the film carries a $150 million price tag. Denis Villeneuve helms the sequel film, which is set in a bleak 2049 Los Angeles with Gosling starring as an LAPD officer dealing with replicants seeking freedom.

Warner Bros. domestic distribution president Jeff Goldstein said “Blade Runner 2049” had fallen short of expectations in mid-sized and smaller markets along with the South and Midwest, where the running time and Major League Baseball playoffs appeared to have held down attendance.

“We did well in the major and high-profile markets,” he added. “Alcon and Denis made an amazing movie. The audience for it was narrower than we anticipated.”

Fox’s opening of survival drama “The Mountain Between Us,” starring Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, was the weekend’s runner-up, coming in slightly below projections with a moderate $10.1 million at 3,088 venues. Based on the Charles Martin novel, the film stars Elba as a surgeon and Winslet as a journalist who are left stranded together following a plane crash. Reviews have been mixed, earning the film a 46% score on Rotten Tomatoes.

Lionsgate’s animated “My Little Pony” trotted in with a modest $8.8 million at 2,528 locations, slightly above forecasts. Based on the Hasbro toys and TV series, the movie’s voice cast includes Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Uzo Aduba, and Sia.

The fifth weekend of New Line’s blockbuster “It” showed plenty of staying power in third place with $9.6 million at 3,197 sites. It will close the weekend with $305 million domestically plus $298.8 million internationally to top the $600 million worldwide mark.

Fox’s third weekend of “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” and Universal’s second weekend of “American Made” were battling for fifth place with about $8.1 million each, followed by Warner’s third weekend of “The Lego Ninjago Movie” with $6.8 million. Focus Features’ expansion of Judi Dench’s “Victoria & Abdul” came in eighth with $4.1 million at 732 locations.",Box Office: 'Blade Runner 2049' fades to $31.5 million opening weekend,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-boxoffice/box-office-blade-runner-2049-fades-to-31-5-million-opening-weekend-idINKBN1CD0QY

(Reuters) - World number one Rafael Nadal produced a ruthless performance to thrash Australian Nick Kyrgios 6-2 6-1 in the China Open final on Sunday for his 75th career singles title.

The 31-year-old was given a tough fight early on but Kyrgios’s challenge faded after he lost his temper and was docked a penalty point at 2-5 in the first set.

Nadal’s previous title at the tournament came 12 years ago.

“I had very tough draw here,” Nadal, who saved match points in his opening round against Frenchman Lucas Pouille, said.

“I was lucky the first day saving the two match points but after that I think I played one of my best events of the year.”

World number 19 Kyrgios matched Nadal early on, winning his opening two service games but became involved in a debate with umpire Mohamed Lahyani over a close line call against him.

“I can’t play at 100 percent if that stuff happens -- and then you expect me not to be angry,” Kyrgios told Lahyani.

He continued to argue the toss with the official who eventually awarded a penalty point against the Australian during the changeover when he trailed 2-5, meaning he began the eighth game already 0-15 behind.

Nadal was well in control by then and he raced into a 5-0 lead in the second set before Kyrgios slightly delayed the inevitable as the Spaniard sauntered to his 12th consecutive win.

“He played well. I played terrible. He’s in great form. He just destroyed me today, so it was too good,” Kyrgios, who struck 20 winners but 35 unforced errors, said.

“I put in a pretty good week, had some good wins. It’s tough to find positives when you won three games in the final. But I guess there were positives. In the semi-final I played well, obviously beating Alex (Zverev).”

Kyrgios still has a chance of qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals as he is 15th in the Race standings with several tournaments remaining to close the gap on those in front.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said on Sunday her new party aims to offer voters a “middle of the fairway” choice, seeking to differentiate her group from ruling, conservative Liberal Democratic Party and smaller, left-leaning opposition parties.

Koike’s Party of Hope has emerged as a formidable challenge to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) at the Oct. 22 election, promising to freeze a planned 2019 sales tax hike and consider a new tax on companies’ retained earnings.

“If I use a golf course metaphor, right now, I believe we have right (wing parties) and left (wing parties) and nothing in between. So we will present ourselves as the fairway, the very centre of the way,” Koike told a policy debate by major party leaders.

Koike said her party’s policies aim to bring a new idea such as basic income and will be closer to consumers.

“The idea of basic income is still experimental but we think this is something we should consider in the future,” she said.

But Koike declined to reveal who would lead a government should her party, formed only about two weeks ago by her supporters and some opposition lawmakers, be in a position to form one.

“I will think about it after we see the results of the election,” she said.

Koike, a former LDP lawmaker, has repeatedly denied she would run for a seat in the election, which means she could not lead a government herself as the constitution stipulates a prime minister has to be selected from elected lawmakers.

That has led to speculation her Party of Hope may tie up with some LDP lawmakers who have been alienated by Abe, such as former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba.

She told Reuters on Friday that all options were on the table regarding whom her party would back when parliament convenes to vote on a prime minister after the election.

While Party of Hope’s economic policies differ from those of Abe’s conservative LDP, but many of its security and diplomatic policies echo LDP’s agenda, including revision to Japan’s pacifist constitution.

To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point.
If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy.","Protestors against President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed liberalization of French labor laws were on the streets of the country’s cities on Tuesday. The marchers, chanting slogans and brandishing placards, halted traffic as they moved slowly through the streets. A fringe of anarchists broke windows; police responded by firing tear gas. But this was no rerun of the mass marches of past years, let alone the semi-revolutionary eruptions of 1968.

France’s second-largest union, the Conféderation Générale du Travail (CGT) was the only one of the three main workers’ organizations that took part. Another protest, this one organized by the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party is scheduled for Sept. 23. This week’s marching columns numbered, nationwide, in the few hundred thousand rather than the many millions hoped for – the police claimed 223,000, the organizers 400,000. There was little effect on production, services or transport.

It was neither victory nor defeat for either side. Instead, Macron’s changes to the vast labor code – hiring and firing will be easier, some workplace issues will be negotiated at company level – hang in the balance. The CGT, the left and the far-right National Front all oppose them, but Macron and his government have a solid, if inexperienced, majority in the Assembly.

More than his predecessors who tried and failed to liberalize France’s labor market – the center-right Nicolas Sarkozy and the center-left Francois Hollande – Macron has pinned the credibility of his presidency on systemic, cultural change, a deliberate jolting of French society and economy out of the rut into which he believes it has fallen. He is contemptuous of both former presidents (he knew Hollande well, having been both his advisor and Finance Minister), believing them to have given up too soon and too easily. When Macron spoke, as he did earlier this month, of “slackers,” he said when challenged that he meant those who retreated from the necessary surgery on France’s body politic The marchers, however, seized on the word and put it on their placards: “Macron, the slackers will kick you out,” read one.

The slackers have a point. Indeed, they have several. Labor productivity in France is relatively good, only a little behind that of the United States and the highest of Europe’s major economies. When French workers work, they work well.

Though both Macron’s labor and economic reforms have won support from the center-right and from many economists, France remains doubtful, even hostile. Perhaps the best-known Frenchman in political and intellectual circles before Macron was the economist Thomas Piketty, whose “Capital in the 21st Century” (2013) is a best seller and who has excoriated his country both for its steeply rising inequality and its hypocrisy in pretending it is egalitarian. Hypocritical it may be, but it clings to the myth, and perfectly bourgeois Frenchmen and -women may recoil from an obvious widening of the income and wealth gaps.

To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point. Germany liberalized its labor market through the so-called Hartz reforms between 2003 and 2005, but unlike France the German unions were relatively moderate, wage bargaining was already localized and investment was rising. In addition, the costs of German unification had already been paid.

If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy. That is also dependent on other ifs – if the present improvement in the European Union economy continues (the European Commission, while underscoring that all members are growing, warns of “higher-than-usual uncertainty) and if investment increases, then France could become more like Germany. The German (and EU) leader Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to see that, and Macron wishes to show her he can deliver.

Yet delivery of this kind of economy now comes with an apparently unavoidable cost. Faster growth and even a fall in unemployment produces an ever-larger underclass, composed both of those with few qualifications and the still-increasing numbers of immigrants, often from poor countries. Macron’s opponents like to quote the Cambridge University economist Christopher Bickerton, who argued in a New York Times column that “not since the economic boom of the 1950s and ’60s has capitalism in Europe been dynamic enough to combine high levels of employment with long-term material gains for the masses.” It will not do so, he believes, under Macron.

The deeper movement, about which Macron can do little, is that the greater integration into the global economy that he champions produces huge gains for the top one percent, more modest rises for the well educated and skilled, but a much larger tail of the precarious, insecure and low paid. The leftist German think tank, the Rosa Luxemburg Institute, called this trend “the end of social capitalism.” A sign of this is the general decline of social democratic parties such as the once-mighty German Social Democrats and the shrunken French Socialists. Only in the UK has the main left party, Labour, made substantial political gains with a far-left leadership.

Social democracy depended on, and greatly furthered, “social capitalism.” It did so in France, under socialist governments, did so again in Germany and still does, though with difficulty, in the Scandinavian states. Organized labor had a place, even an honored and at times powerful one. Now, its gains are a hindrance, its ideology no longer attractive. The leaders of the further left – such as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Insoumise in France - gain by being fundamentalists, opposed to capitalism itself, social or not.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Disagreement among U.S. congressional Republicans is already swirling around a tax cut plan unveiled days ago by President Donald Trump, who has proposed repealing the tax on inheritances and eliminating a deduction for state and local tax payments.

The discord shows the difficulty of overhauling the complex U.S. tax code. This task has defied Washington since 1986, the last time a comprehensive rewrite was completed despite lobbyists who defend each tax break.

Trump has yet to score a major legislative win since taking office in January and is pushing hard for a tax code revamp. But his plan is meeting the same internal Republican tensions between moderates and conservatives that have sunk his efforts this year to repeal the Obamacare health law.

“There’s a lot of give and take,” Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn told Fox Business Network on Friday.

Members of the administration “have been meeting everyday with the tax writers trying to figure out where they need to end up to get the votes ... we’re going to make sure the president gets what he asks for,” he added.

One obstacle is the projected fiscal impact of the plan, which would slash U.S. revenues and expand the federal deficit and the national debt, which now exceeds $20 trillion.

Republican lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York exited meetings this week with Kevin Brady, chairman of the House of Representatives’ tax-writing committee, saying there would be some sort of compromise on repealing the deduction for state and local tax payments.

Separately, some Republican senators were questioning the repeal of a 40 percent inheritance tax levied on estate assets worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for married couples. That tax affects only about 0.2 percent of estates, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank.

“That is not a priority for me as we seek to craft this tax bill,” Senator Susan Collins, who has often been a key Republican vote, said in a statement on Thursday.

Republicans want to use a procedure known as budget reconciliation to pass eventual tax legislation, which allows passage with a simple majority in the 100-seat Senate. Republicans hold 52 Senate seats and can only afford to lose support from two senators, with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a tie-breaking vote. Democrats will likely oppose the legislation.

One Republican fiscal hawk, Senator Bob Corker, has already said he cannot support tax legislation that adds to the annual federal deficit.

“We remain very bearish on any tax legislation passing this year - or next,” Cowen and Co analyst Chris Krueger said in a Friday research note.

The Trump plan, made public last week, calls for up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. Without accompanying spending reductions, the budget would hugely expand the deficit, according to some estimates.

The administration contends tax cuts would spur so much economic growth that the resulting new revenues would help offset the cost.

In addition, Republicans are proposing “revenue raisers,” such as ending the deduction for payments of state and local tax, known as SALT. Doing that would raise about $1.3 trillion over a decade, the Tax Policy Center said.

Almost 30 percent of taxpayers currently deduct state and local taxes. In New Jersey, for example, 41 percent of tax filers, meaning individuals or married couples, claimed the deduction, which averaged $17,850, according to a Government Finance Officers Association analysis of Internal Revenue Service data.

Although the deduction disproportionately benefits people in high-tax states and localities, individuals in all states claim it. In Georgia, for example, 33 percent of tax filers claim an average deduction of $9,158, the report said.

Republican Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Trump ally, told reporters earlier this week that lawmakers from high-tax states, such as his own, were discussing “ways to level the playing field,” including capping the amount of the deduction or putting other limits on it.

“There are many districts with Republican members where state and local deduction is used by a large portion of the taxpayers,” said Frank Sammartino, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. “So it’s not surprising that it’s not strictly a blue state/red state thing.”

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the state and local tax deduction the “Achilles’ heel” of tax reform and said his party would oppose any move to repeal it. He dismissed compromise plans as unfeasible.

Brady said on Thursday that at this point there has been no change to the framework, but tax writers are “listening very carefully” to lawmakers’ concerns.

“It’s got to be frustrating when you’re in a state where local and state officials really put the screws to taxpayers,” Brady told reporters. “We are determined to provide tax relief to every American, regardless of where they live.”",Discord among Republicans already weighs on Trump's tax plan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-salt/discord-among-republicans-already-weighs-on-trumps-tax-plan-idUSKBN1CB13X

The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) did not say what action it would take after the ceasefire ends at midnight on Monday but it was “determined to stop the tyranny and oppression” waged against the Rohingya people.

“If at any stage, the Burmese government is inclined to peace, then ARSA will welcome that inclination and reciprocate,” the group said in a statement.

Government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment.

When the ARSA announced its one-month ceasefire from Sept. 10, a government spokesman said: “We have no policy to negotiate with terrorists.”

The rebels launched coordinated attacks on about 30 security posts and an army camp on Aug. 25 with the help of hundreds of disaffected Rohingya villagers, many wielding sticks or machetes, killing about a dozen people.

In response, the military unleashed a sweeping offensive across the north of Rakhine State, driving more than half a million Rohingya villagers into Bangladesh in what the United Nations branded a textbook example of “ethnic cleansing”.

Myanmar rejects that. It says more than 500 people have been killed in the fighting, most of them “terrorists” who have been attacking civilians and torching villages.

The ability of the ARSA, which only surfaced in October last year, to mount any sort of challenge to the Myanmar army is not known but it does not appear to have been able to put up resistance to the military offensive unleashed in August.

Inevitably, there are doubts about how the insurgents can operate in areas where the military has driven out the civilian population, cutting the insurgents off from recruits, food, funds and information.

The ARSA accused the government of using murder, arson and rape as “tools of depopulation”.

‘NATIVE’

The ARSA denies links to foreign Islamists.

In an interview with Reuters in March, ARSA leader Ata Ullah linked the creation of the group to communal violence between Buddhists and Muslims in Rakhine in 2012, when nearly 200 people were killed and 140,000, mostly Rohingya, displaced.

The group says it is fighting for the rights of the Rohingya, who have never been regarded as an indigenous minority in Myanmar and so have been denied citizenship under a law that links nationality to ethnicity.

The group repeated their demand that Rohingya be recognized as a “native indigenous” ethnic group, adding that all Rohingya people should be allowed “to return home safely with dignity ... to freely determine their political status and pursue their economic, social and cultural development”.

The Rohingya have long faced discrimination and repression in Rakhine State where bad blood between them and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, stemming from violence by both sides, goes back generations.

The ARSA condemned the government for blocking humanitarian assistance in Rakhine and said it was willing to discuss ceasefires with international organizations so aid could be delivered.

Some 515,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh but thousands remain in Rakhine.

Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although a military-drafted constitution gives her no power over the security forces.

Suu Kyi has condemned rights abuses and said Myanmar was ready to start a process agreed with Bangladesh in 1993 by which anyone verified as a refugee would be accepted back.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was taking an indefinite leave from the Weinstein Co, the film production company said on Friday, adding it will conduct an internal investigation into the New York Times’ report of sexual harassment allegations against one of the most powerful men in Hollywood.

The Weinstein Company board of representatives said in a statement that it takes “extremely seriously” the accusations made in the Times story that said Weinstein had made eight settlements with women who had accused him of unwanted physical contact and sexual harassment over three decades.

Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and several Democratic politicians including Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer said Friday they will re-route Weinstein’s political donations to women’s rights groups.

Weinstein Co board representatives called it “essential” to company culture “that all women who work for it or have any dealings with it or any of our executives are treated with respect and have no experience of harassment or discrimination.”

The company said it has retained an outside legal firm to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations.

Weinstein, 65, will take an indefinite leave of absence, the company said. His brother Bob, a co-chairman, and chief operating officer David Glasser will lead the company.

“As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged. Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board’s independent investigation, and Harvey’s own personal decisions,” the board representatives added.

Weinstein initially responded to the Times story on Thursday by apologizing for causing anyone pain, and saying he was taking a leave of absence.

His lawyer later threatened to sue the New York Times.

Weinstein, one of Hollywood’s best-known figures, has produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies including “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago.” He was a prominent donor to Democrats during the 2016 general election campaign.

“The DNC will donate over $30,000 in contributions from Weinstein to EMILY’s List, Emerge America and Higher Heights because what we need is more women in power,” DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement.",Weinstein on indefinite leave as company investigates allegations,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CB2UQ-OCAEN

Republicans in Congress and the White House haven’t been able to get any major legislation passed yet. But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil producers may need to take “some extraordinary measures” next year to rebalance the oil market, the OPEC secretary-general said on Sunday.

“There is a growing consensus that ... a rebalancing process is under way. We are gradually but steadily achieving our common and noble objectives,” Mohammad Barkindo told reporters at the India Energy Forum organised by CERAWeek in New Delhi.

“To sustain this into next year, some extraordinary measures may have to be taken in order to restore this stability on a sustainable basis going forward,” he said, without elaborating.

Saudi Arabia and Russia helped secure a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 rival producers to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March 2018 in an effort to reduce a glut.

Barkindo said consultations were under way for the extension of the OPEC-led pact beyond March 2018 and that more oil producing nations may join the supply pact, possibly at the next meeting of OPEC in Vienna on Nov. 30.

He also said that Nigeria and Libya, who are exempted from the pact, “are making progress towards full recovery” of production, after which they could join the OPEC-led agreement.

Oil futures LCOc1 fell more than 2 percent on Friday, ending Brent crude’s longest multi-week rally in 16 months as oversupply concerns reappeared as producers have started hedging future drilling. [O/R]

But Barkindo said he was not worried about the rise in U.S. shale oil and gas output.

“It is a big market and demand is very strong. Between the first half and second half this year, demand growth is almost about 2 million barrels (per day), which is very robust,” he said. “So everybody has a role to play.”

On Friday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he hoped to reach a consensus with Russia and other major oil producers on the future of the deal before November’s meeting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The powerful U.S. gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, said on Sunday it would oppose an outright ban on bump-stock devices that the killer in the Las Vegas massacre of 58 people used to turn rifles into automatic weapons and strafe a crowd with bursts of sustained gunfire.

The NRA, which has seldom embraced new firearms-control measures, stunned gun control advocates last week when it issued a statement voicing willingness to support a restriction on bump stocks.

On Sunday, the organization said it was open to regulation but opposed any legislation banning the devices.

“We don’t believe that bans have ever worked on anything. What we have said has been very clear - that if something transfers a semiautomatic to function like a fully automatic, then it ought to be regulated differently,” Chris Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Police said the gunman, Stephen Paddock, 64, fitted 12 of his weapons with bump-stock devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns, which are otherwise outlawed in the United States.

Cox and Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s chief executive, accused the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives under Democratic former President Barack Obama of paving the way for the use of bump stocks and creating legal confusion about their usage.

Republican President Donald Trump was an outspoken advocate of gun rights during his 2016 campaign for the White House. The NRA spent more than $30 million in support of his candidacy.

NO REPUBLICAN SUPPORT

LaPierre lashed out at U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who has pushed for gun-control legislation on Capitol Hill.

“I think you want to tell ATF to do its job. It’s an interpretive issue and they need to get the job done. But not let Dianne Feinstein, which is what she wants to do - turn this all of this into some Christmas tree on the Hill where she brings all of her anti-gun circus she has been trying to do for years into this,” LaPierre said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Feinstein said she has garnered some Republican interest, but no support, for the measure. “I have nobody lined up,” she told the CBS program.

Some gun-control advocates praised the NRA for showing some flexibility.

“This is the first time that the gun lobby has shown willingness to come to the table and I think that’s in part because Americans just simply do not accept mass shooting after mass shooting happening and Congress doing absolutely nothing,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

But Sunday’s comments from the NRA representatives suggested nothing may have changed as they castigated calls for gun-control measures in the emotional aftermath of a mass shooting.

“There used to be a common decency in this country where people paused talking about policy. Unfortunately with Dianne Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, they want to exploit a tragedy from Day One. It’s shameful, but apparently that’s the new normal.” Cox said on the “Fox News Sunday” program.

Bloomberg, a billionaire and former mayor of New York, has been an outspoken critic of the National Rifle Association through the group Everytown for Gun Safety.

But an administrator is not among them - nobody has been nominated to the top job since President Donald Trump took office.

Also missing from the roughly 550 people on the payroll of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, are a permanent chief counsel, director for government affairs, chief financial officer and enforcement chief.

While a deputy administrator was appointed last week, slow progress in bringing in senior politically appointed officials has nearly frozen key decision-making at the agency, according to five former NHTSA officials, consumer groups, lawmakers and some business leaders.

They said that without leadership in place NHTSA has either pushed back or failed to act on rules setting new standards for improving how buses fare in rollover crashes, a system to remind passengers in rear seats to wear seat belts, and new tire standards.

Eight months into Trump’s presidency, senior positions in many government agencies across Washington remain vacant, including roles at the State Department, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and throughout the Transportation Department that oversees NHTSA.

Some of the vacancies are the result of Trump’s efforts to slim down the federal bureaucracy. Others are simply waiting to be filled.

The White House blames Democrats for dragging out the confirmation process for its nominees, and says vetting picks has been more complicated than usual because many come from the business world rather than government.

While many companies applaud Trump’s moves to roll back federal bureaucracy, some also complain that delays in bringing aboard political appointees is hindering government decisions that could impact business.

The frustration extends to some U.S. diplomats, private-sector lawyers and others who regularly deal with government agencies, according to interviews.

‘IN A STALL’

In September, the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association urged Trump in a letter to accelerate his efforts to nominate a NHTSA administrator so the agency can comply with a 2015 road safety law passed by Congress.

The law ordered NHTSA to write regulations setting minimum tire standards for fuel efficiency and traction in wet conditions and create an online database for consumers to check for tire recalls.

U.S. manufacturers and consumer groups support the regulations, drawn up in response to vehicle deaths linked to faulty tires, because they will raise standards and make the U.S. market less accessible to poorly made versions.

“We don’t want the U.S. to be kind of the dumping group for the really low technology because there isn’t a standard to meet,” said Dan Zielinski, the association’s senior vice president.

Two former NHTSA leaders and consumer groups say the agency is also moving slowly on other regulatory issues, such as improving side impact standards.

“This agency is in a stall ... They are not going to do very much without political leadership,” said Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator under President Jimmy Carter and a prominent consumer advocate.

NHTSA said in a statement Friday that safety is its top priority. The agency is “committed to meeting all obligations as required” by the 2015 law. NHTSA has an ongoing review of all regulatory actions as part of an administration-wide effort.

A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on NHTSA but said “capable and professional staff” are filling essential positions throughout the government on an acting basis until confirmations go through.

Leadership shortages extend beyond the NHTSA. The White House had by Oct. 4 nominated 387 political appointees for civilian positions in the executive branch and 160 have been confirmed by the U.S. Senate, according to the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service.

Both numbers were well below those in the first eight months under at least the last four presidents. In the same period of Barack Obama’s presidency, 497 candidates were nominated and 337 confirmed.

One senior administration official said it aims to have all top positions - those at the level of assistant secretary and above - nominated by year’s end.

Still, some political appointee jobs are expected to stay empty, the White House spokeswoman said. “The federal government has grown unrestrained for decades because politicians have been too afraid to ‘drain the swamp’,” she said.

‘BEHIND THE CURVE’

In many cases, dire warnings from opponents that Trump’s delays in putting forward political nominations for approval would cause chaos have proven overblown.

But there are examples of government slowing down because mid-level employees do not have the authority or are unwilling to make decisions.

At the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which analyzes proposed transactions to ensure they do not harm national security, private-sector lawyers complain of slow decisions on big deals.

“There is an unwillingness for the staff people to make a decision,” said Michael Gershberg, a trade and investment attorney with Fried Frank.

A lobbyist who works on CFIUS deals said some companies have had to refile proposals because CFIUS failed to reach a decision within 75 days. That drives up legal and financing fees and creates uncertainty about the deal. Deals that have been refiled include a bid by Jack Ma’s Ant Financial to buy MoneyGram (MGI.O) and Zhongwang USA’s $2.33 billion bid for Aleris Corp (ALSD.PK).

The Senate last week confirmed Heath Tarbert, who is expected to oversee CFIUS, as an assistant secretary of the Treasury.

At the State Department, only six of the top 40 jobs have been filled, and no confirmed officials are in place to run regional bureaus that handle foreign relations. Instead, they are in the hands of career diplomats with limited authority.

The United States does not have an ambassador in place in such key allied countries as South Korea, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

”We’re pretty much frozen in amber here,” one official said.

A congressional aide said it was hard to determine the precise impact of the vacancies.

But he added that U.S. policy in the North Korea missiles crisis would likely be helped by an ambassador in Seoul, a fully empowered assistant secretary of state for East Asia and an active special envoy for North Korea.

“That’s just one example in the region with the most prominent national security crisis, and really one of the most serious in a long time,” he said.

Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, testifying in Congress on Sept. 26, addressed the slow pace of filling posts.

”We’re behind the curve. We should be ahead of the curve. And we’re doing all we can to catch up,” he said. “Our work is getting done. It would be better done if we had those positions filled.”",Help wanted: Staff shortages under Trump slow policy changes,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-staff/help-wanted-staff-shortages-under-trump-slow-policy-changes-idUSKBN1CB1AL

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Some of China’s top oil refineries are having to take the highly unusual step of cutting operations during what is typically the peak demand summer season when hot weather drives up power usage and families take to the road during school holidays.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - “Blade Runner 2049” is heading for a downbeat $31.5 million opening weekend at 4,058 sites in North America.

Sunday’s estimated result throws serious doubt onto what had been high hopes for a box office success story. In one of the most surprising turnarounds in recent years, “Blade Runner 2049” fell far short of expectations, which had been in the $45 million to $50 million range at the start of the weekend amid stellar reviews, strong advance ticket sales, and the revered status of 1982’s original “Blade Runner.”

Instead, the film grossed only a moderate $12.7 million on Friday, including $4 million from Thursday night previews. Saturday saw an 11% decline to $11.4 million and Sunday’s projected total was $7.4 million.

The key factors for the under-performance were the movie’s 163-minute running time -- which limits the number of showings each day -- plus far less traction among younger moviegoers than anticipated.

“The core of enthusiastic and loyal ‘Blade Runner’ fans were over 25 and predominantly male and propelled the film as expected to the top spot, but a lengthy running time and lesser interest among females made it tougher for the film to reach the original weekend box office projections,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore.

According to PostTrack, males over 25 represented 50% of the audience and females over 25 were 27%, while males under 25 represented 15% of moviegoers and females under 25 were 8%. Males gave the movie an A CinemaScore, while females gave it a B+.

Warner Bros. is handling domestic distribution on “Blade Runner 2049,” starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, through its output deal with Alcon Entertainment. Financed by Alcon and Sony and laden with special effects, the film carries a $150 million price tag. Denis Villeneuve helms the sequel film, which is set in a bleak 2049 Los Angeles with Gosling starring as an LAPD officer dealing with replicants seeking freedom.

Warner Bros. domestic distribution president Jeff Goldstein said “Blade Runner 2049” had fallen short of expectations in mid-sized and smaller markets along with the South and Midwest, where the running time and Major League Baseball playoffs appeared to have held down attendance.

“We did well in the major and high-profile markets,” he added. “Alcon and Denis made an amazing movie. The audience for it was narrower than we anticipated.”

Fox’s opening of survival drama “The Mountain Between Us,” starring Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, was the weekend’s runner-up, coming in slightly below projections with a moderate $10.1 million at 3,088 venues. Based on the Charles Martin novel, the film stars Elba as a surgeon and Winslet as a journalist who are left stranded together following a plane crash. Reviews have been mixed, earning the film a 46% score on Rotten Tomatoes.

Lionsgate’s animated “My Little Pony” trotted in with a modest $8.8 million at 2,528 locations, slightly above forecasts. Based on the Hasbro toys and TV series, the movie’s voice cast includes Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Uzo Aduba, and Sia.

The fifth weekend of New Line’s blockbuster “It” showed plenty of staying power in third place with $9.6 million at 3,197 sites. It will close the weekend with $305 million domestically plus $298.8 million internationally to top the $600 million worldwide mark.

Fox’s third weekend of “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” and Universal’s second weekend of “American Made” were battling for fifth place with about $8.1 million each, followed by Warner’s third weekend of “The Lego Ninjago Movie” with $6.8 million. Focus Features’ expansion of Judi Dench’s “Victoria & Abdul” came in eighth with $4.1 million at 732 locations.",Box Office: 'Blade Runner 2049' fades to $31.5 million opening weekend,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-boxoffice/box-office-blade-runner-2049-fades-to-31-5-million-opening-weekend-idINKBN1CD0QY?il=0

Cette réforme, qui ne conserve que les biens immobiliers dans le champ de l‘ISF, nourrit les accusations de l‘opposition contre une présumée “présidence des riches” et suscite des réserves au sein de la majorité qui a décidé de déposer plusieurs amendements au PLF 2018 dont l‘examen débute cette semaine en commission des Finances à l‘Assemblée nationale.

“L‘idée de la réforme est que tout ce qui relève de l‘économie productive ne doit pas avoir de frein, qu‘il faut supprimer les impôts repoussoirs pour ceux qui veulent investir en France, de façon à créer des emplois”, rappelle Richard Ferrand dans un entretien à Dimanche Ouest France.

“Taxer la fortune immobilière va dans ce sens, mais des biens comme les yachts, les voitures de grand luxe ou les métaux précieux ne concourent pas non plus à l‘économie productive. Réintroduire des taxes sur ces valeurs n‘est pas en contradiction avec l‘esprit de la réforme, et nous le faisons en accord avec le gouvernement, pour un budget juste et efficace”, justifie-t-il.

Ainsi, les droits annuels de francisation et les droits de passeport pour les yachts de plus de 30 mètres seraient relevés pour un gain de 10 millions d‘euros “qu‘il sera possible d‘affecter à la SNSM” (Société nationale de sauvetage en mer), précise le chef de file des députés LREM.

Seraient concernés les résidents français propriétaires de bateaux de plus de 30 mètres, ou qui en utilisent via des sociétés commerciales, même battant pavillon étranger ou installés hors de France.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian wage growth accelerated at its fastest pace in over a year in September, keeping alive the possibility that the Bank of Canada could hike interest rates for a third time by the end of the year.

Average hourly wages for permanent employees rose 2.2 percent last month from a year ago, Statistics Canada said in its jobs report on Friday.

The acceleration, which was the fastest annual pace since June 2016, suggested there may be a recovery in wage growth, which has been weak despite strong labor market gains over the past year and is being closely watched by the Bank of Canada.

Analysts said the growth in wages was more encouraging than September’s increase of 10,000 jobs, which was below forecasts and pointed to a cooling economy over the second half of the year.

The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates twice this year, spurred by strong economic growth that has put Canada at the top of the Group of Seven nations.

While expectations for a third rate hike later this month have dwindled following cautious comments from policymakers, markets placed the odds of an increase at 18 percent after the jobs report, compared to 12.2 percent before.

“I think this is going to reinforce the Bank of Canada’s expectations that we’re spiraling upward on wage and price pressures in the Canadian economy,” said Derek Holt, vice president of economics at Scotiabank.

Although Holt continues to expect a hike at the central bank’s meeting in December, he said the possibility of an October increase was still in play.

Markets put the odds of a December hike at 64.3 percent.

The Canadian dollar touched a five-week low against its U.S. counterpart immediately after the Canadian jobs report before recovering some losses to trade little changed.

Jimmy Jean, senior economist at Desjardins Capital Markets, said the wage growth was “a pretty rapid improvement,” though he did not expect it to move the needle on the October rate decision.

“It is a sign that the job market is tightening,” Jean said.

September’s job gains were driven by the public sector, which added 26,200 positions, while the private sector shed 15,500 jobs. The unemployment rate held steady at 6.2 percent as the number of people looking for work edged down.

The education sector led the way up, adding 20,000 positions, while the public administration field added 4,500 jobs.

SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - Jolyon Palmer said farewell to the Renault team on Sunday and probably Formula One as well.

The under-performing Briton is being replaced by Spaniard Carlos Sainz for the remaining four races of the season and left the Japanese Grand Prix with no more points than the eight he arrived with.

All of those were scored in one race, in Singapore where he was sixth out of just 12 finishers, leaving 15 other complete blanks.

Palmer managed only one point in all of 2016 when Renault had just taken over the failing Lotus team and were struggling with an uncompetitive car.

Asked about his plans for 2018, he told Sky Sports television that he did not know.

“When I‘m sat on the plane on the way back home, probably it will sink in that certainly I won’t be driving for Renault again and maybe not in Formula One again,” he said.

“I‘m out and that’s Formula One. These things happen. It’s a shame but I’ll move on. There’s plenty to life out there and I‘m about to find out what it is.”

Renault had announced on Saturday that they and Palmer, son of former racer Jonathan, had agreed a parting of the ways.

“I‘m feeling alright,” said the 26-year-old former GP2 champion, who started his last race from 18th place after engine-related grid penalties were applied and ended up 12th.

“I respect the decision and wish the team still the best for the future, Carlos the best and we go our separate ways.”

While Palmer has struggled, highly-rated German team mate Nico Hulkenberg has finished in the points on six occasions this year and scored 34 points.

“The stress levels have been pretty huge this year,” Palmer added.

“It’s been a very tough season for many reasons and each weekend turning up with some question marks, with the pressure coming on more and more as the season hasn’t unfolded like we’d hoped.”",Palmer looks to new horizons after Formula One exit,https://www.reuters.com/article/motor-f1-japan-palmer/motor-racing-palmer-looks-to-new-horizons-after-formula-one-exit-idINKBN1CD0Q8?il=0

While the referendum is non-binding and the final vote tally may not be known for several days (though it will certainly be “yes” to independence), the true results of America’s decades of war in Iraq are already clear.

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice ""Iraq"" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

Tania Karas: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.",Commentary: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-kurds-commentary/commentary-why-the-kurdish-referendum-means-the-end-of-iraq-idUSKCN1C125Q

Olympic bronze medalist Rupp used his track speed to break open the men’s race in the last five km to finish in a lifetime best two hours, nine minutes and 20 seconds in only his fourth marathon.

“It’s just incredible,” said Rupp, who took advantage of the race’s slow early pace to win, surging in the 38th km to take control.

“I made the mistake in the past of going a little too hard too soon,” said Rupp, the U.S. record holder at 10,000 meters on the track.

“But I just felt a little gap pulling away and at that point, it was like you’ve got to put the hammer down and drive to the finish.”

Defending champion Abel Kirui of Kenya, who was with Rupp at the time, could not keep pace.

“It is a huge win for his career, for the United States,” four-times Chicago winner Khalid Khannouchi, the last American to triumph in 2002, told NBC Chicago. “He has a bright future.”

Kirui finished second in 2:09:48 with countryman Bernard Kipyego third in 2:10:23.

Tatyana McFadden pipped American compatriot Amanda McGrory to win her seventh consecutive Chicago women’s wheelchair title and eighth overall.

McFadden, who had suffered blood clots before the Boston Marathon, and McGrory both were timed in 1:39:15 with Swiss Manuela Schar third (1:39:17).

Next time around, in 2021, those troops might be sharing their battle space with a different type of force: self-driving drones, tanks, ships and submersibles.

Drone warfare is hardly new – the first lethal attack conducted by an American unmanned aerial vehicle took place in Afghanistan in October 2001. What is now changing fast, however, is the ability of such unmanned systems to operate without a guiding human hand.

That’s a truly revolutionary shift – and one every major nation wants to be lead. Critics have long feared countries might be more willing to go to war with unmanned systems. Now, some see a very real risk control might pass beyond human beings altogether.

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has long warned that humanity might be on the verge of some cataclysmic errors when it comes to artificial intelligence. Last month, he ramped that up with a warning that the development of autonomous weapons platforms might provoke a potentially devastating arms race.

As if to reinforce Musk’s point, Russian President Vladimir Putin told students shortly thereafter that he believed the technology would be a game changer, making it clear Russia would plow resources into it. “The one who becomes leader in this will become ruler of the world,” Putin was quoted as saying.

China too is pushing ahead, believed by some experts to now be the global leader when it comes to developing autonomous swarms of drones.

Already, drones are able to fly themselves independently so they can stay airborne if they lose touch with human pilots. Soon they may be able to make their own tactical decisions. At Georgia Tech in the United States this summer, researchers programmed swarms of light drones to fight their own aerial dogfights. The U.S. military is trying out similar products.

That means one operator could command many, many more drones – or that they might not need direct supervision at all.

Even more important than what is happening in robotics may be the wider developments in artificial intelligence. That won’t make warfare necessarily more deadly – a bomb dropped from a drone is not in itself less lethal than one from a manned aircraft. While it’s possible that greater accuracy might reduce casualties, some analysts fear that the changes brought by new unmanned systems might themselves fuel new conflicts.

“Radical technological change begets radical government policy ideas,” concluded a July report on the topic produced for the U.S. intelligence community by Harvard University’s Belfer Center. It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.

Artificial intelligence could dramatically increase the efficiency of surveillance technology, allowing a single system to monitor perhaps millions of digital conversations, hacked personal devices and other sources of information. The implications could be terrifying, particularly in the hands of a state with little or no democratic oversight.

At a recent UK panel discussion, Britain’s former Special Forces director Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb predicted that by 2030, technological breakthroughs – not just AI, but quantum computing and beyond – would produce entirely unpredictable changes. Special force teams, he suggested, might well have a robotic and artificial intelligence component deployed alongside them – the U.S. Army calls this “manned-unmanned teaming.”

That sounds like something out of science fiction – and it might well look like it. Last year, Russia unveiled its FEDOR humanoid military robot, which it demonstrated firing a gun.

Most countries deliberately keep their defense AI secret, ultimately fueling the arms race Musk was warning about. Some scientists already worry about a real-world version of the premise for the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring “Terminator” film franchise in which the United States, fearing cyber attack, hands control of key military systems to the artificial intelligence Skynet. (Skynet, fearing its human creators might choose to turn it off, immediately launches a full-scale nuclear attack on humanity.)

For now, Western nations at least look keen to keep a human in the “kill chain.” Not all countries may make that choice, however. Russia has long had a reputation for trusting machines more than people, at one stage considering – and, some evidence suggests, building – an automated system to launch its nuclear arsenal should its command structure be destroyed by a first strike.

Outside of the military, there is evidence AI algorithms have already alarmed their creators. In August, Facebook shut down an AI experiment after programs involved began communicating with each other in a language the humans monitoring them could not understand.

Is this the end for ordinary human soldiering? Almost certainly not. It’s even been argued that a more complex, high-tech battlefield might require more soldiers, not fewer.

Robotic systems may be vulnerable to hacking, jamming and simply rendered inoperable through electronic warfare. Such techniques allow U.S.-led forces in Iraq to largely negate the off-the-shelf drones being used by Islamic State. Russia used similar techniques against Western-made drones in Ukraine.

That’s a worry for armed forces betting – like many industries – on automation. Britain’s new aircraft carrier has only a fraction of the sailors on its only slightly larger U.S. carrier counterparts, relying heavily on automatic systems to manage weaponry and damage control. The latest Russian tank, the T-14 Armata, has an automated turret that will usually be out of reach to most of its crew. Such techniques have clear advantages – but also mean that interfering with electronics could leave them useless.

Such technology is coming whether it is a good idea or not. Indeed, even relatively old military equipment increasingly can be retrofitted. Russian engineers have already demonstrated that they can adapt the 20-year-old T-90 tank to be controlled remotely.

Ironically, the North Korean crisis reminds us that the most dangerous technologies may well remain those invented more than 70 years ago – atomic weapons and the missiles that carry them. Even if mankind can avoid a nuclear apocalypse, however, the coming AI and robotic revolution may prove an equal existential challenge.",Commentary: The coming robot arms race,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-robots-commentary/commentary-the-coming-robot-arms-race-idUSKCN1BT1XN

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump aimed his Twitter account at sometime ally Senator Bob Corker on Sunday with a series of derisive posts blaming the Republican for the Iran nuclear deal and saying Corker wanted the secretary of state job.Corker, who announced his retirement from the Senate last month, responded to Trump with a sarcastic Twitter post of his own.

The senator from Tennessee had been considered by Trump for the secretary of state position in the months after Trump’s Nov. 8 election win. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been more critical of Trump in recent months, including over the handling of a white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August.

”Senator Bob Corker “begged” me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said “NO” and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement),“ Trump wrote. ”He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said “NO THANKS.” He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!

“Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn’t have the guts to run!”

Corker, whose retirement is a blow to the Republican Party struggling to balance divisions between mainstream and more populist wings, said in his tweet on Sunday: “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.”

Trump has long criticized the 2015 international nuclear pact, a signature foreign policy achievement of former President Barack Obama in which Iran agreed to reduce its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions.

Last week, asked about reported tensions between Trump and the person he eventually chose to be secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, Corker’s response was seen as a jab at Trump.

“I think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary [of Defense James] Mattis, and Chief of Staff [John] Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos,” Corker said, referring to Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly.

Corker also said Tillerson was “in an incredibly frustrating place” where he “ends up not being supported in the way that I hope a secretary of state would be supported,” according to media reports.

Sunday was not the first time Trump has tweeted about Corker and his apparent waffling about whether or not he should seek another Senate term.

In August, Trump said Corker was “constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in ‘18.”

That was after the senator’s remarks on Trump’s response to the Charlottesville demonstration.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil producers may need to take “some extraordinary measures” next year to rebalance the oil market, the OPEC secretary-general said on Sunday.

“There is a growing consensus that ... a rebalancing process is under way. We are gradually but steadily achieving our common and noble objectives,” Mohammad Barkindo told reporters at the India Energy Forum organized by CERAWeek in New Delhi.

“To sustain this into next year, some extraordinary measures may have to be taken in order to restore this stability on a sustainable basis going forward,” he said, without elaborating.

Saudi Arabia and Russia helped secure a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 rival producers to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March 2018 in an effort to reduce a glut.

Barkindo said consultations were under way for the extension of the OPEC-led pact beyond March 2018 and that more oil producing nations may join the supply pact, possibly at the next meeting of OPEC in Vienna on Nov. 30.

He also said that Nigeria and Libya, who are exempted from the pact, “are making progress towards full recovery” of production, after which they could join the OPEC-led agreement.

Oil futures fell more than 2 percent on Friday, ending Brent crude’s longest multi-week rally in 16 months as oversupply concerns reappeared as producers have started hedging future drilling. [O/R]

But Barkindo said he was not worried about the rise in U.S. shale oil and gas output.

“It is a big market and demand is very strong. Between the first half and second half this year, demand growth is almost about 2 million barrels (per day), which is very robust,” he said. “So everybody has a role to play.”

On Friday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he hoped to reach a consensus with Russia and other major oil producers on the future of the deal before November’s meeting.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hurricane Nate had curtailed 92 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output and up to 3 percent of refining capacity on Saturday as it sped toward energy facilities in the central U.S. Gulf Coast that largely were spared by Hurricane Harvey’s wrath nearly six weeks ago.

The fast-moving storm has forced evacuations at more than 300 U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore platforms, far more than the number affected by Harvey, which packed more of a punch when it hit the Texas coast.

Nate could still become a Category 2 storm, the second-weakest on a five-category scale used by meteorologists, with winds of up to 110 miles per hour (177 kph) before landfall later on Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said.

The storm was about 50 miles (80 km) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River on Saturday afternoon and moving at 23 mph, according to the NHC.

Its track has taken it closer to offshore production than Harvey, whose impact was greatest on refining centers. On Saturday, some 1.6 million barrels per day of oil and 2.48 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas output were halted by the storm, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement reported.

Colby Goatley, a meteorologist at Weather Decision Technologies Inc, said his firm is helping about 10 drilling rig operators chart a course away from Nate, which is producing waves of up to 30 feet (9.1 m) near its center.

“Rigs on the eastern side (of Nate) are racing westward to get on that more favorable side,” he said.

Weather Decision is expecting tropical storm-force winds to last about 12 hours, Goatley said, a relatively short period that will help offshore producers return to full operations quickly and rigs to return to their drilling sites.

Nate is converging on refineries that remained in operation during Harvey, with Phillips 66’s (PSX.N) Alliance plant, Valero Energy Corp’s (VLO.N) Meraux facility, and PBF Energy’s (PBF.N) Chalmette plant - all in Louisiana - and Chevron Corp’s (CVX.N) plant in Pascagoula, Mississippi, all within the impact zone.

Chevron halted production at the Pascagoula plant on Saturday, according to energy intelligence company Genscape. A Chevron spokesman declined to comment. Phillips 66 confirmed that it shut its Alliance refinery on Saturday.

Combined, the two process 587,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, of the nation’s refining capacity. Hurricane Harvey, which brought intense rains that flooded the Texas Gulf Coast, shut nearly a quarter of U.S. oil refining capacity.

Valero and PBF Energy were planning to keep running during Nate’s passage, according to sources familiar with those operations.

An up to 11-foot (3.4-m) storm surge is expected at the mouth of the Mississippi River in the next few hours, the NHC said at 5 p.m. (0900 GMT).

London’s market has slowed more sharply than the rest of the country but prices across Britain are rising only slowly, potentially boding ill for consumer demand which drives economic growth. The latest figures show British economic growth slowed to an annual 1.5 percent in the second quarter.

The value of the United Kingdom’s housing stock is now at a record £6.8 trillion, almost 1.5 times the value of all the companies on the London Stock Exchange.

Predicting the future direction of the market has become much more difficult, partly because far fewer houses are changing hands.

Five estate agents said sales had effectively ground to a halt in the second quarter due to the uncertainty about Britain’s planned withdrawal from the European Union, combined with higher property taxes and a slowing economy.

“There’s a lack of confidence in the housing market. We are not just not seeing sales,” said an estate agent in Central London, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation for his firm’s business.

The latest official statistics show the number of homes sold in London in May were down by over a third compared with two years ago. Preliminary data for June-August 2017 are even more dismal. Those houses that are on the market are taking longer to sell than a year ago, according to online portal Rightmove. tmsnrt.rs/2eZIvl8

WIDE RANGE OF VIEWS

Twenty-two property market experts surveyed in August by Reuters all said prices in London were over-valued, but their forecasts for the next three years ranged widely from a 17.5 percent drop to a 9 percent rise.

“Time to buckle up,” said Josh Holmans from Valunation, one of the most pessimistic respondents to a separate study by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors which predicted price falls in central London over the next year without giving figures.

“Unless sales pick up pace this train driver may stall her engine. Not confident at all,” he said.

Three estate agents told Reuters they were counting on continuing low interest rates to help house sales. While the Bank of England is widely expected to start raising rates soon, possibly as soon as Nov. 2, most economists expect only a modest and slowly rising path for rates ahead.

For housing, they are weighing worries that Brexit will squeeze incomes and hurt the capital’s big financial services industry against a shortage of homes in low-rise London that has long supported prices.

Martin Ellis, an economist with lender Halifax, is among the many who predict no rise in prices, but also no large drop.

“I think we’re going to be stuck with a flat market for the foreseeable future,” he said. “There is a squeeze on incomes and I don’t expect to see big falls in house prices that would improve affordability for a lot of people.”

Valentino said he bought his house in the early 1990s for 175,000 pounds and neither of his two children, in their early 20s, would be able to buy now.

British parents are predicted to lend more than £6.5 billion this year to help their children become first-time buyers, according to consultancy CEBR. But they often do so by moving somewhere cheaper, something they can only do if they can find a buyer for their more expensive existing home.

Overseas investors bought almost one in every five new-build homes in London last year, according to a study commissioned by London’s mayor. But they have turned cautious since the Brexit vote, property agents told Reuters.

Some developers have offered to pay the transaction tax in an attempt to win over buyers.

Some real estate agents say the wariness of foreign professionals working in London is adding to the weak market.

John King, a property broker in the affluent suburb of Wimbledon, said some non-British EU nationals were put off buying after their employers shortened their contracts due to uncertainty over their status in Britain after it leaves the EU in 2019.

The affordability crisis means only 65 percent of Britons now own their own homes, below the EU average of 70 percent. In London only half of households do.

Many potential sellers are staying put rather than risk a sale in the weak market. More than half of properties taken off the market so far in 2017 were withdrawn rather than sold, research firm LonRes said.

For now, Valentino is sticking with his plan to sell but he balked at his estate agent’s advice to drop the price a second time.

“Too low,” he said. “We will probably wait and hope things get better.”",London's housing market stalls; time to buckle up?,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-housing/londons-housing-market-stalls-time-to-buckle-up-idUKKBN1CB0PS

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.
American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party.
Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council.
What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did.","President Donald Trump’s opening speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday is drawing widespread criticism for his aggressive statements about North Korea and Iran, but it is just as significant for what he didn’t mention at all.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his ""America first"" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.","Commentary: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karas-trump-commentary/commentary-at-the-un-trumps-silences-spoke-volumes-idUSKCN1BW2AC

Russian officials have accused Washington of putting unwarranted pressure on the U.S. operations of RT, a Kremlin-funded broadcaster accused by some in Washington of interfering in domestic U.S. politics, which it denies.

The foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said the full weight of the U.S. authorities was being brought to bear against RT’s operations in the United States, and that Moscow had the right to respond.

“We have never used Russian law in relation to foreign correspondents as a lever of pressure, or censorship, or some kind of political influence, never,” Zakharova said in an interview with Russia’s NTV broadcaster. “But this is a particular case.”

She cited a 1991 Russian law which, she said, stated that if a Russian media outlet is subject to restrictions in a foreign country, then Moscow has the right to impose proportionate restrictions on media outlets from that country operating inside Russia.

“Correspondingly, everything that Russian journalists and the RT station are subject to on U.S. soil, after we qualified it as restriction of their activities, we can apply similar measures to American journalists, American media here, on Russian territory,” Zakharova said.

She did not identify any specific U.S. media outlets that would be targeted. She said it made no difference from the Russian government’s point of view if those outlets were backed by the U.S. state, or privately-funded.

Late last month, Russia’s state communications regulator accused U.S. TV channel CNN International of violating its license to broadcast in Russia and said it had summoned the broadcaster’s representatives in connection with the matter.

The watchdog did not publicly disclose the nature of the violation. The head of the regulator said it was a technical matter and denied that politics was involved.

U.S. intelligence officials, in a report in January this year into allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, said RT was part of a state-run propaganda machine that supported a Kremlin campaign to influence U.S. politics.

SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - Sebastian Vettel suffered the agony of another retirement on Sunday as his Formula One title hopes disappeared almost over the horizon.

Engine problems forced the German out of Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix on the fourth lap after his Ferrari mechanics had worked feverishly on the starting grid to try and fix an engine problem.

Vettel was already 34 points behind championship leader Lewis Hamilton, with the Mercedes driver leading from pole position and set to stretch his lead to 59 with four races remaining.

“Of course it hurts, and we’re all disappointed,” said the four times world champion, who hugged his mechanics and gave the crowd a quick wave after returning to the pits.

“Now I think we just have to get back, get some rest and go flat out for the last four races and see what happens.”

Vettel had lined up alongside Hamilton on the front row at a sunny Suzuka, hoping the hotter conditions could handicap the Briton after he proved unbeatable in qualifying.

But all was clearly not well, with Ferrari mechanics hurriedly changing the car’s spark plug as the seconds ticked away.

The German made a clean start, hanging on to second off the line, but it soon became apparent the problem ran much deeper as Vettel, clearly lacking power, plummeted down the order.

He was finally called in to the pits: “Box, Sebastian, box. We retire the car,” he was told.

It was the third race in a row that Vettel’s hopes had been dealt a battering.

In Singapore the 30-year-old crashed out on the opening lap after colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, who had tangled with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.

Two weeks later in Malaysia, the Ferrari driver finished fourth after engine problems in qualifying forced him to start at the back of the field.

Triple champion Hamilton capitalized on both occasions, winning in Singapore and finishing second in Malaysia.

But Sunday’s setback could be the most decisive yet, opening the possibility that Hamilton could wrap up his fourth title as early as the next race in Austin, Texas, if not Mexico a week later.

“We still have a chance this year...obviously it’s not as much in our control as we would like,” said Vettel.

“I think we are improving race by race, we’ve got a lot further than people have thought so there’s also some positives,” he added.

“But for sure now you don’t look at the positives because it’s not the day to look at positives.”",Vettel's title hopes suffer huge blow in Japan,https://www.reuters.com/article/motor-f1-japan-vettel/motor-racing-vettels-title-bid-looks-almost-over-idINKBN1CD04Q

Nadal’s previous title at the tournament came 12 years ago.

“I had very tough draw here,” Nadal, who saved match points in his opening round against Frenchman Lucas Pouille, said.

“I was lucky the first day saving the two match points but after that I think I played one of my best events of the year.”

World number 19 Kyrgios matched Nadal early on, winning his opening two service games but became involved in a debate with umpire Mohamed Lahyani over a close line call against him.

“I can’t play at 100 percent if that stuff happens -- and then you expect me not to be angry,” Kyrgios told Lahyani.

He continued to argue the toss with the official who eventually awarded a penalty point against the Australian during the changeover when he trailed 2-5, meaning he began the eighth game already 0-15 behind.

Nadal was well in control by then and he raced into a 5-0 lead in the second set before Kyrgios slightly delayed the inevitable as the Spaniard sauntered to his 12th consecutive win.

“He played well. I played terrible. He’s in great form. He just destroyed me today, so it was too good,” Kyrgios, who struck 20 winners but 35 unforced errors, said.

“I put in a pretty good week, had some good wins. It’s tough to find positives when you won three games in the final. But I guess there were positives. In the semi-final I played well, obviously beating Alex (Zverev).”

Kyrgios still has a chance of qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals as he is 15th in the Race standings with several tournaments remaining to close the gap on those in front.

Chief Executive Dave Lewis has boosted margins at Britain’s biggest supermarket, shrunk the pension deficit and cut debt. The first dividend payment in three years confirms the recovery. Yet threats from inflation, weak consumer demand and online rivals have Tesco shares stuck in a rut.

The UK’s largest grocer by market share is in better shape than it has been in years. On Wednesday, the company said that it will pay an interim dividend of 1 pence per share – the first since it scrapped payouts to save cash in early 2015. Tesco’s operating margin of 2.7 percent in the 26 weeks to Aug. 26 is still less than half what it managed just six years ago, but shows the company is on track to hit the 3.5 percent to 4 percent target Lewis set a year ago. Tesco’s balance sheet is also in better shape. Net debt, which stood at 7.5 billion pounds when Lewis took charge in 2014, is down to 3.3 billion pounds. And an independent valuation has reduced the group’s net pension deficit by almost 60 percent to 2.4 billion pounds.

Still, the company is having a hard time getting much credit from investors. Tesco shares have been at a virtual standstill for three years and were down 2 percent in early trading on Wednesday. The stock still looks expensive, trading at 16 times forward earnings, compared with 12 times for closest rival J Sainsbury.

This gloom is largely due to factors beyond the control of Lewis and his team. UK inflation is running at close to 3 percent, squeezing real earnings. To keep its volume-led recovery on track, Tesco has to do more than rivals to shield shoppers from price hikes. Amazon’s recent purchase of Whole Foods is also an ominous development for Tesco, which has a 15 percent share of global online food sales according to Bernstein estimates.

Any sign that discount retailers Aldi and Lidl are slowing their invasion of the cut-throat British market, or that Amazon’s push into groceries is faltering, would be good for Tesco. Until then, the company will be spinning its wheels to get nowhere fast.",Breakingviews - Tesco is spinning its wheels to get nowhere fast,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesco-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-tesco-is-spinning-its-wheels-to-get-nowhere-fast-idUSKCN1C918K

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The vice chairman of a voter fraud panel set up by U.S. President Donald Trump began soon after the election to draft legislative changes that would allow states to require voters to prove their citizenship when registering, court records show.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has been on the panel since its creation in May, exchanged emails on the matter with Trump’s transition team the day after the November presidential election, according to records unsealed by a federal judge on Thursday.

Kobach, who like Trump is a Republican, was ordered to release the records as part of a legal challenge that has enjoined a state law that required Kansans to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote.

The records showed that by the day after the election, Kobach had already started drafting legislative changes that would permit all states to impose proof-of-citizenship requirements by amending the National Voter Registration Act, which lets Americans register to vote when they apply for driver’s licenses.

The records shed light on a photograph taken several days after the election that showed Kobach, then a contender for a Cabinet post, standing with Trump and holding a document partially obscured by his arm and titled “Department of Homeland Security Kobach Strategic Plan for first 365 days.”

Kobach fought the public release of the documents, which included a heavily redacted version of the document in the photograph, for months in federal court.

He and his spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Any changes to the National Voter Registration Act, or “motor-voter law,” require congressional approval.

Civil rights groups said they fear Kobach is using the Trump voting panel to drum up fake proof of widespread non-citizen voter fraud to persuade Congress to change the law.

Trump has said without evidence that there was widespread voter fraud in the November election. Most state election officials and election law experts say U.S. voter fraud is rare.

Requiring people to show birth certificates or other proof-of-citizenship when registering would be overly burdensome and would discourage young people, such as college students, said Dale Ho, director of the voting project at the American Civil Liberties Union.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil producers may need to take “some extraordinary measures” next year to rebalance the oil market, the OPEC secretary-general said on Sunday.

“There is a growing consensus that ... a rebalancing process is under way. We are gradually but steadily achieving our common and noble objectives,” Mohammad Barkindo told reporters at the India Energy Forum organized by CERAWeek in New Delhi.

“To sustain this into next year, some extraordinary measures may have to be taken in order to restore this stability on a sustainable basis going forward,” he said, without elaborating.

Saudi Arabia and Russia helped secure a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 rival producers to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March 2018 in an effort to reduce a glut.

Barkindo said consultations were under way for the extension of the OPEC-led pact beyond March 2018 and that more oil producing nations may join the supply pact, possibly at the next meeting of OPEC in Vienna on Nov. 30.

He also said that Nigeria and Libya, who are exempted from the pact, “are making progress towards full recovery” of production, after which they could join the OPEC-led agreement.

Oil futures fell more than 2 percent on Friday, ending Brent crude’s longest multi-week rally in 16 months as oversupply concerns reappeared as producers have started hedging future drilling. [O/R]

But Barkindo said he was not worried about the rise in U.S. shale oil and gas output.

“It is a big market and demand is very strong. Between the first half and second half this year, demand growth is almost about 2 million barrels (per day), which is very robust,” he said. “So everybody has a role to play.”

On Friday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he hoped to reach a consensus with Russia and other major oil producers on the future of the deal before November’s meeting.

Falih was speaking in Moscow two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was possible that the supply reduction deal could run to the end of next year, although Russia has not made any commitment.",Extraordinary steps may be needed in 2018 to rebalance oil market: OPEC's Barkindo,https://www.reuters.com/article/opec-india/extraordinary-steps-may-be-needed-in-2018-to-rebalance-oil-market-opecs-barkindo-idINKBN1CD0HS?il=0

Dresden (Reuters) - Angesichts der Kritik über das enttäuschende Wahlergebnis der Union und Zweifel an der geplanten Jamaika-Koalition hat Angela Merkel einen Sonderparteitag der CDU zugesagt.

Eine Koalition von CDU, CSU, Grünen und FDP habe es auf Bundesebene noch nicht gegeben, sagte die Parteichefin am Samstag auf dem Deutschlandtag der Jungen Union in Dresden. “Deshalb unterstütze ich voll und ganz die Erwartung, dass wir eine vielleicht existierende (...) Koalitionsvereinbarung dann auf einem Parteitag diskutieren und verabschieden.” Der Kanzlerin wurde in einer Diskussion von etlichen Rednern der gemeinsamen Jugendorganisation von CDU und CSU vorgeworfen, sie habe nicht die richtigen Schlüsse aus dem Wahlergebnis gezogen. Merkel sagte eine personelle Erneuerung des Kabinetts bei einer Regierungsbildung zu, nannte aber keine Details.

In Dresden wurde die Kluft zwischen den 15 CDU-Landesverbänden der JU und dem CSU-Verband aus Bayern deutlich. Dieser verweigerte der Kanzlerin den Applaus. Merkel betonte erneut, dass die Union trotz der Verluste am 24. September ihre “strategischen Ziele” erreicht habe, weil sie wieder eine Regierung anführen werde. Dagegen sprach der bayerische JU-Vorsitzende Hans Reichhart von einer “krachenden Niederlage”. Am Sonntag müssen die Spitzen von CDU und CSU eine Einigung etwa in der umstrittenen Frage einer Obergrenze für die Flüchtlingsaufnahme erreichen, damit Sondierungsgespräche mit FDP und Grünen beginnen können. Die JU hatte sich in einer Dresdner Erklärung zuvor für eine Steuerung der Zuwanderung ausgesprochen, aber nicht für eine Obergrenze.

Der Vorsitzende der Jungen Union, Paul Ziemiak, hatte bereits am Freitag einen CDU-Sonderparteitag gefordert, um über einen Jamaika-Koalitionsvertrag diskutieren zu können. CSU, FDP und Grüne haben entweder Parteitage oder Mitgliederentscheide angekündigt, um ein eventuelles Regierungsprogramm billigen zu lassen.

“AUF ABSEHBARE ZEIT NICHT REGIERUNGSFÄHIG”

Merkel warnte vor allem die CSU davor, auf eine Fortsetzung der großen Koalition mit der SPD zu hoffen. Dies wird von einigen CSU-Politikern als günstigere Ausgangslage für die bayerische Landtagswahl 2018 angesehen. “Es ist offensichtlich, dass die SPD auf Bundesebene auf absehbare Zeit nicht regierungsfähig ist”, sagte Merkel dagegen. “Deshalb rate ich uns allen, keine weiteren Gedanken darauf zu verschwenden.” Man solle versuchen, ohne Missmut ein Jamaika-Bündnis hinzubekommen. Merkel warnte zudem davor, das Wählervotum zu missachten und auf Neuwahlen zu setzen.

Die CDU-Chefin räumte ein, dass die Flüchtlingskrise der wahrscheinlich wichtigste Grund für die Verluste an die AfD gewesen sei. Allerdings gebe es auch andere. Sie wolle das Ergebnis nicht schönreden. Zugleich mahnte Merkel, dass die Union ihre Verhandlungsposition in den anstehenden Gesprächen mit FDP und Grünen nicht durch eine Selbstzerfleischung schwächen dürfe. Sie wolle sich weiter mit Hochdruck dafür einsetzen, dass die Maghreb-Staaten zu sicheren Herkunftsländern erklärt würden. Dies lehnen die Grünen bisher ab.

Zugleich bekannte sich die CDU-Vorsitzende zum Ziel, die AfD wieder aus dem Bundestag drängen zu wollen. “Ich stehe dazu, dass rechts von der Union keine Partei sein sollte”, betonte sie mit Hinweis auf den damaligen CSU-Chef Franz Josef Strauß. “Aber Franz Josef Strauß, dem ich leider nie begegnet bin, hätte sicher nicht dazu aufgefordert, unsere eigenen Prinzipien zu verraten, um das zu erreichen.”",Merkel sagt nach Kritik CDU-Bundesparteitag für Jamaika zu,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-union-merkel-idDEKBN1CD08K

MANILA (Reuters) - Trust and satisfaction in Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on Sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall.

Net satisfaction, used by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) as a rating of the president’s performance, was down 18 points from the second quarter to 48, classified as “good” in the survey of 1,200 Filipinos conducted in the last week of September.

Duterte’s net trust rating, which gauges public sentiment about his personality, was “very good” at 60 points, down from “excellent” 75 he achieved in the previous poll.

The survey was conducted just a few days after thousands of Filipinos rallied to denounce Duterte, his anti-drug crackdown and what they called an emerging dictatorship.

Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in the crackdown and other SWS polls conducted in September indicated doubts about the validity of official accounts of the 3,800 cases where police killed drug suspects.

The SWS survey did not ask respondents to give a reason for the rating of Duterte, who took office in June 2016. Duterte’s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results.

Political analyst Ramon Casiple, head of the country’s Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said it was normal for a president’s rating to fall during his time in office, but concern over the high death toll in his signature war on drugs will have weighed on sentiment.

Activists accuse Duterte of inciting police to kill drug dealers and users, which he denies. Police reject allegations they are executing suspects and say deaths occurred because victims had violently resisted arrest.

Casiple said that though the poll still showed Duterte had the support of Filipinos, he should take it seriously.

“This is a real diminution of his popularity and it serves as a wakeup call for him to stop it further going down,” Casiple said of the poll.

“However, this is still a comfortable figure and far from the threshold of unpopularity.”

Based on SWS methodology for net trust ratings, a score of 70 and above is considered excellent, 50 to 69 is very good, 30-49 good and 10-29 moderate.

While his political opponents chide him for his authoritarian style and intolerance of dissent, Duterte enjoys a cult-like following and support from millions of Filipinos, who see him as the best hope for change in a country with rampant crime and a yawning gap between rich and poor.","Philippine president sees biggest ratings dip, but popularity intact",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-philippines-politics-duterte/philippine-president-sees-biggest-ratings-dip-but-popularity-intact-idUKKBN1CD0NQ

Developed at the University of Texas at Austin the system uses a drop of water to capture the molecules that all tissue gives off. Called metabolites - they form a set of biomarkers unique to each type of cancer. That molecular fingerprint is then examined in a mass spectrometer - and compared with more than 250 different cancerous and healthy tissue types. SOUNDBITE (English) MARTA SANS ESCOFET, RESEARCH ASSISTANT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN SAYING: ""We have some tubing that delivers a control water droplet to the tip of the pen and then this water is used to extract lipids, metabolites and proteins from the tissue sample and those lipids can be characteristic of the tissue type so if you have cancer you know you're going to get a different composition. And then this water droplet is delivered into the Mass Spectrometer with the different tubing that we have have and then this information can be analysed.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The vice chairman of a voter fraud panel set up by U.S. President Donald Trump began soon after the election to draft legislative changes that would allow states to require voters to prove their citizenship when registering, court records show.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has been on the panel since its creation in May, exchanged emails on the matter with Trump’s transition team the day after the November presidential election, according to records unsealed by a federal judge on Thursday.

Kobach, who like Trump is a Republican, was ordered to release the records as part of a legal challenge that has enjoined a state law that required Kansans to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote.

The records showed that by the day after the election, Kobach had already started drafting legislative changes that would permit all states to impose proof-of-citizenship requirements by amending the National Voter Registration Act, which lets Americans register to vote when they apply for driver’s licenses.

The records shed light on a photograph taken several days after the election that showed Kobach, then a contender for a Cabinet post, standing with Trump and holding a document partially obscured by his arm and titled “Department of Homeland Security Kobach Strategic Plan for first 365 days.”

Kobach fought the public release of the documents, which included a heavily redacted version of the document in the photograph, for months in federal court.

He and his spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Any changes to the National Voter Registration Act, or “motor-voter law,” require congressional approval.

Civil rights groups said they fear Kobach is using the Trump voting panel to drum up fake proof of widespread non-citizen voter fraud to persuade Congress to change the law.

Trump has said without evidence that there was widespread voter fraud in the November election. Most state election officials and election law experts say U.S. voter fraud is rare.

Requiring people to show birth certificates or other proof-of-citizenship when registering would be overly burdensome and would discourage young people, such as college students, said Dale Ho, director of the voting project at the American Civil Liberties Union.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s plan to cut corporate taxes may add more fuel to the already hot rally in the shares of automation companies.

Fund managers from Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Hodges Capital and Hood Capital say that they expect that companies will use part of their tax savings to invest in high-cost machines that will allow them to reduce labor costs over time.

That would be a boon for companies such as Cognex Corp (CGNX.O), which makes so-called machine vision systems that are used to quickly sort and fill orders in e-commerce warehouses, and Faro Technologies Inc (FARO.O), which makes three-dimensional measuring tools that can help lower labor costs on aerospace assembly lines. Cognex shares touched a 52-week high on Friday, while Faro shares at $38.20 were closing in on their year-high of $40.60 reached in August.

“Scarcity of capital is the thing that keeps companies from spending money when it makes sense to do so. Investing in automation would be something that pays for itself quickly,” said Matt Litfin, a portfolio manager of the $4.8-billion Columbia Acorn (LACAX.O) fund, who owns shares of Cognex. Shares of the company are up 80 percent year-to-date.

Automation companies have rallied overall this year as corporate America looks for ways to maintain margins and productivity at a time when wages are rising and unemployment is low.

The $1.4 billion Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO.O), which includes a mix of large-cap companies such as Rockwell Automation and Intuitive Surgical, is up over 35 percent for the year to date, nearly triple the 13.5-percent gain in the broad S&P 500 index.

Numerous fund holdings are up over 90 percent for the year to date, including drone manufacturer AeroVironment Inc (AVAV.O), gear manufacturer Harmonic Drive Systems Inc (6324.T), and laser company IPG Photonics Corp (IPGP.O).

Large-cap automation companies, such as Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N) and Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N), have also posted solid returns so far this year, though smaller-cap companies have seen larger share price gains overall.

The Robo ETF has posted positive inflows every week since President Donald Trump’s November election, partly due to investor anticipation of a corporate tax cut. Investors have sent $461 million into the fund since early August, when the Trump administration began publicly discussing its plans to cut the top corporate tax rates to 20 percent, from 35 percent.

Prominent Republican senators such as Bob Corker and Rand Paul have criticized the Trump administration’s plan for its potential to increase the federal deficit, leaving its passage far from certain. Yet fund managers say that they see gains in automation companies continuing regardless of whether a tax bill passes.

“Even eight years after the financial crisis, companies are still very focused on their bottom lines and maintaining efficiency and productivity as much as possible,” said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager of the $743-million Hodges Small Cap fund.

Middleby Corp (MIDD.O), which makes smart ovens and other kitchen equipment used in restaurant chains such as Panera Bread, will likely benefit as companies look for ways to reduce labor costs as more states raise the minimum wage, he said.

Shares of Middleby are flat for the year, in part due to slow sales of its Viking line of high-end ovens after the company had to recall some freestanding gas ranges that turned on by themselves with customers unable to turn them off. Hodges said that despite the overhang, the company looks poised to continue to grow as restaurants expand and high real-estate prices prompt more homeowners to upgrade their kitchens.

The detention in July of the activists, who also include a German and Swedish national, deepened tensions between Ankara and European Union leaders who fear that Turkey is sliding towards greater authoritarianism under President Tayyip Erdogan.

They were held after attending a workshop on digital security on an island off Istanbul. Eight of them have been held since then, accused of being members of and aiding an “armed terrorist organization”.

Shortly after they were detained Germany said it was reviewing applications for arms projects from Turkey. A minister in Berlin compared Ankara’s behavior over the detention of the activists to the authoritarian former communist East Germany.

Chancellor Angela Merkel also said last month that Turkey’s 12-year journey to join the European Union should be halted.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said he was very worried about the latest development.

“The demand for up to 15 years in prison is totally incomprehensible to us and not acceptable,” Gabriel said in a statement, adding Berlin had got in touch with the Turkish government about the matter.

Among those arrested in July are Amnesty International’s Turkey director İdil Eser, German citizen Peter Frank Steudtner and Swedish citizen Ali Gharavi.

They have now been officially charged by an indictment, the first step in court proceedings.

“We are doing all we can to bring the jailed German citizens, including Peter Steudtner, back to Germany,” said Gabriel.

Erdogan’s government says EU critics of the case, and of the wider crackdown in Turkey following last year’s failed military coup in which more than 240 people were killed, do not understand the scale of the security challenges facing Turkey.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) will remain an industry leader, with growth driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, high-performance computing (HPC) and mobile, its chairman Morris Chang said in an interview.

Chang, 86 and dubbed the father of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as he built up the Apple Inc supplier into the world’s biggest foundry chipmaker, said he expects driverless taxis in 10-20 years and sees artificial intelligence (AI) replacing many doctors.

“We’re going to be right there, hopefully ahead of anybody. But at least we’re going to be there with other people to the upper limits of technology,” Chang told Reuters at the company’s headquarters in Taipei.

Chang expects TSMC, which has a market value of about $185 billion, to increase its capital spending by 5-10 percent over the next five years, and to continue to invest in research and development where it employs about 6,000 workers. He also expects further consolidation in the chip industry.

His remarks come just days after he said he would retire next June. He will be succeeded as chairman by Mark Liu, with C.C. Wei appointed as chief executive. The two have worked together as co-CEOs since 2013.

Puffing on a pipe, Chang said he would offer his successors advice until he steps down, and a key message would be the importance of sealing partnerships.

“We need to establish partnerships in IoT, automotive, high-performance computing,” he said, adding that mobile still has bright prospects for the next few years. “Those are the four growth platforms we have identified.”

Chang’s remarks come as TSMC, which has thrived on booming demand for chips used in smartphones, seeks to diversify its customer base and move into emerging sectors such as AI.

It must also deal with a growing threat from Samsung Electronics, the world’s top memory chipmaker, which plans to triple the market share of its contract chipmaking business within five years by aggressively adding clients.

To fend off competitors, TSMC needed to compete on every front, Chang said, adding that chip subsidies in China were a challenge for the semiconductor industry.

“We still sell in China, but the fact is that China is subsidizing a lot of companies ... so the result is that companies in China can continue to lose money for a long time and yet still survive,” he said.

While TSMC was still looking to identify the best potential partners, Chang highlighted its current partner Nvidia as a rising star in AI.

Chang founded TSMC in 1987 with paid-in capital of T$1.4 billion ($45 million), and pioneered contract chip manufacturing for chip design firms which don’t have their own factories.

Among his achievements, Chang said he was most proud of building TSMC into its present position, and also noted his time at Texas Instruments where he helped build the semiconductor business.

Chang spent 25 years at Texas Instruments and holds a doctorate from Stanford. Born in China, he went to Taiwan in 1985 after being recruited by the government to head a body promoting industrial and technological development.

He says he is bowing out after 30 years of service to TSMC to spend more time with his family, but he’ll keep a close eye on the company.

“After I leave, I’ll be looking at the balance sheet, the P&L, and I’ll be listening to the analyst calls,” he said. “I don’t think I’ll be asking questions, I’ll just be a very interested investor.”

Chang owns 0.48 percent of TSMC shares, according to the company’s website, worth around $926 million.","Retiring TSMC founder predicts fewer doctors, no taxi drivers",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-chang/retiring-tsmc-founder-predicts-fewer-doctors-no-taxi-drivers-idUSKBN1CB22B

Then the generator sputtered as if it might die.

A dozen volunteer doctors and medical students from San Juan started assessing which patient should be transported first - in the town’s only ambulance - to a hospital an hour away, and which could survive without oxygen for a short time.

Javier Sevilla Rodriguez, a medical student, had only one way to make the agonizing decisions. He removed one woman’s oxygen tube, watching carefully to see how her blood-oxygen level responded.

“This is how we are doing triage right now,” he said.

Two weeks after hurricane Maria, many of Puerto Rico’s sick, frail and elderly are teetering on the edge, one faulty generator away from missing dialysis treatments or having critical medications go bad.

With nearly the entire island still lacking electricity, hospitals, clinics, and shelters are operating on aging generators not intended for long-term use and powered by scarce diesel fuel. Water is still not available for nearly half the population and supplies of medicines and oxygen are running low.

And residents still can’t call for help across vast swaths of the island because of widespread cellular network outages.

Many regions in the interior of the island, like this one, are only now seeing relief efforts, amid a plodding U.S. disaster response to this island of 3.4 million American citizens. The U.S. territory’s battered economy and infrastructure has magnified the humanitarian crisis wrought by the strongest hurricane to hit here in nine decades.

In Orocovis, even the sickest patients have gone largely without medical care since the storm. So the doctors worked quickly throughout the day, conferring with caregivers and writing prescriptions they would take back to San Juan to fill and then dispatch by messenger.

Now at the community center, their last stop before leaving town, time ran out.

With a loud clunk, the sounds of humming oxygen machines stopped and were replaced by a chorus of beeps and chirps warning that power had been cut.

The generator had failed.

A CALL FOR DOCTORS

The medical convoy that visited Orocovis is an entirely volunteer operation, organized by physician Carlos Mellado. After Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, blocking roads and crippling power and communications networks, Mellado asked other doctors at his clinic to cover for him and threw himself into hurricane relief work.

On the first day, he headed to Canovanas, east of the capital, checking on people at shelters. He promised to fill many patients’ prescriptions and send back the medications.

The next day, he went to Vieques, an island off Puerto Rico’s eastern coast, and found diabetics without insulin, heart patients under extreme stress and crucial treatments interrupted by power outages.

When Mellado returned to San Juan, he stopped by the local radio station, which in the days after the storm, had become a trusted source of information for Puerto Ricans living without communications. Invited to speak to listeners, he called for other physicians willing to join him.

Now, Mellado has a core group of 18 physicians, who rotate between the trips and their own practices, and a growing list of more doctors who want to join. Each morning, he takes out a paper map of the island covered with notes about where he’s been. The doctors pick a town and go.

The convoys have no official ties, but Mellado reports each evening on what the doctors found to Puerto Rican and federal officials in San Juan. Sometimes Puerto Rico’s housing department coordinates deliveries of the drugs back to the towns, and a pharmacy chain donates medications for patients without insurance.

The government’s death count from the storm more than doubled this week to 36. But doctors across the island believe the total would be far higher if it included people with chronic conditions who died because they lacked access to medical care.

“For these critically ill patients, if everything fails, they don’t have too much time,” said Humberto Guzman, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon and member of the medical convoy. ”People are dying.”

‘WE CANNOT WAIT’

In Orocovis, after the generator failed, the doctors looked for a quick fix. Guzman ran up the street to the town’s shuttered urgent care facility.

There, he found a half-dozen oxygen tanks that locals said had been delivered the day before. Each could provide about a day’s worth of oxygen to a patient.

The tanks were quickly moved to the community center, where the doctors taught family members to use them. But before that became necessary, the generator sprang back to life.

The doctors packed up to leave, assuring patients’ families that they could switch to the tanks if the generator failed again.

“In every town right now, there are moments like this happening,” Guzman said. “That’s why you need people like us to just go. We cannot wait.”

AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish army reconnaissance team scouted out Syria’s Idlib province on Sunday, a senior Syrian rebel said, before an expected military operation to impose peace in the bitterly contested Syrian northwest.

“When we don’t go to Syria, Syria comes to us,” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party. “If we didn’t take our measures, bombs would fall on our cities.”

Turkey says it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed, aiming to implement a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area, the most populous pocket of Syria still in rebel hands.

Although Turkish officials say they are helping the rebels from within Turkey, in past interventions they have also sent troops across the frontier.

Any incursion could bring them into conflict with powerful jihadists from al Qaeda’s former Syrian branch, although there were signs on Sunday that they were working to avoid a confrontation.

Local sources said the Turkish military vehicles were escorted into Idlib by a convoy of fighters from the group, which has joined a jihadist alliance called Tahrir al-Sham and disavowed links to the network founded by Osama bin Laden.

Nonetheless, the jihadists and the Turkish military earlier exchanged fire nearby, underscoring the tension as Turkey builds up its forces and the rebel groups it backs prepare to enter Idlib.

“We will never allow a terror corridor that begins in Afrin and goes to the Mediterranean,” Erdogan said, referring to the stretch of Turkey’s southern border which is controlled on the Syrian side by Kurdish fighters and Tahrir al-Sham.

Related Coverage Erdogan says Turkey working with Syria rebels to implement Idlib accord

Turkey has been one of the biggest supporters of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the six-and-a-half-year war, but its focus has moved from ousting him to securing its own border against jihadist and Kurdish groups.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim stressed the importance of ensuring de-escalation near the border, following an agreement reached in Astana, Kazakhstan last month that was backed both by the Turks and by Russia, which supports Assad.

“We will ensure safety in Idlib, and will cooperate with Russia,” Yildirim said.

Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former Nusra Front, which was al Qaeda’s Syrian branch until last year when it changed its name and broke allegiance to the global network, has been a formidable military force since early in the conflict.

Since early this year it has battled other rebel groups as it tried to gain control over areas including Idlib.

UNDER ESCORT

Idlib and neighboring parts of northwest Syria are now home to more than 2 million people, many of them refugees from other formerly rebel-held regions that fell to pro-government forces.

A local resident and another local rebel said they had seen Turkish military vehicles enter Idlib and then travel under Tahrir al-Sham escort along a road.

The senior Syrian rebel said the reconnaissance team went to Sheikh Barakat, a location that overlooks both rebel-held areas of Aleppo province, adjacent to Idlib, and the Kurdish-controlled area of Afrin.

Erdogan gave no details of the operation, but said it was going ahead “without problems at the moment”.

Turkey’s biggest security concern on the frontier is the Kurdish YPG militia, which as part of a U.S.-backed alliance is fighting against Islamic State in eastern Syria. Ankara regards the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey.

Mortars were fired from the area under YPG control near to the location where the Turkish reconnaissance team was operating, the senior rebel said.

“The Turkish team is on its way back. Its mission has been accomplished. They visited areas of disengagement and locations where the Turkish army would be positioned,” the rebel said.

Reuters witnesses, local people, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said earlier on Sunday the Turkish military and Tahrir al-Sham had clashed near the village of Kafr Lusin in Idlib.

Tahrir al-Sham began the exchange by firing on a Turkish bulldozer removing sections of a border wall and Turkish artillery returned fire, they said. The area was later quiet.

Rebel groups that will take part - drawn from the Euphrates Shield campaign that Turkey backed with armor and troops in another part of Syria to the east since last year - said on Saturday they expected the Idlib operation to start very soon.

Tahrir al-Sham said “the lions of jihad and martyrdom will be waiting to pounce” against any incursion into Idlib.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s plan to cut corporate taxes may add more fuel to the already hot rally in the shares of automation companies.

Fund managers from Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Hodges Capital and Hood Capital say that they expect that companies will use part of their tax savings to invest in high-cost machines that will allow them to reduce labor costs over time.

That would be a boon for companies such as Cognex Corp (CGNX.O), which makes so-called machine vision systems that are used to quickly sort and fill orders in e-commerce warehouses, and Faro Technologies Inc (FARO.O), which makes three-dimensional measuring tools that can help lower labor costs on aerospace assembly lines. Cognex shares touched a 52-week high on Friday, while Faro shares at $38.20 were closing in on their year-high of $40.60 reached in August.

“Scarcity of capital is the thing that keeps companies from spending money when it makes sense to do so. Investing in automation would be something that pays for itself quickly,” said Matt Litfin, a portfolio manager of the $4.8-billion Columbia Acorn (LACAX.O) fund, who owns shares of Cognex. Shares of the company are up 80 percent year-to-date.

Automation companies have rallied overall this year as corporate America looks for ways to maintain margins and productivity at a time when wages are rising and unemployment is low.

The $1.4 billion Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO.O), which includes a mix of large-cap companies such as Rockwell Automation and Intuitive Surgical, is up over 35 percent for the year to date, nearly triple the 13.5-percent gain in the broad S&P 500 index.

Numerous fund holdings are up over 90 percent for the year to date, including drone manufacturer AeroVironment Inc (AVAV.O), gear manufacturer Harmonic Drive Systems Inc (6324.T), and laser company IPG Photonics Corp (IPGP.O).

Large-cap automation companies, such as Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N) and Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N), have also posted solid returns so far this year, though smaller-cap companies have seen larger share price gains overall.

The Robo ETF has posted positive inflows every week since President Donald Trump’s November election, partly due to investor anticipation of a corporate tax cut. Investors have sent $461 million into the fund since early August, when the Trump administration began publicly discussing its plans to cut the top corporate tax rates to 20 percent, from 35 percent.

Prominent Republican senators such as Bob Corker and Rand Paul have criticized the Trump administration’s plan for its potential to increase the federal deficit, leaving its passage far from certain. Yet fund managers say that they see gains in automation companies continuing regardless of whether a tax bill passes.

“Even eight years after the financial crisis, companies are still very focused on their bottom lines and maintaining efficiency and productivity as much as possible,” said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager of the $743-million Hodges Small Cap fund.

Middleby Corp (MIDD.O), which makes smart ovens and other kitchen equipment used in restaurant chains such as Panera Bread, will likely benefit as companies look for ways to reduce labor costs as more states raise the minimum wage, he said.

Shares of Middleby are flat for the year, in part due to slow sales of its Viking line of high-end ovens after the company had to recall some freestanding gas ranges that turned on by themselves with customers unable to turn them off. Hodges said that despite the overhang, the company looks poised to continue to grow as restaurants expand and high real-estate prices prompt more homeowners to upgrade their kitchens.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has signaled that she could sack Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a Sunday newspaper said, as she tries to reassert her authority after a series of political disasters.

The Sunday Times said it asked May about her plans for Johnson, who has professed loyalty but is accused by some of the prime minister’s allies of undermining her by putting forward his own vision for Britain’s exit from the European Union.

“It has never been my style to hide from a challenge and I‘m not going to start now,” it quoted May as replying, in what it called a signal that she was prepared to bring in new ministers to her cabinet and axe those who had caused her problems.

“I‘m the PM, and part of my job is to make sure I always have the best people in my cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available to me in the party.”

May has seen her authority over her Conservative Party erode since she called a snap election in June in which she lost her majority in parliament.

Johnson, seen as a potential successor to May, said that Conservative lawmakers pushing to unseat her were “nutters”, adding that a change would lead to demands for another election that could bring a resurgent Labour party back to power.

“Are we really going to be stampeded myopically over the edge of the gorge, with an election that no one wants?” he said in the Sunday Telegraph.

Johnson wrote a newspaper article last month outlining his vision of Brexit just days before May made a major speech on the subject.

While professing loyalty, his interventions have been seen as undermining May and causing unnecessary unrest ahead of the party’s conference last week that culminated in a disastrous speech by the prime minister, marred by a coughing fit and letters falling off the slogan on the set behind her.

Johnson made a plea for loyalty with a typical rhetorical flourish on Sunday.

”‘Quo quo scelesti ruitis?', as Horace put it at the beginning of a fresh bout of Rome’s ghastly civil wars, and which roughly translates as: “What do you think you are doing you nutters?”

GONE BY CHRISTMAS?

On Friday, former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said he had garnered the support of 30 lawmakers who wanted to remove May from the party leadership, short of the number needed to launch a formal challenge.

Former Prime Minister John Major said he was increasingly dismayed by the plotting in the party by those driven by their own personal agenda.

“The country has had enough of the self-absorbed and, frankly, disloyal behavior we have witnessed over recent weeks,” he said in the Mail on Sunday.

The speculation about May’s position comes ahead of crucial Brexit talks between Britain and the EU, and the political uncertainty has led to growing concern that no deal would be agreed by March 2019 when Britain leaves the bloc.

Britain’s Sunday newspapers were brimming with briefings from unnamed Conservative figures suggesting May’s days in Downing Street were numbered.

The Sunday Times said three cabinet ministers had discussed the need to replace May.

“It’s a ‘when’ question now,” one of the unnamed ministers told the paper. “It feels to me that this is over before Christmas.”

A fourth minister was quoted as saying there needed to be an orderly transition to a new leader and there was no prospect of May being in charge for the next election due in 2022.

The Observer newspaper said unnamed senior Conservative figures said while May had no long-term future they were pressing her to shake up her team, hoping new blood would re-energise the party as well as frustrate Johnson’s ambitions.",UK's May signals foreign minister Johnson could be sacked,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-may-reshuffle/may-signals-plan-to-demote-foreign-minister-johnson-newspaper-says-idUKKBN1CC0RO

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Senior Afghan and American officials welcomed the arrival of new U.S.-made military helicopters on Saturday, beginning a process that will radically transform the young Afghan air force.

While the plan for new UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters has been in the works for some time, it forms a major part of the U.S.-led military coalition’s training efforts, which were expanded under proposals approved by President Donald Trump in August.

“It’s a modernization of their program that will allow them to project power throughout Afghanistan,” said Lieutenant Colonel Trent Alexander, a U.S. military adviser to the Afghan air force. “While transitioning to the Black Hawk will not be a quick task, it will not be a difficult task.”

At a ceremony at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani formally accepted the first new helicopters, calling it a “historic day” that would allow the air force to better respond to the demands on the security forces.

The Russian-designed Mi-17 helicopters that currently form the backbone of the Afghan air force worked well for crews used to Russian equipment, but deteriorating relations between Moscow and Washington meant that the Americans were unable to provide new parts and aircraft to replace the overworked aircraft.

“The Mi-17 was a great aircraft and it brought the Afghans the ability to be capable, however, with the introduction of the UH-60 they are now sustainable,” Alexander said.

TALIBAN REACTION

By 2024 the U.S. plans to provide the Afghans with at least 159 Black Hawks, including 58 fitted with extra rocket pods and machine guns to provide close air support, a fleet that will dwarf the fewer than 40 Mi-17s currently operational.

The Black Hawks will cost the American government almost $8 million a piece, officials said, after a process that completely refurbishes and upgrades U.S. Army surplus aircraft.

So far only two training Black Hawks have arrived, with the delivery of several additional helicopters delayed by the U.S. military’s humanitarian response to hurricanes in the Caribbean.

Retraining an Afghan pilot to fly the Black Hawk takes about five to six months, said Alexander.

Members of the first class of six pilots said they were excited over what they view as more modern helicopters.

“Black Hawks are manoeuverable because they are smaller than the Mi-17, so will be more capable during fighting, carrying soldiers, or cargo,” said one pilot, Zabihullah Dorandish.

The Afghan pilots are expected to begin flying their own missions in the Black Hawks by early next year, officials said.

A Twitter feed attributed to Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid warned that the aircraft would do nothing to change the war.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s British newspaper group said on Friday one of its titles had hacked the computer of a former intelligence officer, an admission which critics said showed why his takeover of European broadcaster Sky should be blocked.

In a hearing at London’s High Court, Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers admitted “vicarious liability” for the hacking of computers belonging to Ian Hurst, who worked for British military intelligence.

The case comes a month after Britain’s media minister said regulators should scrutinize Murdoch’s planned $15 billion takeover of Sky over concerns about broadcasting standards and its impact on media plurality.

Hurst’s lawyer Jeremy Reed said in a court statement the Irish edition of the News of the World newspaper had hired a private investigator to intercept his client’s emails in 2006.

Hurst had served in Northern Ireland and later wrote a book about his experiences, including details of Britain’s top spy in the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Alfredo Scappaticci, known by the codename “Stakeknife”.

Reed said it was likely he was targeted because an employee of the newspaper wanted to trace Scappaticci.

“I confirm that News Group Newspapers ... accepts vicarious liability for the wrongful acts of computer interception,” said Anthony Hudson, the lawyer for the newspaper group, adding it had paid “substantial” damages to Hurst and his family.

“News Group Newspapers accepts that such activity happened, accepts that it should never have happened, and has undertaken to the court that it will never happen again.”

Opponents of Murdoch’s takeover said the case was evidence the deal should not be allowed to go through and they would send a dossier to the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) which is examining the proposed deal.

“It’s vital that the CMA is able to take this new evidence of criminality and corporate failure into account as it assesses the Murdochs’ bid to take over Sky,” said Tom Watson, deputy leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party.

Murdoch shut the News of the World in 2011 after its journalists were found to have been involved in widespread phone-hacking.

His original attempt to buy full control of Sky was ditched in the wake of the scandal. Since then the company has been split in two, separating the newspapers from entertainment assets to help to smooth the deal’s passage.

Last month Murdoch’s son James said he was confident regulators would assess the deal on its merits and not be swayed by those with grievances against his father’s newspapers, saying the company had dealt effectively with past problems.","Murdoch's UK paper arm admits computer hacking, fuelling criticism of Sky takeover",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-fox-hack/murdochs-uk-paper-arm-admits-computer-hacking-fuelling-criticism-of-sky-takeover-idUSKBN1CB25F

(Reuters) - Unseeded Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia won the biggest singles title of her career with a 6-4 7-6(3) victory over soon-to-be world number one Simona Halep in the China Open final in Beijing on Sunday.

Garcia extended her winning streak to 11 matches and added to her Wuhan Open triumph last week. The current world number 15 will climb to ninth in the rankings on Monday, marking her Top 10 debut.

Halep, who will take over as number one in the next rankings, broke Garcia’s serve in the first game of the match but the 23-year-old hit back immediately, breaking the Romanian twice to win the first set.

With the score tied at 3-3 in the second set, Garcia saved nine consecutive break points in the seventh game, before taking a 4-3 lead but Halep recovered to force a tiebreak.

The Frenchwoman became the first to complete the Wuhan and Beijing double and is now on track to qualify for the season-ending WTA finals, as her win took her past Briton Johanna Konta to number eight in the Race to Singapore rankings.

DUBLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - Summit Materials, a U.S. construction firm set up by former CRH (CRH.I) executives, has made a rival offer for Ash Grove Cement (ASHG.PK), which CRH has agreed to pay $3.5 billion for, a source said.

Ash Grove said on Friday it had received a bid valued at $3.7-$3.8 billion which it expects to result in a better offer to the deal struck last month with CRH, the world’s third-largest building materials supplier.

A source familiar with the matter said the unnamed bidder was Summit and it had submitted its bid on Thursday. The offer is being considered by Ash Grove’s board, the source added.

Summit said it does not comment on market rumors or speculation. Ireland’s CRH said that its proposal remains in place, subject to approval from Ash Grove shareholders.

Shares in CRH were down 2.1 percent at 30.85 euros at 1500 GMT while Summit was 2.0 percent lower at $32.00.

Ash Grove has set a meeting on Nov. 1 for shareholders to vote on the agreement with CRH, which its board unanimously approved last month, but has extended the period during which it can look for other potential buyers to Oct. 20, the cement company said in a statement.

Prior to setting up fast-growing Summit in 2009, the Denver materials group’s chief executive Thomas Hill headed up CRH’s North American arm and went on to poach a number of other senior U.S.-based CRH executives.

Summit’s bid would surpass its own value of $3.65 billion. CRH, which has a market capitalization of $26.3 billion and said last month that it had around 5 billion euros available to spend on acquisitions over the next 18-24 months, made an all-cash bid.

CRH is also Ash Grove’s largest customer and would be owed a $131 million termination fee if the Kansas-based company sells to another party.

“Summit Materials’ opportunistic offer of an Ash Grove merger will likely see investors decide between a cash offer at a 60 percent premium or a merger that gives no certainty to a cash exit price for large Ash Grove investors,” said Darren McKinley, analyst at Dublin-based Merrion Stockbrokers.

“Given CRH’s position as Ash Grove’s largest customer, they are well placed to determine whether a higher offer makes sense or whether to let Ash Grove shareholders decide whether they want cash in hand now or to merge with a company that currently doesn’t pay a dividend.”",Summit Materials makes $3.8 billion rival bid for Ash Grove Cement: source,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ash-grove-cement-m-a-crh/summit-materials-makes-3-8-billion-rival-bid-for-ash-grove-cement-source-idUSKBN1CB06C

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Catalonia’s capital Barcelona on Sunday to express their opposition to declaring independence from Spain, showing how divided the region is on the issue.

A crowd estimated by local police to number 350,000 waved Spanish and Catalan flags and carried banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”. They poured into the city center after politicians on both sides hardened their positions in the country’s worst political crisis for decades.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Saturday he would not rule out removing Catalonia’s government and calling a fresh local election if it claimed independence, as well as suspending the wealthy region’s existing autonomous status.

The stark warning came days before Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the region’s parliament, on Tuesday, when he could unilaterally declare independence.

The anti-independence demonstration, which included Catalans and people from other parts of Spain, underlined how the dispute has riven the region itself, coming less than a month after a million people rallied in the same city to support independence.

“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said during Sunday’s rally. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.”

The northeastern region of 7.5 million people, which has its own language and culture, held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 in defiance of a Spanish court ban.

More than 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who voted backed secession, according to Catalan officials. But that turnout represented only 43 percent of the region’s 5.3 million eligible voters as many opponents of independence stayed away.

The Spanish government sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers fired rubber bullets and charged crowds with truncheons in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and dramatically escalated the dispute.

CATALONIA‘S IMPORTANCE

Losing Catalonia is almost unthinkable for the Spanish government.

It would deprive Spain of about 16 percent of its people, a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. Catalonia is also the top destination for foreign tourists, attracting about a quarter of Spain’s total.

There is widespread opposition to a Catalan breakaway among people in the rest of the country.

The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia. The board of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis will meet on Monday to discuss moving its head office elsewhere in Spain, a source familiar with the matter said.

Concern is growing in EU capitals about the impact of the crisis on the Spanish economy, the fourth largest in the euro zone, and on possible spillovers to other economies.

Some European officials are also worried that any softening in Spain’s stance towards Catalan independence could fuel secessionist feelings among other groups in Europe such as Belgium’s Flemings and Italy’s Lombards.

‘DRASTIC SOLUTIONS’

Until this weekend, Rajoy has remained vague on whether he would take the unprecedented step of triggering Article 155 of the constitution, the so-called nuclear option which enables him to sack the regional government and call a local election.

However, asked if he was ready to do so, Rajoy told El Pais newspaper on Saturday: “I don’t rule out anything that is within the law ... Ideally, we shouldn’t have to take drastic solutions but for that not to happen there would have to be changes.”

Rajoy also said he planned to leave in Catalonia the 4,000 national police the government had shipped in for the referendum, until the crisis was over.

He ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said he is open to - and added the issue would not force a snap national election.

Sunday’s demonstration in Barcelona was organized by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society to mobilizes what it believes is a “silent majority” of citizens in Catalonia who oppose independence.

“The people who have come to demonstrate don’t feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”

The rally was addressed by Nobel prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who has dual Spanish and Peruvian nationality. He told reporters it showed many Catalans “don’t want the coup d‘etat the Catalan government is fostering”.

Tens of thousands of people had gathered in 50 cities across Spain on Saturday, some defending Spain’s national unity and others dressed in white and calling for talks to defuse the crisis.",Thousands protest in Barcelona against Catalan independence,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/thousands-protest-in-barcelona-against-catalan-independence-idUSKBN1CD0ES

YANGON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders over an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the country, officials familiar with the discussions say.

Interviews with more than a dozen diplomats and government officials based in Washington, Yangon and Europe revealed that punitive measures aimed specifically at top generals were among a range of options being discussed in response to the crisis.

Nothing has yet been decided and Washington and Brussels may decide to hold off for now, the sources said. There are also discussions about increasing aid for violence-riven Rakhine state.

The active discussion of sanctions – not even on the table a month ago – shows how the dramatic exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar’s northwest is putting pressure on Western policymakers to take action.

While much of the outcry overseas has focused on Nobel laureate and Myanmar’s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, few Western diplomats see an alternative to her leadership. Suu Kyi does not control the military, which still wields considerable power under Myanmar’s army-written constitution.

The EU Foreign Ministers Council will discuss Myanmar on Oct. 16, although officials do not expect any move on sanctions that soon. Danish minister for development cooperation, Ulla Tornaes, told Reuters that Copenhagen had been working to get the crisis on the agenda, “with the wish to put further pressure on the military”.

Two Washington-based U.S. officials with knowledge of the Trump administration’s Myanmar deliberations said targeted sanctions against commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and several other generals, as well as leaders of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist militias accused of torching Rohingya villages, were under consideration.

Such sanctions - if decided on - would likely entail U.S. asset freezes, bans on travel to the United States, prohibitions against Americans doing business with them and other unspecified penalties. Washington was moving cautiously as it consulted with governments in Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia, the U.S. officials said.

A senior Yangon-based European diplomat also said Western countries were coordinating their response to the crisis and were in agreement that it was the military, and specifically the commander-in-chief, who needed to be targeted in any punitive action.

Any punishment was likely to be symbolic at first to allow room for further talks, Yangon-based diplomats said, giving the example of formally banning the army chief, who over the past year visited Brussels, Berlin and Vienna, from further travel to Europe.

Western diplomats admit their leverage is limited: compared with China, whose ties with Myanmar have warmed since Suu Kyi took office 18 months ago, U.S. and European investment and military engagement with the country are small.

They are also wary of action that could hurt the wider economy or destabilise already tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army.

PRESSURE BUILDING

The United Nations is pressing for increased humanitarian access to other parts of Rakhine, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain. How Myanmar responds to calls for increased aid, the investigation of alleged atrocities or repatriation of refugees would be a key consideration in deciding what action to take, U.S. and EU diplomats in Myanmar said.

“We can pile political pressure, look into financing we have in Myanmar. We have humanitarian aid, as well as development aid ... the European Commission won’t invest in the development of Myanmar if the conditions, including security, are not there,” said a Brussels-based EU diplomat who follows Myanmar.

“There is also the arms trade embargo and we discuss regularly whether we should reward the reforms in Myanmar and look at gradual easing of that, or the opposite.”

EU economic sanctions on Myanmar were lifted after the army stepped back from direct rule of the country in 2012, beginning the democratic transition that brought Suu Kyi to power last year, but an arms embargo in force since the 1990s remains. The United States removed most sanctions on Myanmar last autumn. It too has kept an arms embargo in place.

One Washington-based U.S. official said that, while there was no firm deadline, Washington hoped to have a plan of action on Myanmar in place by the time President Donald Trump travels to Asia for a series of summits in the first half of November.

The administration wanted to send a strong message to Myanmar’s military, but was concerned that too drastic action could allow China to expand its growing diplomatic and economic influence in the country, the official said.

There is little support in the administration for the re-imposition of broader economic sanctions, the official added.

The White House declined comment on internal deliberations on the Rohingya crisis.

STRAINED RELATIONS

In another sign of pressure building on Myanmar, New York-based diplomats said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the U.N. General Assembly was pushing for a human rights resolution on the country.

Last year the EU announced that for the first time in 15 years it would not introduce a resolution at the General Assembly’s Third Committee, which focuses on human rights, condemning Myanmar’s record - rewarding it for progress.

The European bloc could revive the resolution in the current session, taking on board the OIC draft and broadening it out beyond the Rohingya crisis, one diplomat in New York said.

Diplomats said some members of the U.N. Security Council were exploring whether the 15-member body could agree a formal statement, or even a resolution, calling for an end to the violence, full access for aid and the safe return of refugees.

However, Myanmar has said it was negotiating with China and Russia, which have veto powers in the Security Council, to protect it from any possible action. China and Russia have both expressed support for the Myanmar government.

Myanmar’s relations with the U.N. have grown increasingly testy since the discovery of World Food Programme-branded biscuits at a suspected militant camp in July prompted the government to accuse the U.N. agency of supporting the insurgents, forcing it to shut down its operations in Rakhine.

Myanmar is stalling on accepting a plan by the U.N. to upgrade the U.N. country head to the more powerful rank of Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) when its current top official, who is due to be rotated, is replaced.

Thaung Tun, Suu Kyi’s National Security Advisor, told Reuters that the U.N. “must treat us equally”.

“We’ll be fine with anybody if all member states have an ASG assigned. Not just us,” he said.",Exclusive: West edges towards punishing Myanmar army leaders over Rohingya crisis - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-sanctions/exclusive-west-edges-towards-punishing-myanmar-army-leaders-over-rohingya-crisis-sources-idINKBN1CD0R9

Russian officials have accused Washington of putting unwarranted pressure on the U.S. operations of RT, a Kremlin-funded broadcaster accused by some in Washington of interfering in domestic U.S. politics, which it denies.

The foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said the full weight of the U.S. authorities was being brought to bear against RT’s operations in the United States, and that Moscow had the right to respond.

“We have never used Russian law in relation to foreign correspondents as a lever of pressure, or censorship, or some kind of political influence, never,” Zakharova said in an interview with Russia’s NTV broadcaster. “But this is a particular case.”

She cited a 1991 Russian law which, she said, stated that if a Russian media outlet is subject to restrictions in a foreign country, then Moscow has the right to impose proportionate restrictions on media outlets from that country operating inside Russia.

“Correspondingly, everything that Russian journalists and the RT station are subject to on U.S. soil, after we qualified it as restriction of their activities, we can apply similar measures to American journalists, American media here, on Russian territory,” Zakharova said.

She did not identify any specific U.S. media outlets that would be targeted. She said it made no difference from the Russian government’s point of view if those outlets were backed by the U.S. state, or privately-funded.

Late last month, Russia’s state communications regulator accused U.S. TV channel CNN International of violating its license to broadcast in Russia and said it had summoned the broadcaster’s representatives in connection with the matter.

The watchdog did not publicly disclose the nature of the violation. The head of the regulator said it was a technical matter and denied that politics was involved.

U.S. intelligence officials, in a report in January this year into allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, said RT was part of a state-run propaganda machine that supported a Kremlin campaign to influence U.S. politics.

RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - A final assault on Islamic State’s last line of defense in its former Syrian capital Raqqa should begin on Sunday night, a field commander for the U.S.-backed forces operating there said.

The loss of Islamic State’s remaining streets and buildings in Raqqa following its defeat in Iraq’s Mosul this year and its retreat from swathes of territory in both countries, would mark a major milestone in the battle to destroy the jihadist group.

The assault on militants in the center of the northern city will focus on surrounding the sports stadium there, said a field commander in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in western Raqqa, who gave his name as Ardal Raqqa.

“Daesh is massing there because this is the last stage. They will resist, or they will surrender or die,” he said. “This their last stand to the death.”

Islamic State declared a caliphate in 2014 and at the height of its power ruled over millions of people, from northern Syria to the outskirts of Iraq’s capital Baghdad, but it has since endured a series of losses under attack from many sides.

Raqqa was the group’s de facto Syrian capital, a center of operations where it oversaw the management of much of eastern, central and northern Syria and planned attacks abroad.

Now it is hemmed into a small area in the city center that includes the stadium, the National Hospital and a roundabout where Islamic State once displayed the heads of its enemies.

In the hours before the expected launch of the final assault, which the commander said could take up to a week, the sound of gunfire sporadically rattled around the area near the hospital.

The district had been flattened, with buildings completely gone. Coalition jets soared overhead and air strikes pounded at a higher rate than in recent days.

RIVAL OFFENSIVES

Islamic State has lost most of its territory to the SDF, spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, and to a rival offensive by Syria’s army and allied forces this year, and has fallen back on the fertile Euphrates valley area downstream of Raqqa.

The army and its allies reached the city of Deir al-Zor in September after a months-long offensive across the Syrian desert, and have since then pushed down the Euphrates towards the border with Iraq.

On Sunday a Syrian military source said they had encircled Islamic State fighters in the city of al-Mayadin, one of the jihadists’ last strongholds in the area.

“Units of our armed forces with the allied forces continue their advance on a number of fronts and axes in Deir al-Zor and its countryside... and encircle Daesh terrorists in the city of al-Mayadin,” the military source said.

However, the group has still been able to launch a series of effective counter attacks against the Syrian army in the central desert region over the past week, putting pressure on the main supply road to Deir al-Zor from the west.

RUSSIA, U.S.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is backed in the war by Russia, Iran and Shi‘ite militias including Lebanon’s Hezbollah, and its campaign against Islamic State has mostly been on the west bank of the river.

The U.S.-backed SDF campaign has mostly been on the east bank, where Raqqa is located, and has also advanced downstream to hold areas opposite Deir al-Zor. The United States and Russia have put in place channels to lessen the risk of fighting between the rival offensives they back.

U.S. officials have previously said that Islamic State had relocated some of its diminished command and propaganda structures to al-Mayadin as it was forced from territory elsewhere.

The spokeswoman for the SDF campaign in Raqqa, Jihan Sheikh Ahmad, said in a statement on a website for the campaign that it would announce the liberation of Raqqa “in the coming few days” after having captured 85 percent of the city.

Commanders directing the battle in Raqqa have said that Islamic State fighters have taken civilian hostages and are using sniper fire, booby traps and tunnels to slow the SDF advance.

The SDF began its campaign to isolate Raqqa early this year, pushing along several fronts to enclose the city against the Euphrates backed by coalition air strikes and special forces.

Its attack on the city itself started in June and the fighting left much of Raqqa in ruins, as intense air strikes and street-to-street battles devastated buildings.",Final assault on Islamic State in Raqqa to start on Sunday -commander,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CD09F-OCATP

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil producers may need to take “some extraordinary measures” next year to rebalance the oil market, the OPEC secretary-general said on Sunday.

“There is a growing consensus that ... a rebalancing process is under way. We are gradually but steadily achieving our common and noble objectives,” Mohammad Barkindo told reporters at the India Energy Forum organized by CERAWeek in New Delhi.

“To sustain this into next year, some extraordinary measures may have to be taken in order to restore this stability on a sustainable basis going forward,” he said, without elaborating.

Saudi Arabia and Russia helped secure a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 rival producers to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March 2018 in an effort to reduce a glut.

Barkindo said consultations were under way for the extension of the OPEC-led pact beyond March 2018 and that more oil producing nations may join the supply pact, possibly at the next meeting of OPEC in Vienna on Nov. 30.

He also said that Nigeria and Libya, who are exempted from the pact, “are making progress towards full recovery” of production, after which they could join the OPEC-led agreement.

Oil futures fell more than 2 percent on Friday, ending Brent crude’s longest multi-week rally in 16 months as oversupply concerns reappeared as producers have started hedging future drilling. [O/R]

But Barkindo said he was not worried about the rise in U.S. shale oil and gas output.

“It is a big market and demand is very strong. Between the first half and second half this year, demand growth is almost about 2 million barrels (per day), which is very robust,” he said. “So everybody has a role to play.”

On Friday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he hoped to reach a consensus with Russia and other major oil producers on the future of the deal before November’s meeting.

Falih was speaking in Moscow two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was possible that the supply reduction deal could run to the end of next year, although Russia has not made any commitment.",Extraordinary steps may be needed in 2018 to rebalance oil market: OPEC's Barkindo,https://www.reuters.com/article/opec-india/extraordinary-steps-may-be-needed-in-2018-to-rebalance-oil-market-opecs-barkindo-idINKBN1CD0HS

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear weapons were a “powerful deterrent” that guaranteed its sovereignty, state media reported on Sunday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said “only one thing will work” in dealing with the isolated country.

Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.

In a speech to a meeting of the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party on Saturday, a day before Trump’s most recent comments, state media said Kim had addressed the “complicated international situation”.

North Korea’s nuclear weapons are a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,” Kim said, referring to the “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

North Korea is preparing to test-launch such a missile, a Russian lawmaker who had just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday.

Donald Trump has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies.

The situation proved that North Korea’s policy of “byungjin”, meaning the parallel development of nuclear weapons and the economy was “absolutely right”, Kim Jong Un said in the speech.

“The national economy has grown on their strength this year, despite the escalating sanctions,” said Kim, referring to U.N. Security Council resolutions put in place to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program.

SISTER PROMOTION

“It shows that her portfolio and writ is far more substantive than previously believed and it is a further consolidation of the Kim family’s power,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University’s 38 North website.

In January, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo Jong along with other North Korean officials over “severe human rights abuses”.

Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol, two of the three men behind Kim’s banned rocket program, were also promoted.

State media announced that several other high ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee in what the South Korean unification ministry said could be an attempt by North Korea to navigate a way through its increasing isolation.

“The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong Un is taking the current situation seriously, and that he’s looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians,” the ministry said in a statement.

North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, who named Donald Trump “President Evil” in a bombastic speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, was promoted to full vote-carrying member of the politburo.

“Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea’s top policy makers,” said Madden.

“Even if he has informal or off the record meetings, Ri’s interlocutors can be assured that whatever proposals they proffer will be taken directly to the top,” he said.","Kim Jong Un praises nuclear program, promotes sister to center of power",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CD03N

The animals are fitted with infrared bio-sensors which monitor their heartbeat and movement. Data is analyzed by a computer, and any changes in the animals’ body or behavior flags a change in the purity levels of the water in its tank.

“When three or more crayfish are moving or change their pulse activity, we know that the water parameters have changed. We can react quickly because we have the result within three minutes,” head brewer Michal Voldrich told Reuters.

The water system was developed and patented by scientists at the Faculty of Fisheries and Protection of Water at South Bohemia University at Vodnany.

“We are using crayfish like a living chemical laboratory – like a bio indicator and bio sensor together,” said Pavel Kozak, Director of the university’s Research Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology.

“The crayfish react very fast on any non-specific change, which is different than any other detectors, which react fast on a very low concentration (of pollution) but only on one specific agent.”

Researchers aim to upgrade the technology used in the scheme, and plan to use special cameras to monitor the animals’ hearts.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Catalonia’s capital Barcelona on Sunday to express their opposition to declaring independence from Spain, showing how divided the region is on the issue.

A crowd estimated by local police to number 350,000 waved Spanish and Catalan flags and carried banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”. They poured into the city center after politicians on both sides hardened their positions in the country’s worst political crisis for decades.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Saturday he would not rule out removing Catalonia’s government and calling a fresh local election if it claimed independence, as well as suspending the wealthy region’s existing autonomous status.

The stark warning came days before Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the region’s parliament, on Tuesday, when he could unilaterally declare independence.

The anti-independence demonstration, which included Catalans and people from other parts of Spain, underlined how the dispute has riven the region itself, coming less than a month after a million people rallied in the same city to support independence.

“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said during Sunday’s rally. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.”

The northeastern region of 7.5 million people, which has its own language and culture, held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 in defiance of a Spanish court ban.

More than 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who voted backed secession, according to Catalan officials. But that turnout represented only 43 percent of the region’s 5.3 million eligible voters as many opponents of independence stayed away.

The Spanish government sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers fired rubber bullets and charged crowds with truncheons in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and dramatically escalated the dispute.

CATALONIA‘S IMPORTANCE

Losing Catalonia is almost unthinkable for the Spanish government.

It would deprive Spain of about 16 percent of its people, a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. Catalonia is also the top destination for foreign tourists, attracting about a quarter of Spain’s total.

There is widespread opposition to a Catalan breakaway among people in the rest of the country.

The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia. The board of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis will meet on Monday to discuss moving its head office elsewhere in Spain, a source familiar with the matter said.

Concern is growing in EU capitals about the impact of the crisis on the Spanish economy, the fourth largest in the euro zone, and on possible spillovers to other economies.

Some European officials are also worried that any softening in Spain’s stance towards Catalan independence could fuel secessionist feelings among other groups in Europe such as Belgium’s Flemings and Italy’s Lombards.

‘DRASTIC SOLUTIONS’

Until this weekend, Rajoy has remained vague on whether he would take the unprecedented step of triggering Article 155 of the constitution, the so-called nuclear option which enables him to sack the regional government and call a local election.

However, asked if he was ready to do so, Rajoy told El Pais newspaper on Saturday: “I don’t rule out anything that is within the law ... Ideally, we shouldn’t have to take drastic solutions but for that not to happen there would have to be changes.”

Rajoy also said he planned to leave in Catalonia the 4,000 national police the government had shipped in for the referendum, until the crisis was over.

He ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said he is open to - and added the issue would not force a snap national election.

Sunday’s demonstration in Barcelona was organized by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society to mobilizes what it believes is a “silent majority” of citizens in Catalonia who oppose independence.

“The people who have come to demonstrate don’t feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”

The rally was addressed by Nobel prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who has dual Spanish and Peruvian nationality. He told reporters it showed many Catalans “don’t want the coup d‘etat the Catalan government is fostering”.

Tens of thousands of people had gathered in 50 cities across Spain on Saturday, some defending Spain’s national unity and others dressed in white and calling for talks to defuse the crisis.",Thousands protest in Barcelona against Catalan independence,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/thousands-protest-in-barcelona-against-catalan-independence-idUKKBN1CD0E8?il=0

La convocatoria para trabajar unos días llegó en septiembre pero mientras, y percibiendo sólo 50.000 bolívares semanales (unos 2 dólares según el cambio del mercado paralelo), hizo mudanzas con su desgastada camioneta del 2011 en la ciudad industrial de Valencia e intentó revender materiales de construcción para llegar a fin de mes.

Como él, miles de empleados de transnacionales como Fiat Chrysler (FCA) o Nestlé en Venezuela esperan meses y hasta años la reactivación de decenas de fábricas que parecen muertos vivientes: detenidas o trabajando al mínimo por falta de materia prima, en medio de la profunda escasez y recesión económica que sufre el país petrolero.

Así, unas 150 multinacionales que permanecen en el país han minimizado su presencia ante el deterioro económico de Venezuela.

Para seguir a flote, han reducido sus proyectos o se centran en presentaciones más baratas y fáciles de fabricar, operando en modo supervivencia, según dijeron a Reuters sindicatos, gremios y los portavoces de las compañías.

Y es que para muchas empresas salir del país tampoco parece una opción viable. Huir de Venezuela implicaría tener que rematar los bienes o dejarlos abandonados, como hicieron grandes firmas como Clorox o Kimberly-Clark, algo especialmente doloroso para marcas que durante décadas construyeron su presencia en el mercado.

Por eso es normal ver escenas como las de la planta de FCA en Valencia, a dos horas de Caracas, donde hay camionetas a medio montar acumulando polvo a la espera de alguna pieza que falta, como parabrisas o retrovisores, según una veintena de empleados parados en la puerta de la ensambladora.

De armar 10.286 unidades en el 2010, la planta pasó a producir cero el año pasado. En lo que va del año sacó unos 150 coches a la calle, mientras el 60 por ciento de su plantilla se queda en casa, según trabajadores y líderes sindicales.

“Lo que nos plantean los directivos es que la intención de la empresa no es irse. Es más difícil reiniciar un negocio nuevamente desde cero que mantenerse y aguantar todo este vendaval de situaciones”, reflexionó Henry Ospina, del sindicato de FCA. “Pero la inquietud está”.

A COMER A LA FÁBRICA

Aunque se sienten “pseudoempleados”, los trabajadores de las multinacionales al menos se las ven mejor que los venezolanos que, sin empleo, luchan por conseguir algo de los escasos alimentos y medicinas que importa el país.

Según los últimos datos oficiales disponibles, hasta abril del 2016 la mitad de la población activa estaba desempleada, o trabajaba de manera informal en oficios como el de taxista u otros empleos por cuenta propia.

Los empleados que se mantienen en sus puestos cobran cerca del 20 por ciento de lo que ganaban y no tienen bonos ni horas extras. Algunos van a los comedores de las plantas detenidas para tomar almuerzos pagados por las firmas, que intentan mantenerse en pie a la espera de tiempos mejores.

La cafetería de FCA, por ejemplo, abre para brindar almuerzos diarios a 60 de sus 800 trabajadores más necesitados, en un país dónde siete de cada diez personas dijeron haber perdido al menos 8 kilos de peso en un año, según el más reciente sondeo hecho por universidades privadas en 2016.

“Este año he trabajado 6 días”, confesó Pedro Rodríguez, de 44 años, otro empleado con más de dos décadas en FCA. “Pero he venido más veces para ir al comedor, porque es un plato de comida que me estoy ahorrando en la casa”.

“Hay compañeros que dejan de comer la mitad de la comida de aquí y se la llevan a su casa”, dijo, vestido con su uniforme con las siglas de la planta.

La industria venezolana está atravesando su peor momento en décadas. Miles de empresas han reducido su producción y al menos dos de cada 10 están paradas por falta de materiales o pedidos, según una encuesta de Conindustria, el principal gremio de fabricantes del país petrolero.

Y las que siguen en pie, operan a un tercio de su capacidad.

Como parte del esquema de supervivencia, las empresas también optan por reducir turnos, nóminas y los días que trabajan, buscando estirar su poca materia prima.

“Este año no he producido, pero me han pagado el sueldo”, dijo Núñez, en su humilde casa, usando su camisa azul con el logo de Ford, ya que ese día de agosto fue citado en la fábrica para conocer un plan para reactivar la producción de 50 camiones de un nuevo modelo.

Finalmente en septiembre se concretó su regreso a la planta, para producir algunas unidades, pero solo trabajó siete días.

“Nos dijeron: si el vehículo es aceptado en el mercado se viene la producción y si no...”, explicó encogiéndose de hombros. “Ford me ha dado mucha estabilidad para ayudar a mi familia. Pero uno sabe que no es culpa de ellos, sino por la situación del país”, agregó el padre de dos hijos adolescentes.

Poco menos de una decena de firmas globales, como General Mills o la autopartista Dana, vendieron en el último año sus filiales venezolanas, mayormente a empresarios locales que, si bien no quedaron exentos de las dificultades, compraron activos baratos.

Pero el Gobierno socialista de Nicolás Maduro sostiene que las firmas globales limitan de manera intencional su producción en medio de una “guerra económica” que libran sus adversarios.

Reuters solicitó comentarios al ministerio de Comunicación pero no obtuvo respuesta.

INDEMNIZANDO CON NEUMÁTICOS

Ford contó a Reuters que su planta de Valencia apenas había producido unos 400 coches hasta agosto -cuando en el 2012 ensamblaron 17.000- con una fuerza de trabajo limitada y cientos de obreros en casa. Aún así, Ford “no tiene planes de dejar el país”, aclaró la empresa en un correo electrónico.

Buscando oxígeno, la automotriz estadounidense empezó en el 2015 a vender coches en dólares, una práctica permitida en el sector, que les servirían para comprar sin pasar por el control de cambios.

Otras firmas, como Fiat Chrysler (FCA) y Toyota, le siguieron, pero todas con resultados limitados: los venezolanos con acceso a miles de dólares al contado son pocos.

En los concesionarios, lujosas todoterreno se quedan esperando compradores. La destrucción de la economía de escala y los cuellos de botella en la importación de piezas elevan los precios hasta 20.000 dólares más que en otros países, haciendo de ese mercado uno aún más exclusivo.

La sobreoferta en las tiendas de autos, contrasta con los anaqueles vacíos de los supermercados.

Las firmas de alimentos también tienen que parar varias veces al año sus líneas de producción en espera de materia prima. La gigante de alimentos Nestlé a finales de septiembre detuvo su producción de colados de fruta para bebés porque no tenía envases de vidrios, dijo la empresa.

La compañía agregó en un comunicado que a pesar de la suspensión seguirá pagando a sus trabajadores, aunque un representante del sindicato dijo a Reuters que el salario diario no era ni siquiera el equivalente a una botella de refresco.

El Gobierno de Maduro recortó el año pasado a la mitad las importaciones, reaccionando al fin de una mermante bonanza petrolera que según sus críticos, no supo administrar.

El mandatario alega que es víctima de un sabotaje de opositores y empresarios, en medio de una inflación anual que desde hace dos años se mantiene en tres dígitos y una parálisis económica, que devoran los salarios rápidamente.

El consumo, boyante hasta hace un lustro entre los venezolanos que gozaron de compras de vehículos, viajes y bienes de lujo financiados con divisas baratas, cayó un 15 por ciento en el 2016 y se espera que se contraiga otro 25 por ciento este año, según cifras de la firma local Ecoanalítica.

Imposibilitadas para reducir de forma sustancial su nómina, por la ley local que prohíbe los despidos, las empresas han empezado a ofrecer arreglos cada vez más descabellados a cambio de recibir renuncias voluntarias.

En FCA, por ejemplo, la oferta de liquidación viene acompañada de cuatro neumáticos. Consultada sobre su precaria situación, FCA dijo en un correo electrónico que hace “sus mejores esfuerzos para mantener la producción en niveles adecuados a la disponibilidad de insumos”, sin aportar detalles.

Pero hasta agosto, 23 trabajadores, muchos de ellos con el plan de emigrar, habían aceptado las ruedas para revenderlas en un país con una fuerte escasez de estos productos.

“NO ESTAMOS GANANDO, NI PERDIENDO”

La planta de jabones de Colgate-Palmolive, está detenida desde febrero porque, según los trabajadores, la firma no cubre sus costes al producir barras de jabón a menos de 0,05 centavos de dólar, como le exige el Estado.

Desde hace años, el Gobierno fija los precios de productos como la leche y el jabón, que pierden vigencia rápido por la galopante inflación. También fija el tipo de cambio al que vende el dólar en un control de cambio cada vez menos funcional.

Hace poco, Colgate reinició su producción de pasta dental a precio regulado, empaquetada en cajas de cartón reciclado marrón para ahorrar costos. También descartó versiones infantiles o con blanqueador, reduciendo su portafolio de 300 productos a menos de una docena, dijo su representante sindical, Félix Bello.

La compañía estadounidense no respondió cuando Reuters le solicitó información.

Mientras tanto, empaques rojos similares a los de Colgate importados de China, con nombres como “Coigore” o “Connert”, se ofrecen en tiendas a precios 10 veces por encima del regulado.

Otra gigante del cuidado personal, Johnson & Johnson, solo produce protectores diarios femeninos en el país. Años atrás, fabricaba o importaba desde enjuague bucal y jabón hasta champú para bebés y cremas hidratantes.

Aún así, la multinacional acordó mantener el salario y los tres turnos de sus 157 empleados, aunque sólo operen tres de las siete líneas de producción de la factoría, dijo Jaime Guevara, un representante de su sindicato.

“Johnson & Johnson tiene una responsabilidad con nuestros empleados y la comunidad”, agregó una portavoz de la empresa.

Pero aunque haya firmas que siguen apostando a “esperar y ver”, no hay señales claras de que el gobierno de Maduro pueda mejorar las condiciones porque depende de una empresa petrolera en deterioro. En este contexto ha tenido que vender menos divisas, vitales para el flujo productivo de las empresas.

“Pensamos que en algún momento el país debería volver a la normalidad y ya entonces nosotros tendremos una planta armada”, dijo el gerente general de una firma estadounidense de productos químicos, que incluía limpiadores e insecticidas, y que pidió no ser identificado.

La empresa redujo drásticamente su gama de productos y sólo fabrica con materias primas locales, mientras sus trabajadores hacen labores de mantenimientos en la fábrica, como pintar las paredes o cortar la grama.

“No estamos ganando pero tampoco estamos perdiendo. Ni estamos pensando más en eso”, concluyó.

LA SOMBRA DE GENERAL MOTORS

Pero los gerentes, dirigentes de gremios y sindicatos consultados coinciden en que estas estrategias para comprar tiempo podrían no ser sostenibles por más de dos años.

Y muchos usan la reciente salida de General Motors del país como su fábula con moraleja.

Si bien GM dejó de ensamblar vehículos en el 2015, apenas este año se retiró del todo. La fábrica está abandonada en la zona industrial de Valencia que tiene un 80 por ciento de sus plantas paradas, según el mayor gremio empresarial.

En una visita reciente de Reuters, un grupo de exobreros hacía una sopa en la entrada usando leña. Otros entrenaban a sus hijos en un campo de béisbol. La grama crecía indómita hasta las pantorrillas y el gimnasio albergaba nidos de palomas.

Hace pocas semanas la fabricante estadounidense de pinturas Axalta Coating Systems también cesó su producción en Venezuela por la “situación económica y política” del país, y despidió a sus sorprendidos empleados.

Otras firmas podrían tomar decisiones fundamentales pronto. FCA dijo en su más reciente informe de resultados financieros que, ante la “pérdida de control” que experimentan en su unidad de Venezuela, estarían considerando desconsolidarla de sus resultados globales.

Y para muchas marcas internacionales la desconsolidación ha sido el primer paso antes de partir, o en su defecto, vender.

“Ninguno está exento de lo que está sucediendo”, dijo Carlos Rodríguez, miembro del sindicato de Colgate-Palmolive. “Cuando veas las barbas de tu vecino arder, pon las tuyas en remojo”.",En modo zombi: las multinacionales que trabajan a medias en Venezuela,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idESKBN1CD0O4-OESBS

SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton was within reach of his fourth Formula One title on Sunday after winning the Japanese Grand Prix for Mercedes while Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel suffered engine problems and failed to finish.

The Briton, who started from pole position, crossed the line 1.2 seconds ahead of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo to move 59 points clear at the top of the overall standings.

Vettel made it no further than the fourth lap before retiring in the pits.

Already 34 points behind Hamilton before the start, the setback was the third in as many races for the German, whose hopes now rest on Hamilton suffering similar misfortune in the last four grands prix.

“I could only have dreamed of having this kind of gap,” said Hamilton, interviewed on the podium by Indianapolis 500 winner Takuma Sato.

“I wouldn’t say that I have one hand on it (the title),” he added later. “There’s still 100 points available so I‘m still going to keep the pedal to the metal.”

Sunday’s win was the 61st of Hamilton’s career and third at the Suzuka circuit. It came a day after the 32-year-old smashed the track record to seize pole at the 5.8-km track in dominant style.

With the gap he now holds over Vettel, the 32-year-old could clinch the title as soon as the next race in Austin, Texas, on Oct. 22.

HURT AND DISAPPOINTED

Vettel had lined up alongside the Briton, raising the prospect of the two title rivals racing side by side to the first corner, but the Ferrari had already run into trouble before the start.

Vettel’s mechanics changed his car’s spark plug on the grid and seemed to have resolved the problem. But while he made a clean start, Hamilton chopped across to keep the lead at the first corner.

Clearly lacking power, Vettel fell back through the field before getting the call from his race engineer to retire the car.

“Of course it hurts, and we’re all disappointed,” said the four times world champion, who hugged his mechanics and gave the crowd a quick wave after returning to the pits.

“For sure now you don’t look at the positives because it’s not the day to look at positives,” he added.

With Vettel sidelined and Mercedes back up to speed after two lacklustre weekends, Hamilton’s afternoon should have consisted of a straightforward drive to victory but late tyre vibrations allowed Verstappen to reel him in.

For a moment it looked like the Dutchman could cause a late upset and snatch a second consecutive win to add to his triumph in Malaysia.

But with back markers between him and the chasing Red Bull, Hamilton hung on.

“The first half of the race was very well under control and the second part was a lot harder,” said Hamilton. “I had massive understeer. I‘m really grateful the car stuck in and I didn’t make any mistakes.”

Valtteri Bottas, who had started sixth due to a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, fought through to finish fourth for Mercedes.

Fellow Finn Kimi Raikkonen, also struck by a gearbox-related grid penalty, was the sole-surviving Ferrari in fifth.

Force India’s Esteban Ocon, who ran as high as third at one stage, was sixth ahead of Mexican team-mate Sergio Perez, as the Silverstone-based team came away with another strong haul of points.

Kevin Magnussen was eighth ahead of Haas team-mate Romain Grosjean. Brazilian Felipe Massa rounded out the top 10 for Williams.

RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - A final assault on Islamic State’s last line of defense in its former Syrian capital Raqqa should begin on Sunday night, a field commander for the U.S.-backed forces operating there said.

The loss of Islamic State’s remaining streets and buildings in Raqqa following its defeat in Iraq’s Mosul this year and its retreat from swathes of territory in both countries, would mark a major milestone in the battle to destroy the jihadist group.

The assault on militants in the center of the northern city will focus on surrounding the sports stadium there, said a field commander in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in western Raqqa, who gave his name as Ardal Raqqa.

“Daesh is massing there because this is the last stage. They will resist, or they will surrender or die,” he said. “This their last stand to the death.”

Islamic State declared a caliphate in 2014 and at the height of its power ruled over millions of people, from northern Syria to the outskirts of Iraq’s capital Baghdad, but it has since endured a series of losses under attack from many sides.

Raqqa was the group’s de facto Syrian capital, a center of operations where it oversaw the management of much of eastern, central and northern Syria and planned attacks abroad.

Now it is hemmed into a small area in the city center that includes the stadium, the National Hospital and a roundabout where Islamic State once displayed the heads of its enemies.

In the hours before the expected launch of the final assault, which the commander said could take up to a week, the sound of gunfire sporadically rattled around the area near the hospital.

The district had been flattened, with buildings completely gone. Coalition jets soared overhead and air strikes pounded at a higher rate than in recent days.

RIVAL OFFENSIVES

Islamic State has lost most of its territory to the SDF, spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, and to a rival offensive by Syria’s army and allied forces this year, and has fallen back on the fertile Euphrates valley area downstream of Raqqa.

The army and its allies reached the city of Deir al-Zor in September after a months-long offensive across the Syrian desert, and have since then pushed down the Euphrates towards the border with Iraq.

On Sunday a Syrian military source said they had encircled Islamic State fighters in the city of al-Mayadin, one of the jihadists’ last strongholds in the area.

“Units of our armed forces with the allied forces continue their advance on a number of fronts and axes in Deir al-Zor and its countryside... and encircle Daesh terrorists in the city of al-Mayadin,” the military source said.

However, the group has still been able to launch a series of effective counter attacks against the Syrian army in the central desert region over the past week, putting pressure on the main supply road to Deir al-Zor from the west.

RUSSIA, U.S.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is backed in the war by Russia, Iran and Shi‘ite militias including Lebanon’s Hezbollah, and its campaign against Islamic State has mostly been on the west bank of the river.

The U.S.-backed SDF campaign has mostly been on the east bank, where Raqqa is located, and has also advanced downstream to hold areas opposite Deir al-Zor. The United States and Russia have put in place channels to lessen the risk of fighting between the rival offensives they back.

U.S. officials have previously said that Islamic State had relocated some of its diminished command and propaganda structures to al-Mayadin as it was forced from territory elsewhere.

The spokeswoman for the SDF campaign in Raqqa, Jihan Sheikh Ahmad, said in a statement on a website for the campaign that it would announce the liberation of Raqqa “in the coming few days” after having captured 85 percent of the city.

Commanders directing the battle in Raqqa have said that Islamic State fighters have taken civilian hostages and are using sniper fire, booby traps and tunnels to slow the SDF advance.

The SDF began its campaign to isolate Raqqa early this year, pushing along several fronts to enclose the city against the Euphrates backed by coalition air strikes and special forces.

Its attack on the city itself started in June and the fighting left much of Raqqa in ruins, as intense air strikes and street-to-street battles devastated buildings.",Final assault on Islamic State in Raqqa to start on Sunday -commander,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/final-assault-on-islamic-state-in-raqqa-to-start-on-sunday-commander-idINKBN1CD0A5

AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish army reconnaissance team scouted out Syria’s Idlib province on Sunday, a senior Syrian rebel said, before an expected military operation to impose peace in the bitterly contested Syrian northwest.

“When we don’t go to Syria, Syria comes to us,” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party. “If we didn’t take our measures, bombs would fall on our cities.”

Turkey says it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed, aiming to implement a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area, the most populous pocket of Syria still in rebel hands.

Although Turkish officials say they are helping the rebels from within Turkey, in past interventions they have also sent troops across the frontier.

Any incursion could bring them into conflict with powerful jihadists from al Qaeda’s former Syrian branch, although there were signs on Sunday that they were working to avoid a confrontation.

Local sources said the Turkish military vehicles were escorted into Idlib by a convoy of fighters from the group, which has joined a jihadist alliance called Tahrir al-Sham and disavowed links to the network founded by Osama bin Laden.

Nonetheless, the jihadists and the Turkish military earlier exchanged fire nearby, underscoring the tension as Turkey builds up its forces and the rebel groups it backs prepare to enter Idlib.

“We will never allow a terror corridor that begins in Afrin and goes to the Mediterranean,” Erdogan said, referring to the stretch of Turkey’s southern border which is controlled on the Syrian side by Kurdish fighters and Tahrir al-Sham.

Related Coverage Erdogan says Turkey working with Syria rebels to implement Idlib accord

Turkey has been one of the biggest supporters of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the six-and-a-half-year war, but its focus has moved from ousting him to securing its own border against jihadist and Kurdish groups.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim stressed the importance of ensuring de-escalation near the border, following an agreement reached in Astana, Kazakhstan last month that was backed both by the Turks and by Russia, which supports Assad.

“We will ensure safety in Idlib, and will cooperate with Russia,” Yildirim said.

Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former Nusra Front, which was al Qaeda’s Syrian branch until last year when it changed its name and broke allegiance to the global network, has been a formidable military force since early in the conflict.

Since early this year it has battled other rebel groups as it tried to gain control over areas including Idlib.

UNDER ESCORT

Idlib and neighboring parts of northwest Syria are now home to more than 2 million people, many of them refugees from other formerly rebel-held regions that fell to pro-government forces.

A local resident and another local rebel said they had seen Turkish military vehicles enter Idlib and then travel under Tahrir al-Sham escort along a road.

The senior Syrian rebel said the reconnaissance team went to Sheikh Barakat, a location that overlooks both rebel-held areas of Aleppo province, adjacent to Idlib, and the Kurdish-controlled area of Afrin.

Erdogan gave no details of the operation, but said it was going ahead “without problems at the moment”.

Turkey’s biggest security concern on the frontier is the Kurdish YPG militia, which as part of a U.S.-backed alliance is fighting against Islamic State in eastern Syria. Ankara regards the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey.

Mortars were fired from the area under YPG control near to the location where the Turkish reconnaissance team was operating, the senior rebel said.

“The Turkish team is on its way back. Its mission has been accomplished. They visited areas of disengagement and locations where the Turkish army would be positioned,” the rebel said.

Reuters witnesses, local people, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said earlier on Sunday the Turkish military and Tahrir al-Sham had clashed near the village of Kafr Lusin in Idlib.

Tahrir al-Sham began the exchange by firing on a Turkish bulldozer removing sections of a border wall and Turkish artillery returned fire, they said. The area was later quiet.

Rebel groups that will take part - drawn from the Euphrates Shield campaign that Turkey backed with armor and troops in another part of Syria to the east since last year - said on Saturday they expected the Idlib operation to start very soon.

Tahrir al-Sham said “the lions of jihad and martyrdom will be waiting to pounce” against any incursion into Idlib.

Or, as some conservatives fear, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be prime minister.","British politics are a terrible mess. But don’t blame populism, however that’s defined. If anything, blame democracy – however that’s organized.

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Zurich Insurance (ZURN.S) will have cut costs by $700 million by the end of the year, nearly halfway to its goal to save $1.5 billion by 2019, Chief Executive Mario Greco said in an interview published on Saturday.

“We’re on track,” Greco told the daily Neue Zuercher Zeitung. “It’s a big challenge, because we must simultaneously cut costs as well as invest.”

Greco, who had engineered a turnaround at Italy’s Generali (GASI.MI) , was brought in last year by Zurich to reduce the company’s high cost base and simplify its business to help boost profitability that had been falling short of its own targets.

Asked if a dividend target of 75 percent of net profit was too high, Greco responded by saying the company is satisfied with its AA debt rating and has no ambition to attain AAA, meaning further measures to strengthen capital is not a priority.

“An excessive build-up of capital reserves weakens our discipline and leads to a situation where money is deployed inefficiently,” Greco said. “Additionally, it puts pressure on the return on equity and doesn’t help us any further.”

Greco told the newspaper Zurich does not need additional capital to support organic growth of its property insurance or life insurance businesses, as these already generate significant cashflow.

But the company needs to invest in internal initiatives including new digital technology to become more responsive to its customers’ changing needs, he said.

Pressed about what he meant by Thursday’s comment, the U.S. leader declined to elaborate, telling reporters only that, “You’ll find out.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders also declined to say what Trump meant.

When asked whether Trump was just being mischievous, Sanders denied he was just “messing with the press.”

“You begin to assume that it’s more about getting attention than it is about proclaiming some kind of national policy. I don’t think it’s responsible...but I think in this instance we probably all should take a deep breath and try to assume he’s just making a play for attention,” Panetta told CNN.

Russian officials have accused Washington of putting unwarranted pressure on the U.S. operations of RT, a Kremlin-funded broadcaster accused by some in Washington of interfering in domestic U.S. politics, which it denies.

The foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said the full weight of the U.S. authorities was being brought to bear against RT’s operations in the United States, and that Moscow had the right to respond.

“We have never used Russian law in relation to foreign correspondents as a lever of pressure, or censorship, or some kind of political influence, never,” Zakharova said in an interview with Russia’s NTV broadcaster. “But this is a particular case.”

She cited a 1991 Russian law which, she said, stated that if a Russian media outlet is subject to restrictions in a foreign country, then Moscow has the right to impose proportionate restrictions on media outlets from that country operating inside Russia.

“Correspondingly, everything that Russian journalists and the RT station are subject to on U.S. soil, after we qualified it as restriction of their activities, we can apply similar measures to American journalists, American media here, on Russian territory,” Zakharova said.

She did not identify any specific U.S. media outlets that would be targeted. She said it made no difference from the Russian government’s point of view if those outlets were backed by the U.S. state, or privately-funded.

Late last month, Russia’s state communications regulator accused U.S. TV channel CNN International of violating its license to broadcast in Russia and said it had summoned the broadcaster’s representatives in connection with the matter.

The watchdog did not publicly disclose the nature of the violation. The head of the regulator said it was a technical matter and denied that politics was involved.

U.S. intelligence officials, in a report in January this year into allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, said RT was part of a state-run propaganda machine that supported a Kremlin campaign to influence U.S. politics.

(Reuters) - Unseeded Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia won the biggest singles title of her career with a 6-4 7-6(3) victory over soon-to-be world number one Simona Halep in the China Open final in Beijing on Sunday.

Garcia extended her winning streak to 11 matches and added to her Wuhan Open triumph last week. The current world number 15 will climb to ninth in the rankings on Monday, marking her Top 10 debut.

Halep, who will take over as number one in the next rankings, broke Garcia’s serve in the first game of the match but the 23-year-old hit back immediately, breaking the Romanian twice to win the first set.

With the score tied at 3-3 in the second set, Garcia saved nine consecutive break points in the seventh game, before taking a 4-3 lead but Halep recovered to force a tiebreak.

The Frenchwoman became the first to complete the Wuhan and Beijing double and is now on track to qualify for the season-ending WTA finals, as her win took her past Briton Johanna Konta to number eight in the Race to Singapore rankings.

PARIS (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron may have won the opening salvo in his battle to reform France’s economy, but a nationwide strike by public workers this week will put more pressure on a leader struggling to shake off criticism that he is “president of the rich”.

Strike notices have been lodged in schools, hospitals, airports and government ministries. Tuesday’s protest over plans to axe 120,000 jobs and reduce sick leave compensation will be the first time in a decade that all nine unions representing 5.4 million public workers have united behind a protest call.

The walkout comes as Macron, 39, looks to reverse damaging headlines after a week in which he scrapped a wealth tax and was recorded making unsympathetic remarks about workers at a struggling factory. Opponents reacted by branding him out of touch with ordinary voters.

“It should be a massive mobilization of workers,” Mylene Jacquot, a senior official from France’s largest trade union, the moderate CFDT, told reporters.

Macron says France’s economy needs re-shaping to lure investment and rein in spending, as he strives to persuade Berlin that Paris can be a credible partner with whom to drive European reform.

Public sector workers say they are bearing the brunt of the government’s effort to tame its fiscal deficit.

Macron defied tens of thousands of protesters -- far fewer compared with demonstrations of the past -- last month to drive through labor reforms that simplify employment rules and give companies more power to set working conditions.

Civil servants, retired people and students are not giving up as they look anxiously towards a proposed overhaul of the employment insurance and pension systems.

So far, Unions have been unable to speak with a single voice.

Among workers there are signs of mounting agitation for a tougher stance, notably from the CFDT and Force Ouvriere union which both shunned the labor reform strikes.

“You can hear it in the room. The rank and file is saying ‘we’ve got to act, we’ve got to give a different answer’,” Norbert Raffolt told union bosses at a CFDT convention.

SCHOOL CLOSURES, FLIGHT DISRUPTION

Government measures to cut housing aid and increase certain social security contributions while reducing corporate tax and scrapping a levy on wealth have infuriated socialist opponents and drawn attacks from left-leaning media

“Robin Hood robbed from the rich to give to the poor. Macron is more cold-hearted, more ruthless: he takes from the poorest to give to the wealthiest,” wrote one commentator in Liberation newspaper.

The centrist government says its policies are balanced and will increase the spending power of households.

“We want to create wealth in France ... and at the same time take steps to bolster the purchasing power of workers, of pensioners,” Francois de Rugy, a close Macron ally and president of the National Assembly, told Europe 1 radio on Sunday.

Until now, Macron, whose popularity has slumped since he came to power in May, has been able to take comfort from the divided response of unions to his sweeping reform agenda.

France was once a champion of social protest, with unions able to shut down swathes of the economy and force ministers to respond. But strikes have become less frequent and less successful as the number heeding calls for industrial action falls.

Companies in France lost 81 days to strikes per 1,000 workers in 2014, compared with more than 300 days in the late 1990s and over a thousand days in the late 1980s, according to government data.

It is not clear how much disruption Tuesday’s public workers’ strike will cause to schools, transport networks, hospitals and libraries.

One teachers’ union said nearly half of all primary school teachers in Paris would strike on Tuesday, forcing dozens of schools to close. The aviation authority has asked airlines to cancel a third of flights at airports across the country because of anticipated staff shortages.","France's Macron, unions seek upper hand in struggle over reforms",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-reform-protests/frances-macron-unions-seek-upper-hand-in-struggle-over-reforms-idUSKBN1CD0KI?il=0

The race from the northern city of Darwin to the southern city of Adelaide is expected to take a week for most cars, with speeds of 90-100 kmh (55-62 mph) powered only by the sun.

The fastest time was achieved by Japan’s Tokai University in 2009, completing the transcontinetal race in only 29 hours and 49 minutes.

But reigning 2015 champions Nuon from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands believes it has a good chance of retaining the prize.

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Britain’s struggles to chart a way out of the European Union are boosting the case for Scottish independence, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Sunday, but she shied away from committing to a date for another referendum vote.

Scotland rejected independence by a 10 percentage point margin in a 2014 vote, and polls indicate that support for it has not shifted significantly since then.

“We will consider the (independence referendum) timing again when we have more clarity on what we face,” Sturgeon said, speaking as her Scottish National Party (SNP) began a three-day conference in Glasgow.

“People watch the chaos that is engulfing the UK right now and people look ahead and see the damage that is likely to be done by this unfolding disaster that is not just Brexit but this incompetent and chaotic approach to Brexit being presided over by (Conservative Prime Minister) Theresa May,” she told the BBC.

“I think the case for Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands (...) is becoming greater and stronger by the day.”

Sturgeon, who heads the devolved Scottish government, saw her party lose more than one third of its seats in Britain’s June election after it mistimed a push for another vote on secession. It subsequently put the plan on hold.

Brexit has put the union of the UK’s four nations under strain because Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain while Wales and the larger England voted to leave.

Britain’s main parties are fighting over what new relationship is needed with the bloc after 40 years of shared trade and politics. May has seen her authority over the Conservatives erode since a June’s snap election in which she lost her parliamentary majority.

That means Britain still has a choice over the shape of its future trading relations, Sturgeon argued.

“I believe so, so strongly, not for ideological reasons but for hard practical reasons, it would be an act of monumental folly for the UK to come out of the single market.”","Scottish independence case helped by ""Brexit chaos"": Sturgeon",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-scotland/scottish-independence-case-helped-by-brexit-chaos-sturgeon-idUKKBN1CD0AT

En+ Group, a company owned by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska which supplies electricity to and controls aluminium outfit Rusal, aims to raise $1.5 billion in a London and Moscow listing. It touts its clean, mostly Siberian hydropower, but new public investors will have little say. The cornerstone backer, a Singapore-based partner of the Chinese group that just bought into Rosneft, may see greater advantage.

The combination of remote hydro assets and a 48 percent stake in Hong Kong-listed Rusal isn’t easy to value reliably. Adjusted EBITDA for the year to June, which consolidates Rusal, was around $2.8 billion. Apply a 12 times multiple – between Norsk Hydro’s and Rusal’s own – and deduct $5 billion of debt, as reported by Reuters, and other interests in the aluminium producer worth around $6 billion, and En+ equity would be worth a bit more than $20 billion. Estimate enterprise value as two times some $11 billion of consolidated annual sales instead, and the market cap comes out nearer $10 billion.

The final figure depends, of course, on investor appetite. Aluminium made with clean energy has appeal, as dirtier sources have led to the closure of some smelters and end-users are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their entire supply chains. Demand from China and other Asian countries, including for cars, could provide growth opportunities. And En+ reports strong cash flow, supporting dividends.

Yet Russian listings with control concentrated in the hands of Deripaska and his peers don’t have a stellar record. One close-to-home example is Rusal, which listed in 2010 at HK$10.80 a share and promptly traded down 11 percent on its debut. The stock did better in 2011, but since 2012 has languished below HK$7. Another reason for investor caution is that En+ is set to be the first major Russian float in London since 2014, when sanctions were imposed over Crimea.

The IPO’s big backer, though, may have grander ideas. AnAn, a company related to CEFC China Energy, has committed $500 million to the En+ offering. That in part endorses the investment case. But when CEFC last month agreed to buy a 14 percent stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft from Glencore and the Qatar Investment Authority, it looked like a sign of tighter Sino-Russian cooperation on energy. There could be something similar at work with aluminium.",Breakingviews - More for China than London in Russian hydro IPO,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-en-breakingviews/breakingviews-more-for-china-than-london-in-russian-hydro-ipo-idUSKBN1CA1ID

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Friday its general counsel, Bruce Sewell, will retire and be succeeded by former Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) executive Katherine Adams, who will take over Apple’s multinational legal battle against Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).

Adams, who will also be senior vice president of legal and global security, will report to Chief Executive Tim Cook, the company said.

Before joining Honeywell in 2003, Adams was an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP in New York. Earlier, she had served as a clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and for Stephen Breyer, who was then an appeals court judge but later was appointed to the Supreme Court.

Sewell, who has been Apple’s general counsel since 2009, will retire at the end of the year, the company said. Sewell, who came to Apple from Intel Corp (INTC.O), guided Apple through its massive patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) over design patents for the original iPhone, a case that is still simmering nearly six years after it was filed and eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. A U.S. appeals court is currently working to decide the final amount of damages Samsung owes Apple.

In taking the legal reins at Apple, Adams will take over a wide-ranging dispute with Qualcomm over how that chipmaker licenses its technology to Apple. At the heart of the dispute is Qualcomm’s long-held practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iPhones and other Apple devices as a licensing fee for its mobile connectivity patent portfolio.

Apple has sued Qualcomm over that practice in U.S. civil courts as well as 11 foreign jurisdictions. Qualcomm has brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones. Qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action.

Interviews with more than a dozen diplomats and government officials based in Washington, Yangon and Europe revealed that punitive measures aimed specifically at top generals were among a range of options being discussed in response to the crisis.

Nothing has yet been decided and Washington and Brussels may decide to hold off for now, the sources said. There are also discussions about increasing aid for violence-riven Rakhine state.

The active discussion of sanctions – not even on the table a month ago – shows how the dramatic exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar’s northwest is putting pressure on Western policymakers to take action.

While much of the outcry overseas has focused on Nobel laureate and Myanmar’s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, few Western diplomats see an alternative to her leadership. Suu Kyi does not control the military, which still wields considerable power under Myanmar’s army-written constitution.

The EU Foreign Ministers Council will discuss Myanmar on Oct. 16, although officials do not expect any move on sanctions that soon. Danish minister for development cooperation, Ulla Tornaes, told Reuters that Copenhagen had been working to get the crisis on the agenda, “with the wish to put further pressure on the military”.

Two Washington-based U.S. officials with knowledge of the Trump administration’s Myanmar deliberations said targeted sanctions against commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and several other generals, as well as leaders of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist militias accused of torching Rohingya villages, were under consideration.

Such sanctions - if decided on - would likely entail U.S. asset freezes, bans on travel to the United States, prohibitions against Americans doing business with them and other unspecified penalties. Washington was moving cautiously as it consulted with governments in Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia, the U.S. officials said.

A senior Yangon-based European diplomat also said Western countries were coordinating their response to the crisis and were in agreement that it was the military, and specifically the commander-in-chief, who needed to be targeted in any punitive action.

Any punishment was likely to be symbolic at first to allow room for further talks, Yangon-based diplomats said, giving the example of formally banning the army chief, who over the past year visited Brussels, Berlin and Vienna, from further travel to Europe.

Western diplomats admit their leverage is limited: compared with China, whose ties with Myanmar have warmed since Suu Kyi took office 18 months ago, U.S. and European investment and military engagement with the country are small.

They are also wary of action that could hurt the wider economy or destabilize already tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army.

PRESSURE BUILDING

The United Nations is pressing for increased humanitarian access to other parts of Rakhine, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain. How Myanmar responds to calls for increased aid, the investigation of alleged atrocities or repatriation of refugees would be a key consideration in deciding what action to take, U.S. and EU diplomats in Myanmar said.

“We can pile political pressure, look into financing we have in Myanmar. We have humanitarian aid, as well as development aid ... the European Commission won’t invest in the development of Myanmar if the conditions, including security, are not there,” said a Brussels-based EU diplomat who follows Myanmar.

“There is also the arms trade embargo and we discuss regularly whether we should reward the reforms in Myanmar and look at gradual easing of that, or the opposite.”

EU economic sanctions on Myanmar were lifted after the army stepped back from direct rule of the country in 2012, beginning the democratic transition that brought Suu Kyi to power last year, but an arms embargo in force since the 1990s remains. The United States removed most sanctions on Myanmar last autumn. It too has kept an arms embargo in place.

One Washington-based U.S. official said that, while there was no firm deadline, Washington hoped to have a plan of action on Myanmar in place by the time President Donald Trump travels to Asia for a series of summits in the first half of November.

The administration wanted to send a strong message to Myanmar’s military, but was concerned that too drastic action could allow China to expand its growing diplomatic and economic influence in the country, the official said.

There is little support in the administration for the re-imposition of broader economic sanctions, the official added.

The White House declined comment on internal deliberations on the Rohingya crisis.

STRAINED RELATIONS

In another sign of pressure building on Myanmar, New York-based diplomats said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the U.N. General Assembly was pushing for a human rights resolution on the country.

Last year the EU announced that for the first time in 15 years it would not introduce a resolution at the General Assembly’s Third Committee, which focuses on human rights, condemning Myanmar’s record - rewarding it for progress.

The European bloc could revive the resolution in the current session, taking on board the OIC draft and broadening it out beyond the Rohingya crisis, one diplomat in New York said.

Diplomats said some members of the U.N. Security Council were exploring whether the 15-member body could agree a formal statement, or even a resolution, calling for an end to the violence, full access for aid and the safe return of refugees.

However, Myanmar has said it was negotiating with China and Russia, which have veto powers in the Security Council, to protect it from any possible action. China and Russia have both expressed support for the Myanmar government.

Myanmar’s relations with the U.N. have grown increasingly testy since the discovery of World Food Programme-branded biscuits at a suspected militant camp in July prompted the government to accuse the U.N. agency of supporting the insurgents, forcing it to shut down its operations in Rakhine.

Myanmar is stalling on accepting a plan by the U.N. to upgrade the U.N. country head to the more powerful rank of Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) when its current top official, who is due to be rotated, is replaced.

Thaung Tun, Suu Kyi’s National Security Advisor, told Reuters that the U.N. “must treat us equally”.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Geneva prosecutors are investigating after toilets in a bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination euro banknotes, they said on Monday.

“We are not so interested in the motive but we want to be sure of the origin of the money,” spokesman Vincent Derouand said, adding that neither throwing money away nor blocking a toilet was a crime.

The Tribune de Geneve newspaper, which first reported the unusual deposit, said the first blockage occurred in the toilet serving the vault at UBS bank (UBSG.S) in Geneva’s financial district, and three nearby bistros found their facilities bunged up with 500-euro notes a few days later.

Derouand said two people had agreed to compensate the restaurants for the costs of the blockage, and the restaurants had withdrawn a complaint that they made when the incident happened in May.

The cash was confiscated during the investigation and it was unclear who would get it if it was found to be lawful. There was no immediate reason to think it was dirty money, Derouand said.

The European Central Bank said last year it had decided to discontinue the 500-euro note because of concerns that it was being used too often for illicit activities including money laundering.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York’s Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Mitch Golden, portfolio manager for hedge fund Greenlight Masters, speaks during an interview at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. Photo taken May 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has signaled that she could sack Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a Sunday newspaper said, as she tries to reassert her authority after a series of political disasters.

The Sunday Times said it asked May about her plans for Johnson, who has professed loyalty but is accused by some of the prime minister’s allies of undermining her by putting forward his own vision for Britain’s exit from the European Union.

“It has never been my style to hide from a challenge and I‘m not going to start now,” it quoted May as replying, in what it called a signal that she was prepared to bring in new ministers to her cabinet and axe those who had caused her problems.

“I‘m the PM, and part of my job is to make sure I always have the best people in my cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available to me in the party.”

May has seen her authority over her Conservative Party erode since she called a snap election in June in which she lost her majority in parliament.

Johnson, seen as a potential successor to May, said that Conservative lawmakers pushing to unseat her were “nutters”, adding that a change would lead to demands for another election that could bring a resurgent Labour party back to power.

“Are we really going to be stampeded myopically over the edge of the gorge, with an election that no one wants?” he said in the Sunday Telegraph.

Johnson wrote a newspaper article last month outlining his vision of Brexit just days before May made a major speech on the subject.

While professing loyalty, his interventions have been seen as undermining May and causing unnecessary unrest ahead of the party’s conference last week that culminated in a disastrous speech by the prime minister, marred by a coughing fit and letters falling off the slogan on the set behind her.

Johnson made a plea for loyalty with a typical rhetorical flourish on Sunday.

”‘Quo quo scelesti ruitis?', as Horace put it at the beginning of a fresh bout of Rome’s ghastly civil wars, and which roughly translates as: “What do you think you are doing you nutters?”

GONE BY CHRISTMAS?

On Friday, former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said he had garnered the support of 30 lawmakers who wanted to remove May from the party leadership, short of the number needed to launch a formal challenge.

Former Prime Minister John Major said he was increasingly dismayed by the plotting in the party by those driven by their own personal agenda.

“The country has had enough of the self-absorbed and, frankly, disloyal behavior we have witnessed over recent weeks,” he said in the Mail on Sunday.

The speculation about May’s position comes ahead of crucial Brexit talks between Britain and the EU, and the political uncertainty has led to growing concern that no deal would be agreed by March 2019 when Britain leaves the bloc.

Britain’s Sunday newspapers were brimming with briefings from unnamed Conservative figures suggesting May’s days in Downing Street were numbered.

The Sunday Times said three cabinet ministers had discussed the need to replace May.

“It’s a ‘when’ question now,” one of the unnamed ministers told the paper. “It feels to me that this is over before Christmas.”

A fourth minister was quoted as saying there needed to be an orderly transition to a new leader and there was no prospect of May being in charge for the next election due in 2022.

The Observer newspaper said unnamed senior Conservative figures said while May had no long-term future they were pressing her to shake up her team, hoping new blood would re-energise the party as well as frustrate Johnson’s ambitions.",UK's May signals foreign minister Johnson could be sacked,https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-politics-may-reshuffle/uks-may-signals-foreign-minister-johnson-could-be-sacked-idINKBN1CD01R

HAVANA (Reuters) - The man forecast to replace Cuban President Raul Castro early next year rejected U.S. demands that the Communist-run country change its political and economic system.

In a Sunday speech blasting U.S. pressure on the Venezuelan government and what he termed an effort to discredit the Cuban tourism industry, First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel said these and other recent events in the region proved “imperialism can never be trusted, not even a tiny bit, never.”

Diaz-Canel was quoting Ernesto Che Guevara at a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of the revolutionary who had helped lead a Bolivian uprising modeled after Cuba’s.

“Cuba will not make concessions to its sovereignty and independence, nor negotiate its principles or accept the imposition of conditions,” Diaz-Canel said, apparently responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent statement at the United Nations that sanctions would not be lifted until the Caribbean island restores democracy and capitalism.

“The changes needed in Cuba will solely be carried out by the Cuban people,” Diaz-Canel said.

Castro, 86, has announced he will step down as president in February. Experts expect Diaz-Canel, 57, to become the first head of state since the early 1960s without Castro as a last name.

There are no direct elections in Cuba for national office.

Trump said in June that he would once more tighten sanctions on Cuba and seek a better deal from the country than the gradual detente achieved by predecessor Barack Obama.

The Trump administration has drastically reduced staffing at its embassy in Cuba and ordered a reciprocal reduction of Cuban diplomats in Washington due to a series of alleged “health attacks” on U.S. personnel in Havana.

The United States has not blamed Cuba for the still unsolved incidents but holds it responsible for not protecting its personnel. The administration has also issued a travel warning stating U.S. citizens might be targeted.

“Some unnamed officials are propagating unusual nonsense without any evidence, with the perverse aim of discrediting the impeccable reputation of our country as a safe destination for foreign visitors, including from the United States,” Diaz-Canel said.",Likely successor to Cuba's Castro rejects U.S. demands for change,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cuba/likely-successor-to-cubas-castro-rejects-u-s-demands-for-change-idINKBN1CD0MY?il=0

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

Olympic bronze medalist Rupp used his track speed to break open the men’s race in the last five km to finish in a lifetime best two hours, nine minutes and 20 seconds in only his fourth marathon.

“It’s just incredible,” said Rupp, who took advantage of the race’s slow early pace to win, surging in the 38th km to take control.

“I made the mistake in the past of going a little too hard too soon,” said Rupp, the U.S. record holder at 10,000 meters on the track.

“But I just felt a little gap pulling away and at that point, it was like you’ve got to put the hammer down and drive to the finish.”

Defending champion Abel Kirui of Kenya, who was with Rupp at the time, could not keep pace.

“It is a huge win for his career, for the United States,” four-times Chicago winner Khalid Khannouchi, the last American to triumph in 2002, told NBC Chicago. “He has a bright future.”

Kirui finished second in 2:09:48 with countryman Bernard Kipyego third in 2:10:23.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump aimed his Twitter account at sometime ally Senator Bob Corker on Sunday with a series of derisive posts blaming the Republican for the Iran nuclear deal and saying Corker wanted the secretary of state job.Corker, who announced his retirement from the Senate last month, responded to Trump with a sarcastic Twitter post of his own.

The senator from Tennessee had been considered by Trump for the secretary of state position in the months after Trump’s Nov. 8 election win. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been more critical of Trump in recent months, including over the handling of a white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August.

”Senator Bob Corker “begged” me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said “NO” and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement),“ Trump wrote. ”He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said “NO THANKS.” He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!

“Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn’t have the guts to run!”

Corker, whose retirement is a blow to the Republican Party struggling to balance divisions between mainstream and more populist wings, said in his tweet on Sunday: “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.”

Trump has long criticized the 2015 international nuclear pact, a signature foreign policy achievement of former President Barack Obama in which Iran agreed to reduce its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions.

Last week, asked about reported tensions between Trump and the person he eventually chose to be secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, Corker’s response was seen as a jab at Trump.

“I think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary [of Defense James] Mattis, and Chief of Staff [John] Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos,” Corker said, referring to Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly.

Corker also said Tillerson was “in an incredibly frustrating place” where he “ends up not being supported in the way that I hope a secretary of state would be supported,” according to media reports.

Sunday was not the first time Trump has tweeted about Corker and his apparent waffling about whether or not he should seek another Senate term.

In August, Trump said Corker was “constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in ‘18.”

That was after the senator’s remarks on Trump’s response to the Charlottesville demonstration.

In the 1960’s and 1970’s, the central goal was preventing North Korean founder Kim Il Sung from redeploying his army south of the 38th parallel. For the last 25 years, however, the focus of U.S. policymakers has been something even more difficult: the denuclearization of the Kim dynasty.

Pyongyang’s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July, its testing of a Hwasong-12 missile over Japan in August and the September 3 test of what Pyongyang claimed was a hydrogen bomb have only accelerated the sense of urgency in Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo about the need for a strong collective response.

The U.S. foreign policy community has many recommendations on the table but few easy answers. A preventive military strike is not plausible given its devastating cost - Brigadier General Rob Givens (retired) estimates that 20,000 people would perish in Seoul in the first day of a conflict. Even though the U.N. Security Council voted Monday to step up sanctions against Pyongyang, economic restrictions have limited impact. Pyongyang is a master of sanctions evasion, devising ever new and effective ways to keep their weapons programs funded.

John Mecklin: The North Korea nuclear 'crisis' is an illusion

Adele M. Stan: How Trump mainstreamed hate

What may work, however, is a new U.S. approach that learns from its failures - as well as its successes during the Cold War - while tempering expectations on what can be achieved.

The Kim dynasty has long sought recognition as a nuclear weapons state, a demand that would be a political minefield for even the most popular U.S. president to meet. But North Korea is a nuclear state whether Washington offers formal recognition or not. The only way for the U.S. to improve its North Korea policy is by acknowledging that Pyongyang will be nuclear-capable for many years to come and is highly unlikely to eliminate its nuclear weapons program regardless of what Washington offers. This isn’t about what Kim Jong Un wants, but rather what is most likely to serve U.S. national security.

While openly recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power would cause tremors throughout Asia, Trump ought to do it anyway. As soon as he does, the U.S. can re-focus attention from a denuclearization objective that is increasingly impossible to imagine toward an old-fashioned strategy of deterrence and containment. “We know how to contain and degrade enemies who want to do us harm,” Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest told me. “We just need to open a history book and reread what works and apply it for the 21st century.”

For Washington, deterrence and containment would mean building an anti-North Korea alliance of diverse states in and outside the region with the common objective of minimizing Pyongyang’s ability to threaten its neighbors. As former State Department official Richard Sokolsky told me in an email: “If we could deter the likes of Stalin and Mao, we can do the same with Kim.”

As politically risky as this decision would be, effective deterrence would require Trump to establish a reliable channel of communication with the North - similar to the U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-China hotlines during the Cold War - in order to clear up misunderstandings that will inevitably arise and to deliver a unified message of what Washington will tolerate. The signal to the leadership in Pyongyang should be as unambiguous as possible: while Washington does not seek an armed conflict with the North, the U.S. military will respond to any provocation that dangerously impacts the interests of the U.S. or its allies. The message would aim to trade coexistence between the U.S. and North Korea for as long as Kim Jong Un refrains from launching an attack against his neighbors. Given Kim’s preoccupation with self-preservation - there is no evidence to date he is bent on suicidal self-destruction - this arrangement may be pragmatic enough for the young dictator to explore.

Because the Kim dynasty has been accused of exporting and cooperating with countries like Iran and Syria on nuclear designs, missile technology, and possibly chemical weapons development, the Security Council ought to deliver a similar message to Pyongyang that a continuation of this behavior would be grounds for an even tougher and more comprehensive boycott of what it can import and export.

While China remains resistant to cutting off all oil imports to the North or squeezing its economy to the point of collapse, Washington may be willing to enlist Beijing’s help in areas where Beijing is more likely to agree, such as preventing the proliferation of dual use nuclear and missile technology transiting North Korean territory. Stemming the flow of these materials would minimize the spread of weapons of dangerous items to other proliferators, an objective that the Chinese appear to share.

Washington also needs to encourage a stronger South Korea-Japan relationship. Historical rivalries between these two states cannot obstruct the regional intelligence sharing essential to promoting a unity of purpose in East Asia. The Trump administration needs to spend far more diplomatic capital on alliance-building than it has to date. Open talk about scrapping the free trade agreement only destabilizes the kinds of partnerships that form the bedrock of an anti-Pyongyang alliance. Washington can and should allow the South Koreans to take more responsibility for its external defense, but it can do so without giving Pyongyang a reason to believe that its nuclear development is causing divisions among its adversaries.

Conflict management is not the most ideal scenario for U.S. policymakers, but it may be the only prudent choice we have left.",Commentary: The least bad way for Trump to deal with North Korea,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-depetris-northkorea-commentary/commentary-the-least-bad-way-for-trump-to-deal-with-north-korea-idUSKCN1BO2LK

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil producers may need to take “some extraordinary measures” next year to rebalance the oil market, the OPEC secretary-general said on Sunday.

“There is a growing consensus that ... a rebalancing process is under way. We are gradually but steadily achieving our common and noble objectives,” Mohammad Barkindo told reporters at the India Energy Forum organized by CERAWeek in New Delhi.

“To sustain this into next year, some extraordinary measures may have to be taken in order to restore this stability on a sustainable basis going forward,” he said, without elaborating.

Saudi Arabia and Russia helped secure a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 rival producers to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March 2018 in an effort to reduce a glut.

Barkindo said consultations were under way for the extension of the OPEC-led pact beyond March 2018 and that more oil producing nations may join the supply pact, possibly at the next meeting of OPEC in Vienna on Nov. 30.

He also said that Nigeria and Libya, who are exempted from the pact, “are making progress towards full recovery” of production, after which they could join the OPEC-led agreement.

Oil futures fell more than 2 percent on Friday, ending Brent crude’s longest multi-week rally in 16 months as oversupply concerns reappeared as producers have started hedging future drilling. [O/R]

But Barkindo said he was not worried about the rise in U.S. shale oil and gas output.

“It is a big market and demand is very strong. Between the first half and second half this year, demand growth is almost about 2 million barrels (per day), which is very robust,” he said. “So everybody has a role to play.”

On Friday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he hoped to reach a consensus with Russia and other major oil producers on the future of the deal before November’s meeting.

Falih was speaking in Moscow two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was possible that the supply reduction deal could run to the end of next year, although Russia has not made any commitment.",Extraordinary steps may be needed in 2018 to rebalance oil market: OPEC's Barkindo,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CD0HN-OCABS

UK-listed theme park operator Merlin Entertainments may be planning something similar with SeaWorld, by trying to dislodge its Busch Gardens division. Breaking up the operator famed for its orcas might create some value, but it still looks a slippery target.

Both companies were previously owned by Blackstone and listed in 2013. The private-equity firm run by Steve Schwarzman sold its last stake in Merlin in 2015 and offloaded its SeaWorld holding to Chinese group Zhonghong Zhuoye in March. Neither company has escaped controversy since going public, with Merlin marred by a rollercoaster crash at its Alton Towers theme park, and SeaWorld’s valuation yet to recover from the “Blackfish” documentary showing poor treatment of killer whales.

A bid makes sense for Merlin. It wants to diversify away from its UK home market, which still generates 30 percent of its profit. The company’s finance chief already identified SeaWorld’s two Busch Gardens parks as potential acquisitions. An all-cash deal might push its debt to a toppy four times EBITDA, Stifel analysts reckon, perhaps requiring some equity too. But investors like the idea: Merlin’s share price rose over 3 percent on news of an approach.

There might even be some financial benefits for SeaWorld. Say the parks could be offloaded at a conservative 11 times EBITDA multiple, a slight premium to the group’s current valuation. A sale could fetch $1.6 billion based on estimated EBITDA of $145 million for the parks this year, adding around 10 percent to its market capitalisation.

Yet SeaWorld shareholders seem glum, sending its shares down 2 percent. That may be because they were hoping for a full takeout. Merlin after all has sea-life parks too. But its policy of not keeping large mammals such as killer whales or dolphins in captivity rules that out. And what remains is likely to be subscale, and need investment. Its largest Chinese shareholder, who bought in when the stock was around a fifth higher, may not be ready to sell. Without a clear plan for the rest of the business, Merlin’s next meal is likely to remain elusive.",Breakingviews - SeaWorld a slimy meal for ex-Blackstone predator,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-seaworld-entrnmt-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-seaworld-a-slimy-meal-for-ex-blackstone-predator-idUSKBN1CA2FA

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When reporters descended on upstate New York to ask about a stunning prison break in 2015, state police spokesman Major Charles Guess took their questions.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

Sometimes the name fits the news story. Correspondent Julie Weed writes about legal marijuana for Forbes. This month, a front-page New York Times story on obesity was edited by Hilary Stout.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

Sometimes the odd connections can be horrifying. When a gunman at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine people, including a woman in a wheelchair, her service dog named Bullet survived.

But strange synergies also can signal hope. Josh Outman now pitches for Mexico’s Triple-A Minor League Pericos de Puebla but was once with the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics and other U.S. Major League Baseball teams. Perhaps a streak of no-hitters by Outman could get him back to the big leagues.","Having the right name at the right, or sometimes wrong, time",https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKCN1C425Q

BRUXELLES, 5 ottobre (Reuters) - Uno schema di garanzia europeo per i depositi bancari dovrebbe essere introdotto nella Ue più gradualmente di quanto programmato nel tentativo di ottenere il sostegno della Germania.

In una bozza, vista da Reuters, del documento che la Commissione europea presenterà la prossima settimana, si legge che lo schema di garanzia, conosciuto come Edis, potrebbe inizialmente dare sostegno solo per i depositi di banche fallite.

Il piano della Commissione, teso ad aumentare la stabilità finanziaria della zona euro, prevede che in un secondo tempo lo schema possa coprire le perdite.

Questa fase partirebbe solo dopo una sufficiente riduzione delle sofferenze da parte delle banche.

La Germania si sta opponendo da tempo a questo piano, temendo gli eccessivi costi per le banche tedesche.

Berlino si è sinora detta d‘accordo solo a uno schema sui depositi che li garantisca sino a 100.000 euro in tutta la zona euro, a condizione di una preliminare riduzione dei rischi di fallimento bancari.

Per questo è necessaria in alcuni paesi una significativa riduzione delle sofferenze del settore bancario, attualmente elevate. La Commissione ha dichiarato che la prossima primavera presenterà proposte per rendere più facile il recupero dei debiti.

La Commissione proporrà anche lo sviluppo del mercato secondario degli Npl, facilitandone la vendita.

Bruxelles sta anche considerando “livelli minimi di accantonamento che le banche dovranno fare per gli Npl”, misura che ridurrebbe i rischi da Npl ma aumenterebbe gli oneri delle banche.

Nel documento di 17 pagine la Commissione propone poi che la Bce, attualmente supervisore di 130 banche della zona euro, estenda i suoi poteri di vigilanza alle maggiori banche d‘affari e ai più grandi fondi.

Per ridurre i rischi legati ai fallimenti bancari la migliore opzione, per Bruxelles, continua a essere rappresentata dal Meccanismo europeo di stabilità (Esm) come paracadute per il Fondo di risoluzione unica che finanzia le risoluzioni bancarie.

La Commissione sta considerando di introdurre nel 2018 il quadro legale per abs con al loro interno titoli di Stato, proposta tesa a ridurre i rischi legati all‘eccessiva esposizione bancaria al debito sovrano stesso.

Pressed about what he meant by Thursday’s comment, the U.S. leader declined to elaborate, telling reporters only that, “You’ll find out.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders also declined to say what Trump meant.

When asked whether Trump was just being mischievous, Sanders denied he was just “messing with the press.”

“I think we have some serious world issues here. I think that North Korea, Iran both continue to be bad actors and the president is somebody who’s going to always look for ways to protect Americans,” Sanders said.

Leon Panetta, a former Defense secretary and CIA director, said Trump’s remarks would be something “you’d really worry about” under a previous U.S. president. But he said Trump’s comments appeared to follow a pattern he’d established on Twitter.

“You begin to assume that it’s more about getting attention than it is about proclaiming some kind of national policy. I don’t think it’s responsible...but I think in this instance we probably all should take a deep breath and try to assume he’s just making a play for attention,” Panetta told CNN.

“Moving forward, I also expect you to provide me with a broad range of military options, when needed, at a much faster pace. I know that government bureaucracy is slow, but I am depending on you to overcome the obstacles of bureaucracy,” he said.

Asked if Trump felt like military leaders were deliberately being slow to advise him, Sanders said, “Not at all.”

“As you know, he’s a person who like to take action and take it quickly,” she said. “He wants options on the table so that he can make quick decision.”",Trump declines to explain 'calm before the storm' remark,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-military/trump-declines-to-explain-calm-before-the-storm-remark-idUSKBN1CB2G9

(Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi as the fourth hurricane to hit the United States this year, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages.

As the storm moved northeast into Alabama, Nate’s maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour), prompting the National Hurricane Center to end its tropical storm warnings for the region. The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.

“We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters, saying there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage.

The fourth major storm to strike the United States in less than two months, Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.

Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.

The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the National Hurricane Center said. Heavy rainfall and storm surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.

Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.

Flood waters swept over streets in communities across Alabama and Mississippi, including over Highway 90 and to oceanside casinos in Biloxi, according to reports on social media.

Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.

“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”

Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.

“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

On Saturday, states of emergency were declared in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as in more than two dozen Florida counties. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned of tornadoes springing up in the Pandhandle region.

In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey urged residents in areas facing heavy winds and storm surges to take precautions. U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.

About 47,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, while more than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.

Utility Alabama Power said some 82,000 customers were without electricity.

Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches, were expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the NHC said.

NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu lifted a curfew on Saturday evening that was originally scheduled to last until Sunday morning. He said in a statement on social media however, that there was still a serious threat of storm surge outside levee areas.

Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Plaquemines Parish President Amos Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.

The ports of New Orleans in Louisiana and Mobile in Alabama remained closed, and refineries and port authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were reviewing when they could reopen.

The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.

Workers were evacuated from 301 platforms and 13 rigs as of Saturday, said the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.","Hurricane Nate weakens as it soaks Mississippi, Alabama",https://www.reuters.com/article/storm-nate/hurricane-nate-weakens-as-it-soaks-mississippi-alabama-idINKBN1CC06E

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The powerful U.S. gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, said on Sunday it would oppose an outright ban on bump-stock devices that the killer in the Las Vegas massacre of 58 people used to turn rifles into automatic weapons and strafe a crowd with bursts of sustained gunfire.

On Sunday, the organization said it was open to regulation but opposed any legislation banning the devices.

“We don’t believe that bans have ever worked on anything. What we have said has been very clear - that if something transfers a semiautomatic to function like a fully automatic, then it ought to be regulated differently,” Chris Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Police said the gunman, Stephen Paddock, 64, fitted 12 of his weapons with bump-stock devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns, which are otherwise outlawed in the United States.

Cox and Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s chief executive, accused the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives under Democratic former President Barack Obama of paving the way for the use of bump stocks and creating legal confusion about their usage.

Republican President Donald Trump was an outspoken advocate of gun rights during his 2016 campaign for the White House. The NRA spent more than $30 million in support of his candidacy.

NO REPUBLICAN SUPPORT

LaPierre lashed out at U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who has pushed for gun-control legislation on Capitol Hill.

“I think you want to tell ATF to do its job. It’s an interpretive issue and they need to get the job done. But not let Dianne Feinstein, which is what she wants to do - turn this all of this into some Christmas tree on the Hill where she brings all of her anti-gun circus she has been trying to do for years into this,” LaPierre said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Feinstein said she has garnered some Republican interest, but no support, for the measure. “I have nobody lined up,” she told the CBS program.

Some gun-control advocates praised the NRA for showing some flexibility.

“This is the first time that the gun lobby has shown willingness to come to the table and I think that’s in part because Americans just simply do not accept mass shooting after mass shooting happening and Congress doing absolutely nothing,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

But Sunday’s comments from the NRA representatives suggested nothing may have changed as they castigated calls for gun-control measures in the emotional aftermath of a mass shooting.

“There used to be a common decency in this country where people paused talking about policy. Unfortunately with Dianne Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, they want to exploit a tragedy from Day One. It’s shameful, but apparently that’s the new normal.” Cox said on the “Fox News Sunday” program.

Bloomberg, a billionaire and former mayor of New York, has been an outspoken critic of the National Rifle Association through the group Everytown for Gun Safety.

MANILA (Reuters) - Trust and satisfaction in Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on Sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall.

Net satisfaction, used by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) as a rating of the president’s performance, was down 18 points from the second quarter to 48, classified as “good” in the survey of 1,200 Filipinos conducted in the last week of September.

Duterte’s net trust rating, which gauges public sentiment about his personality, was “very good” at 60 points, down from “excellent” 75 he achieved in the previous poll.

The survey was conducted just a few days after thousands of Filipinos rallied to denounce Duterte, his anti-drug crackdown and what they called an emerging dictatorship.

Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in the crackdown and other SWS polls conducted in September indicated doubts about the validity of official accounts of the 3,800 cases where police killed drug suspects.

The SWS survey did not ask respondents to give a reason for the rating of Duterte, who took office in June 2016. Duterte’s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results.

Political analyst Ramon Casiple, head of the country’s Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said it was normal for a president’s rating to fall during his time in office, but concern over the high death toll in his signature war on drugs will have weighed on sentiment.

Activists accuse Duterte of inciting police to kill drug dealers and users, which he denies. Police reject allegations they are executing suspects and say deaths occurred because victims had violently resisted arrest.

Casiple said that though the poll still showed Duterte had the support of Filipinos, he should take it seriously.

“This is a real diminution of his popularity and it serves as a wakeup call for him to stop it further going down,” Casiple said of the poll.

“However, this is still a comfortable figure and far from the threshold of unpopularity.”

Based on SWS methodology for net trust ratings, a score of 70 and above is considered excellent, 50 to 69 is very good, 30-49 good and 10-29 moderate.

While his political opponents chide him for his authoritarian style and intolerance of dissent, Duterte enjoys a cult-like following and support from millions of Filipinos, who see him as the best hope for change in a country with rampant crime and a yawning gap between rich and poor.","Philippine president sees biggest ratings dip, but popularity intact",https://www.reuters.com/article/philippines-politics-duterte/philippine-president-sees-biggest-ratings-dip-but-popularity-intact-idINKBN1CD0NL?il=0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has not decided whether it will replace the Clean Power Plan - the centerpiece Obama-era climate change regulation - after it moves to repeal it, according to a draft of the proposal seen by Reuters on Friday.

The effort to undo the rule aimed at cutting emissions from power plants forms part of a broader plan by the administration of President Donald Trump to revive the U.S. coal industry and boost domestic fossil fuels production.

In the 43-page document, the EPA said the Clean Power Plan (CPP) introduced by former President Barack Obama in 2015 was illegal. It aimed to cut emissions from utilities, the largest emitters of greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for climate change, by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

“Under the interpretation proposed in this notice, the CPP exceeds the EPA’s statutory authority and would be repealed,” the proposal says.

The EPA said it has not yet determined whether or when it will propose a new rule to regulate emissions from existing power plants. But the agency said it will soon to release what it calls an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit information on a potential replacement nonetheless.

“We can’t comment on the authenticity of the document, but what we can say is that the Obama Administration pushed the bounds of their authority so far that the Supreme Court issued a stay – the first in history – to prevent the so-called ‘Clean Power Plan’ from taking effect,” said EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman.

The CPP had been challenged in court by 27 states after Obama’s administration launched it in 2015. It was suspended by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which set a deadline of Friday for a status report from the EPA on how it plans to proceed.

Reuters had reported earlier this week that the EPA planned to repeal the CPP and seek input for a possible replacement, the first formal step by the agency since Trump ordered it in March to review the regulation.

Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator under Obama who spearheaded the design of the CPP, said the repeal would represent a retreat from the “legal, scientific and moral obligation to address the threats of climate change.”

In another move by the administration aimed at supporting coal, Energy Secretary Rick Perry last week asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to propose a plan to compensate coal and nuclear plants for their reliability to the grid.

In justifying the proposed repeal, the EPA said it found fault in the Obama administration’s use of section 111 of the federal Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions from power plants. It argues that the section can only be used to regulate a single source of emissions, but that the Clean Power Plan instead “encompassed measures that would generally require power generators to change their energy portfolios.”

Industry groups welcomed news of an imminent repeal of the regulation.

“The Clean Power Plan represented an unlawful attempt to transform the nation’s power grid,” said Hal Quinn, director of the National Mining Association lobby group.

David Doniger, climate program director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the repeal would “leave millions of Americans in grave danger from extreme weather and other climate impacts.”",EPA may not replace Obama-era climate rule on repeal: draft,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-usa-epa/u-s-epa-may-not-replace-obama-era-climate-regulation-after-repeal-draft-idUSKBN1CB25B

Market participants were also buoyed by expectations from the GST council meeting on Friday. The mid- and small-cap indexes outperformed the benchmark indexes, gaining between 2.5-3 percent.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) policy announcement was on expected lines and did not have much impact on the markets. Automobile sales numbers also boosted sentiment as most companies posted good numbers ahead of the festival season.

The GST council meeting announced relief measures for exporters and SMEs as it reduced rates on 27 items and 12 services, and reduced the compliance burden. It hiked the threshold limit for the composition scheme to 10 million rupees. It also allowed other taxpayers with a turnover of up to 15 million rupees to file quarterly returns. The increase in threshold would bring in many more small businesses within its ambit and decrease the compliance burden.

A slew of measures were announced for exporters facing working capital issues such as quicker refunds and an e-wallet facility. Also bringing relief for the gems & jewellery industry, PAN or Aadhaar would not be mandatory if the value of the jewellery bought is above 50,000 rupees.

Overall, the meeting brought some relief especially for marginal GST assessees and a larger relief for exporters. Market expectations seemed higher looking at a near 100-point boost on the Nifty.

Automobile sales numbers were healthy in September, helped by a good monsoon and increased production of BS-IV compliant vehicles and a pick-up in exports. Lower GST impact combined with fears of increased cess also led to buying in early September. The early festival season also aided growth numbers. The increase in cess for mid-sized to luxury cars will possibly affect sales in October.

In response to the hue and cry over rising retail fuel prices, the government cut excise duty of 2 rupee per litre and requested state governments to follow suit by reducing VAT.

The RBI monetary policy review offered no surprise for the markets as almost all participants were expecting the status quo. It kept the repo rate unchanged at 6 percent and cut its GDP forecast, revising it down to 6.7 percent this year as against the 7.3 percent projected in August.

At the time when mutual fund assets under management are close to 20 trillion rupees and growing at a healthy pace month-on-month, market regulator SEBI has come out with rules to streamline schemes. It asked mutual funds to categorise schemes within five baskets - equity, debt, hybrid, solution-oriented and others - a move that will weed out the practice of multiple funds being launched on similar themes. SEBI has also defined market cap criteria for large-, mid- and small-caps.

Meanwhile, the SEBI-appointed Kotak panel has proposed more powers for independent directors, limiting chairmanship to non-executive directors, and a greater focus on transparency and disclosures to improve corporate governance. The recommendation covers areas such as composition of the board, the make-up of board committees, treatment of subsidiaries, information sharing with promoters and related-party transactions, audit evaluations, and conduct of annual general meetings.

On the macro front, the Nikkei India Services PMI index rose to 50.7 in September from 47.5 in August, signalling a return to growth of output. Manufacturing PMI remained unchanged at 51.2. Annual infrastructure output grew 4.9 percent in August compared with a revised 2.6 percent growth in July.

In the coming week, markets on Monday are initially expected to react to announcements by the government after the GST council meeting on Friday. The second-quarter earnings season kickstarts with some prominent names such as TCS, Kotak Bank, IndusInd Bank set to unveil their results.

However, markets will also be wary as North Korea prepares for a possible missile launch on Tuesday, the anniversary of the founding of the ruling Korean Workers Party.

On the macro front, the government will announce IIP figures for August on Thursday. CPI inflation data for September is also due the same day. On the global front, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will issue the minutes of its last meeting on Wednesday.

Whenever a country passes through a slowdown with low capex resulting in abysmal credit growth, the economy cannot grow. Excessive consumer spending coupled with low employment growth and utilization of easy credit is another cause of worry in India. To shore up resources to some extent, the government has directed PSUs to step up capex, increase dividends and may possibly push them to increase recruitment. Higher dividends may be beneficial to investors in the short run, but this should also make them wary of the PSU sector.

The detention in July of the activists, who also include a German and Swedish national, deepened tensions between Ankara and European Union leaders who fear that Turkey is sliding towards greater authoritarianism under President Tayyip Erdogan.

They were held after attending a workshop on digital security on an island off Istanbul. Eight of them have been held since then, accused of being members of and aiding an “armed terrorist organization”.

Shortly after they were detained Germany said it was reviewing applications for arms projects from Turkey. A minister in Berlin compared Ankara’s behaviour over the detention of the activists to the authoritarian former communist East Germany.

More than 50,000 people have been detained since the failed coup and 150,000 people, including teachers, academics and lawyers, have been suspended from their jobs.

(Reuters) - World number one Rafael Nadal produced a ruthless performance to thrash Australian Nick Kyrgios 6-2 6-1 in the China Open final on Sunday for his 75th career singles title.

The 31-year-old was given a tough fight early on but Kyrgios’s challenge faded after he lost his temper and was docked a penalty point at 2-5 in the first set.

Nadal’s previous title at the tournament came 12 years ago.

“I had very tough draw here,” Nadal, who saved match points in his opening round against Frenchman Lucas Pouille, said.

“I was lucky the first day saving the two match points but after that I think I played one of my best events of the year.”

World number 19 Kyrgios matched Nadal early on, winning his opening two service games but became involved in a debate with umpire Mohamed Lahyani over a close line call against him.

“I can’t play at 100 percent if that stuff happens -- and then you expect me not to be angry,” Kyrgios told Lahyani.

He continued to argue the toss with the official who eventually awarded a penalty point against the Australian during the changeover when he trailed 2-5, meaning he began the eighth game already 0-15 behind.

Nadal was well in control by then and he raced into a 5-0 lead in the second set before Kyrgios slightly delayed the inevitable as the Spaniard sauntered to his 12th consecutive win.

“He played well. I played terrible. He’s in great form. He just destroyed me today, so it was too good,” Kyrgios, who struck 20 winners but 35 unforced errors, said.

“I put in a pretty good week, had some good wins. It’s tough to find positives when you won three games in the final. But I guess there were positives. In the semi-final I played well, obviously beating Alex (Zverev).”

Kyrgios still has a chance of qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals as he is 15th in the Race standings with several tournaments remaining to close the gap on those in front.

LONDON (Reuters) - For years the options market that companies and investors use to hedge against big swings in currencies viewed the euro as a bigger political and structural risk than Britain’s pound.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

(Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi as the fourth hurricane to hit the United States this year, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages.

As the storm moved northeast into Alabama, Nate’s maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour), prompting the National Hurricane Center to end its tropical storm warnings for the region. The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.

“We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters, saying there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage.

The fourth major storm to strike the United States in less than two months, Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.

Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.

The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the National Hurricane Center said. Heavy rainfall and storm surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.

Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.

Flood waters swept over streets in communities across Alabama and Mississippi, including over Highway 90 and to oceanside casinos in Biloxi, according to reports on social media.

Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.

“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”

Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.

“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

On Saturday, states of emergency were declared in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as in more than two dozen Florida counties. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned of tornadoes springing up in the Pandhandle region.

In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey urged residents in areas facing heavy winds and storm surges to take precautions. U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.

About 47,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, while more than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.

Utility Alabama Power said some 82,000 customers were without electricity.

Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches, were expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the NHC said.

NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu lifted a curfew on Saturday evening that was originally scheduled to last until Sunday morning. He said in a statement on social media however, that there was still a serious threat of storm surge outside levee areas.

Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Plaquemines Parish President Amos Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.

The ports of New Orleans in Louisiana and Mobile in Alabama remained closed, and refineries and port authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were reviewing when they could reopen.

The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.

Workers were evacuated from 301 platforms and 13 rigs as of Saturday, said the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.","Hurricane Nate weakens as it soaks Mississippi, Alabama",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-storm-nate/hurricane-nate-weakens-as-it-soaks-mississippi-alabama-idUKKBN1CD059?il=0

La convocatoria para trabajar unos días llegó en septiembre pero mientras, y percibiendo sólo 50.000 bolívares semanales (unos 2 dólares según el cambio del mercado paralelo), hizo mudanzas con su desgastada camioneta del 2011 en la ciudad industrial de Valencia e intentó revender materiales de construcción para llegar a fin de mes.

Como él, miles de empleados de transnacionales como Fiat Chrysler (FCA) o Nestlé en Venezuela esperan meses y hasta años la reactivación de decenas de fábricas que parecen muertos vivientes: detenidas o trabajando al mínimo por falta de materia prima, en medio de la profunda escasez y recesión económica que sufre el país petrolero.

Así, unas 150 multinacionales que permanecen en el país han minimizado su presencia ante el deterioro económico de Venezuela.

Para seguir a flote, han reducido sus proyectos o se centran en presentaciones más baratas y fáciles de fabricar, operando en modo supervivencia, según dijeron a Reuters sindicatos, gremios y los portavoces de las compañías.

Y es que para muchas empresas salir del país tampoco parece una opción viable. Huir de Venezuela implicaría tener que rematar los bienes o dejarlos abandonados, como hicieron grandes firmas como Clorox o Kimberly-Clark, algo especialmente doloroso para marcas que durante décadas construyeron su presencia en el mercado.

Por eso es normal ver escenas como las de la planta de FCA en Valencia, a dos horas de Caracas, donde hay camionetas a medio montar acumulando polvo a la espera de alguna pieza que falta, como parabrisas o retrovisores, según una veintena de empleados parados en la puerta de la ensambladora.

De armar 10.286 unidades en el 2010, la planta pasó a producir cero el año pasado. En lo que va del año sacó unos 150 coches a la calle, mientras el 60 por ciento de su plantilla se queda en casa, según trabajadores y líderes sindicales.

“Lo que nos plantean los directivos es que la intención de la empresa no es irse. Es más difícil reiniciar un negocio nuevamente desde cero que mantenerse y aguantar todo este vendaval de situaciones”, reflexionó Henry Ospina, del sindicato de FCA. “Pero la inquietud está”.

A COMER A LA FÁBRICA

Aunque se sienten “pseudoempleados”, los trabajadores de las multinacionales al menos se las ven mejor que los venezolanos que, sin empleo, luchan por conseguir algo de los escasos alimentos y medicinas que importa el país.

Según los últimos datos oficiales disponibles, hasta abril del 2016 la mitad de la población activa estaba desempleada, o trabajaba de manera informal en oficios como el de taxista u otros empleos por cuenta propia.

Los empleados que se mantienen en sus puestos cobran cerca del 20 por ciento de lo que ganaban y no tienen bonos ni horas extras. Algunos van a los comedores de las plantas detenidas para tomar almuerzos pagados por las firmas, que intentan mantenerse en pie a la espera de tiempos mejores.

La cafetería de FCA, por ejemplo, abre para brindar almuerzos diarios a 60 de sus 800 trabajadores más necesitados, en un país dónde siete de cada diez personas dijeron haber perdido al menos 8 kilos de peso en un año, según el más reciente sondeo hecho por universidades privadas en 2016.

“Este año he trabajado 6 días”, confesó Pedro Rodríguez, de 44 años, otro empleado con más de dos décadas en FCA. “Pero he venido más veces para ir al comedor, porque es un plato de comida que me estoy ahorrando en la casa”.

“Hay compañeros que dejan de comer la mitad de la comida de aquí y se la llevan a su casa”, dijo, vestido con su uniforme con las siglas de la planta.

La industria venezolana está atravesando su peor momento en décadas. Miles de empresas han reducido su producción y al menos dos de cada 10 están paradas por falta de materiales o pedidos, según una encuesta de Conindustria, el principal gremio de fabricantes del país petrolero.

Y las que siguen en pie, operan a un tercio de su capacidad.

Como parte del esquema de supervivencia, las empresas también optan por reducir turnos, nóminas y los días que trabajan, buscando estirar su poca materia prima.

“Este año no he producido, pero me han pagado el sueldo”, dijo Núñez, en su humilde casa, usando su camisa azul con el logo de Ford, ya que ese día de agosto fue citado en la fábrica para conocer un plan para reactivar la producción de 50 camiones de un nuevo modelo.

Finalmente en septiembre se concretó su regreso a la planta, para producir algunas unidades, pero solo trabajó siete días.

“Nos dijeron: si el vehículo es aceptado en el mercado se viene la producción y si no...”, explicó encogiéndose de hombros. “Ford me ha dado mucha estabilidad para ayudar a mi familia. Pero uno sabe que no es culpa de ellos, sino por la situación del país”, agregó el padre de dos hijos adolescentes.

Poco menos de una decena de firmas globales, como General Mills o la autopartista Dana, vendieron en el último año sus filiales venezolanas, mayormente a empresarios locales que, si bien no quedaron exentos de las dificultades, compraron activos baratos.

Pero el Gobierno socialista de Nicolás Maduro sostiene que las firmas globales limitan de manera intencional su producción en medio de una “guerra económica” que libran sus adversarios.

Reuters solicitó comentarios al ministerio de Comunicación pero no obtuvo respuesta.

INDEMNIZANDO CON NEUMÁTICOS

Ford contó a Reuters que su planta de Valencia apenas había producido unos 400 coches hasta agosto -cuando en el 2012 ensamblaron 17.000- con una fuerza de trabajo limitada y cientos de obreros en casa. Aún así, Ford “no tiene planes de dejar el país”, aclaró la empresa en un correo electrónico.

Buscando oxígeno, la automotriz estadounidense empezó en el 2015 a vender coches en dólares, una práctica permitida en el sector, que les servirían para comprar sin pasar por el control de cambios.

Otras firmas, como Fiat Chrysler (FCA) y Toyota, le siguieron, pero todas con resultados limitados: los venezolanos con acceso a miles de dólares al contado son pocos.

En los concesionarios, lujosas todoterreno se quedan esperando compradores. La destrucción de la economía de escala y los cuellos de botella en la importación de piezas elevan los precios hasta 20.000 dólares más que en otros países, haciendo de ese mercado uno aún más exclusivo.

La sobreoferta en las tiendas de autos, contrasta con los anaqueles vacíos de los supermercados.

Las firmas de alimentos también tienen que parar varias veces al año sus líneas de producción en espera de materia prima. La gigante de alimentos Nestlé a finales de septiembre detuvo su producción de colados de fruta para bebés porque no tenía envases de vidrios, dijo la empresa.

La compañía agregó en un comunicado que a pesar de la suspensión seguirá pagando a sus trabajadores, aunque un representante del sindicato dijo a Reuters que el salario diario no era ni siquiera el equivalente a una botella de refresco.

El Gobierno de Maduro recortó el año pasado a la mitad las importaciones, reaccionando al fin de una mermante bonanza petrolera que según sus críticos, no supo administrar.

El mandatario alega que es víctima de un sabotaje de opositores y empresarios, en medio de una inflación anual que desde hace dos años se mantiene en tres dígitos y una parálisis económica, que devoran los salarios rápidamente.

El consumo, boyante hasta hace un lustro entre los venezolanos que gozaron de compras de vehículos, viajes y bienes de lujo financiados con divisas baratas, cayó un 15 por ciento en el 2016 y se espera que se contraiga otro 25 por ciento este año, según cifras de la firma local Ecoanalítica.

Imposibilitadas para reducir de forma sustancial su nómina, por la ley local que prohíbe los despidos, las empresas han empezado a ofrecer arreglos cada vez más descabellados a cambio de recibir renuncias voluntarias.

En FCA, por ejemplo, la oferta de liquidación viene acompañada de cuatro neumáticos. Consultada sobre su precaria situación, FCA dijo en un correo electrónico que hace “sus mejores esfuerzos para mantener la producción en niveles adecuados a la disponibilidad de insumos”, sin aportar detalles.

Pero hasta agosto, 23 trabajadores, muchos de ellos con el plan de emigrar, habían aceptado las ruedas para revenderlas en un país con una fuerte escasez de estos productos.

“NO ESTAMOS GANANDO, NI PERDIENDO”

La planta de jabones de Colgate-Palmolive, está detenida desde febrero porque, según los trabajadores, la firma no cubre sus costes al producir barras de jabón a menos de 0,05 centavos de dólar, como le exige el Estado.

Desde hace años, el Gobierno fija los precios de productos como la leche y el jabón, que pierden vigencia rápido por la galopante inflación. También fija el tipo de cambio al que vende el dólar en un control de cambio cada vez menos funcional.

Hace poco, Colgate reinició su producción de pasta dental a precio regulado, empaquetada en cajas de cartón reciclado marrón para ahorrar costos. También descartó versiones infantiles o con blanqueador, reduciendo su portafolio de 300 productos a menos de una docena, dijo su representante sindical, Félix Bello.

La compañía estadounidense no respondió cuando Reuters le solicitó información.

Mientras tanto, empaques rojos similares a los de Colgate importados de China, con nombres como “Coigore” o “Connert”, se ofrecen en tiendas a precios 10 veces por encima del regulado.

Otra gigante del cuidado personal, Johnson & Johnson, solo produce protectores diarios femeninos en el país. Años atrás, fabricaba o importaba desde enjuague bucal y jabón hasta champú para bebés y cremas hidratantes.

Aún así, la multinacional acordó mantener el salario y los tres turnos de sus 157 empleados, aunque sólo operen tres de las siete líneas de producción de la factoría, dijo Jaime Guevara, un representante de su sindicato.

“Johnson & Johnson tiene una responsabilidad con nuestros empleados y la comunidad”, agregó una portavoz de la empresa.

Pero aunque haya firmas que siguen apostando a “esperar y ver”, no hay señales claras de que el gobierno de Maduro pueda mejorar las condiciones porque depende de una empresa petrolera en deterioro. En este contexto ha tenido que vender menos divisas, vitales para el flujo productivo de las empresas.

“Pensamos que en algún momento el país debería volver a la normalidad y ya entonces nosotros tendremos una planta armada”, dijo el gerente general de una firma estadounidense de productos químicos, que incluía limpiadores e insecticidas, y que pidió no ser identificado.

La empresa redujo drásticamente su gama de productos y sólo fabrica con materias primas locales, mientras sus trabajadores hacen labores de mantenimientos en la fábrica, como pintar las paredes o cortar la grama.

“No estamos ganando pero tampoco estamos perdiendo. Ni estamos pensando más en eso”, concluyó.

LA SOMBRA DE GENERAL MOTORS

Pero los gerentes, dirigentes de gremios y sindicatos consultados coinciden en que estas estrategias para comprar tiempo podrían no ser sostenibles por más de dos años.

Y muchos usan la reciente salida de General Motors del país como su fábula con moraleja.

Si bien GM dejó de ensamblar vehículos en el 2015, apenas este año se retiró del todo. La fábrica está abandonada en la zona industrial de Valencia que tiene un 80 por ciento de sus plantas paradas, según el mayor gremio empresarial.

En una visita reciente de Reuters, un grupo de exobreros hacía una sopa en la entrada usando leña. Otros entrenaban a sus hijos en un campo de béisbol. La grama crecía indómita hasta las pantorrillas y el gimnasio albergaba nidos de palomas.

Hace pocas semanas la fabricante estadounidense de pinturas Axalta Coating Systems también cesó su producción en Venezuela por la “situación económica y política” del país, y despidió a sus sorprendidos empleados.

Otras firmas podrían tomar decisiones fundamentales pronto. FCA dijo en su más reciente informe de resultados financieros que, ante la “pérdida de control” que experimentan en su unidad de Venezuela, estarían considerando desconsolidarla de sus resultados globales.

Y para muchas marcas internacionales la desconsolidación ha sido el primer paso antes de partir, o en su defecto, vender.

“Ninguno está exento de lo que está sucediendo”, dijo Carlos Rodríguez, miembro del sindicato de Colgate-Palmolive. “Cuando veas las barbas de tu vecino arder, pon las tuyas en remojo”.",En modo zombi: las multinacionales que trabajan a medias en Venezuela,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idESKBN1CD0O4-OESEN

EDMONTON, Alberta (Reuters) - The Somali immigrant charged with attempted murder in connection with a weekend vehicle and knife attack in Edmonton, Alberta, was detained in the United States pending deportation before claiming refugee status in Canada, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.

Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, is accused of running down a police officer with his car on Saturday night and then stabbing him repeatedly. Police said he fled before driving a U-Haul truck into four pedestrians during an attempt to evade capture.

Sharif was in custody in the United States for about four months in the summer and autumn of 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman Lauren Mack said in a statement.

He was ordered deported to Somalia but released on an “order of supervision” on Nov. 23, 2011. Sharif did not appear for a scheduled meeting in January 2012, and efforts to locate him “were not successful,” the statement said.

Sharif “had no known criminal history at the time of his encounters with ICE,” the ICE statement added.

Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Sharif made a refugee claim at a Canadian border crossing in 2012 and obtained refugee status later that year.

In 2015, a complaint led police to probe Sharif’s alleged extremist ideology, but officers found no grounds for criminal charges after what the Royal Canadian Mounted Police described as an “exhaustive investigation.”

Goodale said on Monday it would be wrong to blame the attack on any shortcomings in Canada’s immigration and refugee vetting system.

Sharif, who faces 11 charges including five counts of attempted murder, appeared via video in an Edmonton court on Tuesday wearing an orange jail uniform. He had a Somali interpreter, although he did not speak.

He occasionally looked down or clasped his hands in front of him and still bore facial bruises that police say he sustained while evading capture.

A community leader, Mahamad Accord, who did not speak to Sharif but learned about him from the local Somali community, said Sharif was from a Somali ethnic minority and little known in the community.

Edmonton police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sharif’s lawyer, Chady Moustarah, said he had stepped in on short notice to help someone without representation but that the accused would have to find another lawyer going forward. Sharif remains in custody until his next court appearance, scheduled for Nov. 14.",Somali man charged in Canada attack was ordered deported from U.S.,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1C82CE-OCADN

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do “whatever it takes” to defend world oil prices, it didn’t expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

“We are united in our grief, in our support for those who have suffered and united in our resolve to end such evil in our time,” Pence said, joining Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and other local leaders at a City Hall commemoration for victims of the shooting.

Participants trod seven miles (11 km) along four separate paths to the event amid tight security. President Donald Trump paid a visit to Las Vegas earlier in the week.

Las Vegas’ Democratic Congresswoman Dina Titus was the only speaker who touched on the subject of gun violence and politics, saying, “Let us also pray for those who have power that they will have the wisdom, the courage, and the resolve to find ways to end the gun violence that plagues our nation.”

The commemoration came as Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said investigators remain largely in the dark about what drove retired real estate investor and high-stakes gambler Stephen Paddock to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

“We have looked at everything, literally, to include the suspect’s personal life, any political affiliation, his social behaviors, economic situation, any potential radicalization,” McMahill told reporters late on Friday.

“We have been down each and every single one of these paths, trying to determine why, to determine who else may have known of these plans.”

McMahill said investigators had uncovered “no nexus” between Islamic State and Paddock, even though the militant group had repeatedly claimed responsibility for the attack.

A piece of paper found in Paddock’s room at the Mandalay Bay hotel appeared to calculate the distance and height from his window to help target victims below, the CBS News show “60 Minutes” said in a news release on Saturday ahead of a broadcast on Sunday of interviews with Clark County Sheriff’s officers, including one who said he saw the paper.

The Sheriff’s Office could not be immediately reached for comment.

Investigators have stressed that no suicide note had been found.

FBI APPEALS TO PUBLIC

In an unusual bid to cast a wider net for tips, the FBI and police have arranged with communications company Clear Channel to post billboards around Las Vegas urging citizens to come forward with any information that might help investigators.

Doves are released for each victim of the Route 91 Harvest music festival mass shooting at City Hall plaza in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., October 7, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Wattie

The billboards will bear the slogan, “If you know something, say something,” and carry a toll-free number to an FBI hotline, said Aaron Rouse, special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office.

Paddock, 64, unleashed a torrent of gunfire onto an outdoor music festival from the windows of his 32nd-floor hotel suite overlooking the concert on Sunday night, then shot himself to death before police stormed his room.

In addition to the 58 people who died, nearly 500 were injured, some by gunfire and some trampled or otherwise hurt while running for cover.

Unlike so many other perpetrators of deadly mass shootings before him, Paddock left behind no suicide note, no manifesto, no recordings and no messages on social media pointing to his intent, according to police.

McMahill said investigators remained certain Paddock acted alone in the shooting. But police have said they suspect he had help before the killings, based on the large number of guns, ammunition and explosives found in the hotel suite, his home, his car and a second home searched in Reno.

Slideshow (13 Images)

Authorities have said that 12 of the weapons recovered from Paddock’s hotel suite were equipped with so-called bump-stock devices that enable semi-automatic rifles to be operated as if they were fully automatic machine-guns.

Paddock’s ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute over the course of his 10-minute shooting spree was a major factor in the high casualty count, police said.

The bloodshed might have lasted longer, with greater loss of life, but for a hotel security officer who was sent to check an open-door alarm on the 32nd floor, and discovered the gunman’s whereabouts after the shooting started, McMahill said.

The security officer, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman strafed the hallway with gunfire from behind his door, apparently having detected Campos via surveillance cameras Paddock set up outside his hotel suite.

Campos, though wounded, alerted the hotel’s dispatch, “which was absolutely critical to us knowing the location as well as advising the responding officers as they arrived on that 32nd floor,” McMahill said. “He’s an absolute hero.”

In a new disclosure, authorities said two bullets Paddock fired struck a large jet fuel storage tank at the edge of the city’s main airport, about a block from the concert grounds, indicating an apparent attempt by the gunman to create even greater havoc.

There was no explosion or fire from the two rounds, one of which penetrated the tank, as jet fuel in storage is almost impossible to ignite with gunshots, airport officials said on Friday.

Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, 62, was questioned by the FBI on Wednesday and said in a statement she never had any inkling of Paddock’s plans.

Danley, who returned late on Tuesday from a family visit to the Philippines, is regarded by investigators as a “person of interest.” The Australian citizen of Filipino heritage is cooperating fully with authorities, her lawyer said.",Pence offers solace as Las Vegas police puzzle over shooter's motive,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lasvegas-shooting/police-fbi-seek-publics-help-in-finding-motive-behind-las-vegas-massacre-idUSKBN1CA0X6

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “Hamilton” musical creator Lin-Manuel Miranda on Friday released a new song for hurricane relief charity efforts in Puerto Rico featuring many of the music industry’s biggest Latin stars.

Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Gloria Estefan, Rita Moreno Luis Fonsi and many others sing on the English- and Spanish-language song “Almost Like Praying.”

The song, a riff on the tune “Maria” from the Broadway musical “West Side Story,” lists the names of all 78 of Puerto Rico’s towns in its lyrics.

Hurricane Maria, the worst hurricane to hit the U.S. territory in more than 90 years, killed at least 34 people last month and left most of the island without power or access to clean running water.

Miranda, 37, whose parents migrated to the United States from Puerto Rico, said the song was inspired by his own desperate attempts to contact family members after Hurricane Maria, and his frustrations about the pace of aid reaching the island.

“I thought I could work all 78 towns in Puerto Rico into the lyrics of this song and if we did our job right, these towns will never be forgotten again,” the musician told Billboard.

The success of the Tony Award-winning musical “Hamilton” has made Miranda one of America’s most influential Latin celebrities.

He made headlines last week for saying on Twitter that U.S. President Donald Trump was “going straight to hell” for criticizing Puerto Ricans for not doing enough to help themselves.

Miranda on Friday said he had no regrets about his comments.

“I’ve never seen the president of the United States attack the victims of a natural disaster,” he told “CBS This Morning” in an interview. “That has no precedent for me and so those words coming out of me also have no precedent.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Friday unveiled a blueprint for sweeping reforms of the U.S. capital markets as it looks to implement Republican President Donald Trump’s agenda to promote economic growth by slashing red tape.

The report recommends a raft of measures to encourage companies to seek public listings, to promote company access to capital, and to give investors a wider array of investment opportunities, in what is likely to be a boon for small business, banks, brokers and crowd-funding platforms.

It also called for regulators to put U.S. interests first when engaging in international regulatory forums.

“The U.S. has experienced slow economic growth for far too long,” said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.

“By streamlining the regulatory system, we can make the U.S. capital markets a true source of economic growth which will harness American ingenuity and allow small businesses to grow.”

The 232-page report largely steers clear of proposing legislative changes that would have to be passed by a divided Congress, instead focusing on tweaks that could be made relatively quickly by the country’s two markets regulators, which are both led by Trump appointees.

Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said in statements on Friday they had provided extensive input to the “thoughtful” report and supported its recommendations.

Friday’s report is the second of four expected from the Treasury as it completes a comprehensive review of existing financial rules, as mandated by an executive order President Donald Trump signed in February.

The first report, released in June, sought to promote lending by easing banking regulations outlined under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, with major parts requiring legislative revisions that are unlikely to be passed with Democrats fiercely opposed.

Friday’s report, in contrast, outlines a broad range of 91 technical fixes aimed at boosting stock, bond and derivatives markets. All but nine can be put into effect by the country’s federal regulatory agencies, who were consulted on the report.

The recommendations were met with quick praise from financial industry groups, who said capital markets regulations were also long overdue for a review.

“Efficient capital markets are at the core of a growing and prosperous economy. The Treasury Department’s report offers a blueprint to unlock the resources needed to spur economic growth and job creation,” said David Hirschmann, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Effectiveness.

DISCLOSURE RULES

The Treasury proposes streamlining disclosure and compliance requirements for companies that are both publicly-listed and which are looking to go public, in bid to reduce a secular downward trend in initial public offerings.

It also proposes scrapping a Dodd-Frank rule requiring public companies to disclose information about the potential conflict minerals in their products, and the ratio between the pay for top executives and the company’s average worker.

To boost small companies’ access to capital, the report recommends loosening the rules around crowd-funding, and suggests revising the definition of an ‘accredited investor’ in order to provide more opportunities for mom and pop investors.

The Treasury also waded into the long-running debate over equity market structure, proposing the SEC review share-tick sizes, order types, exchange fee models, and how exchanges themselves operate and are governed.

To reduce regulatory duplication and bring the United States more in line with other markets, the report calls for the SEC and CFTC to work more closely and harmonize their rules, but stopped short of recommending a merger of the two - something policymakers have called for in the past.

“The focus on harmonizing rule sets ... is a vital part of efforts to reduce the compliance burden for derivatives end users,” Scott O’Malia, chief executive of bank group the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and a former CFTC commissioner, said in a statement.

Derivatives dealers also stand to gain from a recommendation to relax rules around swaps trading and the cash they must post against derivatives trades.

While banks, brokers and small companies have cheered the report, many of the requirements are likely to draw criticism from public advocacy groups worried they may reduce investor protections, and open the door for banks to pursue risky trading behavior once again.

“It’s almost uniformly deregulatory. It calls for cutting back on post-crisis Dodd-Frank rules,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform. “It’s quite dangerous.”

Donald Trump mentioned Afghanistan just once in his speech to the United Nations Tuesday. His “new strategy for victory” there, he said, would help “crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.”

Trump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.

That was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.

Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.

“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”

Iran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.

In a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi's foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.

Perhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.

Intriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.

The catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.

Trump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.

Sixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.",Commentary: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afghanistan-commentary/commentary-the-real-deal-trump-has-to-make-on-afghanistan-idUSKCN1BV28K

MANILA (Reuters) - Trust and satisfaction in Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on Sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall.

Net satisfaction, used by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) as a rating of the president’s performance, was down 18 points from the second quarter to 48, classified as “good” in the survey of 1,200 Filipinos conducted in the last week of September.

Duterte’s net trust rating, which gauges public sentiment about his personality, was “very good” at 60 points, down from “excellent” 75 he achieved in the previous poll.

The survey was conducted just a few days after thousands of Filipinos rallied to denounce Duterte, his anti-drug crackdown and what they called an emerging dictatorship.

Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in the crackdown and other SWS polls conducted in September indicated doubts about the validity of official accounts of the 3,800 cases where police killed drug suspects.

The SWS survey did not ask respondents to give a reason for the rating of Duterte, who took office in June 2016. Duterte’s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results.

Political analyst Ramon Casiple, head of the country’s Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said it was normal for a president’s rating to fall during his time in office, but concern over the high death toll in his signature war on drugs will have weighed on sentiment.

Activists accuse Duterte of inciting police to kill drug dealers and users, which he denies. Police reject allegations they are executing suspects and say deaths occurred because victims had violently resisted arrest.

Casiple said that though the poll still showed Duterte had the support of Filipinos, he should take it seriously.

“This is a real diminution of his popularity and it serves as a wakeup call for him to stop it further going down,” Casiple said of the poll.

“However, this is still a comfortable figure and far from the threshold of unpopularity.”

Based on SWS methodology for net trust ratings, a score of 70 and above is considered excellent, 50 to 69 is very good, 30-49 good and 10-29 moderate.

While his political opponents chide him for his authoritarian style and intolerance of dissent, Duterte enjoys a cult-like following and support from millions of Filipinos, who see him as the best hope for change in a country with rampant crime and a yawning gap between rich and poor.","Philippine president sees biggest ratings dip, but popularity intact",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CD0NQ

New rules from the Department of Health and Human Services will let businesses or non-profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide contraceptives coverage in health insurance with no co-payment.

Conservative Christian activists and congressional Republicans praised the move, while reproductive rights advocates and Democrats criticized it. It was unclear how many employers would actually drop birth control coverage on religious grounds, and there were significant doubts that many big ones would.

Within hours, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the administration in federal court in San Francisco to try to halt the rule, claiming among other things that it violated the U.S. Constitution’s requirement for separation of church and state.

The states of Massachusetts and California also sued, and Democratic state attorneys general in another 16 states threatened legal action.

“This is a landmark day for religious liberty. Under the Obama administration, this constitutional right was seriously eroded,” Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said.

“The Trump administration just took direct aim at birth control coverage for 62 million women,” Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said.

“With this rule in place, any employer could decide that their employees no longer have health insurance coverage for birth control,” Richards added.

Trump, who criticized the birth control mandate in last year’s election campaign, won strong support from conservative Christian voters. The Republican president signed an executive order in May asking for rules that would allow faith-based groups to deny insurance coverage for services they oppose on religious grounds.

The contraception mandate was implemented as part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement. Trump and Republicans in Congress campaigned against Obamacare, as the law is known, but could not get enough votes to repeal it as they had promised.

In its reasoning for the move, the administration said among other things that mandating birth control coverage could foster “risky sexual behavior” among teens and young adults. It overturned the Obama administration’s view that the birth control requirement was necessary to meet the government’s “compelling interest” to protect women’s health.

“This administration’s contempt for women reaches a new low with this appalling decision,” top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi said.

The administration broadened narrow existing religious exemptions to include an exception “on the basis of moral conviction” for non-profit and for-profit companies.

Federal rules implemented under Obamacare required employers to provide health insurance that covers birth control, but religious houses of worship were exempted. Some private businesses sued regarding their rights to circumvent such coverage, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that they could object on religious grounds.

Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Jonathan Adler said it was unlikely publicly traded companies would seek exemptions. “Why would a publicly traded company risk alienating potential shareholders by taking such a step?” Adler said.

Ellen Kelsay, chief strategy officer at the National Business Group on Health, a lobbying group for large companies, said, “Most large employers have provided coverage for birth control prior to any mandates and we expect most will continue to do so irrespective of any exemptions that may become available.”

According to one estimate, only 3 percent of nonprofit groups offering health benefits have objected to contraceptives coverage.

“HHS has issued a balanced rule that respects all sides - it keeps the contraceptive mandate in place for most employers and now provides a religious exemption,” said Mark Rienzi, one of the lawyers for the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of Roman Catholic nuns, which runs care homes for the elderly, had challenged the mandate in court.

The Little Sisters and other Christian nonprofit employers objected to a 2013 compromise offered by the Obama administration that allowed entities opposed to providing contraception insurance coverage to comply with the law without actually paying for the required coverage.

The Justice Department released two memos that will serve as the government’s legal basis for justifying the rule and laying out a framework for how apply religious liberty issues in legal opinions, federal rules and grant making.

In another decision popular with Trump’s evangelical supporters, the Justice Department on Wednesday reversed federal policy and declared that federal law banning sex discrimination in the workplace does not protect transgender employees. Trump also has removed protections for transgender students and moved to ban transgender people from the military.

Trump’s support among evangelical voters, a major force in his 2016 election victory, remains strong, but has been slipping in line with his overall approval ratings, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos poll results.",Trump undermines U.S. birth control coverage requirement,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-religion/trump-undermines-u-s-birth-control-coverage-requirement-idUSKBN1CB1XZ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Aber Georg Thiel, Vizepräsident des Statistischen Bundesamtes, gibt sich wenig Mühe zu verbergen, dass das völlig anachronistisch sei. Zusammen mit dem Normenkontrollrat setzt er sich deshalb für eine Revolution der öffentlichen Verwaltung ein, die Staat, Unternehmen und Bürger viel Geld, Zeit und Nerven sparen soll: In einem gemeinsamen Gutachten, das am Freitag Kanzleramtschef Peter Altmaier übergeben wurde, wird eine digitale Neuordnung der sogenannten Register gefordert, in denen Behörden heute allerlei Bürgerdaten sammeln - meist dezentral, meist in Papierform und oft veraltet.

“Aber eine vernünftige Politik setzt eine vernünftige Datenbasis voraus”, mahnte Johannes Ludewig, Vorsitzender des Nationalen Normenkontrollrates, der sich den Bürokratieabbau in Deutschland auf die Fahnen geschrieben hat. Was wie ein langweiliges administratives Thema klingt, könnte in Wirklichkeit das gesamte Verhältnis zwischen Bürger und Staat neu regeln - und Milliardensummen einsparen helfen. Die große Koalition hatte mit dem digitalen Bürgerportal bereits einen Beschluss gefasst, der Bundesbürgern künftig mit einem einzigen Internetzugang erlauben soll, über alle staatlichen Ebenen hinweg Behördengeschäfte zu erledigen - von der Autoanmeldung, der Ummeldung bis zur Geburtsurkunden-Bescheinigung.

In der öffentlichen Wahrnehmung ist diese Einigung im Rahmen der Bund-Länder-Neuordnung angesichts der ansonsten bewegten Milliardensummen kaum beachtet worden: Aber indem sich der Bund die Zuständigkeit für das digitale Bürgerportal sicherte, könnte aus Sicht des Normenkontrollrates endlich der Wildwuchs an kommunalen, regionalen und föderalen Datenbanken eingedämmt werden - die oft nicht einmal Daten austauschen können, weil ihre IT-System nicht kompatibel sind.

In der von der Unternehmensberatung McKinsey durchgeführten Untersuchung wird dabei Alarm geschlagen: Denn während Deutschland immer noch in der analogen Föderalismus-Falle sitzt und jahrelang aus Datenschutz-Grünen über eine elektronische Gesundheitskarte stritt, sind andere europäische Staaten längst weiter, warnt das Gutachten. Österreich oder die Schweiz haben bereits digitale Plattformen, über die Behörden Daten mit einer sogenannten “Registerauskunft” austauschen können. Das kleine Estland ist mittlerweile so weit vorne, dass der EU-Digitalgipfel in Tallinn zur Lehrstunde für die anderen 27 EU-Staats- und Regierungschefs geriet.

SCHNELLIGKEIT ALS STANDORTFAKTOR

Grundidee ist, nicht etwa eine riesige zentrale Datenbank zu schaffen, sondern den Austausch dieser Register zu gewährleisten - was den Bürger davor bewahrt, ständig in verschiedenen Ämtern Angaben mehrfach machen zu müssen. Statt einer Aushöhlung des Datenschutzes bedeutet dies nach Einschätzung der Experten sogar ein höheres Schutzniveau: Denn der Bürger bekommt in Estland oder Österreich eine Nachricht, wenn eine Behörde etwa seine Adresse abgefragt hat, die er einmal in einer digitalen Datei hinterlegt hat. Daten dürfen nur für einen bestimmten Zweck, aber nicht etwa für Profile der Bürger benutzt werden. “Dies verbessert den Datenschutz sogar und schafft Transparenz”, betonen Ludewig und die estnische Präsidentin Kersti Kaljulaid übereinstimmend. Angenehmer Nebeneffekt für Bürger und Unternehmen: Entscheidungen staatlicher Behörden können wesentlich schneller fallen. “Und Schnelligkeit ist heute ein Kriterium im internationalen Standortvergleich”, betont Ludewig.

Auch aus Sicht der Verwaltung wäre dies ein Riesenfortschritt: Die Kosten für den Zensus könnten nach Angaben des Statistischen Bundesamtes von 667 auf 89 Millionen zusammenschnurren, wenn man nach Auswertung von Datenbanken nur noch Stichproben machen würde - und auf ganze 13 Millionen Euro, wenn man die Daten aus allen vorhandenen Registern nutzen könnte. In Österreich ist dies längst möglich - weshalb der Zensus immer auf dem letzten Stand ist. Thiel verweist darauf, dass dies im Nachbarland den Blindflug für die Politik beendete, den es in Deutschland oft gibt, weil die Bundespolitik beispielsweise zwar Entscheidungen über den Wohnungsbau treffen muss - aber nicht einmal einen Überblick über den gesamten Wohnungsbestand in Deutschland hat. Dabei gibt es genug Daten, nur sind sie verstreut. Allein 214 sogenannte Register, die für die Arbeit des Statistischen Bundesamtes wichtig wären, hat Thiel ausgemacht - und darin sind die Verwaltungsdaten noch nicht einmal erfasst.

Matthias Daub, verantwortlicher Partner bei McKinsey, beziffert den Gesamtnutzen des Übergangs zu einer digitalen Verwaltung pro Jahr auf sechs Milliarden Euro - bei einmaligen Kosten von 600 bis 800 Millionen Euro und einem jährlichen Aufwand von 160 bis 200 Millionen Euro. Während Thiel die Hoffnung hat, in sechs bis zehn Jahren durch eine digitale Verwaltung dann zu einer neuen Zensus-Erhebung übergehen zu können, ist Estland längst Lichtjahre weiter. Dort wird diskutiert, dass Bürger gar keine Anträge mehr auf staatliche Leistungen mehr stellen sollen - weil der Staat ja mit dem Zugriff auf Daten erkennen kann, wem eine beschlossene staatliche Leistung zusteht. Die Bittsteller-Rolle der Bürger, die von ihren eigenen Steuergeldern Leistungen erhalten wollen, würde damit beendet.

“Es ist richtig, dass die Einsparungen für Bürger beim Übergang zu antraglosen Verfahren - etwa beim Kindergeld- oder Elterngeldantrag - noch höher ausfallen könnten”, räumt McKinsey-Partner Daub ein. Dies sei aber nicht Teil des Auftrages für das Gutachten gewesen. Für Deutschland wurde “nur” der Nutzen beim Übergang von heute weitgehend auf Papiernachweisen basierenden Anträgen zu zukünftig papierlosen und registergestützten Anträgen geprüft. Und schon das wäre in der größten EU-Volkswirtschaft eine kleine Revolution.",Digitale Verwaltung könnte Milliarden und Zeit sparen,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-digitalisierung-verwaltung-idDEKBN1CD0PX

MANILA (Reuters) - Trust and satisfaction in Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on Sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall.

Net satisfaction, used by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) as a rating of the president’s performance, was down 18 points from the second quarter to 48, classified as “good” in the survey of 1,200 Filipinos conducted in the last week of September.

Duterte’s net trust rating, which gauges public sentiment about his personality, was “very good” at 60 points, down from “excellent” 75 he achieved in the previous poll.

The survey was conducted just a few days after thousands of Filipinos rallied to denounce Duterte, his anti-drug crackdown and what they called an emerging dictatorship.

Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in the crackdown and other SWS polls conducted in September indicated doubts about the validity of official accounts of the 3,800 cases where police killed drug suspects.

The SWS survey did not ask respondents to give a reason for the rating of Duterte, who took office in June 2016. Duterte’s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results.

Political analyst Ramon Casiple, head of the country’s Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said it was normal for a president’s rating to fall during his time in office, but concern over the high death toll in his signature war on drugs will have weighed on sentiment.

Activists accuse Duterte of inciting police to kill drug dealers and users, which he denies. Police reject allegations they are executing suspects and say deaths occurred because victims had violently resisted arrest.

Casiple said that though the poll still showed Duterte had the support of Filipinos, he should take it seriously.

“This is a real diminution of his popularity and it serves as a wakeup call for him to stop it further going down,” Casiple said of the poll.

“However, this is still a comfortable figure and far from the threshold of unpopularity.”

Based on SWS methodology for net trust ratings, a score of 70 and above is considered excellent, 50 to 69 is very good, 30-49 good and 10-29 moderate.

While his political opponents chide him for his authoritarian style and intolerance of dissent, Duterte enjoys a cult-like following and support from millions of Filipinos, who see him as the best hope for change in a country with rampant crime and a yawning gap between rich and poor.","Philippine president sees biggest ratings dip, but popularity intact",https://www.reuters.com/article/philippines-politics-duterte/philippine-president-sees-biggest-ratings-dip-but-popularity-intact-idINKBN1CD0NL

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Donald Trump’s visit to Puerto Rico risks compounding the damage caused by Hurricane Maria. His vow on Tuesday to wipe out the U.S. commonwealth’s huge debts sent its bond prices plunging on Wednesday. The island’s devastation may well necessitate a fresh restructuring, but that won’t address urgent issues. The White House needs to provide money and supplies, not distraction.

The president spent a few hours touring the island on Tuesday, tossing rolls of paper towels to locals and praising what he said was the “great job” being done by federal emergency teams and military commanders. Roughly two-thirds of grocery stores and gasoline stations have reopened and power was restored earlier this week to the business district of the capital, San Juan. Most of the island’s hospitals, though, rely on intermittent deliveries of diesel to power generators so are still in the dark.

Governor Ricardo Rosselló announced shortly after the president left that the death toll had more than doubled, to 34. It will take months if not years to rebuild damaged roads, the power grid, homes and other infrastructure. Catastrophe-modeling firm AIR Worldwide has estimated insured losses of anywhere between $40 billion and $85 billion.

Given the scale of the task, it seems likely bondholders will ultimately face an even bigger haircut than they were already bracing for. In May, Puerto Rico initiated a form of bankruptcy to restructure its $72 billion of debt. The commonwealth’s general obligation bonds due in 2035 were trading at around 57 cents on the dollar before Maria struck, declining to some 45 cents on Tuesday. Trump’s comments sparked a surge in sell orders that wiped another 25 percent off the price on Wednesday, according to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board’s electronic quotation service.

Driving away investors won’t help Puerto Rico’s recovery effort. Trump doesn’t even have the authority to abrogate debts, something budget director Mick Mulvaney seemed to recognize Wednesday when he said the president’s comments shouldn’t be taken literally. Even if the president wants to help negotiate a more generous restructuring for the island, that process is a slow, painstaking one. That’s the opposite of what the territory and its 3.5 million people need most.",Breakingviews - Trump gets Puerto Rico priorities in a muddle,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puerto-rico-breakingviews/breakingviews-trump-gets-puerto-rico-priorities-in-a-muddle-idUSKBN1C92GA

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Die längste Rally in der Geschichte der europäischen Aktienmärkte nährt bei Börsianern die Furcht vor einer Überhitzung.

Dax und EuroStoxx steigen bereits das sechste Jahr in Folge, so lange wie nie zuvor. Seit Jahresbeginn hat der deutsche Leitindex rund zwölf Prozent zugelegt und steht nun kurz vor dem Sprung durch die Schallmauer von 13.000 Punkten. Zuletzt trennten ihn lediglich rund 30 Pünktchen von der Rekordmarke.

Immer mehr Analysten raten dazu, die Kurssprünge mit Vorsicht zu genießen. Vor allem die Wall Street, die den Dax mit nach oben gezogen hat, scheint heißgelaufen. Auch Deutsche-Bank-Chef John Cryan sieht in Folge der jahrelangen Niedrigzins-Politik der Notenbanken Anzeichen von Spekulationsblasen bei Aktien, Anleihen und Immobilien. Die europäische Finanzmarktaufsicht (ESMA) warnte ebenfalls vor Risiken. EZB-Ratsmitglied Ewald Nowotny sieht vor allem am US-Aktienmarkt eine erhöhte Gefahr für Abstürze, eine generelle Überbewertung an Europas Börsen sei noch nicht in Sicht. Auch EZB-Chef Mario Draghi gibt sich diesbezüglich gelassen. Erstklassige Gewerbeimmobilien seien der einzige Bereich mit überdehnten Preisen, meinte er kürzlich.

Fakt ist: Die Zinspolitik der Notenbanken hat in zahlreichen Anlageklassen zu kräftigen Preisschüben geführt. Seit 2009 sind die Geldhähne weit geöffnet. Die US-Notenbank Fed, die Europäische Zentralbank und die Notenbanken Großbritanniens und Japans pumpten seither Billionen in den Geldkreislauf.

NOCH LUFT NACH OBEN

Aktienanleger fragen sich, wie lange die Party an den Börsen noch anhält und ob der Zeitpunkt für einen Ausstieg nicht schon gekommen ist. Aus kurzfristiger Sicht mag es richtig sein, erst einmal Kasse zu machen, meint Martin Hüfner, Chefvolkswirt des Vermögensverwalters Assenagon. Langfristig hingegen seien die fundamentalen Faktoren nach wie vor gut. Die Konjunktur laufe rund, daran werde sich auf absehbare Zeit nichts ändern. “Die Überbewertungen in anderen Asset-Klassen, vor allem in Bonds sind viel größer”, betont Hüfner.

Neben dem zuletzt wieder etwas schwächeren Euro setzen die Anleger vor allem auf eine starke US-Konjunktur. “Geopolitische Risiken werden immer stärker ignoriert”, sagt Anlagestratege Tobias Basse von der NordLB. Das könnte sich jedoch ändern, sollten die Krisen in Nordkorea und Katalonien eskalieren. Störfeuer könnten auch von der Fed kommen, die mit höheren Zinsen auf das von den Börsen momentan gespielte Szenario eines stärkeren Wachstums in den USA reagieren könnte. “Damit scheinen vor allem nordamerikanische Aktien inzwischen recht ambitioniert bewertet zu sein.”

Vergleicht man das Kurs-Gewinn-Verhältnis (KGV) zwischen den Kontinenten bleibt dem Dax noch Luft nach oben. Nach Reuters-Daten liegt sein KGV derzeit bei knapp 14 - der Kurs der 30 im deutschen Leitindex gelisteten Unternehmens-Papiere übertrifft also den Gewinn je Aktie um das 14-fache. Das ist sogar unter dem langjährigen Mittel von rund 15. Zum Vergleich: In Zeiten der Internet-Blase zur Jahrtausendwende lag das KGV etwa doppelt so hoch.

An der New Yorker Wall Street laufen die Aktienkurse den Unternehmensgewinnen hingegen davon. Der Blick zurück zeigt, dass nur in kurzen Phasen die KGVs jemals höher waren als momentan. “Fundamental sind Bewertungen vorzufinden, die sonst nur in einem Fünftel der Geschichte der Wall Street zu beobachten waren”, sagt Stratege Jochen Stanzl von CMC Markets. Fiskalpolitisch sorgten zwar die Steuerpläne der Trump-Regierung für gute Stimmung, allerdings sei die Frage nach der Finanzierbarkeit nicht geklärt. Beim US-Standardwerteindex Dow Jones liegt das KGV bei 20,6 und beim breit gefassten S&P 500 sogar bei 22,5. Damit rangieren beide ebenfalls über ihrem langjährigen Durchschnitt.

VERZERRUNGEN AN DEN BONDMÄRKTEN

Ein Großteil des billigen Notenbank-Geldes fließt in die Anleihemärkte. Allein das Kaufprogramm der EZB umfasst 2,3 Billionen Euro. Dies drückt die Verzinsung auf Rekordtiefs. Nach Berechnungen der Vermögensverwaltung der US-Bank JP Morgan rentieren rund 36 Prozent der Staatsanleihen in der Euro-Zone unter Null. Es sei schwer zu leugnen, dass es überzogene Preise gebe, sagt der auf Bonds spezialisierte Vermögensverwalter Iain Stealey von JP Morgan Asset Management. “Es gibt Länder, die im Jahr nominal an die vier Prozent wachsen und deren Staatsanleihen einen Negativ-Zins haben. Da gibt es ein Missverhältnis.”

Der Einfluss der EZB wird unter anderem bei Italien deutlich. Die zehnjährigen Anleihen des Landes, das volkswirtschaftlich als eines der schwächsten Glieder in der Euro-Zone gilt, warfen in den vergangenen Jahren meist weniger ab als US-Staatspapiere. Zum Höhepunkt der Finanzkrise hatten sie bei 7,5 Prozent rentiert. Momentan liegen die Renditen mit 2,2 beziehungsweise 2,3 Prozent nahezu gleichauf.",HINTERGRUND-Dax-Rekordfieber nährt Furcht vor Überhitzung,https://www.reuters.com/article/m-rkte-aktien-anleihen-spekulationsblase-idDEKBN1CB0OL

HAVANA (Reuters) - The man forecast to replace Cuban President Raul Castro early next year rejected U.S. demands that the Communist-run country change its political and economic system.

In a Sunday speech blasting U.S. pressure on the Venezuelan government and what he termed an effort to discredit the Cuban tourism industry, First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel said these and other recent events in the region proved “imperialism can never be trusted, not even a tiny bit, never.”

Diaz-Canel was quoting Ernesto Che Guevara at a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of the revolutionary who had helped lead a Bolivian uprising modeled after Cuba’s.

“Cuba will not make concessions to its sovereignty and independence, nor negotiate its principles or accept the imposition of conditions,” Diaz-Canel said, apparently responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent statement at the United Nations that sanctions would not be lifted until the Caribbean island restores democracy and capitalism.

“The changes needed in Cuba will solely be carried out by the Cuban people,” Diaz-Canel said.

Castro, 86, has announced he will step down as president in February. Experts expect Diaz-Canel, 57, to become the first head of state since the early 1960s without Castro as a last name.

There are no direct elections in Cuba for national office.

Trump said in June that he would once more tighten sanctions on Cuba and seek a better deal from the country than the gradual detente achieved by predecessor Barack Obama.

The Trump administration has drastically reduced staffing at its embassy in Cuba and ordered a reciprocal reduction of Cuban diplomats in Washington due to a series of alleged “health attacks” on U.S. personnel in Havana.

The United States has not blamed Cuba for the still unsolved incidents but holds it responsible for not protecting its personnel. The administration has also issued a travel warning stating U.S. citizens might be targeted.

“Some unnamed officials are propagating unusual nonsense without any evidence, with the perverse aim of discrediting the impeccable reputation of our country as a safe destination for foreign visitors, including from the United States,” Diaz-Canel said.",Likely successor to Cuba's Castro rejects U.S. demands for change,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cuba/likely-successor-to-cubas-castro-rejects-u-s-demands-for-change-idUSKBN1CD0N0?il=0

O grupo militar foi escoltado para a área por rivais dos rebeldes, a aliança jihadista Tahrir al-Sham, contra a qual a operação foi planejada, disseram fontes locais, sugerindo que um acordo pode surgir a fim de evitar a batalha.

Modi, in a rare acknowledgment that economic sentiment had turned negative, this week defended his handling of the economy, which in the June quarter grew at an annual 5.7 percent, its slowest rate in three years.

Small and medium-sized enterprises, crucial to Modi’s plans to create millions of more jobs, have been hurt by a massive tax overhaul launched on July 1 that added layers of bureaucracy for companies and hit exports.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday chaired a meeting of the council for the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a landmark reform which turned India’s 29 states into a single customs union for the first time.

After the day-long meeting, Jaitley said small businesses would be allowed to file tax returns once a quarter instead of every month. He also said duties would be cut on some products and the threshold for lower tax would be raised.

“We are not in a denial mode that there is a problem in the SME (small and medium enterprises) sector,” said a senior lawmaker who has been working with Modi’s office to combat the economic slowdown.

Ajay Sahai, head of the Federation of Indian Export Organisation, said before the Jaitley press conference that its 25,000 small and medium-sized members had found the monthly tax drill “exhausting”.

While a mountain of bad loans has crimped bank lending to India’s bigger companies, smaller firms have been hurt by a government move last November to stamp out “black money” - untaxed cash that oils many industries - and by GST, whose complex structure has baffled companies down the supply chain.

“Informal sources of working capital (for smaller firms) has dried up,” said Anil Bhardwaj at the Federation of Indian Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises.

He predicted that it would be another year before GST began to have a positive impact on smaller companies.

Jaitley has promised steps to boost economic growth back above 7 percent and toward the levels economists say India requires to generate employment for the one million entering the workforce every month.

Modi built a reputation as an economic reformer capable of delivering jobs and wealth for an increasingly aspirational population, but slowing growth will be near the top of voter concerns in upcoming state elections.

Investment remains low. The government has hiked spending on infrastructure, but private investment has remained muted.

“It is not easy because our banking system is in deep trouble and private investment is not picking up,” the lawmaker said. “The government will have to recast all policies that will activate the public sector.”

Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu said in a tweet his department was working with Jaitley to address GST-related issues of exporters.

Les manifestants, qui étaient au nombre de 350.000 selon la police, étaient venus de toute l‘Espagne. Ils se sont rassemblés dans le centre de la capitale catalane, agitant des drapeaux espagnols et catalans où l‘on pouvait lire : “La Catalogne c‘est l‘Espagne” et “Ensemble, nous sommes plus forts”.

Samedi déjà, des dizaines de milliers de personnes avaient manifesté dans une cinquantaine de villes d‘Espagne pour défendre l‘unité du pays ou réclamer l‘ouverture d‘un dialogue pour désamorcer la crise.

Le président de l‘exécutif autonome catalan, Carles Puigdemont, doit prendre la parole mardi devant le Parlement régional. Il pourrait proclamer unilatéralement l‘indépendance de la Catalogne en s‘appuyant sur les résultats du référendum du 1er octobre où le “oui” l‘a largement emporté malgré un faible taux de participation.

Dans un entretien accordé au quotidien El Pais, le président du gouvernement espagnol, Mariano Rajoy, annonce que Madrid pourrait utiliser les pouvoirs que lui confère la Constitution pour suspendre l‘autonomie de la région et l‘empêcher de se séparer de l‘Espagne.

“Je n‘exclus absolument rien qui soit dans le cadre de la loi”, dit-il en réponse à une question sur une activation de l‘article 155 de la Constitution, qui lui permettrait de limoger le gouvernement régional et d‘organiser de nouvelles élections locales.

“Idéalement, il ne devrait pas être nécessaire de mettre en oeuvre des solutions drastiques, mais pour que cela ne se produise pas, les choses vont devoir changer”, ajoute-t-il.

“Nous allons empêcher l‘indépendance de se produire. C‘est pourquoi je peux vous dire avec une franchise absolue que cela n‘arrivera pas”, insiste-t-il.

DÉFENDRE LA DÉMOCRATIE

Le Parti populaire (PP, droite, minoritaire) de Mariano Rajoy est en discussion avec les socialistes afin d‘obtenir le soutien du principal parti d‘opposition avant de prendre la décision, sans précédent, de déclencher l‘article 155.

L‘ancien chef du gouvernement socialiste, Felipe Gonzalez, a déclaré samedi à des journalistes alors qu‘il se trouvait en Allemagne que, s‘il était au pouvoir, il aurait déjà invoqué l‘article 155.

“J‘aurais suspendu les dirigeants qui ont enfreint la Constitution et le statut d‘autonomie (...)”, a-t-il dit.

Rebondissant sur le mot d‘ordre du défilé de dimanche, Mariano Rajoy a déclaré sur Twitter : “Retrouvons nos esprits pour défendre la démocratie, la Constitution et la liberté. Nous préserverons l‘unité de l‘Espagne.”

Le gouvernement autonome de Catalogne a publié vendredi soir les résultats définitifs de cette consultation qui avait été interdite par le Tribunal constitutionnel. Le “oui” à l‘indépendance l‘a emporté avec 90,18% des voix exprimées par les quelque 2,3 millions d‘électeurs qui se sont déplacés aux urnes malgré le déploiement des forces de police, soit une participation de 43% des inscrits.

La manifestation de dimanche à Barcelone a accueilli le romancier et prix Nobel de littérature 2010 Mario Vargas Llosa, qui possède la double nationalité espagnole et péruvienne. Il a déclaré aux journalistes que la participation massive montrait qu‘il y avait “une très grande partie des Catalans qui ne se sentent pas représentés par les militants en faveur de l‘indépendance et qui ne veulent pas du coup d‘Etat que le gouvernement catalan est en train d‘organiser”.

Perdre la Catalogne est impensable pour l‘Etat espagnol qui perdrait 16% de sa population, un cinquième de son produit intérieur brut (PIB) et plus d‘un quart de ses exportations.

La crise politique a conduit un certain nombre de banques et d‘entreprises à transférer leurs sièges sociaux hors de Catalogne. Dernière en date, la société autoroutière Abertis doit se réunir lundi à ce sujet.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The powerful U.S. gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, said on Sunday it would oppose an outright ban on bump-stock devices that the killer in the Las Vegas massacre of 58 people used to turn rifles into automatic weapons and strafe a crowd with bursts of sustained gunfire.

The NRA, which has seldom embraced new firearms-control measures, stunned gun control advocates last week when it issued a statement voicing willingness to support a restriction on bump stocks.

On Sunday, the organization said it was open to regulation but opposed any legislation banning the devices.

“We don’t believe that bans have ever worked on anything. What we have said has been very clear - that if something transfers a semiautomatic to function like a fully automatic, then it ought to be regulated differently,” Chris Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Police said the gunman, Stephen Paddock, 64, fitted 12 of his weapons with bump-stock devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns, which are otherwise outlawed in the United States.

Cox and Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s chief executive, accused the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives under Democratic former President Barack Obama of paving the way for the use of bump stocks and creating legal confusion about their usage.

Republican President Donald Trump was an outspoken advocate of gun rights during his 2016 campaign for the White House. The NRA spent more than $30 million in support of his candidacy.

NO REPUBLICAN SUPPORT

LaPierre lashed out at U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who has pushed for gun-control legislation on Capitol Hill.

“I think you want to tell ATF to do its job. It’s an interpretive issue and they need to get the job done. But not let Dianne Feinstein, which is what she wants to do - turn this all of this into some Christmas tree on the Hill where she brings all of her anti-gun circus she has been trying to do for years into this,” LaPierre said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Feinstein said she has garnered some Republican interest, but no support, for the measure. “I have nobody lined up,” she told the CBS program.

Some gun-control advocates praised the NRA for showing some flexibility.

“This is the first time that the gun lobby has shown willingness to come to the table and I think that’s in part because Americans just simply do not accept mass shooting after mass shooting happening and Congress doing absolutely nothing,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

But Sunday’s comments from the NRA representatives suggested nothing may have changed as they castigated calls for gun-control measures in the emotional aftermath of a mass shooting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said late on Friday it had approved Alphabet Inc’s application to provide emergency cellular service to Puerto Rico through balloons.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled to regain communications services. The FCC said on Friday that 83 percent of cell sites remain out of service, while wireless communications company are deploying temporary sites.

Alphabet, which announced its Project Loon in 2013 to use solar-powered, high-altitude balloons to provide internet service in remote regions, said in an FCC filing it was working to “support licensed mobile carriers’ restoration of limited communications capability” in Puerto Rico.

Earlier on Friday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced he was forming a Hurricane Recovery Task Force with an emphasis on addressing challenges facing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

“It is critical that we adopt a coordinated and comprehensive approach to support the rebuilding of communications infrastructure and restoration of communications services,” Pai said in statement.

Separately, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a Twitter posting late on Friday that he had a “great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities. Next steps soon to follow.”

Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc, said on Friday the company would send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island over two weeks ago.

Musk said he was diverting resources from a semi-truck project to fix Model 3 bottlenecks and “increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.”

In late September, Tesla said it was sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Hurricane Maria.",Google to use balloons to provide Puerto Rico cell service,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CC02F-OCATC

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Large protests were held across Australia on Saturday against Indian mining giant Adani Enterprises’ proposed Carmichael coal mine, which would be the country’s largest coal mine but has been delayed for years over environmental and financing issues.

Environment groups say the mine in Queensland state would contribute to global warming and damage the Great Barrier Reef.

The “Stop Adani” movement organized 45 protests.

On the sands of Sydney’s Bondi Beach more than 1,000 people formed a human sign saying '#STOP ADANI’, said organizer Blair Palese from activist group 350.

“I think there’s a very real national concern that goes beyond Queensland about the idea of giving this mine a billion-dollar taxpayer-funded loan,” she said.

The national rallies come as new polling shows more than half of Australians oppose the mine, reported local media.

Analysts have raised doubts about whether Adani can fund the mine, at an initial cost of $4 billion, given a global backlash to investment in fossil fuels.

Adani says the project would pay billions of dollars in royalties and taxes, create jobs and export coal to India help bring electricity to rural regions.

Adani has been counting on a A$900 million ($704 million) loan from the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) for a rail link to the proposed mine.

The company’s chief executive officer Jeyakumar Janakaraj, however, has said Adani may not have to borrow from NAIF. “If the commercial banks take off all the debt then we will not have any need for NAIF as there will be no gap.”

The Australian Conservation Foundation president Geoff Cousins, one of the country’s top businessmen, said it was unlikely Adani could proceed without the NAIF loan.

“They’ve tried hard to secure commercial funding, but no bank will touch them,” he said.

“Stop Adani is an issues-based campaign, and the rest of the world sees the madness of building one of the world’s largest coal mines particularly when Australia has signed the Paris Agreement (on climate change).”

(Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi as the fourth hurricane to hit the United States this year, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages.

As the storm moved northeast into Alabama, Nate’s maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour), prompting the National Hurricane Center to end its tropical storm warnings for the region. The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.

“We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters, saying there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage.

The fourth major storm to strike the United States in less than two months, Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.

Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.

The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the National Hurricane Center said. Heavy rainfall and storm surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.

Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.

Flood waters swept over streets in communities across Alabama and Mississippi, including over Highway 90 and to oceanside casinos in Biloxi, according to reports on social media.

Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.

“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”

Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.

“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

On Saturday, states of emergency were declared in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as in more than two dozen Florida counties. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned of tornadoes springing up in the Pandhandle region.

In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey urged residents in areas facing heavy winds and storm surges to take precautions. U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.

About 47,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, while more than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.

Utility Alabama Power said some 82,000 customers were without electricity.

Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches, were expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the NHC said.

NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu lifted a curfew on Saturday evening that was originally scheduled to last until Sunday morning. He said in a statement on social media however, that there was still a serious threat of storm surge outside levee areas.

Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Plaquemines Parish President Amos Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.

The ports of New Orleans in Louisiana and Mobile in Alabama remained closed, and refineries and port authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were reviewing when they could reopen.

The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.

Workers were evacuated from 301 platforms and 13 rigs as of Saturday, said the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.","Hurricane Nate weakens as it soaks Mississippi, Alabama",https://www.reuters.com/article/storm-nate/hurricane-nate-weakens-as-it-soaks-mississippi-alabama-idINKBN1CC06E?il=0

SABRATHA, Libya (Reuters) - An armed alliance involved in a three-week battle over the Libyan smuggling hub of Sabratha said on Saturday it had taken over protection of the Mellitah oil and gas terminal after expelling a rival group.

An organization called the Operations Room and its allies have been fighting the Anas al-Dabbashi brigade, a major facilitator of migrant smuggling that recently said it had changed tack and struck a deal with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli to stop boats setting off across the Mediterranean.

The fighting killed 17 and wounded 164, Omar Abduljaleel, commander of the Operations Room, told reporters in Sabratha, a town west of the capital Tripoli.

The Dabbashi brigade had been guarding the facility west of Sabratha since 2015. It is run jointly by Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) and Italian firm Eni.

Since a 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey to block crossings in the Aegean, Libya has been the gateway for the vast majority of migrants trying to reach Europe by boat, and the area around Sabratha has been the most common departure point.

From July, the number of crossings dropped sharply, a change attributed to increased activity by Libya’s EU-trained coastguard and to the Dabbashi brigade blocking departures in return for offers of amnesty and jobs in the security forces.

Asked whether the Operations Room would stop illegal migration, Abduljaleel said: “God willing we will work on illegal migration after the biggest smuggler has been eliminated.”

The Dabbashi brigade has confirmed the retreat from Sabratha, where the Operations Room took reporters on a tour. Several houses in the main street had been hit by rockets or were burned out but otherwise the city was calm.

LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

MONTREAL (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve must respond to “very tight” U.S. labor markets by gradually raising interest rates or risk halting the economic recovery, a hawkish Fed official said on Saturday.

In prepared remarks that largely restated his views, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said he expects the labor market to improve further after U.S. unemployment dropped to 4.2 percent last month, its lowest level since 2001.

“Prudent risk management would argue for the continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation in order to minimize the risk of outcomes that might prematurely shorten the current economic recovery,” said Rosengren, who was speaking at the International Atlantic Economic Conference in Montreal, adding he expects the U.S. economy will likely continue to grow above its potential.

“Failing to respond to very tight labor markets with rates remaining negative in real terms could potentially risk unnecessarily shortening the economic recovery,” added Rosengren, who does not vote on policy this year but whose views often portend overall Fed policy.

(Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi as the fourth hurricane to hit the United States this year, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages.

As the storm moved northeast into Alabama, Nate’s maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour), prompting the National Hurricane Center to end its tropical storm warnings for the region. The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.

“We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters, saying there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage.

The fourth major storm to strike the United States in less than two months, Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.

Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.

The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the National Hurricane Center said. Heavy rainfall and storm surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.

Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.

Flood waters swept over streets in communities across Alabama and Mississippi, including over Highway 90 and to oceanside casinos in Biloxi, according to reports on social media.

Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.

“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”

Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.

“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

On Saturday, states of emergency were declared in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as in more than two dozen Florida counties. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned of tornadoes springing up in the Pandhandle region.

In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey urged residents in areas facing heavy winds and storm surges to take precautions. U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.

About 47,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, while more than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.

Utility Alabama Power said some 82,000 customers were without electricity.

Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches, were expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the NHC said.

NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu lifted a curfew on Saturday evening that was originally scheduled to last until Sunday morning. He said in a statement on social media however, that there was still a serious threat of storm surge outside levee areas.

Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Plaquemines Parish President Amos Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.

The ports of New Orleans in Louisiana and Mobile in Alabama remained closed, and refineries and port authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were reviewing when they could reopen.

The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.

Workers were evacuated from 301 platforms and 13 rigs as of Saturday, said the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.","Hurricane Nate weakens as it soaks Mississippi, Alabama",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-nate/hurricane-nate-weakens-as-it-soaks-mississippi-alabama-idUSKBN1CA1DD

ACCRA (Reuters) - A fuel distribution site in Ghana’s capital Accra exploded on Saturday evening, killing an unknown number of people, a government official said.

“Unfortunately there are some fatalities and we are working to have the numbers,” Deputy Information Minister Kojo Oppong Nkrumah told a local radio station. “There are quite a number also injured.”

He added that the main blaze was largely under control and that the government planned to release casaulty figures on Sunday morning.

Several eyewitnesses told Reuters they had counted four or five bodies, although some bodies could have already been removed from the scene.

The explosion at around 7:30 p.m. local time (1930 GMT) occurred at a fuel distribution site at city’s Atomic Junction where there is a liquefied petroleum gas storage depot and two service stations run by state-owned GOIL and oil major Total, a Reuters witness said.

Frightened residents ran from the explosion, which sent a giant fireball high into the sky above the city, and several fire trucks and ambulances were deployed to the scene.

“I don’t think there’s much support in the Conservative Party for Grant Shapps.","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday she would stay on as leader to provide stability after a former chairman of her Conservative Party said he had garnered the support of 30 lawmakers who wanted her to quit.

May is trying to face down a rebellion by some of her own lawmakers just as Britain enters a crucial stage in Brexit talks, 18 months before the country leaves the European Union and must redefine its place in the world.

Some Conservative plotters say her authority is shattered beyond repair after a disastrous speech at her party’s conference, which comes after she called a snap election and lost her party its majority in parliament.

Speaking from her parliamentary constituency of Maidenhead in southern England, May said in a televised statement: “What the country needs is calm leadership and that’s what I‘m providing with the full support of my cabinet.”

Senior ministers rallied around May, who has just over a year to agree a divorce deal with the EU ahead of Britain’s exit in March 2019. May said she planned to hold a scheduled meeting about Brexit with business leaders on Monday in Downing Street.

But former party chairman Grant Shapps told BBC radio: “I think she should call a leadership election.”

After May’s bungled election, her failure to unite the cabinet and a poor party conference “the writing is on the wall,” he said.

May’s authority was already diminished by her decision to call a snap election in June that lost her party its majority in parliament days before Brexit talks opened.

Though no Conservative ministers have publicly indicated any support for the plot, such a blunt demand for May to quit indicates the extent of her weakness while she attempts to navigate the intricacies of the negotiations to leave the EU.

Her survival has so far been dependent on the absence of an obvious successor who could unite the party and the fear of an election that many Conservatives think would let opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into power.

Sterling fell earlier in the day but then rallied by around a quarter of a cent against the U.S. dollar following May’s remarks. It later fell after U.S. payrolls data was released.

SERIOUS PLOT?

May’s speech to activists on Wednesday was ruined by coughing fits, a comedian handing her a bogus employment termination notice and by letters falling off the slogans on the set behind her.

She had hoped to use the speech to her party in the northern English city of Manchester to revive her premiership.

“Look, I’ve had a cold all this week,” May said, adding that she would be updating lawmakers next week on her Brexit plans and introducing a draft bill to cap domestic energy prices.

Shapps, who chaired the party between 2012 and 2015, said the plot to remove her existed before this week’s party conference and included both supporters and opponents of Brexit. He said the group did not have a unified view on who should replace May.

However, grassroots Conservative members did not share his desire for a change in leadership, said James Pearson, Vice President of the National Conservative Convention which represents the party’s voluntary wing.

“I don’t think there’s much support in the Conservative Party for Grant Shapps. I don’t see this as anything that’s really serious to be honest,” Pearson told Reuters.

“The general feeling is we don’t have the time or the appetite for a lengthy leadership election, nor do we actually want it,” Pearson, who sits on the Conservatives’ Board, the party’s ultimate decision-making body, added.

To trigger a formal leadership challenge, 48 Conservative lawmakers need to write to the chairman of the party’s so-called 1922 committee.

“Number 10 must be delighted to learn that it’s Grant Shapps leading this alleged coup,” Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 committee, told BBC radio.

“Grant has many talents, but one thing he doesn’t have is a following in the party, so really I think this is now just going to fizzle out to be perfectly honest.”

If May stays, talks on leaving the European Union will be guided by one of the weakest leaders in recent British history. EU diplomats and officials expressed astonishment about the uncertainty in London.

“SHE SHOULD STAY”

Supporters, including her most senior ministers, said she should remain in charge to deliver Brexit.

Under the headline ‘Theresa May will stay as Prime Minister and get the job done,’ interior minister Amber Rudd wrote in The Telegraph newspaper that “she should stay”. May’s de facto deputy Damian Green said she would carry on. Environment Secretary Michael Gove also said he hoped she would continue.

“I know that she is as determined as ever to get on with the job, she sees it as her duty to do so and she will carry on and she will make a success of this government,” Green, the first secretary of state, told BBC television.

Many Conservative activists fear a leadership contest would exacerbate the divide in the party over Europe, an issue that helped sink the previous three Conservative prime ministers - David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.

A leadership contest could also pave the way for an election that some Conservatives worry could be won by Corbyn, whom they cast as a Marxist who would reverse decades of free market policies.

“The Conservatives have no plan for Britain and their posturing will not deliver the change our country is crying out for,” Corbyn said on Friday.",British PM May vows to stay as party plotters attempt to topple her,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-may-leadership/may-vows-to-stay-as-party-plotters-attempt-to-topple-her-idUKKBN1CA2TY

HAVANA (Reuters) - The man forecast to replace Cuban President Raul Castro early next year rejected U.S. demands that the Communist-run country change its political and economic system.

In a Sunday speech blasting U.S. pressure on the Venezuelan government and what he termed an effort to discredit the Cuban tourism industry, First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel said these and other recent events in the region proved “imperialism can never be trusted, not even a tiny bit, never.”

Diaz-Canel was quoting Ernesto Che Guevara at a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of the revolutionary who had helped lead a Bolivian uprising modeled after Cuba’s.

“Cuba will not make concessions to its sovereignty and independence, nor negotiate its principles or accept the imposition of conditions,” Diaz-Canel said, apparently responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent statement at the United Nations that sanctions would not be lifted until the Caribbean island restores democracy and capitalism.

“The changes needed in Cuba will solely be carried out by the Cuban people,” Diaz-Canel said.

File Picture: Cuba's First Vice-President Miguel Diaz-Canel (C) leaves the National Assembly after the inauguration ceremony of Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno (not pictured) in Quito, Ecuador May 24, 2017. REUTERS/Mariana Bazo

Castro, 86, has announced he will step down as president in February. Experts expect Diaz-Canel, 57, to become the first head of state since the early 1960s without Castro as a last name.

There are no direct elections in Cuba for national office.

Trump said in June that he would once more tighten sanctions on Cuba and seek a better deal from the country than the gradual detente achieved by predecessor Barack Obama.

The Trump administration has drastically reduced staffing at its embassy in Cuba and ordered a reciprocal reduction of Cuban diplomats in Washington due to a series of alleged “health attacks” on U.S. personnel in Havana.

The United States has not blamed Cuba for the still unsolved incidents but holds it responsible for not protecting its personnel. The administration has also issued a travel warning stating U.S. citizens might be targeted.

“Some unnamed officials are propagating unusual nonsense without any evidence, with the perverse aim of discrediting the impeccable reputation of our country as a safe destination for foreign visitors, including from the United States,” Diaz-Canel said.",Likely successor to Cuba's Castro rejects U.S. demands for change,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-cuba/likely-successor-to-cubas-castro-rejects-u-s-demands-for-change-idUKKBN1CD0MW?il=0

ZURICH (Reuters) - Zurich Insurance (ZURN.S) will have cut costs by $700 million by the end of the year, nearly halfway to its goal to save $1.5 billion by 2019, Chief Executive Mario Greco said in an interview published on Saturday.

“We’re on track,” Greco told the daily Neue Zuercher Zeitung. “It’s a big challenge, because we must simultaneously cut costs as well as invest.”

Greco, who had engineered a turnaround at Italy’s Generali (GASI.MI) , was brought in last year by Zurich to reduce the company’s high cost base and simplify its business to help boost profitability that had been falling short of its own targets.

Asked if a dividend target of 75 percent of net profit was too high, Greco responded by saying the company is satisfied with its AA debt rating and has no ambition to attain AAA, meaning further measures to strengthen capital is not a priority.

“An excessive build-up of capital reserves weakens our discipline and leads to a situation where money is deployed inefficiently,” Greco said. “Additionally, it puts pressure on the return on equity and doesn’t help us any further.”

Greco told the newspaper Zurich does not need additional capital to support organic growth of its property insurance or life insurance businesses, as these already generate significant cashflow.

But the company needs to invest in internal initiatives including new digital technology to become more responsive to its customers’ changing needs, he said.

“For small purchases, we have enough capital,” he told the paper, adding the company could turn to shareholders to raise cash should it decide to make a large acquisition.",Zurich's Greco says nearly halfway to 2019 goal to cut costs: NZZ,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-zurich-cost-cuts/zurichs-greco-says-nearly-halfway-to-2019-goal-to-cut-costs-nzz-idUSKBN1CC0GA

On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blanc-iran-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-threats-risk-a-u-s-break-with-europe-idUSKCN1C32E3

E’ quanto dice a Reuters una fonte vicina alla situazione.

Ieri, dice la fonte, “è stata inviata alle banche creditrici la proposta di ristrutturazione del debito”. Il piano prevede un prestito di 15 milioni di euro erogato da D.E. Shaw, investitore Usa con oltre 43 miliardi di dollari in gestione.

La proposta inviata alle banche (UniCredit, Intesa Sanpaolo, Ubi e Credito Valtellinese), secondo la fonte, contempla una separazione della parte immobiliare da quella operativa. Si passerebbe attraverso la procedura fallimentare, probabilmente ricorrendo all‘articolo 182 bis. La famiglia, scegliendo questa strada, resterebbe alla guida.

La risposta degli istituti di credito è attesa “nei prossimi giorni”. Resta in campo, però, l‘ipotesi che le banche optino per conferire il debito a DeA Corporate Credit Recovery (DeA Ccr), fondo gestito da IDeA Capital Funds Sgr che si occupa di operazioni di turnaround. Questa seconda strada comporterebbe un ingresso del fondo nel capitale e, presumibilmente, la presa di possesso delle leve operative.

Con sede a San Fermo della Battaglia (Como), Canepa è gravata da un indebitamento vicino ai 90 milioni, maturato in occasione del family buyout che nel 2008 fa ha portato Elisabetta Canepa e i due figli a controllare il 100% della società. Il fatturato attuale si aggira attorno ai 90 milioni e l‘ebitda è sceso a circa 4 milioni.

Cominciato nel marzo scorso, con la raccolta delle manifestazioni d‘interesse (si sono fatti avanti, tra gli altri, Tages, Vam Investments, Oxy Capital e QuattroR), il percorso di ristrutturazione/risanamento ha incontrato diversi ostacoli, col risultato che l‘azienda, sebbene sana dal punto di vista industriale, è entrata in una spirale fatta di difficoltà a pagare i fornitori e clienti che si allontanano.

AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish army reconnaissance team scouted out Syria’s Idlib province on Sunday, a senior Syrian rebel said, before an expected military operation to impose peace in the bitterly contested Syrian northwest.

“When we don’t go to Syria, Syria comes to us,” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party. “If we didn’t take our measures, bombs would fall on our cities.”

Turkey says it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed, aiming to implement a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area, the most populous pocket of Syria still in rebel hands.

Although Turkish officials say they are helping the rebels from within Turkey, in past interventions they have also sent troops across the frontier.

Any incursion could bring them into conflict with powerful jihadists from al Qaeda’s former Syrian branch, although there were signs on Sunday that they were working to avoid a confrontation.

Local sources said the Turkish military vehicles were escorted into Idlib by a convoy of fighters from the group, which has joined a jihadist alliance called Tahrir al-Sham and disavowed links to the network founded by Osama bin Laden.

Nonetheless, the jihadists and the Turkish military earlier exchanged fire nearby, underscoring the tension as Turkey builds up its forces and the rebel groups it backs prepare to enter Idlib.

“We will never allow a terror corridor that begins in Afrin and goes to the Mediterranean,” Erdogan said, referring to the stretch of Turkey’s southern border which is controlled on the Syrian side by Kurdish fighters and Tahrir al-Sham.

Turkey has been one of the biggest supporters of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the six-and-a-half-year war, but its focus has moved from ousting him to securing its own border against jihadist and Kurdish groups.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim stressed the importance of ensuring de-escalation near the border, following an agreement reached in Astana, Kazakhstan last month that was backed both by the Turks and by Russia, which supports Assad.

“We will ensure safety in Idlib, and will cooperate with Russia,” Yildirim said.

Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former Nusra Front, which was al Qaeda’s Syrian branch until last year when it changed its name and broke allegiance to the global network, has been a formidable military force since early in the conflict.

Since early this year it has battled other rebel groups as it tried to gain control over areas including Idlib.

UNDER ESCORT

Idlib and neighboring parts of northwest Syria are now home to more than 2 million people, many of them refugees from other formerly rebel-held regions that fell to pro-government forces.

A local resident and another local rebel said they had seen Turkish military vehicles enter Idlib and then travel under Tahrir al-Sham escort along a road.

The senior Syrian rebel said the reconnaissance team went to Sheikh Barakat, a location that overlooks both rebel-held areas of Aleppo province, adjacent to Idlib, and the Kurdish-controlled area of Afrin.

Erdogan gave no details of the operation, but said it was going ahead “without problems at the moment”.

Turkey’s biggest security concern on the frontier is the Kurdish YPG militia, which as part of a U.S.-backed alliance is fighting against Islamic State in eastern Syria. Ankara regards the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey.

Mortars were fired from the area under YPG control near to the location where the Turkish reconnaissance team was operating, the senior rebel said.

“The Turkish team is on its way back. Its mission has been accomplished. They visited areas of disengagement and locations where the Turkish army would be positioned,” the rebel said.

Reuters witnesses, local people, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said earlier on Sunday the Turkish military and Tahrir al-Sham had clashed near the village of Kafr Lusin in Idlib.

Tahrir al-Sham began the exchange by firing on a Turkish bulldozer removing sections of a border wall and Turkish artillery returned fire, they said. The area was later quiet.

Rebel groups that will take part - drawn from the Euphrates Shield campaign that Turkey backed with armor and troops in another part of Syria to the east since last year - said on Saturday they expected the Idlib operation to start very soon.

Tahrir al-Sham said “the lions of jihad and martyrdom will be waiting to pounce” against any incursion into Idlib.

The Syrian Civil Defence, better known as the White Helmets rescue workers, said on its Twitter account that jets it believed to be from the Syrian military had struck a marketplace in Maarat al-Numan in Idlib on Sunday, killing at least six.",Turkish army surveys Syria's Idlib before deployment - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/turkish-army-surveys-syrias-idlib-before-deployment-sources-idUKKBN1CD07A

President Donald Trump has championed deregulation, saying it is needed to promote economic growth. In March he told auto workers, “We are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories.”

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others, said the EPA understated the costs of technologies needed to meet the 2025 requirements.

The Obama administration finalized rules in 2012 to double the fleetwide average fuel economy to 54.5 mpg by 2025, but the EPA revised it to 51.4 mpg based on a rising number of trucks. The EPA said that would result in a real world average of 36 mpg by 2025, because of credits automakers receive and differences in test procedures versus real-world driving.

Automakers earn credits by producing cars and trucks that exceed the requirements in a given year -- and can then apply credits to deficits in future years. They also earn credits for air conditioning improvements, building electric vehicles and other improvements that may not be captured in testing procedures.

Automakers said the Obama administration finding that the 2025 targets were achievable at reasonable cost was based on errors in modeling the impact of new technology and assumptions about fuel prices and sales trends that have proved wrong.

Global Automakers, a group representing Honda Motor Co (7267.T), Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and others, cited shifting consumer preferences for bigger vehicles as a problem.

“There is, simply put, a misalignment between the increasing stringency of the standards and the decreasing consumer demand for fuel efficiency,” the group said in comments filed late Thursday with the EPA.

The two auto groups said the EPA has agreed to develop a new modeling approach after they said a prior model “caused the agencies to overestimate the role that conventional technologies can play in achieving future” improvements.

An EPA spokesman declined to comment on its reconsideration, saying it would review all comments.

The risk for automakers is that California, the most populous U.S. state, will withdraw from a 2012 agreement to adhere to the national EPA standard if the current standards are weakened. California’s standards are followed by a dozen other states. Automakers have said it is vital to maintain one national regime for emissions regulation to avoid higher costs by having to meet two differing standards.

California on Friday said it would not budge.

“If the federal standards are relaxed despite the overwhelming body of evidence demonstrating they should continue as is, California will maintain its standards. Moreover, we will pursue all available legal remedies to overturn federal actions that are unsupported by the facts and law,” state officials said in a statement.

Environmental groups also oppose the decision to reopen the standards.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said “automakers can meet the current standards with known technologies at reasonable cost. ... Rolling them back, however, would increase pollution, raise costs for drivers, slow innovation and put jobs at risk.”","Automakers say U.S. fuel economy standards unrealistic, cite costs and consumers",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-automakers-emissions/automakers-say-u-s-fuel-economy-standards-unrealistic-cite-costs-and-consumers-idUSKBN1CB2UY?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Sunday that the United States was serving the interests of Islamic State by preventing the Syrian army and its allies advancing in some areas of eastern Syria.

American jets have this year targeted pro-government militias in eastern Syria that were advancing towards Washington’s local allies.

Nasrallah said the United States was delaying the Syrian military in its battle to retake territory from Islamic State.

“The American air force in some areas prevents the Syrian army and its allies from advancing in areas controlled by Islamic State,” said the leader of Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shi‘ite movement designated by Washington as a terrorist group.

“The Americans are working to hinder the battle against Islamic State,” he said in a speech, part of a commemoration for Hezbollah fighters killed in clashes against Islamic State.

His comments came after a senior U.S. official said President Donald Trump was considering putting sanctions on Iran for its support of Hezbollah, and as the U.S. Congress prepares to consider tighter sanctions on Hezbollah itself.

The battlefield situation in Syrian is complex, comprising both a civil war that pits Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government against rebels, as well as two separate campaigns against Islamic State.

The Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran and Shi‘ite militias including Hezbollah, has advanced against Islamic State in an offensive across the central Syrian desert in recent months.

The United States is meanwhile leading a rival international coalition against the Sunni jihadists that includes an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias.

Russia and the United States have put in place measures to prevent outright conflict between the two offensives against Islamic State, but there have been times when they fired on each other.

Security sources in Lebanon have said that Hezbollah has lost hundreds of fighters in Syria since it entered the conflict in support of Assad in 2013 against rebel groups.

If Spanish authorities hoped strong-arm tactics against the referendum independence for Catalonia would nip nationalist feeling in the bud, they will almost certainly be proved badly wrong. Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

“We are united in our grief, in our support for those who have suffered and united in our resolve to end such evil in our time,” Pence said, joining Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and other local leaders at a City Hall commemoration for victims of the shooting.

Participants trod seven miles (11 km) along four separate paths to the event amid tight security. President Donald Trump paid a visit to Las Vegas earlier in the week.

Las Vegas’ Democratic Congresswoman Dina Titus was the only speaker who touched on the subject of gun violence and politics, saying, “Let us also pray for those who have power that they will have the wisdom, the courage, and the resolve to find ways to end the gun violence that plagues our nation.”

The commemoration came as Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said investigators remain largely in the dark about what drove retired real estate investor and high-stakes gambler Stephen Paddock to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

“We have looked at everything, literally, to include the suspect’s personal life, any political affiliation, his social behaviors, economic situation, any potential radicalization,” McMahill told reporters late on Friday.

“We have been down each and every single one of these paths, trying to determine why, to determine who else may have known of these plans.”

McMahill said investigators had uncovered “no nexus” between Islamic State and Paddock, even though the militant group had repeatedly claimed responsibility for the attack.

A piece of paper found in Paddock’s room at the Mandalay Bay hotel appeared to calculate the distance and height from his window to help target victims below, the CBS News show “60 Minutes” said in a news release on Saturday ahead of a broadcast on Sunday of interviews with Clark County Sheriff’s officers, including one who said he saw the paper.

The Sheriff’s Office could not be immediately reached for comment.

Investigators have stressed that no suicide note had been found.

FBI APPEALS TO PUBLIC

In an unusual bid to cast a wider net for tips, the FBI and police have arranged with communications company Clear Channel to post billboards around Las Vegas urging citizens to come forward with any information that might help investigators.

The billboards will bear the slogan, “If you know something, say something,” and carry a toll-free number to an FBI hotline, said Aaron Rouse, special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office.

Paddock, 64, unleashed a torrent of gunfire onto an outdoor music festival from the windows of his 32nd-floor hotel suite overlooking the concert on Sunday night, then shot himself to death before police stormed his room.

In addition to the 58 people who died, nearly 500 were injured, some by gunfire and some trampled or otherwise hurt while running for cover.

Unlike so many other perpetrators of deadly mass shootings before him, Paddock left behind no suicide note, no manifesto, no recordings and no messages on social media pointing to his intent, according to police.

McMahill said investigators remained certain Paddock acted alone in the shooting. But police have said they suspect he had help before the killings, based on the large number of guns, ammunition and explosives found in the hotel suite, his home, his car and a second home searched in Reno.

Authorities have said that 12 of the weapons recovered from Paddock’s hotel suite were equipped with so-called bump-stock devices that enable semi-automatic rifles to be operated as if they were fully automatic machine-guns.

Paddock’s ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute over the course of his 10-minute shooting spree was a major factor in the high casualty count, police said.

The bloodshed might have lasted longer, with greater loss of life, but for a hotel security officer who was sent to check an open-door alarm on the 32nd floor, and discovered the gunman’s whereabouts after the shooting started, McMahill said.

The security officer, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman strafed the hallway with gunfire from behind his door, apparently having detected Campos via surveillance cameras Paddock set up outside his hotel suite.

Campos, though wounded, alerted the hotel’s dispatch, “which was absolutely critical to us knowing the location as well as advising the responding officers as they arrived on that 32nd floor,” McMahill said. “He’s an absolute hero.”

In a new disclosure, authorities said two bullets Paddock fired struck a large jet fuel storage tank at the edge of the city’s main airport, about a block from the concert grounds, indicating an apparent attempt by the gunman to create even greater havoc.

There was no explosion or fire from the two rounds, one of which penetrated the tank, as jet fuel in storage is almost impossible to ignite with gunshots, airport officials said on Friday.

Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, 62, was questioned by the FBI on Wednesday and said in a statement she never had any inkling of Paddock’s plans.

Danley, who returned late on Tuesday from a family visit to the Philippines, is regarded by investigators as a “person of interest.” The Australian citizen of Filipino heritage is cooperating fully with authorities, her lawyer said.",Pence offers solace as Las Vegas police puzzle over shooter's motive,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lasvegas-shooting/las-vegas-gunman-stockpiled-weapons-over-decades-planned-attack-idUSKBN1CA0X6

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Last month, Trump sided with Democrats in a surprising debt limit deal that blindsided Republicans and left conservative groups aghast.
A Democratic aide said the Trump administration would have to abandon such efforts before it could reach a healthcare deal with Republicans.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would be open to cutting a one-year or two-year deal with Democratic rivals as a way to kick-start reform of the nation’s healthcare system, a key campaign pledge made by Trump and the Republican Party.

Republicans fell short several times this year in their drive to repeal former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic legislation, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a promise the party has campaigned on for seven years.

Trump has been frustrated by the failure, openly taunting Republicans as “total quitters” and “fools” this summer over their inability in the Senate to replace Obamacare.

“If we made a temporary deal, I think it would be a great thing for people, but it’s really up to them (Democrats),” Trump told reporters at the White House.

“So if we could do a one-year deal or two-year deal as a temporary measure, you’ll have block granting ultimately to the states, which is what Republicans want,” Trump said.

Earlier on Saturday Trump said he had called Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to gauge interest in working on what he called a “great” healthcare bill to replace Obamacare.

“I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill,” Trump wrote on Twitter earlier on Saturday. “ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!”

Axios first reported Trump’s call to Schumer on Friday.

Schumer said Trump had told him during the phone call on Friday that he wanted to try again to repeal and replace Obamacare.

“I told the president that’s off the table,” Schumer said in a statement. “If he wants to work together to improve the existing health care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions.”

Schumer pointed to bipartisan efforts by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray to repair Obamacare as “a good place to start.”

Alexander pulled out of the talks last month as a new Republican bill to repeal Obamacare gained momentum. After that bill collapsed, Alexander said he would again consult with Murray.

Although Democrats have been mostly united against Trump’s agenda, there is a precedent for a bipartisan deal. Last month, Trump sided with Democrats in a surprising debt limit deal that blindsided Republicans and left conservative groups aghast.

But there are still wide policy differences between Democrats and Trump. His administration on Friday undermined requirements under Obamacare that employers provide insurance to cover women’s birth control.

A new rule will allow businesses or non-profit organizations to lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide contraceptives coverage in health insurance with no co-payment.

A Democratic aide said the Trump administration would have to abandon such efforts before it could reach a healthcare deal with Republicans.

“Particularly after the birth control decision yesterday, the administration has to stop sabotaging the law before anything real can happen,” the aide said on condition of anonymity.",Trump says open to temporary healthcare reform deal with Democrats,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-trump-deal/trump-says-open-to-temporary-healthcare-reform-deal-with-democrats-idUSKBN1CC0S9

BEIJING (Reuters) - China has denied responsibility for alleged cyberattacks in the United States appearing to target exiled tycoon Guo Wengui, who has leveled corruption allegations against senior Communist Party officials and applied for political asylum.

In a statement provided to Reuters on Sunday, the Ministry of Public Security said an investigation had found “no evidence” of Chinese government involvement in the alleged cyberattacks.

The law enforcement agency said China had also provided the United States government with evidence that Guo, who has applied for political asylum in the United States, fabricated documents used to support his claims. It said China would make an official request for U.S. authorities to investigate the matter.

“The falsified official documents and the false information he fabricated are sensational and outrageous,” the ministry said in a rare English-language statement.

Guo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Washington-based Hudson Institute think-tank was scheduled to host Guo last Wednesday in a rare public appearance, but canceled the event the day before without explanation.

The event would have coincided with the visit of an official Chinese delegation to the U.S. capital for a high-level law enforcement and cybersecurity dialogue between the two countries.

The Hudson Institute said it had detected a Shanghai-based attack aimed at shutting down access to its website several days earlier.

The suspected attack prompted a complaint from U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a meeting with China’s Public Security Minister Guo Shengkun on Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The New York-based Guo applied for U.S. political asylum in September, but said this week the law firm representing him, Clark Hill PLC, had backed out after being targeted by Chinese hackers.

Clark Hill lawyer Thomas Ragland, who lodged the asylum claim, confirmed he was no longer representing Guo, without elaborating.

After his Hudson event was called off, Guo held a news conference at the National Press Club on Thursday where he produced what he claimed were “top-secret” official documents showing China had sent secret agents into the United States.

China’s Ministry of Public Security said the documents shown by Guo were “clumsily forged” and “full of obvious mistakes”.

Guo has made wideranging corruption allegations against senior Communist Party leaders via a daily stream of Twitter and YouTube posts since the start of the year, which he says are aimed at disrupting a key five-yearly Communist Party congress which begins next week.

The Chinese government has been seeking to discredit Guo, who is the subject of an Interpol red notice issued at Beijing’s request, as a criminal suspect who should not be trusted.",China denies links to alleged cyberattacks in United States targeting exiled tycoon Guo,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-corruption-tycoon/china-denies-links-to-alleged-cyberattacks-in-united-states-targeting-exiled-tycoon-guo-idINKBN1CD0AY

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Catalonia’s capital Barcelona on Sunday to express their opposition to any declaration of independence from Spain, showing how divided the region is on the issue.

The protesters rallied in central Barcelona, waving Spanish and Catalan flags and banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”, as politicians on both sides hardened their positions in the country’s worst political crisis for decades.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Saturday he would not rule out removing Catalonia’s government and calling a fresh local election if it claimed independence, as well as suspending the region’s existing autonomous status.

The stark warning came days before Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the region’s parliament, on Tuesday, when he could unilaterally declare independence.

“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said as she rallied in Barcelona. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.”

The wealthy northeastern region of 7.5 million people, which has its own language and culture, held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 in defiance of a Spanish court ban.

More than 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who voted backed secession, according to Catalan officials. But that turnout represented only 43 percent of the region’s 5.3 million eligible voters as many opponents of independence stayed away.

The Spanish government sent thousands of national police into the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers fired rubber bullets and charged crowds with truncheons in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and dramatically escalated the dispute.

Losing Catalonia is almost unthinkable for the Spanish government.

It would deprive Spain of about 16 percent of its people, a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. Catalonia is also the top destination for foreign tourists, attracting about a quarter of Spain’s total.

The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia. Concern is growing in EU capitals about the impact of the crisis on the Spanish economy, the fourth largest in the euro zone, and on possible spillovers to other economies.

Some European officials are also worried that any softening in Spain’s stance towards Catalan independence could fuel secessionist feelings among other groups in Europe such as Belgium’s Flemings and Italy’s Lombards.

‘DRASTIC SOLUTIONS’

The demonstration in Barcelona was organised by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society under the slogan “Let’s recover our senses” to mobilise what it believes is a “silent majority” of citizens in Catalonia who oppose independence.

“The people who have come to demonstrate don’t feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”

It was a second day of protests after tens of thousands of people gathered in 50 cities across Spain on Saturday, some defending Spain’s national unity and others dressed in white and calling for talks to defuse the crisis.

Until this weekend, Rajoy has remained vague on whether he would use article 155 of the constitution, the so-called nuclear option which enables him to sack the regional government and call a local election.

Asked if he was ready to trigger article 155, Rajoy told El Pais newspaper: “I don’t rule out anything that is within the law ... Ideally, we shouldn’t have to take drastic solutions but for that not to happen there would have to be changes.”

The conservative prime minister ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said he is open to - and said the issue would not force a snap national election.

Rajoy added the government would “prevent any declaration of independence from materialising in anything”.

“Spain will continue being Spain,” he said.

Nicola Sturgeon, the pro-independence leader of Scotland, which voted to remain part of the United Kingdom in a 2014 referendum, said: “Everyone has to accept reality, this will not be resolved by both sides going to extreme positions.”

“You can’t simply say in a democracy there is no legal or legitimate way for people to decide their own future, that would be an absurd position,” she added.",Thousands protest in Barcelona against Catalan independence,https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia/thousands-protest-in-barcelona-against-catalan-independence-idINKBN1CD0FG

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump aimed his Twitter account at sometime ally Senator Bob Corker on Sunday with a series of derisive posts blaming the Republican for the Iran nuclear deal and saying Corker wanted the secretary of state job.Corker, who announced his retirement from the Senate last month, responded to Trump with a sarcastic Twitter post of his own.

The senator from Tennessee had been considered by Trump for the secretary of state position in the months after Trump’s Nov. 8 election win. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been more critical of Trump in recent months, including over the handling of a white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August.

”Senator Bob Corker “begged” me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said “NO” and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement),“ Trump wrote. ”He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said “NO THANKS.” He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!

“Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn’t have the guts to run!”

Corker, whose retirement is a blow to the Republican Party struggling to balance divisions between mainstream and more populist wings, said in his tweet on Sunday: “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.”

Trump has long criticized the 2015 international nuclear pact, a signature foreign policy achievement of former President Barack Obama in which Iran agreed to reduce its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions.

Last week, asked about reported tensions between Trump and the person he eventually chose to be secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, Corker’s response was seen as a jab at Trump.

“I think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary [of Defense James] Mattis, and Chief of Staff [John] Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos,” Corker said, referring to Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly.

Corker also said Tillerson was “in an incredibly frustrating place” where he “ends up not being supported in the way that I hope a secretary of state would be supported,” according to media reports.

Sunday was not the first time Trump has tweeted about Corker and his apparent waffling about whether or not he should seek another Senate term.

In August, Trump said Corker was “constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in ‘18.”

That was after the senator’s remarks on Trump’s response to the Charlottesville demonstration. Corker said, “The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.”","Trump tweets more criticism of former ally, Republican senator Corker",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-corker/trump-tweets-more-criticism-of-former-ally-republican-senator-corker-idUKKBN1CD0OU?il=0

SAN JOSÉ, COSTA RICA, 7 oct (Reuters) - La selección de fútbol de Costa Rica clasificó el sábado al Mundial de Rusia 2018 tras empatar en tiempo de descuento ante Honduras por 1-1 en la novena y penúltima jornada de la eliminatoria de la Concacaf.

La selección “tica” llegó a 16 puntos para asegurarse el segundo lugar del hexagonal final, por abajo de México que marcha invicto con 21 unidades. La Concacaf da tres pases directos a la Copa del Mundo, mientras que el cuarto clasificado disputará su pase ante una selección de Asia.

Estados Unidos se ubica en el tercer lugar con 12 puntos, Panamá y Honduras con 10, y Trinidad y Tobago con tres.

“Es mi mejor día, estar al frente de la selección es una responsabilidad muy grande, pesada y se le cumplió al país. Ahora falta cumplir en el Mundial, repetir lo de Brasil 2014 y hasta mejorarlo”, dijo Óscar Ramírez, director técnico de Costa Rica.

En la Copa del Mundo del 2014, Costa Rica llegó por primera vez en su historia a los cuartos de final.

Costa Rica logró su boleto a Rusia a los 95 minutos del partido disputado en el estadio Nacional de San José cuando el defensor Kendall Waston remató en el área un centro enviado por el capitán Bryan Ruiz.

Eddie Hernández había adelantado a Honduras a los 66 minutos cuando remató con la cabeza un centro enviado por Romell Quioto desde el sector izquierdo, donde superó a dos defensores por velocidad.

El partido debía jugarse el viernes, pero fue aplazado por la tormenta tropical Nate que dejó más 30 fallecidos y miles de damnificados tras su paso por Centroamérica.

“Sabe sabroso, no me importa el minuto en que cayó el gol, la cosa es que estamos en el Mundial. Me volví loco y exploté”, dijo Waston.

En la última jornada, Honduras tratará de quedarse con el último cupo directo cuando reciba el martes a México, mientras que Costa Rica visitará a Panamá, que también buscará el boleto directo.

“Indudablemente estamos golpeados, inmensamente tristes porque es uno de los mejores partidos que ha jugado Honduras conmigo. Las opciones de Honduras son ganarle a México como sea y que Costa Rica haga un buen partido en Panamá, que defienda su dignidad”, dijo el costarricense Jorge Luis Pinto, director técnico de Honduras.

El viernes, Estados Unidos, que registraba tres partidos consecutivos sin ganar en la eliminatoria, dio un gran paso hacia el Mundial al golear por 4-0 a Panamá.

En la última jornada, los estadounidenses visitarán a la eliminada Trinidad y Tobago.

(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

The attack took place near the city of Beni and, if the deaths are confirmed, would be the first mass-killing this year in that area. It has seen relative peace since more than 800 people were killed in dozens of massacres between 2014 and 2016.

The spate of attacks raised serious questions about the state’s ability to impose order over a region full of ethnic tensions and plagued by pockets of lawlessness where armed groups prey on populations and exploit rich mineral reserves.

In the latest attack, on Saturday, assailants armed with machetes and guns ambushed travelers on the main road linking Beni territory in North Kivu province to neighboring Uganda, Boris Maelezo, a member of parliament from the area, told Reuters.

He said about 30 civilians were riding on motorbikes, with several people on each vehicle, and that most of them could have been killed.

Albert Baliesima Kadukima, another lawmaker from the area, said two women freed by the militants had told local authorities the assailants had slit the throats of more than a dozen people.

Mak Hazukay, a local army spokesman, said Congolese forces were battling the militants and attempting to dislodge them from a section of the road that was several kilometers long.

The two lawmakers and the army spokesman said the militants belonged to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active near the border between Congo and Uganda.

Congolese authorities have blamed almost all the massacres of the past three years on the ADF but independent and U.N. experts say several armed groups as well as national army commanders have orchestrated the killings as they vie for influence in the area.

Eastern Congo is a tinderbox of ethnic tensions and has been racked by conflict for more than two decades. It is the world’s biggest source of coltan, used in mobile phones and other electronic products.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani defended the nuclear deal with Western powers Saturday and said that U.S. President Donald Trump could not undermine it.

Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions.

However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel.

“In the nuclear negotiations and agreement we reached issues and benefits that are not reversible. No one can turn that back, not Mr. Trump or anyone else,” Rouhani said at a ceremony at Tehran University marking the start of the university academic year, according to state media.

“Even if 10 other Trumps are created in the world, these are not reversible.”

Trump, who has called the pact an “embarrassment” and “the worst deal ever negotiated”, has been weighing whether the deal serves U.S. security interests as he faces the Oct. 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with its terms.

The prospect of Washington reneging on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis, North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile development.

If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. U.N. inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms.

Rouhani said Saturday that if the United States violated the deal then it would hurt its own reputation in the international community.

“If America carries out any violations today, the whole world will condemn America. They will not condemn Iran,” Rouhani said, according to state media. “Then they will say why did you trust America and sign an agreement with them?”

Separately, former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami has been forbidden from attending “public political, cultural and promotional ceremonies”, for a period of three months, two of his lawyers told the Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA) on Saturday.

Khatami has long been a lightning rod of criticism for hardliners who accuse him of fomenting unrest in the protests that followed the disputed election of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009. Local media are forbidden from quoting Khatami in articles or publishing his image.

The new restrictions were issued by Iranian security forces, Khatami’s lawyers told ILNA, and there does not appear to be any judicial mechanism to dispute the restrictions.

In the lead-up to the presidential election last May, Khatami posted a message online encouraging his supporters to vote for Rouhani.

Rouhani made a reference to the new restrictions placed on Khatami during his speech Saturday but did not name him.

“If anybody repeats that people should come to the ballot box, they should be punished?” he said, according to ILNA.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo

LONDON (Reuters) - When Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund’s no-nonsense boss, spoke to Harvard University this past week, she had some good news: nearly 75 percent of the world is experiencing an economic upswing.

Why, then, was her speech given the somewhat bearish title “A Time to Repair the Roof”?

One reason is that the IMF has to worry about everyone, not just those who are doing well. If nearly 75 percent of world economies are growing, more than 25 percent are not.

Some of the strugglers - not for the first time - can be found in Africa, where the two biggest economies, Nigeria and South Africa have only just crawled out of recession and could still be teetering.

The IMF’s last outlook for the sub-Sahara region suggests 2017 growth of 2.6 percent - around a full percentage below that for the world as a whole and less than half the 1999-2008 average of 5.6 percent.

“The recovery is not complete,” Lagarde told the Harvard audience. “Some countries are growing too slowly, and last year 47 countries experienced negative GDP growth per capita.”

This brings up a second reason for Lagarde’s tempered celebration of recovery - inequality.

There is no question that the gap between countries has been narrowing, as Lagarde told the Harvard glitterati. China, Brazil and India, for example, are now major economic players. But within economies themselves there are many left behind.

Most of these are the “bottom billion” described by economist Paul Collier in his 2007 book of the same name - people completely untethered to the global economy and any wealth it might bring.

But others in advanced economies - though relatively less poor - are now railing against being left behind. They range from Britain’s public servants to primary school teachers in the Netherlands and nurses in parts of Australia.

The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, and the rise -- albeit modest -- of the far right in Germany are all widely viewed as reflecting disaffection brought on by the unequal share of the global economy’s spoils.

Hence, Lagarde’s focus on what needs to be done right now: rich countries should spend more, central banks should communicate more clearly and public debt needs to be brought under control.

It also explains the title of her address, a riff on John F. Kennedy’s comment: “Pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery... the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.”

EUROPE‘S PROBLEM

It is not unrelated that the euro zone - barreling along a surprisingly smooth growth path - finds itself facing two potentially destructive threats.

The first is the possibility in the coming week that Catalonian separatists will declare unilateral independence from Spain.

Setting aside the politics, such a move could strip nearly 20 percent off Spanish GDP - a bit like California and Florida together cutting loose from the United States.

How the European Union would handle such a things would simply add to its Brexit headache. Rump Spain would retain its place in the top four of euro zone economies, but much diminished.

The second hit would come if eurosceptics - some of who want to leave the euro zone -- gain power in Italy at an election that must take place next year.

Germany’s economy is steaming ahead - latest data: industrial orders soaring in August - and in France, the official statistics agency has raised its 2017 growth outlook to the highest since 2011.

But they cannot carry the load alone, one reason, perhaps for the European Central Bank’s softly-slowly approach to pulling back stimulus.","Message from the IMF bridge: full speed ahead, mind the inequality",https://www.reuters.com/article/global-economy-outlook/global-economy-message-from-the-imf-bridge-full-speed-ahead-mind-the-inequality-idINKBN1CB1KW

Trump dijo en junio que volverá a endurecer las sanciones sobre Cuba y buscará un acuerdo mejor en lugar de la distensión gradual lograda por su predecesor, Barack Obama.

The warning came after the White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump would announce new U.S. responses to Iran’s missile tests, support for “terrorism” and cyber operations as part of his new Iran strategy.

“As we’ve announced in the past, if America’s new law for sanctions is passed, this country will have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km range of Iran’s missiles,” Guards’ commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, according to state media.

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the United States, according to state media, and issued a stark warning to American troops.

“If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world particularly in the Middle East,” Jafari said.

The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are Iran’s most powerful internal and external security force. The Quds Force, the IRGC’s foreign espionage and paramilitary wing, and individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are on the US list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

Iran sees the Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State as an existential threat to the Islamic Republic where the majority of the population are Shi‘ites.

On June 7, Islamic State claimed an attack on Tehran’s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, killing 18 people. The Guards fired missiles at Islamic State bases in Syria on June 18 in response.

Guards commanders have framed their military involvement in Iraq and Syria, where they are fighting to support the government of President Bashar al-Assad, as a fight against Islamic State.

Dozens of members of the Guards, including senior commanders, have been killed in Syria and Iraq.

MISSILE PROGRAM

The website for state TV reported Jafari as adding that the United States was mistaken if it thought it could pressure Iran into negotiating on regional issues.

Jafari also said that Tehran would ramp up its defense capabilities, including its missile program, if the U.S. undermined a nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers.

Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions.

However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel.

“The Americans should know that the Trump government’s stupid behavior with the nuclear deal will be used by the Islamic Republic as an opportunity to move ahead with its missile, regional and conventional defense program,” Jafari said, according to state media.

The prospect of Washington backtracking on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis in the shape of North Korea.

If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. U.N. inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms.

(Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi as the fourth hurricane to hit the United States this year, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages.

As the storm moved northeast into Alabama, Nate’s maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour), prompting the National Hurricane Center to end its tropical storm warnings for the region. The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.

“We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters, saying there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage.

The fourth major storm to strike the United States in less than two months, Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.

Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.

The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the National Hurricane Center said. Heavy rainfall and storm surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.

Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.

Flood waters swept over streets in communities across Alabama and Mississippi, including over Highway 90 and to oceanside casinos in Biloxi, according to reports on social media.

Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.

“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”

Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.

“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

On Saturday, states of emergency were declared in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as in more than two dozen Florida counties. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned of tornadoes springing up in the Pandhandle region.

In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey urged residents in areas facing heavy winds and storm surges to take precautions. U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.

About 47,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, while more than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.

Utility Alabama Power said some 82,000 customers were without electricity.

Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches, were expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the NHC said.

NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu lifted a curfew on Saturday evening that was originally scheduled to last until Sunday morning. He said in a statement on social media however, that there was still a serious threat of storm surge outside levee areas.

Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Plaquemines Parish President Amos Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.

The ports of New Orleans in Louisiana and Mobile in Alabama remained closed, and refineries and port authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were reviewing when they could reopen.

The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.

Workers were evacuated from 301 platforms and 13 rigs as of Saturday, said the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.","Hurricane Nate weakens as it soaks Mississippi, Alabama",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-nate/tropical-storm-nate-forms-near-nicaraguan-coast-idUSKBN1CA1DD

But an administrator is not among them - nobody has been nominated to the top job since President Donald Trump took office.

Also missing from the roughly 550 people on the payroll of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, are a permanent chief counsel, director for government affairs, chief financial officer and enforcement chief.

While a deputy administrator was appointed last week, slow progress in bringing in senior politically appointed officials has nearly frozen key decision-making at the agency, according to five former NHTSA officials, consumer groups, lawmakers and some business leaders.

They said that without leadership in place NHTSA has either pushed back or failed to act on rules setting new standards for improving how buses fare in rollover crashes, a system to remind passengers in rear seats to wear seat belts, and new tire standards.

Eight months into Trump’s presidency, senior positions in many government agencies across Washington remain vacant, including roles at the State Department, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and throughout the Transportation Department that oversees NHTSA.

Some of the vacancies are the result of Trump’s efforts to slim down the federal bureaucracy. Others are simply waiting to be filled.

The White House blames Democrats for dragging out the confirmation process for its nominees, and says vetting picks has been more complicated than usual because many come from the business world rather than government.

While many companies applaud Trump’s moves to roll back federal bureaucracy, some also complain that delays in bringing aboard political appointees is hindering government decisions that could impact business.

The frustration extends to some U.S. diplomats, private-sector lawyers and others who regularly deal with government agencies, according to interviews.

‘IN A STALL’

In September, the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association urged Trump in a letter to accelerate his efforts to nominate a NHTSA administrator so the agency can comply with a 2015 road safety law passed by Congress.

The law ordered NHTSA to write regulations setting minimum tire standards for fuel efficiency and traction in wet conditions and create an online database for consumers to check for tire recalls.

U.S. manufacturers and consumer groups support the regulations, drawn up in response to vehicle deaths linked to faulty tires, because they will raise standards and make the U.S. market less accessible to poorly made versions.

“We don’t want the U.S. to be kind of the dumping group for the really low technology because there isn’t a standard to meet,” said Dan Zielinski, the association’s senior vice president.

Two former NHTSA leaders and consumer groups say the agency is also moving slowly on other regulatory issues, such as improving side impact standards.

“This agency is in a stall ... They are not going to do very much without political leadership,” said Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator under President Jimmy Carter and a prominent consumer advocate.

NHTSA said in a statement Friday that safety is its top priority. The agency is “committed to meeting all obligations as required” by the 2015 law. NHTSA has an ongoing review of all regulatory actions as part of an administration-wide effort.

A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on NHTSA but said “capable and professional staff” are filling essential positions throughout the government on an acting basis until confirmations go through.

Leadership shortages extend beyond the NHTSA. The White House had by Oct. 4 nominated 387 political appointees for civilian positions in the executive branch and 160 have been confirmed by the U.S. Senate, according to the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service.

Both numbers were well below those in the first eight months under at least the last four presidents. In the same period of Barack Obama’s presidency, 497 candidates were nominated and 337 confirmed.

One senior administration official said it aims to have all top positions - those at the level of assistant secretary and above - nominated by year’s end.

Still, some political appointee jobs are expected to stay empty, the White House spokeswoman said. “The federal government has grown unrestrained for decades because politicians have been too afraid to ‘drain the swamp’,” she said.

‘BEHIND THE CURVE’

In many cases, dire warnings from opponents that Trump’s delays in putting forward political nominations for approval would cause chaos have proven overblown.

But there are examples of government slowing down because mid-level employees do not have the authority or are unwilling to make decisions.

At the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which analyzes proposed transactions to ensure they do not harm national security, private-sector lawyers complain of slow decisions on big deals.

“There is an unwillingness for the staff people to make a decision,” said Michael Gershberg, a trade and investment attorney with Fried Frank.

A lobbyist who works on CFIUS deals said some companies have had to refile proposals because CFIUS failed to reach a decision within 75 days. That drives up legal and financing fees and creates uncertainty about the deal. Deals that have been refiled include a bid by Jack Ma’s Ant Financial to buy MoneyGram (MGI.O) and Zhongwang USA’s $2.33 billion bid for Aleris Corp (ALSD.PK).

The Senate last week confirmed Heath Tarbert, who is expected to oversee CFIUS, as an assistant secretary of the Treasury.

At the State Department, only six of the top 40 jobs have been filled, and no confirmed officials are in place to run regional bureaus that handle foreign relations. Instead, they are in the hands of career diplomats with limited authority.

The United States does not have an ambassador in place in such key allied countries as South Korea, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

”We’re pretty much frozen in amber here,” one official said.

A congressional aide said it was hard to determine the precise impact of the vacancies.

But he added that U.S. policy in the North Korea missiles crisis would likely be helped by an ambassador in Seoul, a fully empowered assistant secretary of state for East Asia and an active special envoy for North Korea.

“That’s just one example in the region with the most prominent national security crisis, and really one of the most serious in a long time,” he said.

Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, testifying in Congress on Sept. 26, addressed the slow pace of filling posts.

”We’re behind the curve. We should be ahead of the curve. And we’re doing all we can to catch up,” he said. “Our work is getting done. It would be better done if we had those positions filled.”",Help wanted: Staff shortages under Trump slow policy changes,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-staff/help-wanted-staff-shortages-under-trump-slow-policy-changes-idUSKBN1CB1AL?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Catalonia’s capital Barcelona on Sunday to express their opposition to declaring independence from Spain, showing how divided the region is on the issue.

A crowd estimated by local police to number 350,000 waved Spanish and Catalan flags and carried banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”. They poured into the city center after politicians on both sides hardened their positions in the country’s worst political crisis for decades.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Saturday he would not rule out removing Catalonia’s government and calling a fresh local election if it claimed independence, as well as suspending the wealthy region’s existing autonomous status.

The stark warning came days before Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the region’s parliament, on Tuesday, when he could unilaterally declare independence.

The anti-independence demonstration, which included Catalans and people from other parts of Spain, underlined how the dispute has riven the region itself, coming less than a month after a million people rallied in the same city to support independence.

“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said during Sunday’s rally. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.”

The northeastern region of 7.5 million people, which has its own language and culture, held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 in defiance of a Spanish court ban.

More than 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who voted backed secession, according to Catalan officials. But that turnout represented only 43 percent of the region’s 5.3 million eligible voters as many opponents of independence stayed away.

The Spanish government sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers fired rubber bullets and charged crowds with truncheons in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and dramatically escalated the dispute.

CATALONIA‘S IMPORTANCE

Losing Catalonia is almost unthinkable for the Spanish government.

It would deprive Spain of about 16 percent of its people, a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. Catalonia is also the top destination for foreign tourists, attracting about a quarter of Spain’s total.

There is widespread opposition to a Catalan breakaway among people in the rest of the country.

The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia. The board of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis will meet on Monday to discuss moving its head office elsewhere in Spain, a source familiar with the matter said.

Concern is growing in EU capitals about the impact of the crisis on the Spanish economy, the fourth largest in the euro zone, and on possible spillovers to other economies.

Some European officials are also worried that any softening in Spain’s stance towards Catalan independence could fuel secessionist feelings among other groups in Europe such as Belgium’s Flemings and Italy’s Lombards.

‘DRASTIC SOLUTIONS’

Until this weekend, Rajoy has remained vague on whether he would take the unprecedented step of triggering Article 155 of the constitution, the so-called nuclear option which enables him to sack the regional government and call a local election.

However, asked if he was ready to do so, Rajoy told El Pais newspaper on Saturday: “I don’t rule out anything that is within the law ... Ideally, we shouldn’t have to take drastic solutions but for that not to happen there would have to be changes.”

Rajoy also said he planned to leave in Catalonia the 4,000 national police the government had shipped in for the referendum, until the crisis was over.

He ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said he is open to - and added the issue would not force a snap national election.

Sunday’s demonstration in Barcelona was organized by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society to mobilizes what it believes is a “silent majority” of citizens in Catalonia who oppose independence.

“The people who have come to demonstrate don’t feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”

The rally was addressed by Nobel prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who has dual Spanish and Peruvian nationality. He told reporters it showed many Catalans “don’t want the coup d‘etat the Catalan government is fostering”.

Despite well-lit shots of steak and dessert, and with a father-son bonding story thrown in, it was never sweet enough to work.

But given new India’s obsession with food and eating out, this might have been a good remake, if only director Raja Krishna Menon hadn’t forgotten to add the spice. The Hindi “Chef” is as one-toned and as predictable as the original. For a film that purports to be about food, there is little more than a passing interest demonstrated.

Instead, the focus is on Roshan Kalra, a chef who is fired from his job in an Indian restaurant after he punches a customer (something Saif Ali Khan was accused of doing in real life). Roshan returns home to India from New York to see his pre-teen son Armaan (Svar Kamble) and ex-wife Radha (Padmapriya), who live in a picturesque, old-world bungalow in Kochi. There, Roshan re-discovers his relationship with his son and with food.

When Biju (Milind Soman), Radha’s friend, offers him a chance to overhaul an old double-decker bus and start running a restaurant, he reluctantly takes up the offer. A former colleague from New York joins him, and it turns into one merry road trip across India, serving “fusion” Indian food along the way. Alas, this fusion food, like much else in the film, is boring. Take, for example, the “rotzaa”, or a pizza fashioned out of that staple Indian flatbread, the roti - something a thousand Indian restaurants have on their menus.

Handout photo

This “rotzaa” is symptomatic of the approach “Chef” takes – it makes no attempt transcend or improve on the original film. For someone with a Michelin star, Roshan seems to have just one kind of pasta dish and the “rotzaa” in his repertoire. The film is full of food clichés like “chhole bhature” from Delhi and “puttu” (steamed rice noodles) from Kerala, and full of relationship clichés like the father bonding with the son.

To their credit, Saif Ali Khan and debutant Svar Kamble are comfortable in their characters. But Roshan’s relationship with his ex-wife is handled haphazardly. Biju is first shown as a threat, then disappears completely, and Radha flits in and out of the screenplay like she isn’t sure how she fits.

New rules from the Department of Health and Human Services will let businesses or non-profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide contraceptives coverage in health insurance with no co-payment.

Conservative Christian activists and congressional Republicans praised the move, while reproductive rights advocates and Democrats criticized it. It was unclear how many employers would actually drop birth control coverage on religious grounds, and there were significant doubts that many big ones would.

Within hours, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the administration in federal court in San Francisco to try to halt the rule, claiming among other things that it violated the U.S. Constitution’s requirement for separation of church and state.

The states of Massachusetts and California also sued, and Democratic state attorneys general in another 16 states threatened legal action.

“This is a landmark day for religious liberty. Under the Obama administration, this constitutional right was seriously eroded,” Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said.

“The Trump administration just took direct aim at birth control coverage for 62 million women,” Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said.

“With this rule in place, any employer could decide that their employees no longer have health insurance coverage for birth control,” Richards added.

Trump, who criticized the birth control mandate in last year’s election campaign, won strong support from conservative Christian voters. The Republican president signed an executive order in May asking for rules that would allow faith-based groups to deny insurance coverage for services they oppose on religious grounds.

The contraception mandate was implemented as part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement. Trump and Republicans in Congress campaigned against Obamacare, as the law is known, but could not get enough votes to repeal it as they had promised.

In its reasoning for the move, the administration said among other things that mandating birth control coverage could foster “risky sexual behavior” among teens and young adults. It overturned the Obama administration’s view that the birth control requirement was necessary to meet the government’s “compelling interest” to protect women’s health.

“This administration’s contempt for women reaches a new low with this appalling decision,” top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi said.

The administration broadened narrow existing religious exemptions to include an exception “on the basis of moral conviction” for non-profit and for-profit companies.

Federal rules implemented under Obamacare required employers to provide health insurance that covers birth control, but religious houses of worship were exempted. Some private businesses sued regarding their rights to circumvent such coverage, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that they could object on religious grounds.

‘ALIENATING POTENTIAL SHAREHOLDERS’

Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Jonathan Adler said it was unlikely publicly traded companies would seek exemptions. “Why would a publicly traded company risk alienating potential shareholders by taking such a step?” Adler said.

Ellen Kelsay, chief strategy officer at the National Business Group on Health, a lobbying group for large companies, said, “Most large employers have provided coverage for birth control prior to any mandates and we expect most will continue to do so irrespective of any exemptions that may become available.”

According to one estimate, only 3 percent of nonprofit groups offering health benefits have objected to contraceptives coverage.

“HHS has issued a balanced rule that respects all sides - it keeps the contraceptive mandate in place for most employers and now provides a religious exemption,” said Mark Rienzi, one of the lawyers for the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of Roman Catholic nuns, which runs care homes for the elderly, had challenged the mandate in court.

The Little Sisters and other Christian nonprofit employers objected to a 2013 compromise offered by the Obama administration that allowed entities opposed to providing contraception insurance coverage to comply with the law without actually paying for the required coverage.

The Justice Department released two memos that will serve as the government’s legal basis for justifying the rule and laying out a framework for how apply religious liberty issues in legal opinions, federal rules and grant making.

In another decision popular with Trump’s evangelical supporters, the Justice Department on Wednesday reversed federal policy and declared that federal law banning sex discrimination in the workplace does not protect transgender employees. Trump also has removed protections for transgender students and moved to ban transgender people from the military.

Trump’s support among evangelical voters, a major force in his 2016 election victory, remains strong, but has been slipping in line with his overall approval ratings, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos poll results.",Trump undermines U.S. birth control coverage requirement,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-religion/trump-undermines-u-s-birth-control-coverage-requirement-idUSKBN1CB1XZ

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A San Diego children’s hospital unveiled a collection of remote controlled luxury mini cars on Tuesday that allow its young patients to ‘drive’ themselves to the operating room.

The cars at the Rady Children’s Hospital are actually operated by a nurse or a doctor, and are part of a new program designed to make children more relaxed before their procedures.

“The kids are having fun. The parents are seeing that they’re relaxed and that they’re happy,” said Dr. Daniela Carvalho, medical director of surgical services at the hospital.

SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton was within reach of his fourth Formula One title on Sunday after winning the Japanese Grand Prix for Mercedes while Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel suffered engine problems and failed to finish.

The Briton, who started from pole position, crossed the line 1.2 seconds ahead of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo to move 59 points clear at the top of the overall standings.

Vettel made it no further than the fourth lap before retiring in the pits.

Already 34 points behind Hamilton before the start, the setback was the third in as many races for the German, whose hopes now rest on Hamilton suffering similar misfortune in the last four grands prix.

“I could only have dreamed of having this kind of gap,” said Hamilton, interviewed on the podium by Indianapolis 500 winner Takuma Sato.

“I wouldn’t say that I have one hand on it (the title),” he added later. “There’s still 100 points available so I‘m still going to keep the pedal to the metal.”

Sunday’s win was the 61st of Hamilton’s career and third at the Suzuka circuit. It came a day after the 32-year-old smashed the track record to seize pole at the 5.8-km track in dominant style.

With the gap he now holds over Vettel, the 32-year-old could clinch the title as soon as the next race in Austin, Texas, on Oct. 22.

HURT AND DISAPPOINTED

Vettel had lined up alongside the Briton, raising the prospect of the two title rivals racing side by side to the first corner, but the Ferrari had already run into trouble before the start.

Vettel’s mechanics changed his car’s spark plug on the grid and seemed to have resolved the problem. But while he made a clean start, Hamilton chopped across to keep the lead at the first corner.

Clearly lacking power, Vettel fell back through the field before getting the call from his race engineer to retire the car.

“Of course it hurts, and we’re all disappointed,” said the four times world champion, who hugged his mechanics and gave the crowd a quick wave after returning to the pits.

“For sure now you don’t look at the positives because it’s not the day to look at positives,” he added.

With Vettel sidelined and Mercedes back up to speed after two lacklustre weekends, Hamilton’s afternoon should have consisted of a straightforward drive to victory but late tyre vibrations allowed Verstappen to reel him in.

For a moment it looked like the Dutchman could cause a late upset and snatch a second consecutive win to add to his triumph in Malaysia.

But with back markers between him and the chasing Red Bull, Hamilton hung on.

“The first half of the race was very well under control and the second part was a lot harder,” said Hamilton. “I had massive understeer. I‘m really grateful the car stuck in and I didn’t make any mistakes.”

Valtteri Bottas, who had started sixth due to a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, fought through to finish fourth for Mercedes.

Fellow Finn Kimi Raikkonen, also struck by a gearbox-related grid penalty, was the sole-surviving Ferrari in fifth.

Force India’s Esteban Ocon, who ran as high as third at one stage, was sixth ahead of Mexican team-mate Sergio Perez, as the Silverstone-based team came away with another strong haul of points.

AUSTIN, Texas/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chocking up employment losses last month to the temporary hit of a severe hurricane season and reiterating expectations that inflation will strengthen, Federal Reserve policymakers on Friday signaled they continue to see gradual U.S. interest-rate hikes ahead.

“Even though inflation is currently somewhat below our longer-run objective, I judge that it is still appropriate to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually,” said New York Fed President William Dudley, whose regular meetings with Fed Chair Janet Yellen and constant contact with Wall Street banks bolster his influence among Fed policymakers.

While other policymakers largely agreed, they also said they were keeping a close eye on the data, particularly on inflation.

And one offered a strong rebuttal, saying the central bank risked a “policy mistake” if it continues raising rates despite inflation data that remains stalled.

“If we go too far in our zeal to normalize (rates) we might push inflation expectations down further and that might hinder our ability to hit our target,” said St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who called the September jobs number “startling” even given the hurricane. “The December meeting is going to be too early to make a determination on whether inflation is coming back.”

Others were more on board with the December increase, though they also offered some skepticism about inflation.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, the newest of the 12 Fed presidents, told Reuters in an interview that he continues to believe the U.S. central bank should raise interest rates again by the end of the year, though he is “not wedded” to that position and continues to track data closely.

And Robert Kaplan, chief of the Dallas Fed, told reporters that inflation is “likely building” given the low unemployment rate, which would make the case for further rate hikes. Though the number of jobs fell in September for the first time in seven years, the unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent and hourly wages rose more than expected.

Striking a somewhat less eager tone than his colleagues though, Kaplan said, “I‘m going to watch a little bit here. We have the benefit of having a little time and I plan to take it.”

Last month, the Fed left rates unchanged and announced the well-telegraphed start to a gradual shrinking of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, which was swollen by massive purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.

But market expectations are high that the Fed will hike rates again in December, especially after Fed Chair Janet Yellen outlined why she is fairly confident that inflation, now at 1.4 percent by the Fed’s preferred measure, will rise toward the Fed’s 2-percent target over the medium term. It would be imprudent, she said in late September, to wait until inflation actually reached that target to raise rates.

Investors are more skeptical of the Fed’s forecasts of roughly three more hikes next year.

Three of the policymakers suggested they would be open-minded about the economic data, and especially inflation readings, for the next several months due to temporary factors weighing on prices and also the hurricanes that struck the United States over the last 40 days.

U.S. President Donald Trump recently interviewed at least three candidates who could replace Yellen when her term as Fed chief expires in February, though he is also reported to be considering reappointing her. Trump said last week that he would have a decision in the next two or three weeks.

Bostic, who started his job four months ago and has a vote next year on the central bank’s rate-setting committee, said he expects the Fed, regardless of who leads it, to continue to raise rates in “a slow, steady return to more normal levels” in 2018, “absent some sign that either the economy weakens dramatically or suddenly, or if it accelerates faster than we might expect.”

TAX DEBATE

Bostic said his economic forecasts do not include any changes to fiscal policy, in line with many of his colleagues.

Some Fed policymakers have begun to push back on the Trump administration’s assertion that its tax cut plan would boost the economy, cautioning it could instead trigger high inflation, unsustainable debt and an eventual return to sub-par growth.

The proposed tax overhaul includes lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent.

“If they use it to invest, then we might see some more robust growth and then we would have to keep an eye on what happens with the level of prices,” Bostic said.

“But we’ve had other episodes where cash windfalls have been used to buy back stocks and those sorts of things, in which case you are not getting to the same level of productive transmission of that policy.”","Downplaying job losses, Fed officials eye December rate hike",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed/downplaying-job-losses-fed-officials-eye-december-rate-hike-idINKBN1CB2KE

The Labor Department said on Friday nonfarm payrolls decreased by 33,000 jobs last month amid a record drop in employment in the leisure and hospitality sector. The decline in payrolls was the first since September 2010.

The department said Harvey and Irma, which wreaked havoc in Texas and Florida in late August and early September, reduced employment last month. But underlying details of the closely watched employment report were upbeat.

The unemployment rate hit a more than 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent and annual wage growth accelerated to 2.9 percent.

“Investors will find solace in a whole host of other labor market indicators that reveal an underlying labor market that continues to show evidence of resilience and continued tightening,” said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.

Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 90,000 in September. Payrolls are calculated from a survey of employers, which treats any worker who was not paid for any part of the pay period that includes the 12th of the month as unemployed.

Many of the dislocated people will probably return to work. That, together with rebuilding and clean-up is expected to boost job growth in the coming months.

Leisure and hospitality payrolls plunged 111,000, the most since records started in 1939, as employment at restaurants and bars fell 104,700. There were also decreases in retail and manufacturing employment last month.

The economy created 13,000 more jobs than previously reported in August. Harvey and Irma did not have an impact on the unemployment rate, which fell two-tenths of a percentage point from August to the lowest since February 2001. The smaller survey of households from which the jobless rate is derived treats persons as employed regardless of whether they missed work during the reference week and were unpaid as result.

The decrease in the unemployment rate reflected a 906,000 surge in household employment, which eclipsed a 575,000 increase in the labor force.

The dollar initially rose against a basket of currencies as investors focused on the jobless rate and wages, before surrendering gains to trade little changed. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell as did stocks on Wall Street.

DISRUPTIONS BOOST WAGES

Underscoring the disruptive impact of the hurricanes, the household survey showed 1.5 million workers stayed at home in September because of the bad weather, the most since January 1996. About 2.9 million people worked part-time, the largest number since February 2014.

The length of the average workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours. With the hurricane-driven temporary unemployment concentrated in the low-paying retail and leisure and hospitality industries, average hourly earnings jumped 12 cents or 0.5 percent in September after rising 0.2 percent in August.

The annual increase in wages in September was the largest since December 2016 and followed an upwardly revised 2.7 percent rise in August. The revision to August’s annual increase from 2.5 percent raised hope that wage growth was finally picking up.

The unemployment rate is now below the Federal Reserve’s median average forecast for the fourth quarter.

Strong wage gains and shrinking labor market slack left financial markets almost fully pricing in a December interest rate increase from the U.S. central bank.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen cautioned last month that the hurricanes could “substantially” weigh on September job growth, but expected the effects would “unwind relatively quickly.”

“The Fed has been hyper-focused on wage growth, so the above-average increase will be a welcome relief, even if there is some storm impact embedded in the number,” said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston. “We think that the report strengthens the Fed’s December hike hand.”

The Fed said last month it expected “labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.”

The Fed left interest rates unchanged in September, but signaled it expected one more hike by the end of the year. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year.

The employment report added to August consumer spending, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales data in suggesting that the hurricanes will dent economic growth in the third quarter.

Economists estimate that the back-to-back storms, including Hurricane Maria which destroyed infrastructure in Puerto Rico last month, could shave at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter gross domestic product.

Growth estimates for the July-September period are as low as a 1.8 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.1 percent rate in the second quarter.

Private payrolls fell by 40,000 jobs, the first drop since February 2010. Manufacturing employment slipped by 1,000 jobs pulled down by declines at motor vehicle assembly and chemical plants as well as textile mills.

Retail employment fell by 2,900 jobs as food stores payrolls tumbled 6,900. There were also declines in employment at department stores. Construction payrolls rose 8,000 in September as a 3,900 drop in jobs at homebuilding sites was offset by increases elsewhere.","U.S. payrolls shrink in September after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy/u-s-payrolls-shrink-in-september-after-hurricanes-harvey-irma-idINKBN1CB1L7

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Une start-up de la région de Seattle soutenue par la filiale de capital-risque de Boeing et la compagnie JetBlue Airways prévoit de lancer d‘ici à 2022 un petit avion de ligne hybride électrique qui pourrait réduire considérablement le temps de déplacement et le coût des voyages de moins de 1.000 miles (1.600 km), a-t-elle annoncé jeudi.

Le premier modèle de cette nouvelle gamme d‘appareils, prévus en plusieurs versions, devrait accueillir jusqu‘à 12 passagers et sera propulsé par deux moteurs électriques, a précisé Zunum Aero.

Les batteries seront les mêmes que celles conçues par Tesla, Panasonic et d‘autres pour les véhicules électriques. Un moteur à essence et un générateur électrique seront toutefois associés à cet équipement pour permettre à l‘avion d‘atteindre une portée de 700 miles, a expliqué Matt Knapp, co-fondateur et chef ingénieur en aéronautique de la start-up basée à Kirkland, dans l‘Etat de Washington.

Zunum Aero n‘a cependant pour le moment aucun accord avec Tesla ou Panasonic.

Un autre modèle, plus large, conçu pour transporter jusqu‘à 50 passagers, est prévu pour la fin de la prochaine décennie. Ces deux modèles seraient ensuite améliorés pour parvenir à parcourir une distance d‘environ 1.000 miles à la faveur des progrès technologiques sur les batteries, a ajouté Matt Knapp.

A terme, la start-up envisage de passer au tout électrique et à des avions sans pilote.

Nombre d‘autres entreprises, notamment Uber Technologies et Airbus, travaillent sur des voitures autonomes volantes propulsées par un moteur électrique et destinées à des trajets intra-urbains.

Si Zunum Aero ne s‘attend pas à être le premier à décrocher une certification pour un avion électrique, la société vise surtout le marché des avions régionaux jugé encore trop onéreux pour beaucoup d‘hommes d‘affaires et de compagnies aériennes.

“Les compagnies aériennes sont très intéressées par des court-courriers offrant une bonne rentabilité”, a-t-il déclaré.

Selon Matt Knapp, les avancées récentes dans les véhicules électriques et les systèmes de conduite autonome, ainsi que les moteurs électriques légers et les cellules composites en carbone permettraient de réduire le coût de vol par siège et par mile d‘environ 8 cents.

Ces nouveaux appareils devraient également réduire le temps de déplacement en permettant aux passagers de décoller à partir de milliers d‘aéroports régionaux, au lieu d‘emprunter les importants hubs utilisés par les grandes compagnies aériennes.

Boeing a annoncé séparément l‘acquisition du fournisseur de technologies pour l‘aviation Aurora Flight Sciences afin d‘accélérer le développement de systèmes autonomes pour ses appareils aussi bien civils que militaires.

A few dozen white nationalists, led by so-called “alt-right” activist Richard Spencer and carrying torches gathered at Emancipation Park near a covered statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, the removal of which was blocked by a court pending the outcome of a legal challenge.

Spencer posted a video on Twitter showing the protest, in which opponents of the removal of Lee’s statue chanted “You will not replace us” and “We will be back.”

Charlottesville’s Mayor Mike Signer fired off an angry response on Twitter, telling Spencer and the protesters to “go home.”

“Another despicable visit by neo-Nazi cowards. You’re not welcome here!,” Signer tweeted, adding “we’re looking at all our legal options. Stay tuned.”

An August rally organized by white nationalists to protest the planned removal of the Lee statue turned deadly when counter-protester Heather Heyer, 32, was killed by a car driven into a crowd.

The violence stemmed from a heated national debate about whether Confederate symbols of the U.S. Civil War memorialize past leaders and dead soldiers or rather invoke white supremacy and the Confederacy’s acceptance of the slavery of blacks.

In the wake of the rally, other cities have acted to remove monuments to the Confederacy.",White nationalists return to Charlottesville for torch-lit protest,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-protests-charlottesville/white-nationalists-return-to-charlottesville-for-torch-lit-protest-idUSKBN1CD04N

Interviews with more than a dozen diplomats and government officials based in Washington, Yangon and Europe revealed that punitive measures aimed specifically at top generals were among a range of options being discussed in response to the crisis.

Nothing has yet been decided and Washington and Brussels may decide to hold off for now, the sources said. There are also discussions about increasing aid for violence-riven Rakhine state.

The active discussion of sanctions – not even on the table a month ago – shows how the dramatic exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar’s northwest is putting pressure on Western policymakers to take action.

While much of the outcry overseas has focused on Nobel laureate and Myanmar’s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, few Western diplomats see an alternative to her leadership. Suu Kyi does not control the military, which still wields considerable power under Myanmar’s army-written constitution.

The EU Foreign Ministers Council will discuss Myanmar on Oct. 16, although officials do not expect any move on sanctions that soon. Danish minister for development cooperation, Ulla Tornaes, told Reuters that Copenhagen had been working to get the crisis on the agenda, “with the wish to put further pressure on the military”.

Two Washington-based U.S. officials with knowledge of the Trump administration’s Myanmar deliberations said targeted sanctions against commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and several other generals, as well as leaders of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist militias accused of torching Rohingya villages, were under consideration.

Such sanctions - if decided on - would likely entail U.S. asset freezes, bans on travel to the United States, prohibitions against Americans doing business with them and other unspecified penalties. Washington was moving cautiously as it consulted with governments in Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia, the U.S. officials said.

A senior Yangon-based European diplomat also said Western countries were coordinating their response to the crisis and were in agreement that it was the military, and specifically the commander-in-chief, who needed to be targeted in any punitive action.

Any punishment was likely to be symbolic at first to allow room for further talks, Yangon-based diplomats said, giving the example of formally banning the army chief, who over the past year visited Brussels, Berlin and Vienna, from further travel to Europe.

Western diplomats admit their leverage is limited: compared with China, whose ties with Myanmar have warmed since Suu Kyi took office 18 months ago, U.S. and European investment and military engagement with the country are small.

They are also wary of action that could hurt the wider economy or destabilize already tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army.

PRESSURE BUILDING

The United Nations is pressing for increased humanitarian access to other parts of Rakhine, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain. How Myanmar responds to calls for increased aid, the investigation of alleged atrocities or repatriation of refugees would be a key consideration in deciding what action to take, U.S. and EU diplomats in Myanmar said.

“We can pile political pressure, look into financing we have in Myanmar. We have humanitarian aid, as well as development aid ... the European Commission won’t invest in the development of Myanmar if the conditions, including security, are not there,” said a Brussels-based EU diplomat who follows Myanmar.

“There is also the arms trade embargo and we discuss regularly whether we should reward the reforms in Myanmar and look at gradual easing of that, or the opposite.”

EU economic sanctions on Myanmar were lifted after the army stepped back from direct rule of the country in 2012, beginning the democratic transition that brought Suu Kyi to power last year, but an arms embargo in force since the 1990s remains. The United States removed most sanctions on Myanmar last autumn. It too has kept an arms embargo in place.

One Washington-based U.S. official said that, while there was no firm deadline, Washington hoped to have a plan of action on Myanmar in place by the time President Donald Trump travels to Asia for a series of summits in the first half of November.

The administration wanted to send a strong message to Myanmar’s military, but was concerned that too drastic action could allow China to expand its growing diplomatic and economic influence in the country, the official said.

There is little support in the administration for the re-imposition of broader economic sanctions, the official added.

The White House declined comment on internal deliberations on the Rohingya crisis.

STRAINED RELATIONS

In another sign of pressure building on Myanmar, New York-based diplomats said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the U.N. General Assembly was pushing for a human rights resolution on the country.

Last year the EU announced that for the first time in 15 years it would not introduce a resolution at the General Assembly’s Third Committee, which focuses on human rights, condemning Myanmar’s record - rewarding it for progress.

The European bloc could revive the resolution in the current session, taking on board the OIC draft and broadening it out beyond the Rohingya crisis, one diplomat in New York said.

Diplomats said some members of the U.N. Security Council were exploring whether the 15-member body could agree a formal statement, or even a resolution, calling for an end to the violence, full access for aid and the safe return of refugees.

However, Myanmar has said it was negotiating with China and Russia, which have veto powers in the Security Council, to protect it from any possible action. China and Russia have both expressed support for the Myanmar government.

Myanmar’s relations with the U.N. have grown increasingly testy since the discovery of World Food Programme-branded biscuits at a suspected militant camp in July prompted the government to accuse the U.N. agency of supporting the insurgents, forcing it to shut down its operations in Rakhine.

Myanmar is stalling on accepting a plan by the U.N. to upgrade the U.N. country head to the more powerful rank of Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) when its current top official, who is due to be rotated, is replaced.

Thaung Tun, Suu Kyi’s National Security Advisor, told Reuters that the U.N. “must treat us equally”.

“We’ll be fine with anybody if all member states have an ASG assigned. Not just us,” he said.",West edges towards punishing Myanmar army leaders over Rohingya crisis: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-sanctions-exclusive/west-edges-towards-punishing-myanmar-army-leaders-over-rohingya-crisis-sources-idUSKBN1CD0RN

(Reuters) - The Florida inventor who designed the first “bump stock,” nearly two decades before the Las Vegas gunman used one to massacre 58 people on Sunday, never made a dime off of his creation.

For years, Bill Akins fought to capitalize on his idea - with the U.S. government, his former business partner and a rival competitor - but found himself stymied at every turn.

The 63-year-old Marine veteran and Elvis impersonator voiced his sorrow at the tragedy in Las Vegas, where authorities said Stephen Paddock had bump stocks installed on 12 of his rifles. The device allows semi-automatic weapons to fire almost as rapidly as machine guns, which are largely outlawed.

“I would like to express my dismay and sincere condolences to the victims, families and anyone affected by the recent Las Vegas mass shooting,” Akins said during a telephone interview from his home about 45 minutes north of Tampa, Florida.

But he also defended the devices as protected under the U.S. Constitution’s right to bear arms.

“People need to recognize that we either have a constitution, or we don‘t,” he said.

Akins first came up with his idea while watching a documentary about World War Two in 1996 that showed twin anti-aircraft guns firing at Japanese warplanes from a U.S. Navy ship.

He saw the barrels sliding back and forth with each concussive recoil and wondered if he could design a device that would mimic that action, turning a semi-automatic rifle that fires once per trigger pull into a weapon capable of shooting hundreds of rounds per minute.

The result, which he eventually termed the “Akins Accelerator,” seemed promising enough. Akins teamed up with a firearms industry businessman, secured two letters from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) affirming the mechanism behind the device was legal, and poured his savings into the project.

But the ATF outlawed the device in 2005, concluding that the retail version transformed semi-automatic rifles into illegal machine guns.

Another company, Slide Fire Solutions, began making its own version of the bump stock that was approved by the ATF, in large part because it lacked a recoil spring that Akins had included.

Akins transferred his patent to an outdoor sporting goods company, FosTecH Outdoors, and the two rival manufacturers engaged in a legal battle over patent infringement before settling the case in 2012.

The owner of FosTecH, whose website says the company strives to be “your bump fire stock specialist,” did not return a request for comment.

The seller’s site said it had suspended sales of bump stocks while it works on catching up with demand, which has skyrocketed since the Vegas shooting due to customers’ concerns that the item could be outlawed.

Slide Fire’s founder, Jeremiah Cottle, did not return multiple calls for comment.

Akins is limited in what he can say about the litigation, saying only that he is “legally prevented” from discussing certain aspects of the bump stock industry. But he made clear his ire at the ATF.

“They just destroyed our business,” he said.

The ATF did not immediately comment on the case.

Court documents showed the agency required all customers who purchased an Akins Accelerator to remove the spring, rendering the device inoperable.

“JUST A TINKERER ... WITH AN IDEA”

Akins’ device was intended to improve upon “bump firing,” a practice in which shooters fired from the hip while keeping a thumb hooked inside a belt loop for stability, using the gun’s recoil to activate the trigger more quickly.

His innovation let users brace rifles against their shoulders in a more normal firing stance, improving accuracy and control.

Akins put up his own property as collateral for a loan to launch the business. He estimated he sold several hundred devices, priced at more than $1,000 each, before he was shut down - not enough to cover his startup costs.

He filed two unsuccessful federal lawsuits against the ATF, leaving him with a workshop full of unused Akins Accelerators.

“Boy, did I get an education,” he said. “I‘m not a person who’d ever done business before with a corporation, never worked in the firearm industry before, just a tinkerer that came up with an idea.”

Akins is largely retired, though he still dons his Elvis costume for occasional gigs. He gave up his longtime National Rifle Association membership after he said the group offered no help in his fight against the ATF. But, he said, he remains a steadfast supporter of the right to bear arms.

He scoffed at the NRA’s willingness to accept stricter regulation on bump stocks, saying any law would run afoul of the Second Amendment.

“Congress has the right to pass laws,” he said. “But Congress is not supposed to pass a law that violates the constitution.”","Inventor of 'bump stock' spent years fighting for device, and lost",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lasvegas-shooting-guns/inventor-of-bump-stock-spent-years-fighting-for-device-and-lost-idUSKBN1CB2TF

Minority Islamic groups in the province are routinely attacked by militant outfits including Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for several bombings.

A police officer apprehended the bomber at the entrance to the Sufi shrine and was among those killed, but his heroic action reduced the number of casualties, Baluchistan home minister Sarfraz Bugti told Reuters.

Local government official Ahmed Aziz Tarrar said 16 people were killed and over 30 wounded in the blast.

“We have received 16 bodies at the local hospital and many injured. The severely wounded are being moved to other facilities,” district heath official Rukhsani Magsi said.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq news service.

The shrine in the district of Jhal Magsi was packed with devotees mourning the death of a local spiritual leader.

Such incidents fuel concern about security for projects in the $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a planned transport and energy route from western China to Baluchistan’s deep-water port of Gwadar.

The province has been rocked by violence on two fronts for over a decade. As well as the Taliban and other Sunni Islamist militants, Baluchistan separatists mount attacks on targets linked to the central government.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian wage growth accelerated at its fastest pace in over a year in September, keeping alive the possibility that the Bank of Canada could hike interest rates for a third time by the end of the year.

Average hourly wages for permanent employees rose 2.2 percent last month from a year ago, Statistics Canada said in its jobs report on Friday.

The acceleration, which was the fastest annual pace since June 2016, suggested there may be a recovery in wage growth, which has been weak despite strong labor market gains over the past year and is being closely watched by the Bank of Canada.

Analysts said the growth in wages was more encouraging than September’s increase of 10,000 jobs, which was below forecasts and pointed to a cooling economy over the second half of the year.

The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates twice this year, spurred by strong economic growth that has put Canada at the top of the Group of Seven nations.

While expectations for a third rate hike later this month have dwindled following cautious comments from policymakers, markets placed the odds of an increase at 18 percent after the jobs report, compared to 12.2 percent before.

“I think this is going to reinforce the Bank of Canada’s expectations that we’re spiraling upward on wage and price pressures in the Canadian economy,” said Derek Holt, vice president of economics at Scotiabank.

Although Holt continues to expect a hike at the central bank’s meeting in December, he said the possibility of an October increase was still in play.

Markets put the odds of a December hike at 64.3 percent.

The Canadian dollar touched a five-week low against its U.S. counterpart immediately after the Canadian jobs report before recovering some losses to trade little changed.

Jimmy Jean, senior economist at Desjardins Capital Markets, said the wage growth was “a pretty rapid improvement,” though he did not expect it to move the needle on the October rate decision.

“It is a sign that the job market is tightening,” Jean said.

September’s job gains were driven by the public sector, which added 26,200 positions, while the private sector shed 15,500 jobs. The unemployment rate held steady at 6.2 percent as the number of people looking for work edged down.

The education sector led the way up, adding 20,000 positions, while the public administration field added 4,500 jobs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said he hoped a new requirement for lenders to hold more capital would dampen signs of a “bit of exuberance” in credit card and personal lending to British consumers.

The Bank of England said last month that lenders had underestimated the risks from a surge in consumer borrowing, and they needed to hold an extra 10 billion pounds of capital to guard against future dangers.

Cunliffe said on Sunday that banks were being over-optimistic in estimating the likely losses from credit card and personal loan debt because they were confusing good economic conditions with the credit quality of the actual borrowers.

“People were letting standards slip,” he said in an interview in the Mail on Sunday. “You’re starting to see it maybe a little bit more in mortgage terms.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned on Friday that the Trump administration was making “highly dangerous demands” in the North American Free Trade Agreement modernization talks that could erode U.S. business support and torpedo the negotiations.

John Murphy, the chamber’s senior vice president for international policy, said the largest U.S. business lobby was urging the administration to drop some of its more controversial NAFTA proposals, including raising rules of origin thresholds to “extreme” levels.

“We’re increasingly concerned about the state of play in negotiations,” Murphy told reporters.

U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators are preparing for a fourth round of talks to update the 23-year-old trade pact next week in a Washington suburb, Oct. 11-15.

U.S. companies large and small were worried about a proposal by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to add a five-year termination clause to NAFTA, Murphy said.

He said there was also concern about Lighthizer’s proposal to reduce Canadian and Mexican companies’ access to U.S. public procurement contracts, and to include a U.S.-specific content requirement for autos and auto parts.

“We see these proposals as highly dangerous, and even one of them could be significant enough to move the business and agriculture community to oppose an agreement that included them,” Murphy said.

He also voiced similar concerns about U.S. proposals for revamping dispute settlement mechanisms and trade protections for seasonal U.S. produce.

Some U.S. lawmakers and congressional staff are also growing increasingly concerned that the talks can reach a successful conclusion. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a pro-trade Republican, has invited Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to speak to the tax- and trade-focused panel on Wednesday as negotiators return to the table, a committee spokeswoman said.

WORRY ON AUTOS CONTENT

Inside U.S. Trade, a trade publication, stirred concerns among auto industry groups by quoting unnamed sources as saying that the Trump administration was also moving forward with a bid to increase North American content requirements for autos to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent, with a new 50 percent U.S. content requirement.

U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) spokeswoman Emily Davis declined to comment on the report, but said President Donald Trump had been clear about the need to shake up the agreement governing one of the world’s biggest trade blocs.

“NAFTA has been a disaster for many Americans, and achieving his objectives requires substantial change,” she said. “These changes of course will be opposed by entrenched Washington lobbyists and trade associations.”

Officials from auto industry trade groups said they had not seen a rules of origin proposal with such stringent targets.

“Forcing unrealistic rules of origin on businesses would leave the U.S. unable to compete by increasing the cost of manufacturing and raising prices for consumers,” said Cindy Sebrell, a spokeswoman for the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents auto parts manufacturers.

Karen Antebi, the trade counselor at Mexico’s embassy in Washington, told a forum on Friday that while there were “rumors” of a 50 U.S. percent content demand for autos, formal texts had not been proposed on rules of origin.

L‘operazione come noto prevede che chi aderisce allo scambio consegni le azioni rivenienti dalla conversione forzosa alla banca ricevendo in cambio una obbligazione senior. Le azioni sono acquistate dal Mef che, nell‘ipotesi di massima adesione all‘offerta, salirà al 67,76% dal 52,18% del capitale della banca. L‘offerta, spiega il documento di offerta, dovrebbe partire entro la fine di ottobre e durerà indicativamente tre settimane.

Questa operazione è propedeutica alla riammissione in Borsa dei titoli della banca senese che erano stati sospesi alla fine del dicembre 2016 dopo il fallimento della ricapitalizzazione di mercato. La banca ha fatto già richiesta alla Consob che ha subordinato la riammissione al ripristino di un quadro informativo completo per il mercato.

Secondo una fonte Mps dovrebbe tornare a trattare in Borsa nella seconda metà di ottobre.

L‘operazione di scambio, nel dettaglio, è rivolta alle azioni derivanti dal burden sharing di quella obbligazione subordinata del 2008 pari al 20,84% del capitale della banca. I destinatari dell‘offerta riceveranno in adesione obbligazioni senior a tasso fisso con cedola unica pagabile a scadenza, emesse da Mps con scadenza 15 maggio 2018 per nominale complessivo massimo di 1,536 miliardi di euro. Il tasso sarà determinato al termine del periodo di adesione “in linea con il rendimento delle obbligazioni non subordinate della Banca aventi analoghe caratteristiche, rilevato sul mercato secondario nel periodo intercorrente tra la data di publicazione del decreto che ha disposto il burden sharing (28 luglio 2017) e la data di scambio dell‘offerta”.

Se le adesioni all‘offerta eccedono l‘offerta prevista di bond senior si andrà a riparto pro-rata.

L‘adesione all‘offerta comporterà, come previsto dal decreto di salvataggio, “la rinuncia dell‘aderente a far valere ogni pretesa relativa alla commercializzazione unicamente dei Titoli UT2”, cioè di questo bond subordinato.

Tale rinuncia sarà valida anche in caso di adesione parziale da parte dei destinatari e di riparto, spiega la nota.

Ad oggi gli azionisti rilevanti con quote sopra il 3% della banca, dopo la ricapitalizzazione precauzionale e il burden sharing delle obbligazioni subordinate, sono il Mef con il 52,18% che salirà appunto con questa offerta di scambio, la stessa banca Mps che ha il 3,18 di azioni proprie e Generali con il 4,3%.

Al explorar la traición en el corazón de la inteligencia británica en novelas de espionaje, le Carré desafió las suposiciones occidentales sobre la Guerra Fría definiendo para millones de personas las ambigüedades morales de la lucha entre la Unión Soviética y Occidente.

Alex Younger, el jefe del Servicio Secreto de Inteligencia británico, o MI6, dijo en una carta a la revista The Economist que le molestaba la equivalencia moral de las novelas de le Carré pero sentía que los servicios de espionaje ofrecían un reflejo de sus países.

“La Stasi dijo todo lo que la gente necesitaba saber sobre el régimen de Alemania Oriental. El MI6, y nuestros servicios hermanos, GCHQ y MI5, les dicen mucho sobre el Reino Unido moderno”, escribió Younger, que se unió al MI6 cuando se desintegraba la Unión Soviética en 1991.

“Pese a que me molesta la insinuación de una equivalencia moral entre nosotros y nuestros oponentes que aparece en las novelas de John le Carré, prefiero el valor sosegado y la integridad de George Smiley a las gracias de 007, siempre”, añadió.

A diferencia del glamour de 007, los héroes de Le Carré -como Smiley- estaban atrapados en un laberinto de espejos dentro de la inteligencia británica que se tambaleaba tras la traición de Kim Philby, quien huyó a Moscú en 1963.

Younger dijo que los servicios británicos de inteligencia no eran poco convencionales, aunque reconoció que a veces rompían las reglas pero no la ley. “Hacemos cosas en defensa de nuestra seguridad nacional que no serían justificadas cuando se busca el interés privado”.

“Pero sólo cuando los ministros consideran que son necesarias y proporcionales.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech.
The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech.

Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them.","In a flurry of confident pronouncements within an hour of the massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival, conservative commentators and activists linked the perpetrator, Stephen Paddock, to liberal or Islamist influences. Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

The comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) set up the next round in a battle between automakers and the state of California and environmental groups, which argue against any retreat from limits to greenhouse gas emissions.

Automakers want changes that would make it easier for them to comply with fuel economy standards, including flexibility in the use of a system of credits under the program.

Automakers have to meet parallel fuel economy standards overseen by the NHTSA and vehicle emissions limits regulated by the EPA.

President Donald Trump has championed deregulation, saying it is needed to promote economic growth. In March he told auto workers, “We are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories.”

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others, said the EPA understated the costs of technologies needed to meet the 2025 requirements.

The Obama administration finalized rules in 2012 to double the fleetwide average fuel economy to 54.5 mpg by 2025, but the EPA revised it to 51.4 mpg based on a rising number of trucks. The EPA said that would result in a real world average of 36 mpg by 2025, because of credits automakers receive and differences in test procedures versus real-world driving.

Automakers earn credits by producing cars and trucks that exceed the requirements in a given year -- and can then apply credits to deficits in future years. They also earn credits for air conditioning improvements, building electric vehicles and other improvements that may not be captured in testing procedures.

Automakers said the Obama administration finding that the 2025 targets were achievable at reasonable cost was based on errors in modeling the impact of new technology and assumptions about fuel prices and sales trends that have proved wrong.

Global Automakers, a group representing Honda Motor Co (7267.T), Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and others, cited shifting consumer preferences for bigger vehicles as a problem.

“There is, simply put, a misalignment between the increasing stringency of the standards and the decreasing consumer demand for fuel efficiency,” the group said in comments filed late Thursday with the EPA.

The two auto groups said the EPA has agreed to develop a new modeling approach after they said a prior model “caused the agencies to overestimate the role that conventional technologies can play in achieving future” improvements.

An EPA spokesman declined to comment on its reconsideration, saying it would review all comments.

The risk for automakers is that California, the most populous U.S. state, will withdraw from a 2012 agreement to adhere to the national EPA standard if the current standards are weakened. California’s standards are followed by a dozen other states. Automakers have said it is vital to maintain one national regime for emissions regulation to avoid higher costs by having to meet two differing standards.

California on Friday said it would not budge.

“If the federal standards are relaxed despite the overwhelming body of evidence demonstrating they should continue as is, California will maintain its standards. Moreover, we will pursue all available legal remedies to overturn federal actions that are unsupported by the facts and law,” state officials said in a statement.

Environmental groups also oppose the decision to reopen the standards.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said “automakers can meet the current standards with known technologies at reasonable cost. ... Rolling them back, however, would increase pollution, raise costs for drivers, slow innovation and put jobs at risk.”","Automakers say U.S. fuel economy standards unrealistic, cite costs and consumers",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-automakers-emissions/automakers-say-u-s-fuel-economy-standards-unrealistic-cite-costs-and-consumers-idUSKBN1CB2UY

But the damage didn’t come from Hurricane Maria.

“Those wires were actually there before,” said Fermin Seda, 68, a Salinas resident who said he has grown accustomed to downed lines and power outages.

Two weeks after the storm plunged the island into a blackout, less than 10 percent of Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million people have seen power restored - and many will wait months.

Restoring the grid after the worst storm to hit here in nine decades would be a monumental task even for a well-run utility. It will be much harder for the chronically underfunded Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which went bankrupt in July amid mounting maintenance problems, years-long battles with creditors, a shrinking workforce and frequent management turnover.

Infographic ID: '2xvCFyU'

Interviews with more than two dozen officials and consultants who work for or with the U.S. territory’s government, PREPA or its creditors reveal a utility that was unprepared for a major storm despite the ever-present risk to this Caribbean island. When Maria hit, PREPA was trying to simultaneously finance an operational overhaul and dig out from about $8 billion in debt.

Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, in an interview with Reuters on Saturday, said none of the utility’s storm response plans could account for years of poor maintenance of the dilapidated electric network.

”The emergency plan was as follows: There is no way to fix the nature of the grid,” Rossello said.

He added that the network was so feeble it would have collapsed even in a much weaker storm than the one that hit Puerto Rico at Category 4 wind strength - the second highest level in the five-tier U.S. storm gauge.

“If you have an old grid susceptible to collapse, there is no way - until you change it completely - that it can sustain the winds of a Category 4, or even really a Category 2,” the governor said.

CHRONIC WEAKNESSES

A host of chronic problems at PREPA left the island’s electric grid vulnerable to collapse in a major storm, Reuters found. They include:

* Frequent turnover in management and board leadership, which has long failed to prioritize grid maintenance, according to reports prepared in 2015 and 2016 for utility regulators by the consultancy Synapse Energy Associates. The deferred upkeep, according to a PREPA assessment in April, led to a ”degraded and unsafe“ grid that needed at least $4 billion for modernization of an ”isolated system, in challenging terrain“ that is ”subject to natural atmospheric events.”

* Falling revenues that failed to cover operating expenses because of poor collection of utility bills and declining energy sales through a decade-long recession.

* A lack of regulatory oversight prior to 2014, and a rough transition of power from former utility board members and officials to a new energy commission created that year by legislation, with little handoff of disaster-preparedness plans.

* A staff diminished from 8,628 workers in 2012 to 6,042 this year, according to the April PREPA report. The talent drain reflects a larger exodus of residents from Puerto Rico - especially skilled workers - as the U.S. territory lost 300,000 people, or 8 percent of its populace, between 2010 and 2016, according to U.S. Census data.

Ricardo Ramos, who took over as the utility’s chief executive in March, told Reuters that the number of employee departures over the past five years is actually closer to 4,000 - with the vast majority being key operational workers such as linemen, power plant operators and mechanics.

They were exactly the kind of workers the utility couldn’t afford to lose.

“PREPA did not invest in new power plants or new generation, so our power plants are very, very old; our distribution system is very, very old,” Ramos said in an interview on Monday.

One pivotal question now is whether the United States will work merely to patch the existing network or allocate billions of dollars in federal funds to overhaul it. The government is open to spending money on modernization, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert said at a briefing last week.

The White House did not respond to Reuters’ inquiries seeking comment on the short- and long-term U.S. roles in restoring power to this U.S. territory.

‘THE LONG HAUL’

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told Reuters that the agency is “in this for the long haul” but offered no details on the level of funding it could commit to the island’s power grid.

Citizens of Puerto Rico do not receive services equal to U.S. states but also do not pay federal income tax.

The collapse of the grid isn’t the only cause of the island’s suffering. The U.S. relief effort so far has been unable to supply Puerto Rico with all the fuel it requires, for instance, leaving motorists waiting in long gasoline-station lines and depriving many backup electricity generators of diesel.

The lengthy electrical outages are a bitter pill for storm victims, who before Maria had already endured frequent service interruptions and rates higher than any U.S. state except Hawaii, according to PREPA and the U.S. Energy Department.

The impacts go well beyond temporary discomfort. The lack of power has been a key factor in a humanitarian crisis as residents with no refrigeration for food and medicine scrambled to find open stores and waited in endless lines.

In Salinas, 54-year-old Maria Sanchez wept as she threw out all of the food inside her mother’s fridge. By Saturday, she and six family members were surviving on crackers after eating all the other non-perishable food in the house.

“We are not rich - to throw away food like that. We’re running out of food - like fast,” she said, sitting on the porch, where a mild sea breeze offered little reprieve from the oppressive heat.

Diabetic Nancy Rivera lost more than food.

“All of my insulin is ruined,” said Rivera, 59, of Santurce, a district in San Juan, who stopped taking her spoiled medicine four days after the storm.

‘TRIAGE’ OF GRID REPAIRS

Winds of up to 155 mph (250 km/hr) during Maria knocked out about 80 percent of PREPA’s distribution network, said Ramos, the utility’s chief executive. Since the storm, power has been limited to key locales such as hospitals and hotels using generators fueled with a scarce supply of diesel.

Damage assessment for the grid, usually completed within 48 hours of a hurricane in the mainland United States, took a week-and-a-half, Ramos said. The assessment went as fast as possible given the widespread damage, he said, and the utility had three working helicopters to survey the network.

FEMA last week put the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - often tasked with infrastructure projects - in charge of short-term power restoration, in coordination with the Energy Department, the American Public Power Association and the New York Power Authority.

Gil Quiniones, CEO of NYPA, said the Army Corps had asked his utility for experts in power systems - which isn’t a Corps specialty - who can “think strategically on how to triage the situation and how to prioritize the work.”

The task is made more daunting by the island’s ill-maintained infrastructure. And PREPA’s strapped finances mean it cannot keep large standing orders for full-scale repair operations to swarm in after disasters, as utility repairman did last month in Florida after Hurricane Irma.

Ramos said PREPA has about 30 days worth of existing supplies for repairs following a storm; more is being ordered, to arrive in the next few weeks, he said.

‘THEY CAN‘T TELL ME HOW LONG’

On the south side of Puerto Rico, near most of the island’s power plants, broken wires and blackouts were common before Maria.

“They tell me that right now, they’re evaluating damage to the power grid in our region,” Salinas Mayor Karilyn Bonilla said on Friday. ”And they can’t tell me how long that will take.”

Bonilla said she has seen workers remove a few transformers since Maria hit but no one fixing downed power lines.

The amount of time power plants were down due to unplanned outages, measured in megawatt hours, more than doubled between mid-2015 and mid-2016, according to Synapse, the consultant firm.

By summer 2016, residents were experiencing four to five times the number of outages as the average U.S. customer, the consultants wrote.

The system’s deficiencies were laid bare in September 2016, when a transformer fire knocked out half of the island’s power, which wasn’t fully restored for nearly a week, forcing the governor to declare a state of emergency.

“Basically it was what you can call an unfortunate set of events, but really it is what I have said since I began at PREPA: lack of maintenance,” Ramos said.

One of the biggest factors in the outages: a constantly shrinking staff, driven away by costly medical benefits and unsafe conditions. The utility’s April report notes PREPA had a greater-than-average number of safety incidents for U.S. utilities, with more than 14,000 accidents and 15 fatalities in a 10-year period.

Many workers left for better opportunities, Ramos said. Because Puerto Ricans are American citizens, they face no legal barriers in leaving the island for the mainland.

“The truth of the matter is they make a lot more money in the U.S.,” said Ramos.

FIGHT FOR CONTROL

U.S. utilities are regulated by the states in which they operate, and by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission if they operate across state lines. U.S. federal oversight of PREPA is limited to environmental and safety standards and does not cover the transmission network.

Unlike utilities in U.S. states, PREPA had no regulator for decades and essentially governed itself. In 2014, the Puerto Rico Energy Commission was created by the island’s legislature, which sought greater oversight in response to perceived neglect by PREPA’s leadership at the time, which resisted the intervention.

Weeks after the act passed, PREPA became insolvent.

Today, the political squabbling over control of PREPA - and blame for its problems - continues even as utility officials respond to a historic crisis.

Ramon Luis Nieves - former head of Puerto Rico’s senate energy committee and a champion of the 2014 legislation - blasted former utility officials for poor oversight in an interview last week.

“Using their powers of self-regulation, PREPA itself was judge and jury,” he said as he waited in a five-hour gasoline line.

Energy Commissioner Angel Rivera said former PREPA officials gave the new regulator nothing in the way of disaster plans.

“If PREPA did any sort of analysis like this when they were creating the system, we would not know,” said Rivera, who was appointed in November 2014.

PREPA also fought the commission’s requirements to integrate renewable energy, said Nieves, the former senator. The commission rejected the utility’s first long-term plan to create a more reliable, cost-effective grid as inadequate, according to commission records.

Attempts by Reuters to reach PREPA’s previous chief executive, Javier Quintana, were unsuccessful.

Ramos - Quintana’s successor and a former engineer and PREPA employee - said he agreed with the need for an oversight commission when it was formed. But he now believes the commission wields too much power, citing its pushback on the utility’s capital spending.

“I basically have no power,” he said. “Basically, they wanted to run PREPA except during a hurricane, because now they are nowhere to be found.”

Jose Roman, interim chairman of the energy commission, disputed the notion that the commission wanted to run the utility, saying it only aimed to protect customers.

YEARS OF REBUILDING AHEAD

What remains unclear is the level of commitment from FEMA, the Army Corps and U.S. utilities for longer-term upgrades to buttress the system against future storms.

Bossert, the U.S. Homeland security advisor, said on Sept. 28 that the power grid would have to be rebuilt, “so we’re going to put federal money into this.”

The costs will be steep: The $4 billion estimate for modernization from PREPA does not include additional damage from Maria.

The task will be complicated by PREPA’s battles with creditors, who are led by hedge funds and mutual funds. The parties had been in debt restructuring talks for three years before the agency filed for bankruptcy in July.

A group of PREPA’s largest creditors, which include Franklin Advisers, Oppenheimer Funds and BlueMountain Capital, offered a loan of $1 billion after the hurricane. The island’s fiscal oversight committee rejected the offer, calling it a “publicity stunt” and criticizing the repayment and interest terms as unfavorable.

A spokesperson for the creditors declined to comment on that statement but the investment firms’ advisor, investment bank Houlihan Lokey, earlier expressed disappointment that the proposed loan had been rejected without negotiation.

The utility had considered but not yet implemented a wide variety of infrastructure improvements when senior leadership turned over after Rossello became governor at the beginning of the year. The governor typically appoints PREPA’s board and executive director.

Now new honchos are starting over in assessing PREPA’s needs, a repeat of past leadership transitions.

In the summer of 2016, PREPA held its 2017 public budgeting proceeding - the first led by the island’s utility commission rather than the utility itself.

Amid the deep financial problems of the island’s government and the utility, the commission allocated about $400 million for PREPA to address maintenance and repairs for the year, Commissioner Rivera said. Overall capital improvement plans for 20 years come to $2 billion, according to commission consultant Synapse.

Even the long-term plan represents just a fraction of what will be needed, suggesting the grid overhaul will require a serious commitment from the United States. Discussions about that reality are starting now.

“There’s diverging sentiments on the role of U.S. funding,” said a private sector energy executive who is working with PREPA to fix the networks and has been involved in strategy discussions with officials from FEMA and Puerto Rico.

“That’s where things start to get stuck,” he said. “No one argues about a generator in a hospital, but that doesn’t get the lights in the houses turned back on. Nobody knows where the money is going to come from.”",Special Report: The bankrupt utility behind Puerto Rico’s power crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-utility-specialreport/special-report-the-bankrupt-utility-behind-puerto-ricos-power-crisis-idUSKBN1C92B5

MANILA (Reuters) - Trust and satisfaction in Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on Sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall.

Net satisfaction, used by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) as a rating of the president’s performance, was down 18 points from the second quarter to 48, classified as “good” in the survey of 1,200 Filipinos conducted in the last week of September.

Duterte’s net trust rating, which gauges public sentiment about his personality, was “very good” at 60 points, down from “excellent” 75 he achieved in the previous poll.

The survey was conducted just a few days after thousands of Filipinos rallied to denounce Duterte, his anti-drug crackdown and what they called an emerging dictatorship.

Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in the crackdown and other SWS polls conducted in September indicated doubts about the validity of official accounts of the 3,800 cases where police killed drug suspects.

The SWS survey did not ask respondents to give a reason for the rating of Duterte, who took office in June 2016. Duterte’s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results.

Political analyst Ramon Casiple, head of the country’s Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said it was normal for a president’s rating to fall during his time in office, but concern over the high death toll in his signature war on drugs will have weighed on sentiment.

Activists accuse Duterte of inciting police to kill drug dealers and users, which he denies. Police reject allegations they are executing suspects and say deaths occurred because victims had violently resisted arrest.

Casiple said that though the poll still showed Duterte had the support of Filipinos, he should take it seriously.

“This is a real diminution of his popularity and it serves as a wakeup call for him to stop it further going down,” Casiple said of the poll.

“However, this is still a comfortable figure and far from the threshold of unpopularity.”

Based on SWS methodology for net trust ratings, a score of 70 and above is considered excellent, 50 to 69 is very good, 30-49 good and 10-29 moderate.

While his political opponents chide him for his authoritarian style and intolerance of dissent, Duterte enjoys a cult-like following and support from millions of Filipinos, who see him as the best hope for change in a country with rampant crime and a yawning gap between rich and poor.","Philippine president sees biggest ratings dip, but popularity intact",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-politics-duterte/philippine-president-sees-biggest-ratings-dip-but-popularity-intact-idUSKBN1CD0NJ?il=0

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear weapons were a “powerful deterrent” that guaranteed its sovereignty, state media reported on Sunday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said “only one thing will work” in dealing with the isolated country.

Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.

In a speech to a meeting of the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party on Saturday, a day before Trump’s most recent comments, state media said Kim had addressed the “complicated international situation”.

North Korea’s nuclear weapons are a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,” Kim said, referring to the “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

North Korea is preparing to test-launch such a missile, a Russian lawmaker who had just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday.

Donald Trump has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies.

The situation proved that North Korea’s policy of “byungjin”, meaning the parallel development of nuclear weapons and the economy was “absolutely right”, Kim Jong Un said in the speech.

“The national economy has grown on their strength this year, despite the escalating sanctions,” said Kim, referring to U.N. Security Council resolutions put in place to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program.

SISTER PROMOTION

The meeting also handled some personnel changes inside North Korea’s secretive and opaque ruling center of power, state media said.

Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, was made an alternate member of the politburo - the top decision-making body over which Kim Jong Un presides.

Alongside Kim Jong Un himself, the promotion makes Kim Yo Jong the only other millennial member of the influential body.

Her new position indicates the 28-year-old has become a replacement for Kim Jong Un’s aunt, Kim Kyong Hui, who had been a key decision maker when former leader Kim Jong Il was alive.

“It shows that her portfolio and writ is far more substantive than previously believed and it is a further consolidation of the Kim family’s power,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University’s 38 North website.

In January, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo Jong along with other North Korean officials over “severe human rights abuses”.

Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol, two of the three men behind Kim’s banned rocket program, were also promoted.

State media announced that several other high ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee in what the South Korean unification ministry said could be an attempt by North Korea to navigate a way through its increasing isolation.

“The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong Un is taking the current situation seriously, and that he’s looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians,” the ministry said in a statement.

North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, who named Donald Trump “President Evil” in a bombastic speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, was promoted to full vote-carrying member of the politburo.

“Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea’s top policy makers,” said Madden.

“Even if he has informal or off the record meetings, Ri’s interlocutors can be assured that whatever proposals they proffer will be taken directly to the top,” he said.","Kim Jong Un praises nuclear program, promotes sister to center of power",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CD03V-OCATP

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - From the field of sudden mass casualties to the unmistakable and devastating internal injuries of high-velocity gunfire, Sunday’s shooting at a Las Vegas music festival bore the hallmarks of war. So did the medical response.

The life-saving effort was in many ways textbook battlefield medicine.

It called on U.S. worst-case drills informed by lessons in wars from Vietnam to Iraq and refined by attacks on civilians in Paris, San Bernardino and Orlando.

And because the shooting occurred in a compact city with a fleet of ambulances and two trauma centers a few minutes away, the effort made the most of what doctors know as the “golden hour,” medical shorthand for a stark truth: Time is the enemy of the critically wounded.

Such care at close range saved lives, a success that would be harder to achieve in more isolated parts of the country, medical experts said.

“Vegas did it impeccably,” said Ian Weston, executive director of the American Trauma Society. “They practiced. They were ready.”

The fusillade the gunman poured on crowds at the outdoor festival from a 32nd-floor hotel suite killed 58 people and wounded hundreds of others - the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Of more than 300 wounded who got to the city’s two trauma units, all but 20 survived.

Each less than a six-mile (10-km) drive from the shooting site, University Medical Center and Sunrise Hospital operate, respectively, Level 1 and Level 2 trauma units, the highest designations for such care reflecting the readiness and range of capabilities.

U.S. trauma care, a network of public and privately operated first response crews and medical centers, developed after World War Two around the goal of delivering patients at risk of bleeding to death to surgeons within 60 minutes.

Today, more than 90 percent of the U.S. population of around 325 million lives within 60 minutes of one of the country’s roughly 2,000 designated trauma centers, broad coverage made possible by the reach of helicopter ambulances, which have limited capacity, according to the American Trauma Society.

The portion of Americans able to get to a trauma center within that time by ground transportation was only 64 percent in 2010 and probably has not changed much, Weston said.

That leaves almost 40 percent of the population, tens of millions of people, unable to get to a trauma center within an hour by ground transportation. Most of what trauma specialists refer to as the uncovered population lives in the rural West, including parts of Nevada, Idaho, Oregon, the Dakotas, Montana, Arizona and New Mexico, Weston said.

Several mass casualty events in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington have demonstrated that robust trauma care makes a difference.

After the bombing of the 2013 marathon in Boston, a metropolitan area with six Level 1 and 2 trauma units, all victims who got to hospitals were expected to survive.

“An urban center is going to be able to marshal resources,” said Dr. Mark Morocco, emergency medicine professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “But outside the major cities, where you don’t have those resources, then you really are at risk.”

If something like the Las Vegas shooting occurred in an uncovered rural zone, say at a rodeo or a Friday night football game, trauma experts said the toll would likely be higher.

”A lot more people would be dead,” said Dr. Scott A. Scherr, emergency room director at Sunrise in Las Vegas.

LUCKY TO BE ALIVE

When Braden Matejka arrived with a bullet wound to the back of the head, he was swarmed by Scherr’s team and whisked to surgery.

“I was lucky,” said the country music fan from British Columbia, walking out of the hospital a couple of days later.

Scherr’s team organized incoming patients with color coded tags: from green for the walking wounded to red for those closest to death. Except for drills, it was the only time the hospital had deployed the tags, long used to sort wounded on battlefields.

At UMC Trauma Center, “patients were stacked everywhere” within an hour of the shooting, and were sent into surgery according to “who’s dying fastest,” said supervising surgeon Dr. Jay Coates. At one point, eight patients were in surgery simultaneously.

The surgeons and nurses there used skills they drilled a year earlier in a mock mass shooting similar to the November 2015 Paris attack on a concert hall and cafes in which 130 people were killed and hundreds of people were wounded.

In coming months, trauma teams across the country will study the Las Vegas response, drill what worked and avoid what did not.

National ambulance company AMR flooded the zone in Las Vegas, applying lessons its corporate counterparts had learned responding to mass shootings in Orlando, Florida; Aurora, Colorado; and San Bernardino, California.

In all, the service made 200 runs, helping turn the golden hour “into the golden 15 minutes,” said Damon Schilling, a paramedic and AMR manager.

When the first call was 20 people shot, “We said, okay, we’re sending 30 ambulances,” Schilling recalled. “When they said 40, we sent 50. And when they said more, we sent 106 ambulances.”","Top-level trauma care, within close reach, saved lives in Las Vegas",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lasvegas-shooting-trauma/top-level-trauma-care-within-close-reach-saved-lives-in-las-vegas-idUSKBN1CB2SN

Others in the party warned that the uncertainty over May was damaging Brexit negotiations with the European Union.

May on Friday said she would remain as leader after a former Conservative chairman said he had garnered the support of 30 lawmakers who wanted her to quit.

It followed a disastrous speech at the party’s conference earlier this week, when a persistent cough left May barely able to deliver her message, and a snap election in June in which May lost her party’s majority in parliament.

Senior figures have rallied round May, but the open rebellion coincides with crucial talks with the European Union just 18 months before Britain is due to leave.

Johnson, who is widely considered to be the most serious challenger for leadership of the Conservatives if May were to resign, called for unity, according to media reports.

“We have just had an election and people are fed up with this malarkey,” newspapers quoted him as saying in a message to Conservative lawmakers.

“Get behind the PM. Ordinary punters I have spoken to thought her speech was good and anyone can have a cold,” he said. “Circle the wagons, turn the fire on (opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy) Corbyn and talk about nothing except our great policies and what we can do for the country”.

EU partners are stepping up preparations for a collapse in Brexit negotiations due to fundamental divisions across Britain on what to ask for - even if few believe Britain would risk crashing out into legal limbo in March 2019.

In Brussels, officials are questioning whether May will survive even until a summit on Oct. 19, but diplomats said governments insisted they would not ease their demands to help her move on with talks on a post-Brexit transition.

Few of her 27 EU counterparts see either hardline Brexiter rivals such as Johnson or the Labour opposition of Corbyn as any better able to rally the country behind their own visions for Brexit.

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, a possible successor should May be forced out and who campaigned hard against Brexit last year, told the BBC the prime minister’s critics should “put up, shut up and get off the stage”.

“I would tell my party to get its house in order, get together, knuckle down, and make sure that our first commitment, last commitment and only commitment is to the country,” she said.

Her message came after former party chairman Grant Shapps toured media studios calling for a leadership election. Shapps said 30 Conservative lawmakers backed his view, well short of the 48 needed to trigger a contest.

MOMENTUM LOST

Commentators said deep divisions in the party over the direction of Brexit meant the rebellion had lost momentum despite disquiet over May’s performance as leader.

One Conservative lawmaker, Nigel Evans, said the “botched plot” appeared to have fizzled out within 24 hours but that it would play into the hands of EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and EU Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker.

May’s weakness is generating more concern than satisfaction in Brussels, however, since failing to reach a deal with London would disrupt economies on both sides of the English Channel.

Barnier’s team starts a new week of talks with British negotiators on Monday, though expectations are very low of a breakthrough that could prompt leaders to open the way in the following week for talks on a post-Brexit free trade deal -- something London insists should be a priority for both sides.

Underscoring a hard line among governments, including heavyweights such as Germany and France, that Britain must do more to settle immediate “divorce” issues, such as paying Brussels tens of billions of euros, before opening a new phase of talks, envoys told Barnier on Friday they opposed starting even a tentative exploration of transitional arrangements.

Negotiators have suggested that, with time tight, it could be useful to explore some of the immediate problems that will come up on March 30, 2019, when Britain is out. However, leaders could still agree to let Barnier look at some transition issues, depending on next week’s negotiating round, diplomats said.

Adding to low expectations, however, the schedule for talks is thinner than previous rounds, with no public meeting planned at the start between Barnier and Brexit Secretary David Davis and no negotiations taking place at all on Wednesday.

For now, European leaders can do little more than watch and speculate about May’s ability to govern. “Who knows if we will still have an interlocutor at the summit,” one official said.",Conservative plotters told to get behind UK's May amid Brexit fears,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-may/conservative-plotters-told-to-get-behind-may-amid-brexit-fears-idUKKBN1CC088

Modi, in a rare acknowledgment that economic sentiment had turned negative, this week defended his handling of the economy, which in the June quarter grew at an annual 5.7 percent, its slowest rate in three years.

Small and medium-sized enterprises, crucial to Modi’s plans to create millions of more jobs, have been hurt by a massive tax overhaul launched on July 1 that added layers of bureaucracy for companies and hit exports.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday chaired a meeting of the council for the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a landmark reform which turned India’s 29 states into a single customs union for the first time.

After the day-long meeting, Jaitley said small businesses would be allowed to file tax returns once a quarter instead of every month. He also said duties would be cut on some products and the threshold for lower tax would be raised.

“We are not in a denial mode that there is a problem in the SME (small and medium enterprises) sector,” said a senior lawmaker who has been working with Modi’s office to combat the economic slowdown.

Ajay Sahai, head of the Federation of Indian Export Organisation, said before the Jaitley press conference that its 25,000 small and medium-sized members had found the monthly tax drill “exhausting”.

While a mountain of bad loans has crimped bank lending to India’s bigger companies, smaller firms have been hurt by a government move last November to stamp out “black money” - untaxed cash that oils many industries - and by GST, whose complex structure has baffled companies down the supply chain.

“Informal sources of working capital (for smaller firms) has dried up,” said Anil Bhardwaj at the Federation of Indian Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises.

He predicted that it would be another year before GST began to have a positive impact on smaller companies.

Jaitley has promised steps to boost economic growth back above 7 percent and toward the levels economists say India requires to generate employment for the one million entering the workforce every month.

Modi built a reputation as an economic reformer capable of delivering jobs and wealth for an increasingly aspirational population, but slowing growth will be near the top of voter concerns in upcoming state elections.

Investment remains low. The government has hiked spending on infrastructure, but private investment has remained muted.

“It is not easy because our banking system is in deep trouble and private investment is not picking up,” the lawmaker said. “The government will have to recast all policies that will activate the public sector.”

Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu said in a tweet his department was working with Jaitley to address GST-related issues of exporters.

Jaitley said input tax credit for exporters for July and August, estimated at $10 billion, would be refunded soon.","India's Modi, under fire, eases burden on small companies",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy/modi-under-fire-eases-burden-on-small-companies-idINKBN1CD0I4

LONDON (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar after Arab countries imposed restrictions on trade with the tiny Gulf state and the company is looking at alternative shipping routes.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.","Maersk says unable to ship Qatar bound cargo from UAE, seeks alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-shipping/maersk-says-unable-to-ship-qatar-bound-cargo-from-uae-seeks-alternatives-idUSKBN18X1YS

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Friday that a fourth soldier was killed during an attack on Wednesday in Niger, raising the death toll from an incident that has thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counterterrorism mission in the West African nation.

The United States had previously announced that three U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers had been killed and another two wounded when a joint U.S.-Nigerien patrol came under attack near the village of Tongo Tongo.

It did not disclose until Friday that a fourth soldier had been missing. Officials said his body was found by Nigerien forces on Friday morning near the site of the ambush, ending an extensive rescue and recovery mission.

No group has taken responsibility for the killings, although officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the United States suspects a local branch of Islamic State was responsible.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command declined to publicly name any group but said the American military would hunt down the insurgents.

“Absolutely, we are resolved and stalwart in our efforts to go after those who attacked this joint patrol of Nigerien and U.S. forces,” said Army Colonel Mark Cheadle, a spokesman for the U.S. military’s Africa Command.

From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included about a dozen U.S. troops, came under a swift attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles.

Islamist militants form part of a regional insurgency in the poor, sparsely populated deserts of West Africa’s Sahel.

Jihadists have stepped up attacks on U.N. peacekeepers, Malian soldiers and civilian targets since being driven back in northern Mali by a French-led military intervention in 2013.

U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed joint counterterrorism operations in the Sahel to defeat al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups during a call on Friday, the White House said.

LOW-RISK

Cheadle said the U.S. and Nigerien troops had been meeting with local leadership at the time of the attack, in what had been seen as a relatively lower-risk endeavor for America’s elite commandos.

There was not even any armed air cover at the time that could carry out air strikes if necessary.

“It was not meant to be an engagement with the enemy. It was meant to establish relations with the local leaders and the threats at the time were deemed to be unlikely, so there was no overhead armed air cover during the engagement,” he said.

Cheadle acknowledged that loss of elite U.S. forces would trigger a review of how the U.S. military carries out operations but did not suggest any move to scale back the American mission.

The U.S. military on Friday published the names of the three Army Special Forces soldiers from 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) who were killed when their reconnaissance patrol with Nigerien forces came under fire.

They were Staff Sergeant Bryan Black, 35, of Puyallup, Washington, Staff Sergeant Jeremiah Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio and Staff Sergeant Dustin Wright, 29, of Lyons, Georgia.

The U.S. military said it had surged resources to Niger to try to locate the missing American soldier. Cheadle said that included U.S. fighter jets, helicopters and surveillance assets.

(Reuters) - Unseeded Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia won the biggest singles title of her career with a 6-4 7-6(3) victory over soon-to-be world number one Simona Halep in the China Open final in Beijing on Sunday.

Garcia extended her winning streak to 11 matches and added to her Wuhan Open triumph last week. The current world number 15 will climb to ninth in the rankings on Monday, marking her Top 10 debut.

Halep, who will take over as number one in the next rankings, broke Garcia’s serve in the first game of the match but the 23-year-old hit back immediately, breaking the Romanian twice to win the first set.

With the score tied at 3-3 in the second set, Garcia saved nine consecutive break points in the seventh game, before taking a 4-3 lead but Halep recovered to force a tiebreak.

The Frenchwoman became the first to complete the Wuhan and Beijing double and is now on track to qualify for the season-ending WTA finals, as her win took her past Briton Johanna Konta to number eight in the Race to Singapore rankings.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has signalled that she could sack Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a Sunday newspaper said, as she tries to reassert her authority after a series of political disasters.

The Sunday Times said it asked May about her plans for Johnson, who has professed loyalty but is accused by some of the prime minister’s allies of undermining her by putting forward his own vision for Britain’s exit from the European Union.

“It has never been my style to hide from a challenge and I‘m not going to start now,” it quoted May as replying, in what it called a signal that she was prepared to bring in new ministers to her cabinet and axe those who had caused her problems.

“I‘m the PM, and part of my job is to make sure I always have the best people in my cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available to me in the party.”

May has seen her authority over her Conservative Party erode since she called a snap election in June in which she lost her majority in parliament.

Johnson, seen as a potential successor to May, said that Conservative lawmakers pushing to unseat her were “nutters”, adding that a change would lead to demands for another election that could bring a resurgent Labour party back to power.

“Are we really going to be stampeded myopically over the edge of the gorge, with an election that no one wants?” he said in the Sunday Telegraph.

Johnson wrote a newspaper article last month outlining his vision of Brexit just days before May made a major speech on the subject.

While professing loyalty, his interventions have been seen as undermining May and causing unnecessary unrest ahead of the party’s conference last week that culminated in a disastrous speech by the prime minister, marred by a coughing fit and letters falling off the slogan on the set behind her.

Johnson made a plea for loyalty with a typical rhetorical flourish on Sunday.

Former Prime Minister John Major said he was increasingly dismayed by the plotting in the party by those driven by their own personal agenda.

“The country has had enough of the self-absorbed and, frankly, disloyal behaviour we have witnessed over recent weeks,” he said in the Mail on Sunday.

The speculation about May’s position comes ahead of crucial Brexit talks between Britain and the EU, and the political uncertainty has led to growing concern that no deal would be agreed by March 2019 when Britain leaves the bloc. [nL8N1MI06W]

Britain’s Sunday newspapers were brimming with briefings from unnamed Conservative figures suggesting May’s days in Downing Street were numbered.

The Sunday Times said three cabinet ministers had discussed the need to replace May.

“It’s a ‘when’ question now,” one of the unnamed ministers told the paper. “It feels to me that this is over before Christmas.”

A fourth minister was quoted as saying there needed to be an orderly transition to a new leader and there was no prospect of May being in charge for the next election due in 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned on Friday that the Trump administration was making “highly dangerous demands” in the North American Free Trade Agreement modernization talks that could erode U.S. business support and torpedo the negotiations.

John Murphy, the chamber’s senior vice president for international policy, said the largest U.S. business lobby was urging the administration to drop some of its more controversial NAFTA proposals, including raising rules of origin thresholds to “extreme” levels.

“We’re increasingly concerned about the state of play in negotiations,” Murphy told reporters.

U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators are preparing for a fourth round of talks to update the 23-year-old trade pact next week in a Washington suburb, Oct. 11-15.

U.S. companies large and small were worried about a proposal by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to add a five-year termination clause to NAFTA, Murphy said.

He said there was also concern about Lighthizer’s proposal to reduce Canadian and Mexican companies’ access to U.S. public procurement contracts, and to include a U.S.-specific content requirement for autos and auto parts.

“We see these proposals as highly dangerous, and even one of them could be significant enough to move the business and agriculture community to oppose an agreement that included them,” Murphy said.

He also voiced similar concerns about U.S. proposals for revamping dispute settlement mechanisms and trade protections for seasonal U.S. produce.

Some U.S. lawmakers and congressional staff are also growing increasingly concerned that the talks can reach a successful conclusion. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a pro-trade Republican, has invited Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to speak to the tax- and trade-focused panel on Wednesday as negotiators return to the table, a committee spokeswoman said.

WORRY ON AUTOS CONTENT

Inside U.S. Trade, a trade publication, stirred concerns among auto industry groups by quoting unnamed sources as saying that the Trump administration was also moving forward with a bid to increase North American content requirements for autos to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent, with a new 50 percent U.S. content requirement.

U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) spokeswoman Emily Davis declined to comment on the report, but said President Donald Trump had been clear about the need to shake up the agreement governing one of the world’s biggest trade blocs.

“NAFTA has been a disaster for many Americans, and achieving his objectives requires substantial change,” she said. “These changes of course will be opposed by entrenched Washington lobbyists and trade associations.”

Officials from auto industry trade groups said they had not seen a rules of origin proposal with such stringent targets.

“Forcing unrealistic rules of origin on businesses would leave the U.S. unable to compete by increasing the cost of manufacturing and raising prices for consumers,” said Cindy Sebrell, a spokeswoman for the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents auto parts manufacturers.

The warning came after the White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump would announce new U.S. responses to Iran’s missile tests, support for “terrorism” and cyber operations as part of his new Iran strategy.

“As we’ve announced in the past, if America’s new law for sanctions is passed, this country will have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km range of Iran’s missiles,” Guards’ commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, according to state media.

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the United States, according to state media, and issued a stark warning to American troops.

“If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world particularly in the Middle East,” Jafari said.

The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are Iran’s most powerful internal and external security force. The Quds Force, the IRGC’s foreign espionage and paramilitary wing, and individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are on the US list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

Iran sees the Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State as an existential threat to the Islamic Republic where the majority of the population are Shi‘ites.

On June 7, Islamic State claimed an attack on Tehran’s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, killing 18 people. The Guards fired missiles at Islamic State bases in Syria on June 18 in response.

Guards commanders have framed their military involvement in Iraq and Syria, where they are fighting to support the government of President Bashar al-Assad, as a fight against Islamic State.

Dozens of members of the Guards, including senior commanders, have been killed in Syria and Iraq.

MISSILE PROGRAM

The website for state TV reported Jafari as adding that the United States was mistaken if it thought it could pressure Iran into negotiating on regional issues.

Jafari also said that Tehran would ramp up its defense capabilities, including its missile program, if the U.S. undermined a nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers.

Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions.

However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel.

“The Americans should know that the Trump government’s stupid behavior with the nuclear deal will be used by the Islamic Republic as an opportunity to move ahead with its missile, regional and conventional defense program,” Jafari said, according to state media.

The prospect of Washington backtracking on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis in the shape of North Korea.

If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. U.N. inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms.

The Guards navy was also carrying out a military exercise on Sunday in the Gulf, an area of tension with the U.S. navy in recent months.

More than 110 vessels were involved in the exercise, including some that have rocket and missile capabilities, a state media report quoted a Guards commander as saying.",Iran warns U.S. against imposing further sanctions,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-guards/iran-warns-u-s-against-imposing-further-sanctions-idUSKBN1CD081

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear weapons were a “powerful deterrent” that guaranteed its sovereignty, state media reported on Sunday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said “only one thing will work” in dealing with the isolated country.

Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.

In a speech to a meeting of the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party on Saturday, a day before Trump’s most recent comments, state media said Kim had addressed the “complicated international situation”.

North Korea’s nuclear weapons are a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,” Kim said, referring to the “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

North Korea is preparing to test-launch such a missile, a Russian lawmaker who had just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday.

Donald Trump has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies.

The situation proved that North Korea’s policy of “byungjin”, meaning the parallel development of nuclear weapons and the economy was “absolutely right”, Kim Jong Un said in the speech.

“The national economy has grown on their strength this year, despite the escalating sanctions,” said Kim, referring to U.N. Security Council resolutions put in place to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program.

“It shows that her portfolio and writ is far more substantive than previously believed and it is a further consolidation of the Kim family’s power,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University’s 38 North website.

In January, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo Jong along with other North Korean officials over “severe human rights abuses”.

Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol, two of the three men behind Kim’s banned rocket program, were also promoted.

State media announced that several other high ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee in what the South Korean unification ministry said could be an attempt by North Korea to navigate a way through its increasing isolation.

“The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong Un is taking the current situation seriously, and that he’s looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians,” the ministry said in a statement.

North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, who named Donald Trump “President Evil” in a bombastic speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, was promoted to full vote-carrying member of the politburo.

“Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea’s top policy makers,” said Madden.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

MANILA (Reuters) - Trust and satisfaction in Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on Sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall.

Net satisfaction, used by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) as a rating of the president’s performance, was down 18 points from the second quarter to 48, classified as “good” in the survey of 1,200 Filipinos conducted in the last week of September.

Duterte’s net trust rating, which gauges public sentiment about his personality, was “very good” at 60 points, down from “excellent” 75 he achieved in the previous poll.

The survey was conducted just a few days after thousands of Filipinos rallied to denounce Duterte, his anti-drug crackdown and what they called an emerging dictatorship.

Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in the crackdown and other SWS polls conducted in September indicated doubts about the validity of official accounts of the 3,800 cases where police killed drug suspects.

The SWS survey did not ask respondents to give a reason for the rating of Duterte, who took office in June 2016. Duterte’s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results.

Political analyst Ramon Casiple, head of the country’s Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said it was normal for a president’s rating to fall during his time in office, but concern over the high death toll in his signature war on drugs will have weighed on sentiment.

Activists accuse Duterte of inciting police to kill drug dealers and users, which he denies. Police reject allegations they are executing suspects and say deaths occurred because victims had violently resisted arrest.

Casiple said that though the poll still showed Duterte had the support of Filipinos, he should take it seriously.

“This is a real diminution of his popularity and it serves as a wakeup call for him to stop it further going down,” Casiple said of the poll.

“However, this is still a comfortable figure and far from the threshold of unpopularity.”

Based on SWS methodology for net trust ratings, a score of 70 and above is considered excellent, 50 to 69 is very good, 30-49 good and 10-29 moderate.

The attack took place near the city of Beni and, if the deaths are confirmed, would be the first mass-killing this year in that area. It has seen relative peace since more than 800 people were killed in dozens of massacres between 2014 and 2016.

The spate of attacks raised serious questions about the state’s ability to impose order over a region full of ethnic tensions and plagued by pockets of lawlessness where armed groups prey on populations and exploit rich mineral reserves.

In the latest attack, on Saturday, assailants armed with machetes and guns ambushed travellers on the main road linking Beni territory in North Kivu province to neighbouring Uganda, Boris Maelezo, a member of parliament from the area, told Reuters.

He said about 30 civilians were riding on motorbikes, with several people on each vehicle, and that most of them could have been killed.

Albert Baliesima Kadukima, another lawmaker from the area, said two women freed by the militants had told local authorities the assailants had slit the throats of more than a dozen people.

Mak Hazukay, a local army spokesman, said Congolese forces were battling the militants and attempting to dislodge them from a section of the road that was several kilometres long.

The two lawmakers and the army spokesman said the militants belonged to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active near the border between Congo and Uganda.

Congolese authorities have blamed almost all the massacres of the past three years on the ADF but independent and U.N. experts say several armed groups as well as national army commanders have orchestrated the killings as they vie for influence in the area.

Eastern Congo is a tinderbox of ethnic tensions and has been racked by conflict for more than two decades. It is the world’s biggest source of coltan, used in mobile phones and other electronic products.

Various armed groups have committed atrocities around Beni since late 2014 to settle scores and undermine rivals, with attacks sometimes sectarian in nature.

Separately, armed men from an ethnic Bantu militia broke out more than 50 inmates on Saturday from a prison in the southeastern town of Pweto, Celestin Ngombe, a local government official, told Reuters.

A series of large-scale prison breaks in recent months, including one in the capital Kinshasa that freed more than 4,000 prisoners, have underscored deteriorating security across the country since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December.",Congo militants ambush and kill travellers in northeast - lawmakers,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-congo-violence/congo-militants-ambush-and-kill-travellers-in-northeast-lawmakers-idUKKBN1CD0I7?il=0

If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

PARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

Interviews with more than a dozen diplomats and government officials based in Washington, Yangon and Europe revealed that punitive measures aimed specifically at top generals were among a range of options being discussed in response to the crisis.

Nothing has yet been decided and Washington and Brussels may decide to hold off for now, the sources said. There are also discussions about increasing aid for violence-riven Rakhine state.

The active discussion of sanctions – not even on the table a month ago – shows how the dramatic exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar’s northwest is putting pressure on Western policymakers to take action.

While much of the outcry overseas has focused on Nobel laureate and Myanmar’s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, few Western diplomats see an alternative to her leadership. Suu Kyi does not control the military, which still wields considerable power under Myanmar’s army-written constitution.

The EU Foreign Ministers Council will discuss Myanmar on Oct. 16, although officials do not expect any move on sanctions that soon. Danish minister for development cooperation, Ulla Tornaes, told Reuters that Copenhagen had been working to get the crisis on the agenda, “with the wish to put further pressure on the military”.

Two Washington-based U.S. officials with knowledge of the Trump administration’s Myanmar deliberations said targeted sanctions against commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and several other generals, as well as leaders of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist militias accused of torching Rohingya villages, were under consideration.

Such sanctions - if decided on - would likely entail U.S. asset freezes, bans on travel to the United States, prohibitions against Americans doing business with them and other unspecified penalties. Washington was moving cautiously as it consulted with governments in Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia, the U.S. officials said.

A senior Yangon-based European diplomat also said Western countries were coordinating their response to the crisis and were in agreement that it was the military, and specifically the commander-in-chief, who needed to be targeted in any punitive action.

Any punishment was likely to be symbolic at first to allow room for further talks, Yangon-based diplomats said, giving the example of formally banning the army chief, who over the past year visited Brussels, Berlin and Vienna, from further travel to Europe.

Western diplomats admit their leverage is limited: compared with China, whose ties with Myanmar have warmed since Suu Kyi took office 18 months ago, U.S. and European investment and military engagement with the country are small.

They are also wary of action that could hurt the wider economy or destabilize already tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army.

PRESSURE BUILDING

The United Nations is pressing for increased humanitarian access to other parts of Rakhine, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain. How Myanmar responds to calls for increased aid, the investigation of alleged atrocities or repatriation of refugees would be a key consideration in deciding what action to take, U.S. and EU diplomats in Myanmar said.

“We can pile political pressure, look into financing we have in Myanmar. We have humanitarian aid, as well as development aid ... the European Commission won’t invest in the development of Myanmar if the conditions, including security, are not there,” said a Brussels-based EU diplomat who follows Myanmar.

“There is also the arms trade embargo and we discuss regularly whether we should reward the reforms in Myanmar and look at gradual easing of that, or the opposite.”

EU economic sanctions on Myanmar were lifted after the army stepped back from direct rule of the country in 2012, beginning the democratic transition that brought Suu Kyi to power last year, but an arms embargo in force since the 1990s remains. The United States removed most sanctions on Myanmar last autumn. It too has kept an arms embargo in place.

One Washington-based U.S. official said that, while there was no firm deadline, Washington hoped to have a plan of action on Myanmar in place by the time President Donald Trump travels to Asia for a series of summits in the first half of November.

The administration wanted to send a strong message to Myanmar’s military, but was concerned that too drastic action could allow China to expand its growing diplomatic and economic influence in the country, the official said.

There is little support in the administration for the re-imposition of broader economic sanctions, the official added.

The White House declined comment on internal deliberations on the Rohingya crisis.

STRAINED RELATIONS

In another sign of pressure building on Myanmar, New York-based diplomats said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the U.N. General Assembly was pushing for a human rights resolution on the country.

Last year the EU announced that for the first time in 15 years it would not introduce a resolution at the General Assembly’s Third Committee, which focuses on human rights, condemning Myanmar’s record - rewarding it for progress.

The European bloc could revive the resolution in the current session, taking on board the OIC draft and broadening it out beyond the Rohingya crisis, one diplomat in New York said.

Diplomats said some members of the U.N. Security Council were exploring whether the 15-member body could agree a formal statement, or even a resolution, calling for an end to the violence, full access for aid and the safe return of refugees.

However, Myanmar has said it was negotiating with China and Russia, which have veto powers in the Security Council, to protect it from any possible action. China and Russia have both expressed support for the Myanmar government.

Myanmar’s relations with the U.N. have grown increasingly testy since the discovery of World Food Programme-branded biscuits at a suspected militant camp in July prompted the government to accuse the U.N. agency of supporting the insurgents, forcing it to shut down its operations in Rakhine.

Myanmar is stalling on accepting a plan by the U.N. to upgrade the U.N. country head to the more powerful rank of Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) when its current top official, who is due to be rotated, is replaced.

Thaung Tun, Suu Kyi’s National Security Advisor, told Reuters that the U.N. “must treat us equally”.

“We’ll be fine with anybody if all member states have an ASG assigned. Not just us,” he said.",West edges towards punishing Myanmar army leaders over Rohingya crisis: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-myanmar-rohingya-sanctions-exclusive/exclusive-west-edges-towards-punishing-myanmar-army-leaders-over-rohingya-crisis-sources-idUKKBN1CD0RB

Parts of an industry long used to labor unrest are now contending with community protests that have cut production of the country’s largest mineral export earner, platinum, and may shut some operations down altogether.

At the heart of the conflict are tribal leaders who have royal titles and feudal-style control over the homelands, poor rural areas designated to South Africa’s black majority by its former white minority rulers during apartheid.

Tribal leaders are also key allies of President Jacob Zuma, whose political base has become increasingly rural, and his African National Congress party has drafted a law that would cement their control.

But with protests spreading across the homelands, the communities, mining companies and some within the ANC itself are moving to change what they see as an anachronistic system.

The traditional leaders have acted as intermediaries with companies which have discovered chrome and coal as well as platinum in the homelands and hope to find shale gas. Many locals say they are seeing none of the proceeds.

“If they don’t give us that 175 million rand ($13 million), we are going to shut down the mine,” said Chippa Langa, a leader of the community around the Mogalakwena platinum mine, referring to a community fund set up by Anglo American Platinum (Amplats).

To avoid such an outcome, a leading human rights lawyer is negotiating with the local royal house to allow community representatives more control over the fund.

“We are renegotiating the agreement to make it more accountable,” said the lawyer, Richard Spoor, whose work has included spearheading a class action suit against gold producers over the fatal lung disease silicosis which miners contract.

It is a plan that, if copied elsewhere, would dilute the power of the tribal leaders and could do the same to the ANC, which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994.

But Spoor says he and his legal team, who are acting for the communities rather than the mine, are not undermining tradition.

“Our view is that this more democratic model is far more aligned with traditional law and custom. We don’t regard the current very authoritarian top-down style of chieftanship as consistent with the traditional institution.”

Zolani Mkiva, head of presidency at Contralesa, the umbrella group for South Africa’s traditional leaders, agreed that the African way is bottom up, but said what he called isolated cases involving some mining deals were giving the chiefs a bad name.

“They tend to attract attention and create an impression that this represents the African way of leadership,” he said.

Chris Griffith, chief executive of Amplats, a unit of Anglo American, said the company was fully behind the restructuring of the community trust and was applying the lessons learned to other deals.

“What we are trying to do is get away from some of the previous structures where we felt obliged to pay the money over to the Kgoshi (chief),” Griffiths told Reuters, noting a new-style deal on a chrome project in February. At that project, there have been no protests so far.

LAND RIGHTS

Discontent has not been confined to Mogalakwena, the world’s largest open-pit platinum mine, where Amplats says protests two years ago cost it 8,600 ounces of its annual 200,000-plus ounces of production.

Impala Platinum’s Marula mine says it lost 10,000 ounces of almost 80,000 ounces of production in the last financial year to community protests that included road blocks, vehicle stonings and assaults on people reporting for work.

A nearby chrome project it set up with a tribal council - made up of a chief and his aides - has collapsed and Impala says it may soon have to close Marula, which would be the first such shutdown in South Africa linked purely to social upheaval.

Falling platinum prices have multiplied the pressure.

Implats CEO Nico Muller told Reuters the company would not change the structure itself but wanted the two sides to resolve their differences. “The way they apply the proceeds is perceived not to benefit the broader community,” he said.

Around Mogalakwena, set amid rust-tinged rocky outcrops in sweltering latitudes north of Johannesburg, resentment over grinding poverty runs deep.

“I never worked in the mine. I never got benefit, nothing,” said 57-year-old Leg Phalanea as he walked down a dusty street near the mine.

The bill before parliament formalizes the current political system in the homelands with a clause allowing traditional councils to enter partnerships with any “body or institution”. It says such deals “must be beneficial to the community represented by such council”, but does not require consultation.

However, Richard Mdakane, an ANC MP who chairs the parliamentary committee on traditional matters, said villagers should have more say. “We are amending many clauses that were there just to make sure that the bill allows community participation in these processes,” he said.

Some in the ANC are seeking to go further by ending the chief’s role as custodians of land now regarded as communal by giving villagers title deeds to the land they plough.

ANC Treasurer Secretary Zweli Mkhize - seen as a contender to replace Zuma as party chief at a December conference where policy positions will also be adopted - told Reuters: “We are discussing this issue. There is a huge discussion about what kind of land tenure we need in the former homelands.”

Tribal power is already ebbing in places such as Mogalakwena. Villagers there have agreed a new trust structure with four trustees: one from Amplats, one independent, and the other two from the royal Mapela clan, to replace a structure dominated by the tribal council.

Former chief Kgabagare Langa, who has been ousted in a dispute, said he is challenging his removal in court. The new chief, or Kgoshi, Hans Langa, said he could not comment on the restructuring as his lawyers were working on it.

Residents say they have received positive signals from the new chief’s camp and Amplats’ Griffith said the company was just waiting for him to settle in.

“It’s clear the new Kgoshi will want to see peace in Mapela,” said Jonathon Manamela, 53, treasurer of the Mapela Executive Committee, a community group involved in the talks. “Our culture believes you are a king because of the people.”

Ce rassemblement, organisé en plein coeur de la zone de production du foie gras des Landes, à une cinquantaine de kilomètres au Sud-Ouest de Mont-de-Marsan, se voulait pacifique et unitaire mais aussi déterminé.

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp abandoned its C$15.7 billion ($12.52 billion) cross-country Energy East pipeline on Thursday amid mounting regulatory hurdles, dealing a blow to the country’s oil export ambitions.

The demise of the pipeline comes less than a year after the Canadian government rejected another export pipeline, Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway, and is a further setback for Canada’s oil industry which is already hurting from low global crude prices.

The vast majority of Canadian crude exports go to the United States, and Energy East would have shipped 1.1 million barrels a day to east coast ports for loading onto tankers destined for higher-priced markets in Europe and Asia.

Concern about limited market access is one of the reasons foreign oil companies have sold off $23 billion in Canadian assets this year, along with high production costs that have made the country’s oil sands unattractive.

“It means reduced (options) for Canada and Canadian oil producers to access global markets and to receive fair pricing for one of our country’s most important export products,” said Brett Harris, spokesman for Canada’s No. 3 oil sands producer Cenovus Energy.

The cancellation heads off a broader political row over the project for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government, however, which is trying to balance diversifying Canada’s oil export markets with a commitment to tackling climate change.

TransCanada said last month it could abandon the project, weeks after Canada’s National Energy Board (NEB) announced a tougher review process that would take into account indirect greenhouse gas contributions among other factors.

On Thursday TransCanada canceled the plan, citing its review of “changed circumstances” and said it would take a fourth-quarter C$1 billion after-tax non-cash charge.

‘JOB LOSSES’

When it was announced in 2013, Energy East was hailed as a nation-building project that would unlock Canadian exports and boost economic growth along its route.

“The loss of this major project means the loss of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars for Canada, and will significantly impact our country’s ability to access markets for our oil and gas,” the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) said in a statement.

Pipeline supporters and the Alberta government have criticized the NEB for changing its review scope and provincial Premier Rachel Notley urged the regulator to give more clarity on its process.

While Energy East’s collapse may cost Trudeau support in the traditionally conservative oil heartland of Alberta it is likely to prove popular in the eastern province of Quebec, which has far more parliamentary seats and where pipeline opposition from politicians and environmental groups had been stiff.

Canada’s Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said the cancellation was a business decision and oil markets had changed since the pipeline was first proposed.

Oil prices have roughly halved since 2014.

TransCanada’s decision is also a blow to the ailing economy of New Brunswick province, where the pipeline would have terminated. Premier Brian Gallant said he believed low crude prices had killed the project.

Environmental groups welcomed the decision to scrap a pipeline they said was at odds with Canada’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Analysts said the decision to abandon it was already priced into the stock. Shares were last up 0.7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$61.29. They had fallen 3.2 percent since Aug. 23 - when the NEB expanded the scope of its assessment.

MANILA (Reuters) - Trust and satisfaction in Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on Sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall.

Net satisfaction, used by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) as a rating of the president’s performance, was down 18 points from the second quarter to 48, classified as “good” in the survey of 1,200 Filipinos conducted in the last week of September.

Duterte’s net trust rating, which gauges public sentiment about his personality, was “very good” at 60 points, down from “excellent” 75 he achieved in the previous poll.

The survey was conducted just a few days after thousands of Filipinos rallied to denounce Duterte, his anti-drug crackdown and what they called an emerging dictatorship.

Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in the crackdown and other SWS polls conducted in September indicated doubts about the validity of official accounts of the 3,800 cases where police killed drug suspects.

The SWS survey did not ask respondents to give a reason for the rating of Duterte, who took office in June 2016. Duterte’s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results.

Political analyst Ramon Casiple, head of the country’s Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said it was normal for a president’s rating to fall during his time in office, but concern over the high death toll in his signature war on drugs will have weighed on sentiment.

Activists accuse Duterte of inciting police to kill drug dealers and users, which he denies. Police reject allegations they are executing suspects and say deaths occurred because victims had violently resisted arrest.

Casiple said that though the poll still showed Duterte had the support of Filipinos, he should take it seriously.

“This is a real diminution of his popularity and it serves as a wakeup call for him to stop it further going down,” Casiple said of the poll.

“However, this is still a comfortable figure and far from the threshold of unpopularity.”

Based on SWS methodology for net trust ratings, a score of 70 and above is considered excellent, 50 to 69 is very good, 30-49 good and 10-29 moderate.

While his political opponents chide him for his authoritarian style and intolerance of dissent, Duterte enjoys a cult-like following and support from millions of Filipinos, who see him as the best hope for change in a country with rampant crime and a yawning gap between rich and poor.","Philippine president sees biggest ratings dip, but popularity intact",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-philippines-politics-duterte/philippine-president-sees-biggest-ratings-dip-but-popularity-intact-idUKKBN1CD0NQ?il=0

(Reuters) - World number one Rafael Nadal produced a ruthless performance to thrash Australian Nick Kyrgios 6-2 6-1 in the China Open final on Sunday for his 75th career singles title.

The 31-year-old was given a tough fight early on but Kyrgios’s challenge faded after he lost his temper and was docked a penalty point at 2-5 in the first set.

Nadal’s previous title at the tournament came 12 years ago.

“I had very tough draw here,” Nadal, who saved match points in his opening round against Frenchman Lucas Pouille, said.

“I was lucky the first day saving the two match points but after that I think I played one of my best events of the year.”

World number 19 Kyrgios matched Nadal early on, winning his opening two service games but became involved in a debate with umpire Mohamed Lahyani over a close line call against him.

“I can’t play at 100 percent if that stuff happens -- and then you expect me not to be angry,” Kyrgios told Lahyani.

He continued to argue the toss with the official who eventually awarded a penalty point against the Australian during the changeover when he trailed 2-5, meaning he began the eighth game already 0-15 behind.

Nadal was well in control by then and he raced into a 5-0 lead in the second set before Kyrgios slightly delayed the inevitable as the Spaniard sauntered to his 12th consecutive win.

“He played well. I played terrible. He’s in great form. He just destroyed me today, so it was too good,” Kyrgios, who struck 20 winners but 35 unforced errors, said.

“I put in a pretty good week, had some good wins. It’s tough to find positives when you won three games in the final. But I guess there were positives. In the semi-final I played well, obviously beating Alex (Zverev).”

Kyrgios still has a chance of qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals as he is 15th in the Race standings with several tournaments remaining to close the gap on those in front.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Friday pushed back the unveiling of the company’s big rig truck until mid-November, tweeting that the electric vehicle maker was diverting resources to fix production bottlenecks of its new Model 3 sedan and to help Puerto Rico.

Musk said Tesla’s Model 3 was “deep in production hell” echoing his own comments in July, when he showed off some of the first cars of that model.

The Model 3 could help Tesla approach its goal of becoming more of a mass market producer. Recent comments have tempered expectations about the speed of the increase in production, though.

Musk’s comments came after the close of stock trading on Friday. The company’s shares fell 0.8 percent in extended trading.

The Palo Alto, California-based company delivered just 220 Model 3 sedans and produced 260 in the third quarter. It had planned to produce more than 1,500.

Musk also tweeted the company was diverting resources to increasing battery production to help hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, where most residents remain without electricity.

Earlier this week Tesla reported that “production bottlenecks” had left it behind the planned ramp-up for the Model 3.

In response to a Tesla customer asking if he would get his car delivered this year, Musk tweeted, “December will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now.”

A Wall Street Journal report said parts of Model 3 were being made by hand as recently as early September, adding to production delays. (on.wsj.com/2kt5E17)

Musk also said Tesla would reschedule the unveiling of its semi-truck to Nov. 16 as it focuses on fixing production issues tied to Model 3 and increases battery production for Puerto Rico.

The unveiling of the truck, called Tesla Semi, has been delayed for the second time this year. Musk had initially said the truck would be unveiled in September, but he later rescheduled it to late October.

“Semi specs are better than anything I’ve seen reported so far. Semi eng/design team work is aces, but other needs are greater right now,” Elon replied to a twitter user who asked him about the specifications of the semi-truck.

Reuters in August reported that the truck would have a working range of 200-300 miles.

Earlier in the day, Musk said the company will send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out power on the island over two weeks ago.",Tesla delays big rig truck debut; Model 3 in 'production hell',http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-truck/tesla-delays-big-rig-truck-debut-model-3-in-production-hell-idUSKBN1CB2NQ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Russian officials have accused Washington of putting unwarranted pressure on the U.S. operations of RT, a Kremlin-funded broadcaster accused by some in Washington of interfering in domestic U.S. politics, which it denies.

The foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said the full weight of the U.S. authorities was being brought to bear against RT’s operations in the United States, and that Moscow had the right to respond.

“We have never used Russian law in relation to foreign correspondents as a lever of pressure, or censorship, or some kind of political influence, never,” Zakharova said in an interview with Russia’s NTV broadcaster. “But this is a particular case.”

She cited a 1991 Russian law which, she said, stated that if a Russian media outlet is subject to restrictions in a foreign country, then Moscow has the right to impose proportionate restrictions on media outlets from that country operating inside Russia.

“Correspondingly, everything that Russian journalists and the RT station are subject to on U.S. soil, after we qualified it as restriction of their activities, we can apply similar measures to American journalists, American media here, on Russian territory,” Zakharova said.

She did not identify any specific U.S. media outlets that would be targeted. She said it made no difference from the Russian government’s point of view if those outlets were backed by the U.S. state, or privately-funded.

Late last month, Russia’s state communications regulator accused U.S. TV channel CNN International of violating its license to broadcast in Russia and said it had summoned the broadcaster’s representatives in connection with the matter.

The watchdog did not publicly disclose the nature of the violation. The head of the regulator said it was a technical matter and denied that politics was involved.

U.S. intelligence officials, in a report in January this year into allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, said RT was part of a state-run propaganda machine that supported a Kremlin campaign to influence U.S. politics.

The award to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) was unexpected, particularly in a year when the architects of the 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran had been seen as favorites for achieving the sort of diplomatic breakthrough that has won the prize in the past. (Graphics on 'Nobel Laureates' - here)

Supporters described the award as a potential breakthrough for a global movement that has fought to ban nuclear arms from the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in August 1945.

ICAN’s Executive Director Beatrice Fihn told Reuters the group was elated. “This. Is. Surreal.” she later tweeted.

Asked if she had a message for North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un, who has tested nuclear arms in defiance of global pressure, and President Donald Trump, who has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea to protect the United States and its allies, Fihn said both leaders need to know that the weapons are illegal.

“Nuclear weapons are illegal. Threatening to use nuclear weapons is illegal. Having nuclear weapons, possessing nuclear weapons, developing nuclear weapons, is illegal, and they need to stop,” she told Reuters.

Two days before her group won the prize, Fihn had tweeted that Trump was “a moron”. She told Reuters she had written this in jest, in the context of news reports that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had used the same word to describe his boss. But she said Trump’s impulsive character illustrated the importance of banning nuclear arms for all countries.

“A man you can bait with a tweet seems to be taking irrational decisions very quickly and not listening to expertise, it just puts a spotlight on what do nuclear weapons really mean. There are no right hands for the wrong weapons,” she said.

ICAN describes itself as a coalition of grassroots non-government groups in more than 100 nations. It began in Australia and was officially launched in Vienna in 2007.

In her speech announcing the prize, Berit Reiss-Andersen, the leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said the risk that nuclear weapons might be used was now “greater than it has been for a long time”.

“Some states are modernizing their nuclear arsenals, and there is a real danger that more countries will try to procure nuclear weapons, as exemplified by North Korea.”

The award was hailed by anti-nuclear campaigners around the world. “Now more than ever we need a world without nuclear weapons,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted.

Mikiso Iwasa, an 88-year-old Hiroshima survivor, told Reuters the prize would help push the movement forward.

“It is wonderful we have this Nobel Peace-Prize winning movement. All of us need to join forces, think hard and walk forward together to turn this momentum into something even bigger,” he said.

The prize seeks to bolster the case for disarmament amid nuclear tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, as well as uncertainty over the fate of the 2015 deal between Iran and major powers to limit Tehran’s nuclear program.

The prize-giving committee made no mention of Iran in its award citation. It raised eyebrows with its decision to award the prize to an international campaign group with a relatively low profile, rather than recognize the Iran deal, a complex agreement hammered out over years of high-stakes diplomacy.

“Norwegian Nobel Committee has its own ways, but the nuclear agreement with Iran achieved something real and would have deserved a prize,” tweeted Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister who has held top posts as an international diplomat.

The Iran accord, which Trump has repeatedly called “the worst deal ever negotiated”, is seen as under particular threat this week. A senior administration official said on Thursday Trump is expected to “decertify” the pact, a step which could allow Congress to restore sanctions on Iran.

The committee may have been reluctant to reward the Iranian government for its role in the nuclear deal because the only Iranian winner so far, 2003 laureate Shirin Ebadi, a lawyer and human rights campaigner, is forced to live in exile.

“I think the committee has thought about the human rights situation in Iran. It would have been difficult to explain the prize even though it has a favorable view of the Iran deal,” Asle Sveen, a historian of the Nobel Peace Prize, told Reuters.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee denied that giving the prize to an anti-nuclear group was intended either as a rebuke to Trump, or as a snub to the architects of the Iran nuclear deal.

“The Iran treaty is a positive development, a disarmament development that is positive, but the reason we mentioned North Korea (in our statement) is a reference to the threat that people actually feel,” Reiss-Andersen told Reuters. “Iran has not voiced recent threats to use nuclear weapons.”

ICAN has campaigned for a U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted by 122 nations in July this year.

That agreement is not signed by -- and would not apply to -- any of the states that already have nuclear arms, which include the five U.N. Security Council permanent members, the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, as well as India, Pakistan and North Korea. Israel is also widely assumed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies it.

Major allies of the declared nuclear powers also oppose the new treaty. Nevertheless, campaigners see it as a framework that would make it easier for countries that have nuclear arms to work toward eliminating them.

NATO member Norway congratulated ICAN but said it would not sign the treaty to ban nuclear weapons. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by a committee appointed by the Norwegian parliament.

“Norway will not support proposals in the UN that would weaken NATO’s role as a defence alliance,” Prime Minister Erna Solberg said.

Nuclear-armed nations, including the United States and Russia, back the U.N.’s 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty which sets limits on the spread of atomic weapons and has a long-term goal of nuclear disarmament.

“There is a strong logic in this peace prize,” said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute “It’s all about encouraging governments to do what they have promised to do in the non-proliferation treaty.”

But reigning 2015 champions Nuon from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands believes it has a good chance of retaining the prize.

“All the cars look completely different (this year), and all we know is we’ve got a good car, we’ve got it running perfectly the last couple of days and we’re confident we’re going to do everything to win,” tour manager Sarah Benninkbolt said Sunday.

The Bank of England said last month that lenders had underestimated the risks from a surge in consumer borrowing, and they needed to hold an extra 10 billion pounds of capital to guard against future dangers.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s Angela Merkel was meeting leaders of her Bavarian conservative sister party on Sunday to hammer out policy differences, including on immigration, which could clear the way for talks with two other parties on a coalition.

It could take months to get a full coalition deal and investors are concerned about the prospect of a policy standstill in Europe’s biggest economy. If no deal is reached, the prospect of a minority government or new elections loom.

“We must form a government quickly. This is about more than just us,” Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told the conservative youth wing in Dresden on Saturday.

“Agreement on a common position is necessary and possible tomorrow,” added de Maiziere, who is a member of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU).

A weakened Merkel, in power since 2005, aims to build a nationally untested coalition between her conservative bloc and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmentalist Greens who are far apart on issues from tax and energy to Europe.

Merkel has first to get her own house in order and agree on common ground between her CDU and Bavaria’s Christian Social Union (CSU) who have for decades formed a parliamentary bloc together.

The CSU has made Merkel’s life difficult after she won a fourth term as chancellor in a Sept. 24 vote but bled support to the far-right.

The main round of talks got going early on Sunday afternoon and it was unclear how long they would go on. The CDU had held a preparatory meeting in the morning.

The main sticking point is immigration.

The CSU blames Merkel’s decision in 2015 to keep Germany’s borders open, resulting in almost 1 million people arriving in the country that year, many fleeing war and hunger in the Middle East and Africa. Most entered via the southern state of Bavaria.

Ever since, the CSU has insisted on an upper limit on refugees of 200,000 a year.

Merkel rules out a cap, saying it would breach Germany’s constitution which guarantees the right of asylum to anyone facing political persecution.

Fearing heavy losses to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in a state election next year, the CSU is digging in its heels on the issue.

The stakes are also high for the CSU’s combative leader Horst Seehofer who is fighting for his political survival after a poor election performance. The CSU slumped to 6.2 percent, measured nationally, from 7.4 percent in 2013.

At the conservative youth conference, Merkel said the talks with the CSU, which will include leading members of both parties, would be difficult but she implored both sides to compromise.

An immigration law, which has some support among conservatives, FDP and Greens, could provide wiggle room by distinguishing between economic migrants and refugees and controlling migration to help plug gaps in the labor market.",Merkel holds crunch talks with Bavaria allies on coalition path,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CD0FI-OCATP
755,"['boeing', 'backs', 'jets', 'states', 'decision', 'united', 'canada', 'complaint', 'trade', '300', 'cseries', 'duties', 'bombardier']","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has notched up proposed trade duties on Bombardier Inc CSeries jets to nearly 300 percent, affirming Boeing Co’s complaint that the Canadian company received illegal subsidies and dumped the planes at “absurdly low” prices.
The new duty follows a preliminary finding that Bombardier sold 75 CSeries jets below cost to Delta Air Lines Inc in 2016.
The duties are expected to heighten trade tensions between the United States, Canada and Britain, where CSeries wings are made.
The United States, Canada and Mexico also are negotiating to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement.
“Bombardier always has the option of coming into full compliance with trade laws,” Boeing added.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has notched up proposed trade duties on Bombardier Inc CSeries jets to nearly 300 percent, affirming Boeing Co’s complaint that the Canadian company received illegal subsidies and dumped the planes at “absurdly low” prices.

The decision underscored the defensive trade policy of U.S. President Donald Trump, and could effectively halt sales of Bombardier’s innovative new plane to U.S. airlines by quadrupling the cost of the jets imported to the United States.

The Commerce Department proposed a 79.82 percent antidumping duty on Friday, on top of a 219.63 percent duty for subsidies announced last week.

The new duty follows a preliminary finding that Bombardier sold 75 CSeries jets below cost to Delta Air Lines Inc in 2016. The total was well above the 80 percent Boeing sought in its complaint.

The proposed duties would not take effect unless affirmed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) early next year.

The duties are expected to heighten trade tensions between the United States, Canada and Britain, where CSeries wings are made. The United States, Canada and Mexico also are negotiating to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement.

After the first duty was announced on Sept. 26, Canada and Britain threatened to avoid buying Boeing military equipment, saying duties on the CSeries would reduce U.S. sales and put thousands of Bombardier jobs in their countries at risk.

“This is a disappointing statement but hardly surprising given last week’s preliminary ruling sided with Boeing,” a British government spokesman said on Saturday.

“We continue to make all efforts alongside the Canadian government to get Boeing to the table to resolve the case.”

Bombardier shares were last up 0.5 percent to C$2.20. Some analysts said the muted response reflected a view that the penalties might not actually be applied.

Boeing, the world’s largest plane maker, hailed the decision and hinted at an alternative for Bombardier.

“These duties are the consequence of a conscious decision by Bombardier to violate trade law and dump their CSeries aircraft to secure a sale,” Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement.

“Bombardier always has the option of coming into full compliance with trade laws,” Boeing added.

Canada’s foreign ministry said Boeing was “manipulating the U.S. trade remedy system” to keep the CSeries out of the country.

Canada is in “complete disagreement” with the decision and would keep raising concerns with the United States and Boeing, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

To win its case before the ITC, Boeing must prove it was harmed by Bombardier’s sales, despite not using one of its own jets to compete for the Delta order.

Bombardier said it was confident that the ITC would find Boeing was not harmed, calling the Commerce Department decision a case of “egregious overreach.”

Delta said the decision was preliminary and it was confident the ITC “will conclude that no U.S. manufacturer is at risk” from Bombardier’s plane.

Boeing has said the dispute was about “maintaining a level playing field” and was not an attack on Canada or Britain.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the decision affirmed Trump’s “America First” policy.

“We will ... do everything in our power to stand up for American companies and their workers,” Ross said in a statement.

But the industry is not so simple. More than half of the purchased content of each CSeries aircraft comes from U.S. suppliers, Bombardier has said. The plane supports an estimated 22,700 jobs and Bombardier’s aerospace division spent $2.14 billion in the United States last year, according to the company and documents seen by Reuters.

Boeing has said the CSeries would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada and Britain and a $2.5 billion equity infusion from the province of Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015.",U.S. backs 300 percent in duties on Bombardier after Boeing complaint,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-bombardier-commerce/u-s-backs-300-percent-in-duties-on-bombardier-after-boeing-complaint-idUSKBN1CB29X?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo

LONDON (Reuters) - When Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund’s no-nonsense boss, spoke to Harvard University this past week, she had some good news: nearly 75 percent of the world is experiencing an economic upswing.

Why, then, was her speech given the somewhat bearish title “A Time to Repair the Roof”?

One reason is that the IMF has to worry about everyone, not just those who are doing well. If nearly 75 percent of world economies are growing, more than 25 percent are not.

Some of the strugglers - not for the first time - can be found in Africa, where the two biggest economies, Nigeria and South Africa have only just crawled out of recession and could still be teetering.

The IMF’s last outlook for the sub-Sahara region suggests 2017 growth of 2.6 percent - around a full percentage below that for the world as a whole and less than half the 1999-2008 average of 5.6 percent.

“The recovery is not complete,” Lagarde told the Harvard audience. “Some countries are growing too slowly, and last year 47 countries experienced negative GDP growth per capita.”

This brings up a second reason for Lagarde’s tempered celebration of recovery - inequality.

There is no question that the gap between countries has been narrowing, as Lagarde told the Harvard glitterati. China, Brazil and India, for example, are now major economic players. But within economies themselves there are many left behind.

Most of these are the “bottom billion” described by economist Paul Collier in his 2007 book of the same name - people completely untethered to the global economy and any wealth it might bring.

But others in advanced economies - though relatively less poor - are now railing against being left behind. They range from Britain’s public servants to primary school teachers in the Netherlands and nurses in parts of Australia.

The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, and the rise -- albeit modest -- of the far right in Germany are all widely viewed as reflecting disaffection brought on by the unequal share of the global economy’s spoils.

Hence, Lagarde’s focus on what needs to be done right now: rich countries should spend more, central banks should communicate more clearly and public debt needs to be brought under control.

It also explains the title of her address, a riff on John F. Kennedy’s comment: “Pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery... the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.”

EUROPE‘S PROBLEM

It is not unrelated that the euro zone - barreling along a surprisingly smooth growth path - finds itself facing two potentially destructive threats.

The first is the possibility in the coming week that Catalonian separatists will declare unilateral independence from Spain.

Setting aside the politics, such a move could strip nearly 20 percent off Spanish GDP - a bit like California and Florida together cutting loose from the United States.

How the European Union would handle such a things would simply add to its Brexit headache. Rump Spain would retain its place in the top four of euro zone economies, but much diminished.

The second hit would come if eurosceptics - some of who want to leave the euro zone -- gain power in Italy at an election that must take place next year.

Germany’s economy is steaming ahead - latest data: industrial orders soaring in August - and in France, the official statistics agency has raised its 2017 growth outlook to the highest since 2011.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - “Blade Runner 2049” is heading for a downbeat $31.5 million opening weekend at 4,058 sites in North America.

Sunday’s estimated result throws serious doubt onto what had been high hopes for a box office success story. In one of the most surprising turnarounds in recent years, “Blade Runner 2049” fell far short of expectations, which had been in the $45 million to $50 million range at the start of the weekend amid stellar reviews, strong advance ticket sales, and the revered status of 1982’s original “Blade Runner.”

Instead, the film grossed only a moderate $12.7 million on Friday, including $4 million from Thursday night previews. Saturday saw an 11% decline to $11.4 million and Sunday’s projected total was $7.4 million.

The key factors for the under-performance were the movie’s 163-minute running time -- which limits the number of showings each day -- plus far less traction among younger moviegoers than anticipated.

“The core of enthusiastic and loyal ‘Blade Runner’ fans were over 25 and predominantly male and propelled the film as expected to the top spot, but a lengthy running time and lesser interest among females made it tougher for the film to reach the original weekend box office projections,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore.

According to PostTrack, males over 25 represented 50% of the audience and females over 25 were 27%, while males under 25 represented 15% of moviegoers and females under 25 were 8%. Males gave the movie an A CinemaScore, while females gave it a B+.

Warner Bros. is handling domestic distribution on “Blade Runner 2049,” starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, through its output deal with Alcon Entertainment. Financed by Alcon and Sony and laden with special effects, the film carries a $150 million price tag. Denis Villeneuve helms the sequel film, which is set in a bleak 2049 Los Angeles with Gosling starring as an LAPD officer dealing with replicants seeking freedom.

Warner Bros. domestic distribution president Jeff Goldstein said “Blade Runner 2049” had fallen short of expectations in mid-sized and smaller markets along with the South and Midwest, where the running time and Major League Baseball playoffs appeared to have held down attendance.

“We did well in the major and high-profile markets,” he added. “Alcon and Denis made an amazing movie. The audience for it was narrower than we anticipated.”

Fox’s opening of survival drama “The Mountain Between Us,” starring Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, was the weekend’s runner-up, coming in slightly below projections with a moderate $10.1 million at 3,088 venues. Based on the Charles Martin novel, the film stars Elba as a surgeon and Winslet as a journalist who are left stranded together following a plane crash. Reviews have been mixed, earning the film a 46% score on Rotten Tomatoes.

Lionsgate’s animated “My Little Pony” trotted in with a modest $8.8 million at 2,528 locations, slightly above forecasts. Based on the Hasbro toys and TV series, the movie’s voice cast includes Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Uzo Aduba, and Sia.

The fifth weekend of New Line’s blockbuster “It” showed plenty of staying power in third place with $9.6 million at 3,197 sites. It will close the weekend with $305 million domestically plus $298.8 million internationally to top the $600 million worldwide mark.

Fox’s third weekend of “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” and Universal’s second weekend of “American Made” were battling for fifth place with about $8.1 million each, followed by Warner’s third weekend of “The Lego Ninjago Movie” with $6.8 million. Focus Features’ expansion of Judi Dench’s “Victoria & Abdul” came in eighth with $4.1 million at 732 locations.",Box Office: 'Blade Runner 2049' Fades to $31.5 Million Opening Weekend,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-boxoffice/box-office-blade-runner-2049-fades-to-31-5-million-opening-weekend-idUKKBN1CD0R0

While Progress’ Alberta asset produces oil and gas, the North Montney asset is rich in gas resources.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Progress Energy, the Canadian unit of Malaysian state energy firm Petroliam Nasional Berhad, said on Thursday it was looking to sell its Deep Basin oil and gas asset in the Canadian province of Alberta.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that Petroliam Nasional, or Petronas, had enlisted BMO Capital Markets to advise on the sale of the asset, citing documents on the bank’s website.

“Progress regularly reviews its assets to ensure alignment with the company’s strategy,” it said in an emailed statement to Reuters, adding that it decided to sell its Deep Basin asset following the most recent evaluation.

The sale would allow Progress to focus on future investments in its North Montney assets in Canada’s province of British Columbia, which represents “significant growth opportunity” for the company, it said.

The potential sale marks a further retreat by Petronas in Canada after it scrapped plans for the $29 billion Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas export project in British Columbia in July.

While Progress’ Alberta asset produces oil and gas, the North Montney asset is rich in gas resources. Petronas acquired Progress Energy for $5.87 billion in 2012.

After the cancellation of the Pacific NorthWest project, Petronas had said it was looking at other ways to generate revenue from its North American gas assets.

“Despite what it looks like, Petronas’ reported intent to sell off its Alberta oil and gas assets does not appear to signal that the firm is looking to exit from the Canadian upstream entirely,” said Peter Lee, Asia oil and gas analyst at BMI Research.

He said the Alberta asset could be considered “non-core” as Petronas is focusing on developing its gas resources in Canada.

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s plan to cut corporate taxes may add more fuel to the already hot rally in the shares of automation companies.

Fund managers from Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Hodges Capital and Hood Capital say that they expect that companies will use part of their tax savings to invest in high-cost machines that will allow them to reduce labor costs over time.

That would be a boon for companies such as Cognex Corp, which makes so-called machine vision systems that are used to quickly sort and fill orders in e-commerce warehouses, and Faro Technologies Inc, which makes three-dimensional measuring tools that can help lower labor costs on aerospace assembly lines. Cognex shares touched a 52-week high on Friday, while Faro shares at $38.20 were closing in on their year-high of $40.60 reached in August.

“Scarcity of capital is the thing that keeps companies from spending money when it makes sense to do so. Investing in automation would be something that pays for itself quickly,” said Matt Litfin, a portfolio manager of the $4.8-billion Columbia Acorn fund, who owns shares of Cognex. Shares of the company are up 80 percent year-to-date.

Automation companies have rallied overall this year as corporate America looks for ways to maintain margins and productivity at a time when wages are rising and unemployment is low.

The $1.4 billion Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF, which includes a mix of large-cap companies such as Rockwell Automation and Intuitive Surgical, is up over 35 percent for the year to date, nearly triple the 13.5-percent gain in the broad S&P 500 index.

Numerous fund holdings are up over 90 percent for the year to date, including drone manufacturer AeroVironment Inc, gear manufacturer Harmonic Drive Systems Inc, and laser company IPG Photonics Corp.

Large-cap automation companies, such as Rockwell Automation Inc and Emerson Electric Co, have also posted solid returns so far this year, though smaller-cap companies have seen larger share price gains overall.

The Robo ETF has posted positive inflows every week since President Donald Trump’s November election, partly due to investor anticipation of a corporate tax cut. Investors have sent $461 million into the fund since early August, when the Trump administration began publicly discussing its plans to cut the top corporate tax rates to 20 percent, from 35 percent.

Prominent Republican senators such as Bob Corker and Rand Paul have criticized the Trump administration’s plan for its potential to increase the federal deficit, leaving its passage far from certain. Yet fund managers say that they see gains in automation companies continuing regardless of whether a tax bill passes.

“Even eight years after the financial crisis, companies are still very focused on their bottom lines and maintaining efficiency and productivity as much as possible,” said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager of the $743-million Hodges Small Cap fund.

Middleby Corp, which makes smart ovens and other kitchen equipment used in restaurant chains such as Panera Bread, will likely benefit as companies look for ways to reduce labor costs as more states raise the minimum wage, he said.

Shares of Middleby are flat for the year, in part due to slow sales of its Viking line of high-end ovens after the company had to recall some freestanding gas ranges that turned on by themselves with customers unable to turn them off. Hodges said that despite the overhang, the company looks poised to continue to grow as restaurants expand and high real-estate prices prompt more homeowners to upgrade their kitchens.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Catalonia’s capital Barcelona on Sunday to express their opposition to any declaration of independence from Spain, showing how divided the region is on the issue.

The protesters rallied in central Barcelona, waving Spanish and Catalan flags and banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”, as politicians on both sides hardened their positions in the country’s worst political crisis for decades.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Saturday he would not rule out removing Catalonia’s government and calling a fresh local election if it claimed independence, as well as suspending the region’s existing autonomous status.

The stark warning came days before Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the region’s parliament, on Tuesday, when he could unilaterally declare independence.

“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said as she rallied in Barcelona. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.”

The wealthy northeastern region of 7.5 million people, which has its own language and culture, held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 in defiance of a Spanish court ban.

More than 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who voted backed secession, according to Catalan officials. But that turnout represented only 43 percent of the region’s 5.3 million eligible voters as many opponents of independence stayed away.

The Spanish government sent thousands of national police into the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers fired rubber bullets and charged crowds with truncheons in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and dramatically escalated the dispute.

Losing Catalonia is almost unthinkable for the Spanish government.

It would deprive Spain of about 16 percent of its people, a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. Catalonia is also the top destination for foreign tourists, attracting about a quarter of Spain’s total.

The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia. Concern is growing in EU capitals about the impact of the crisis on the Spanish economy, the fourth largest in the euro zone, and on possible spillovers to other economies.

Some European officials are also worried that any softening in Spain’s stance towards Catalan independence could fuel secessionist feelings among other groups in Europe such as Belgium’s Flemings and Italy’s Lombards.

‘DRASTIC SOLUTIONS’

The demonstration in Barcelona was organised by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society under the slogan “Let’s recover our senses” to mobilise what it believes is a “silent majority” of citizens in Catalonia who oppose independence.

“The people who have come to demonstrate don’t feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”

Slideshow (5 Images)

It was a second day of protests after tens of thousands of people gathered in 50 cities across Spain on Saturday, some defending Spain’s national unity and others dressed in white and calling for talks to defuse the crisis.

Until this weekend, Rajoy has remained vague on whether he would use article 155 of the constitution, the so-called nuclear option which enables him to sack the regional government and call a local election.

Asked if he was ready to trigger article 155, Rajoy told El Pais newspaper: “I don’t rule out anything that is within the law ... Ideally, we shouldn’t have to take drastic solutions but for that not to happen there would have to be changes.”

The conservative prime minister ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said he is open to - and said the issue would not force a snap national election.

Rajoy added the government would “prevent any declaration of independence from materialising in anything”.

“Spain will continue being Spain,” he said.

Nicola Sturgeon, the pro-independence leader of Scotland, which voted to remain part of the United Kingdom in a 2014 referendum, said: “Everyone has to accept reality, this will not be resolved by both sides going to extreme positions.”

“You can’t simply say in a democracy there is no legal or legitimate way for people to decide their own future, that would be an absurd position,” she added.",Thousands protest in Barcelona against Catalan independence,https://in.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia/thousands-protest-in-barcelona-against-catalan-independence-idINKBN1CD0FG

Vikram Limaye, who took over as the exchange's chief in July, spoke to Reuters reporters Abhirup Roy and Devidutta Tripathy about the changes he is making, his ambitions for the exchange -- including getting into debt and commodities -- and the latest on the probe and the IPO.



(This interview has been edited for clarity.)





Q: It has been about two months since you took over as CEO. How much progress have you made improving stakeholder relations and strengthening controls and processes?

A: There is a substantial improvement on all fronts ... To the extent that what was done in the past has caused any kind of issues with any of these stakeholders, those are certainly on track in terms of being resolved. We are getting appropriate firms engaged to make sure we conduct all the reviews and tighten areas that need to be tightened.



Q: What about in terms of changing the corporate culture in light of the regulatory probes impacting NSE?

A: It is my view that this issue could have been managed a lot better, and we would not have been where we are ... It has escalated and run out of control because it was probably not handled in a proper way ... I have certainly made it absolutely clear that we have to conduct ourselves in a different way. We have to come across differently. Internally, as well in terms of better collaboration and coming across as being more transparent, helpful, collaborative with the external community.

Q: The regulatory probe into the allegation that some brokers got unfair access to NSE’s co-location servers has been ongoing. Where are things at?



A: We are awaiting a report from Ernst & Young. If you recall, Deloitte was engaged to review the futures and options market. E&Y was engaged to do cash, currency and interest rate futures. So their report is anticipated ... There was a show cause to the NSE and a show cause notice to 14 employees ... SEBI has also engaged Deloitte and E&Y to conduct an exercise with brokers that was mentioned in the Deloitte report. That process has also started.

Q. Do you see any chance of the IPO happening during this financial year by March?



A: To do an IPO by Feb. 15, you have to launch the IPO by end of January. To do that you have to have filed your draft red-herring prospectus by December, assuming that you give SEBI one month to review comments, finalise, etc. ... To anticipate that SEBI would reach a conclusion to settle under consent, complete all the internal processes that we would be in a position to prepare the revised (IPO) document and file it in December is exceedingly unlikely.

Q: There was a big trading disruption at NSE in July. What measures have been taken to prevent a recurrence?

A: We’ve done a series of things to make sure that our contingency steps, our standard operating procedures, everything else is also fixed in order to address something like this if it were to crop up again ... We are tightening our own disaster recovery transition times and making them much faster.



Q: Extending market timing in India has been a recent area of debate. What is your view?

A: We need to provide a level playing field for Indian investors, retail or institutional, to be able to hedge event risk that happens post-1530. For the foreign institutional investors, they can go and do a NIFTY trade on Singapore when India is shut. The Indian investor is taking overnight risk, weekend risk, late-night risk when other markets are open. For that reason, you should at least provide an index hedge even if you don’t keep your cash markets open till 2200 or 2300, or whatever you decide.



Q: What are the key focus areas for growth at NSE in the near future?

A: I‘m hopeful that the bond markets will see more robust development over the next 12-plus months. That is an area of focus certainly for us ... I think it’s important to fund the country’s growth, and it can’t be done only on the back of bank financing ... Second area is commodities. There, while SEBI has now allowed the brokers to combine their equities and commodities platforms, the next step is to allow exchanges to operate across all asset classes.",CEO Interview: India's biggest stock exchange tries to put regulatory probe in the past,https://in.reuters.com/article/nse-vikram-limaye-interview/ceo-interview-indias-biggest-stock-exchange-tries-to-put-regulatory-probe-in-the-past-idINKBN1CB1HW

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index retreated on Friday after touching a seven-month high in the previous session, as energy stocks, hurt by 3 percent drop in oil prices, drove the weaker finish.

The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index fell 47.98 points, or 0.3 percent, to finish at 15,728.32. Half of the index’s 10 key sectors ceded ground.

The TSX closed at 15,776.30 on Thursday, its highest finish since Feb. 23, and added about 0.6 percent on the week, extending a month long rally that has helped bring the index back into positive territory for the year.

“The first eight months were pretty disappointing for the Canadian market compared to the U.S. September’s been very good, so it’s starting to catch up here,” said John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities.

Suncor Energy and Canadian Natural Resources were the most influential decliners on the index. Suncor fell 1.2 percent to C$43.5, while Canadian Natural Resources declined 2.1 percent to C$41.12. Cenovus Energy dropped 3.1 percent to C$12.05.

Oil and gas companies slumped 1.9 percent on oil prices that fell on profit-taking as well as renewed jitters about excess supply. Crude prices snapped a multiweek bull run, with U.S. crude settling at $49.29 a barrel, down 2.95 percent. [O/R]

The heavily weighted financial sector slipped 0.2 percent, while industrials fell 0.4 percent.

Bombardier Inc rose 0.9 percent to C$2.21 even as the U.S. Commerce Department notched up proposed trade duties on the Canadian plane maker’s CSeries jets to nearly 300 percent, affirming Boeing Co’s complaint that Bombardier received illegal subsidies and dumped the planes at “absurdly low” prices.

The materials group, home to mining and other resource companies, added 0.2 percent as gold miners rebounded. Kirkland Lake Gold rallied 5.7 percent to C$17.46.

Element Fleet Management was the most influential gainer on the positive side. The stock surged 10.4 percent to end at C$9.98 on market talk of activist investors agitating for change. A company representative could not be immediately reached for comment.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the TSX by 138 to 107, for a 1.29-to-1 ratio on the downside.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Friday unveiled a blueprint for sweeping reforms of the U.S. capital markets as it looks to implement Republican President Donald Trump’s agenda to promote economic growth by slashing red tape.

The report recommends a raft of measures to encourage companies to seek public listings, to promote company access to capital, and to give investors a wider array of investment opportunities, in what is likely to be a boon for small business, banks, brokers and crowd-funding platforms.

It also called for regulators to put U.S. interests first when engaging in international regulatory forums.

“The U.S. has experienced slow economic growth for far too long,” said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.

“By streamlining the regulatory system, we can make the U.S. capital markets a true source of economic growth which will harness American ingenuity and allow small businesses to grow.”

The 232-page report largely steers clear of proposing legislative changes that would have to be passed by a divided Congress, instead focusing on tweaks that could be made relatively quickly by the country’s two markets regulators, which are both led by Trump appointees.

Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said in statements on Friday they had provided extensive input to the “thoughtful” report and supported its recommendations.

Friday’s report is the second of four expected from the Treasury as it completes a comprehensive review of existing financial rules, as mandated by an executive order President Donald Trump signed in February.

The first report, released in June, sought to promote lending by easing banking regulations outlined under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, with major parts requiring legislative revisions that are unlikely to be passed with Democrats fiercely opposed.

Friday’s report, in contrast, outlines a broad range of 91 technical fixes aimed at boosting stock, bond and derivatives markets. All but nine can be put into effect by the country’s federal regulatory agencies, who were consulted on the report.

The recommendations were met with quick praise from financial industry groups, who said capital markets regulations were also long overdue for a review.

“Efficient capital markets are at the core of a growing and prosperous economy. The Treasury Department’s report offers a blueprint to unlock the resources needed to spur economic growth and job creation,” said David Hirschmann, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Effectiveness.

DISCLOSURE RULES

The Treasury proposes streamlining disclosure and compliance requirements for companies that are both publicly-listed and which are looking to go public, in bid to reduce a secular downward trend in initial public offerings.

It also proposes scrapping a Dodd-Frank rule requiring public companies to disclose information about the potential conflict minerals in their products, and the ratio between the pay for top executives and the company’s average worker.

To boost small companies’ access to capital, the report recommends loosening the rules around crowd-funding, and suggests revising the definition of an ‘accredited investor’ in order to provide more opportunities for mom and pop investors.

The Treasury also waded into the long-running debate over equity market structure, proposing the SEC review share-tick sizes, order types, exchange fee models, and how exchanges themselves operate and are governed.

To reduce regulatory duplication and bring the United States more in line with other markets, the report calls for the SEC and CFTC to work more closely and harmonize their rules, but stopped short of recommending a merger of the two - something policymakers have called for in the past.

“The focus on harmonizing rule sets ... is a vital part of efforts to reduce the compliance burden for derivatives end users,” Scott O’Malia, chief executive of bank group the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and a former CFTC commissioner, said in a statement.

Derivatives dealers also stand to gain from a recommendation to relax rules around swaps trading and the cash they must post against derivatives trades.

While banks, brokers and small companies have cheered the report, many of the requirements are likely to draw criticism from public advocacy groups worried they may reduce investor protections, and open the door for banks to pursue risky trading behavior once again.

“It’s almost uniformly deregulatory. It calls for cutting back on post-crisis Dodd-Frank rules,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform. “It’s quite dangerous.”

“Next week there might be some changes in government.

Mugabe told a meeting of the ruling ZANU-PF youth wing in Harare that it was time to review the performance of his cabinet ministers.

The last cabinet reshuffle was in September 2015 when Mugabe was removing allies of his former deputy Joice Mujuru, whom he fired in December 2014 over accusations that she was plotting to topple him. She denied the allegations.

“Next week there might be some changes in government. Should we remain with the same team or we make changes or even discard some. So that exercise I will be doing it and early next week you will get the results,” Mugabe told a meeting of his ZANU-PF youth wing.

Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a frontrunner to take over from Mugabe, said on Thursday he had been poisoned in August when he fell ill and was airlifted to South Africa, which earned him a public rebuke from First Lady Grace Mugabe.

ZANU-PF is divided into two camps, one supporting Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe and another rallying behind Grace.

Mugabe also castigated his senior party officials for fighting in public, saying this would weaken ZANU-PF and embolden the opposition ahead of elections next year.

“And the public insults, its a shame. A shame even to our legend because our party was not built on that basis.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Friday pushed back the unveiling of the company’s big rig truck until mid-November, tweeting that the electric vehicle maker was diverting resources to fix production bottlenecks of its new Model 3 sedan and to help Puerto Rico.

Musk said Tesla’s Model 3 was “deep in production hell” echoing his own comments in July, when he showed off some of the first cars of that model.

The Model 3 could help Tesla approach its goal of becoming more of a mass market producer. Recent comments have tempered expectations about the speed of the increase in production, though.

Musk’s comments came after the close of stock trading on Friday. The company’s shares fell 0.8 percent in extended trading.

The Palo Alto, California-based company delivered just 220 Model 3 sedans and produced 260 in the third quarter. It had planned to produce more than 1,500.

Musk also tweeted the company was diverting resources to increasing battery production to help hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, where most residents remain without electricity.

Earlier this week Tesla reported that “production bottlenecks” had left it behind the planned ramp-up for the Model 3.

In response to a Tesla customer asking if he would get his car delivered this year, Musk tweeted, “December will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now.”

A Wall Street Journal report said parts of Model 3 were being made by hand as recently as early September, adding to production delays. (on.wsj.com/2kt5E17)

Musk also said Tesla would reschedule the unveiling of its semi-truck to Nov. 16 as it focuses on fixing production issues tied to Model 3 and increases battery production for Puerto Rico.

The unveiling of the truck, called Tesla Semi, has been delayed for the second time this year. Musk had initially said the truck would be unveiled in September, but he later rescheduled it to late October.

“Semi specs are better than anything I’ve seen reported so far. Semi eng/design team work is aces, but other needs are greater right now,” Elon replied to a twitter user who asked him about the specifications of the semi-truck.

Reuters in August reported that the truck would have a working range of 200-300 miles.

Earlier in the day, Musk said the company will send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out power on the island over two weeks ago.",Tesla delays big rig truck debut; Model 3 in 'production hell',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-truck/tesla-delays-big-rig-truck-debut-model-3-in-production-hell-idUKKBN1CB2NQ

LONDON (Reuters) - Low on cash but high on hope, Iran’s technology entrepreneurs are learning to live with revived hostility in the United States and growing suspicion - or worse - from hardliners at home.

Their startups and e-commerce apps are flourishing, driven by government infrastructure support and young Iranians educated both in the country and abroad. Some are even drawing foreign investment in a way that Iran’s dominant oil industry has yet to achieve since most international sanctions were lifted early last year under a nuclear deal with world powers.

Life remains tough despite the easing of Iran’s international isolation. The atmosphere in Washington has soured again, with President Donald Trump signing legislation tightening domestic U.S. sanctions on Iran and threatening to pull out of the nuclear accord.

On top of this, Google and Apple have withdrawn some services temporarily or indefinitely for Iranian users in recent months for reasons including the U.S. sanctions.

Still, the absence of U.S. giants such as Amazon and Uber has allowed their Iranian equivalents Digikala and Snapp to grow rapidly. Many other local internet firms are following suit.

Ramin Rabii, chief executive of Turquoise Partners, which facilitates foreign investment in Iran, said Trump’s rhetoric could paradoxically help the tech sector.

“If he keeps talking about sanctions, that would increase the risk of investment in Iran, but at the same time it will keep a lot of competition out,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview from Tehran. “Major global players are not here.”

No figures are available on foreign investment in Iranian tech firms. Rabii, however, estimated it at hundreds of millions of dollars since the nuclear deal came into force.

By contrast, an expected rush into Iran’s huge energy reserves has yet to materialize. French group Total is investing in a gas project but Tehran has yet to seal any major oil deals with international partners.

Foreign investment in Iranian tech remains modest compared with regional mega-deals such as Amazon’s purchase in March of Dubai-based retailer souq.com. Amazon did not reveal the price but beat off a rival offer worth $800 million.

Still, Rabii sees a bright future. “Many foreign investors ask me what is the best performing sector in Iran for the next decade. I always name e-commerce and the tech sector,” he said.

LOCAL INCARNATIONS

After the relative isolation of the international sanctions era, the tech sector has attracted many young Iranians back from the United States, Canada and Europe. They hope to marry their experience of the startup scene with locally-educated talent.

Reza Arbabian left Canada, where he went as a teenager, to join his family textile business in Iran. But in 2012 he launched Sheypoor, the Iranian answer to Craigslist, a U.S. classified advertisements website.

Sheypoor now employs 200 and recently marked its fifth anniversary. Cash, however, remains tight.

“Many foreign companies are still hesitant and Iranian investors don’t understand the value in e-commerce. They cannot accept that they need to wait for five years for a startup to make profits,” said Arbabian.

Some outside Iran, especially in Europe where the sanctions net is not quite so tight, are nevertheless willing to take the plunge. Swedish-based Pomegranate Investment, for instance, has taken a 43 percent stake in Sheypoor.

On a larger scale, Sarava, Digikala’s main shareholder, is 45 percent-owned by foreign investors. These include Pomegranate, which raised its stake to 15 percent with a 41 million euro ($48 million) investment in 2016.

Following the Amazon model, Digikala has grown into Iran’s biggest internet company with a market share of 85-90 percent, according to Pomegranate. Staff numbers have leapt in the past two years from 800 to more than 2,000.

INFRASTRUCTURE

Iran came late to mass internet access but has invested heavily under President Hassan Rouhani, hoping to attract foreign cash and create more jobs.

According to the Measuring Information Society of Iran, a government-linked portal, more than 62 percent of households were connected to the internet by March 2017. This was up from only 21 percent in 2013, the year Rouhani took office.

Smartphone ownership has also rocketed. Iran, a country of 80 million people, had only two million smartphone users three years ago but the number hit 40 million in 2016.

Such developments encouraged Kamran Adle, an Iranian born and raised in London, to move to Tehran last year.

“Iranian infrastructure has dramatically improved in recent of years. 3G and 4G is much more commonplace than it was a couple of years ago,” said Adle, whose firm Ctrl+Tech invests in early stage startups and helps them to develop apps.

Some Iranian apps are copies of foreign equivalents, made out of the reach of international lawyers. But the years of isolation also forced domestic talent to be more innovative, and Adle says there is no shortage of app developers.

One such is Farshad Khodamoradi, who has designed the app for a job-hunting startup being launched this month. Unlike traditional sites, “3sootjobs” will use an algorithm-driven matching system to connect candidates with the right employers.

Khodamoradi complains about difficulties in accessing foreign tech services, many of which are U.S.-based. “The main problem is that the global services Iranian startups are using can be cut off overnight,” he told Reuters from Tehran.

He cited Google’s Firebase, a platform used to generate push notifications - such as messages to passengers that a taxi has arrived to pick them up - without their having to open the app.

This was unavailable in Iran on a number of occasions in June and July, disrupting startups including taxi hailing apps, he said. Google did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Although technology firms can gain exemptions from the sanctions, U.S. corporations appear unwilling to risk involvement in Iran. In August, Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi threatened to take legal action over Apple’s removal of Iranian apps from its app stores. Apple did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

MESSAGE FROM OBAMA

All this seems in contrast to U.S. promises after the nuclear deal. In March 2016, in a message to the Iranian people, then President Barack Obama said ending international sanctions “would mean more access to cutting-edge technologies, including information technologies that can help Iranian startups”.

Since that message, anti-U.S. Iranian hardliners have followed the growth of startups suspiciously, branding them as vehicles of enemy infiltration. Two foreign-based tech investors have also ended up in prison.

Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese information technology expert with permanent U.S. residency, was jailed in 2016 for 10 years for collaborating against the state. He had attended a conference in Tehran the previous year at the invitation of one of Iran’s vice presidents, only to be arrested by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as he was going to the airport to leave the country.

Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi also got 10 years in 2016 on charges of cooperating with the United States. While under arrest, Namazi appeared in an Iranian documentary seen by Reuters in which he said his mistake had been to accept money for his startup from an organization linked to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The Revolutionary Guards, a military force that runs an industrial empire, largely control telecommunications in Iran.

However, tech entrepreneurs say the environment is generally supportive. “We haven’t come across any of those governmental push-backs,” Adle said.

In the longer term, the sanctions would make using the souq.com model to cash in on Iranian investments much harder.

But Eddie Kerman, of London-based Indigo Holdings which links retail investors to Iranian tech firms, is optimistic.

“American companies like Amazon might not be able to enter the Iranian market, but there is a significant possibility that European or Asian companies buy the larger Iranian players,” he said.",Keeping the competition out: Iran startups thrive despite sanctions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-investment-tech/keeping-the-competition-out-iran-startups-thrive-despite-sanctions-idUSKBN1CB1BB

A year ago, the probability that North Korea would fire a nuclear-tipped missile at the United States was essentially zero; the North did not have the capability to make such an attack. Pyongyang has made technological advances since then.

But despite what some analysts believe, others say there is no definitive, publicly available proof that North Korea has a missile with the range to strike the continental United States, a miniaturized nuclear warhead to mate with it, and the shielding technology to make sure the warhead survives the heat and pressure of reentry to the atmosphere.

That doesn't, of course, mean the show is harmless. But even if the North acquires those technical capabilities, the likelihood it might attack the United States with a nuclear missile will remain exceedingly low, for one overriding reason: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is, as former Obama administration arms control director Jon Wolfsthal has explained in authoritative detail, neither crazy nor suicidal. The North Korean leader knows his regime would be erased within hours (more likely minutes) of his use of a nuclear weapon. Roughly 1,590 nuclear warheads deployed on U.S. ballistic missiles and bombers ensure that result. (The North has acquired the fissile material to build only 10 to 20 nuclear warheads, according to the most authoritative public reporting on the subject.)

It is also quite unlikely that the United States will make a preemptive military strike — conventional or nuclear — on North Korea, because doing so would almost certainly lead to hundreds of thousands of casualties in South Korea, and perhaps many more. Even without recourse to nuclear weapons, the North could fire thousands of rockets and artillery rounds in the early hours of a war, in a barrage of conventional explosives that would, as the North Korean state-run news service has threatened, turn Seoul into a “sea of fire.” Pyongyang also has huge stores of chemical artillery shells and rocket warheads and the capability, therefore, to also turn the South Korean capital into a sea of sarin and VX nerve gas.

In light of the undeniable reality of mutual deterrence, the North Korean ""crisis"" of 2017 can most accurately be seen as a media puppet show put on by Chairman Kim and President Trump for their own public relations purposes. Nonetheless, it’s a dangerous play. In the current overheated media environment, some piece of international theater by Kim or Trump — undertaken for political effect or negotiating edge or ego gratification — could become so magnified by breathless, 24-7 repetition on cable TV and the Internet that it becomes seen as a humiliating national insult. An emotional response to that insult could initiate a spiral of escalation that leads to catastrophe. To put things in more concrete terms: if U.S. forces had shot down the North Korean missile recently fired through Japanese airspace, might Kim, in an act of pique or bravado, have fired another missile, perhaps in the general direction of Guam? Would Trump have then felt compelled to craft a macho response? Etcetera — with a possible end result of mushroom clouds.



The best way to reduce the threat of inadvertent war posed by the invented theatrical crisis in Northeast Asia would be to persuade the prime thespians — Kim and Trump — that the show they have been putting on is unbelievable and unlikely to get either what he wants. But I don’t really expect that my views will motivate two world leaders of high (if largely unearned) self-regard to quickly change their policies on matters of life, death, and television ratings.

So I propose a next-best approach: Journalists should stop writing and broadcasting about the North Korea situation as if everything had changed and war is very near. North Korea has been seeking a usable nuclear arsenal for years. Its latest underground nuclear test had a higher yield than earlier detonations, producing the explosive power of somewhat more than 100,000 tons of TNT, meaning it was four to five times the size of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The larger yield could have come from a fission bomb “boosted” with hydrogen isotopes or a true fusion weapon, commonly known as a hydrogen bomb; experts cannot be sure which, based on the information currently available.

But even if the September 3 test involved a true hydrogen bomb, Sig Hecker—former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory and one of the country’s foremost experts on North Korea’s nuclear program—has told the magazine I edit, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, that it wouldn’t be “a game changer.” If delivered to an American city, any North Korean nuclear bomb — whether based on nuclear fission or fusion, whether its yield is 20 or 100 or 800 kilotons — would produce devastation and the instant death of tens of thousands. That’s a devastating prospect. But again, North Korea’s leaders know that to fire a nuclear weapon at the United States or its allies would constitute certain national suicide.



Clearly, North Korean nuclear bomb and ballistic missile tests are important events that the international news media must report. But the urgency that world news media are imparting to the ""crisis"" is, actually, a factor in extending it, thereby creating opportunities for miscalculation and war. The North Korean situation might begin to devolve into the kind of long slog of difficult diplomacy that leads to an acceptable resolution if more journalists downplayed the Chairman Kim and President Trump Puppet Show and focused on reality: North Korea is a tiny, impoverished country that would be instantly vaporized if it ever launched a serious attack on the United States, and so the probability of such an attack is vanishingly small. Absent a media environment that encourages a perception of crisis, the likelihood of an American preemptive attack is equally small.

Journalists can’t make U.S. and North Korean leaders behave responsibly. But the media can help audiences understand that the Korean “crisis” is really a Korean standoff, and that a puppet show full of bluster is a rather pathetic substitute for professional diplomacy.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear weapons were a “powerful deterrent” that guaranteed its sovereignty, state media reported on Sunday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said “only one thing will work” in dealing with the isolated country.

Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.

In a speech to a meeting of the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party on Saturday, a day before Trump’s most recent comments, state media said Kim had addressed the “complicated international situation”.

North Korea’s nuclear weapons are a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,” Kim said, referring to the “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

North Korea is preparing to test-launch such a missile, a Russian lawmaker who had just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday.

Donald Trump has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies.

The situation proved that North Korea’s policy of “byungjin”, meaning the parallel development of nuclear weapons and the economy was “absolutely right”, Kim Jong Un said in the speech.

“The national economy has grown on their strength this year, despite the escalating sanctions,” said Kim, referring to U.N. Security Council resolutions put in place to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program.

SISTER PROMOTION

“It shows that her portfolio and writ is far more substantive than previously believed and it is a further consolidation of the Kim family’s power,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University’s 38 North website.

In January, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo Jong along with other North Korean officials over “severe human rights abuses”.

Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol, two of the three men behind Kim’s banned rocket program, were also promoted.

State media announced that several other high ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee in what the South Korean unification ministry said could be an attempt by North Korea to navigate a way through its increasing isolation.

“The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong Un is taking the current situation seriously, and that he’s looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians,” the ministry said in a statement.

North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, who named Donald Trump “President Evil” in a bombastic speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, was promoted to full vote-carrying member of the politburo.

“Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea’s top policy makers,” said Madden.

Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. On Sunday he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government.

Trump said on Saturday that he had a good relationship with his secretary of state despite some disagreements.

”We have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes I’d like him to be a little bit tougher, but other than that we have a very good relationship,” he said.

A Russian lawmaker on Friday was quoted saying North Korea was preparing to test a long-range missile that it believes can reach the west coast of the United States. Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament’s international affairs committee, was part of a Russian delegation that visited Pyongyang from Oct. 2-6, according to Russian RIA news agency.

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility.
Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll.","Unlike the nerve-jangling elections earlier this year in the Netherlands, France and Britain, Germany’s has been notably dull. The country that invented “Sturm und Drang” is showing a distinct lack of storm and stress as Angela Merkel heads towards a fourth term as chancellor.

That seemingly inexorable outcome on Sept. 24 has raised hopes that she will push through greater integration within the euro area, in partnership with French president Emmanuel Macron, while also championing the rules-based international order that America has forsaken under Donald Trump. But Merkel will find it hard to satisfy such expectations, since she will face new political constraints at home, while the basis for her authority, German economic strength, will come under increasing strain.

A string of polls suggests that the politics of Merkel’s fourth term will be tricky. The chancellor is a long way ahead but she is not doing as well as in the last election, in 2013. Recent findings show support for her center-right CDU party (together with the CSU in Bavaria) at around 36 percent, down from the 41.5 percent she managed four years ago. Because of Germany’s electoral system, which broadly aligns the distribution of seats in the Bundestag with the parties’ share of the vote – while excluding those that fail to reach a 5 percent voting threshold - she will once again have to form a coalition.

The most stable government would be another “grand coalition” with the center-left SPD, her current partner, which is currently polling at around 22 percent. That might appeal to the SPD leadership but many party members are opposed to playing second fiddle again, not least since this does not pay off at the polls. If Merkel cannot form a coalition with the SPD, she may have to form a coalition with not just one but two smaller parties, the FDP and the Greens. This combination would be a first in the Bundestag and it could prove fissile by bringing together the free-market FDP, Merkel’s junior partner in her second term of office between 2009 and 2013, with Germany’s environmentalist party, which has in the past allied itself with the SPD.

The coalition arithmetic could change if the election throws up surprise results for the smaller parties. But whatever alliance Merkel forms after probably protracted negotiations, it will face a disturbing new political phenomenon. Until now the Bundestag has been immune from the upsurge of populism in Europe. But the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) looks set to break through the 5 percent threshold that held it at bay in 2013. Currently polling around 10 percent, it has mutated from its euroskeptic origins into an anti-immigration party, capitalizing upon concerns about the influx of asylum-seekers in 2015. Though riven by internal divisions and shunned by the other parties, the AfD will be able to use its presence in the Bundestag as a platform for its populist opposition to the chancellor’s policies.

The politics of Merkel’s fourth term may be more unfavorable than before, but that should be surmountable if the economy – her trump card in the election - remains buoyant. Growth prospects for this year and next year are good, continuing a robust performance in the chancellor’s last two terms. Manufacturers excel in exporting the high-quality engineering products in which Germany specializes. The current-account surplus is extraordinarily high at around 8 percent of GDP. Helped by the humming economy and low interest rates on government debt, Germany boasts healthy public finances too, running a surplus of almost 1 percent of GDP.

Peter Apps: The coming robot arms race

John Lloyd: Labor reform in France's Macron economy

German economic and fiscal strength, so crucial in underpinning the euro zone during the crisis years of 2010-12, has come to be taken for granted. Yet under the shiny paint the engine looks less reliable for the longer journey ahead. Much of the economy does not match the prowess of German manufacturers. In particular Germany lags in business services, as a report from the OECD pointed out last year. Many professions are subject to restrictions that fetter competition. Germany is overbanked with too many small lenders and the banking sector has unhelpfully high levels of public ownership.

Moreover, the business model of German manufacturing is under threat. The diesel emissions scandal that began when Volkswagen admitted cheating U.S. emissions tests has cast a shadow over the country’s premier industry and German carmakers’ big bet on the fuel now looks misplaced. They have to scramble to catch up with electric-powered models, whose time has come thanks both to technological advances and a wave of public-health measures led by cities to ban polluting vehicles. The self-driving revolution poses another challenge to German carmakers. Manufacturers fret that they may be on the wrong side of the digital divide, with Silicon Valley in effect grabbing the high value-added content of many products.

Germans are proud of their massive current-account surplus, yet the domestic counterpart is a lack of investment to absorb national savings. The government’s drive to balance the books has come at the cost of inadequate capital spending on the national infrastructure. Business investment has been subdued. Indeed, according to the OECD’s survey, German firms are behind those of other advanced countries in investing in the “knowledge-based capital”, such as software and management skills, that is increasingly important in spurring greater efficiency. That is one reason why productivity growth has been weak.

An underlying and profound weakness is that Germany’s demographics are especially unfavorable in economic terms. At almost 46, the median age of the population in 2015 was only just lower than Japan’s, the world’s oldest, according to UN data released in June. Although there was a baby boom from the mid-1950s through most of the 1960s, the birth rate fell below the replacement level (of 2.1 children per woman) at the start of the 1970s and has since been among the lowest in the world; indeed the current fertility rate of 1.5 is unusually high. These persistently low birth rates mean that there are fewer young people to replace the bulge of baby-boomers as they retire. Despite the recent upsurge in immigration the working-age population is set to fall, which will act as a persistent drag on growth by reducing the number of workers over the next couple of decades.

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility. Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll. That will limit her ability to meet the exaggerated expectations of what she can achieve both within Europe and on the wider international stage.",Commentary: Don’t be fooled by Merkel’s aura of invincibility,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-germany-commentary/commentary-dont-be-fooled-by-merkels-aura-of-invincibility-idUSKCN1BU2BJ

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.

More recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

Since P&G’s board before Peltz jolted it into action had no such representative, they consider his pitch favorably.

There’s no particularly good reason for shareholders to deny the pushy investor, whose hedge fund Trian Partners owns 1.5 percent of the $235 billion diapers-to-shampoo conglomerate, a seat at the table. Yet as at the ballot box, a combination of voter apathy and arcane rules is likely to leave three investors holding all the cards at next Tuesday’s annual meeting.

It is an irony of the way American public equity markets have developed that the most important deciders on the P&G saga – as in many other proxy battles involving the world’s most valuable companies – are so-called passive index-fund managers led by Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. To further the imperfect political analogy, they play roles similar to the ones Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania did in helping put Donald Trump into the Oval Office, even though his rival Hillary Clinton achieved more of the popular vote last November.

There are differences, of course. P&G shareholders are not being offered a choice between one chief executive or another. The question of whether to give Peltz, who comes armed with ideas about how P&G can improve its performance and more experience in the sector than most if not all of the company’s sitting directors, is far from existential. He would be one of about a dozen people helping set strategy, compensation and the like. Handing him a board seat is pretty much a no-lose option on bettering the maker of Tide and Pampers.

The insular, Cincinnati-based company thinks differently. P&G’s notorious allegiance to internal candidates for nearly every high-level position makes it vulnerable to criticism that it does not like outsiders telling it what to do. That’s a central theme to Peltz’s charges of P&G’s underperformance. For its part, the giant led by David Taylor says it’s already on track to create a “profoundly different, much stronger, and more profitable company” than just a few years ago.

As in previous engagements, Peltz is apt to have won over most of those P&G investors who spend their days thinking about whether to keep the investment in their portfolio. These so-called active managers, a group that in P&G’s case includes hedge funds, mutual funds and some pension funds, tend to agree that corporate boards benefit from having a voice from the investor community in their midst. Since P&G’s board before Peltz jolted it into action had no such representative, they consider his pitch favorably.

”Peltz’s experience in the consumer product space will add value to P&G’s board and his significant stake in the company will bring an owner’s perspective inside the boardroom,“ said Anne Sheehan, the director of corporate governance at CalSTRS, on Thursday. ”The addition of Mr. Peltz to the board is best for P&G, the CalSTRS fund and ultimately, the teachers of California.”

It’s here where the electoral math starts to matter. P&G has about 2.6 billion shares outstanding. Proxy advisers working either side of the tussle roughly estimate that investors like CalSTRS, Fidelity and Capital Group own about 41 percent of those shares. Assume 90 percent of the active managers live up to their billing and vote. If 80 percent of them tilt in favor of Peltz, that would give Trian about 770 million votes.

Retail investors own about the same amount of P&G, however. They tend to go along with what management has told them to do in the proxy cards that arrive in the post, as Trian learned the hard way when it failed to garner enough support to win seats on the board of DuPont two years ago. Like the American electorate, this group doesn’t tend to vote the way Fidelity and other institutions do. P&G may have an extra edge, though, in that many of its former workers still hold the stock, or received it as part of their retirement.

Yet there may also be folks who own the stock because, say, they love Dawn dishwashing liquid or live in the Cincinnati area and worry that Peltz would move its headquarters to the Bronx. So for arithmetic purposes, assume a slightly higher 60 percent of retail shareholders vote, and 80 percent of them cast their ballot against Peltz. That would give P&G 515 million votes.

That’s obviously not enough, and explains the significance of Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. They have been the biggest beneficiaries of a trend toward investing in funds that simply track benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 – and charge lower fees for doing so – at the expense of higher-cost managers. Together, the trio control more than 17 percent of P&G, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm that favors Peltz’s proposal.

To beat back Peltz, P&G needs to make up the difference between the active and retail investors, of some 255 million shares. In this scenario, P&G can only make that happen by bringing all three to its side. Vanguard, with 181 million shares, is the largest. State Street and BlackRock own 115 million and 156 million, respectively, according to ISS. To put it another way, Peltz just has to win one of the three.

Though that sounds like a tall order for P&G, past voting records give it a chance. In votes for directors proposed by shareholders, BlackRock only cast its ballot against management’s wishes 17 percent of the time at U.S. companies in the year to June 30. Nearly half the time, Vanguard sided with board-related proposals put forward by shareholders at U.S. companies. State Street says it cast its ballot in favor of any shareholder proposal, in defiance of management, only about 7 percent of the time in the first half of this year on a global basis.

These are not perfectly comparable statistics. They nevertheless suggest that P&G has a chance, just as Trump clearly did, if it can woo the investment world’s version of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin. That also means a weekend trip for Peltz to suburban Malvern in the Keystone State – where Vanguard calls home – is advisable.",Breakingviews - Cox: P&G counting on an investor electoral college,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-trian-breakingviews/breakingviews-cox-pg-counting-on-an-investor-electoral-college-idUSKBN1CB25W

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzanian president John Magufuli split the energy and minerals ministry in two and appointed heads for the new ministries on Saturday, five months after sacking the previous minister.

Two presidential committees had recommended the move to tighten supervision of natural resources in Tanzania, where Magufuli has sent shockwaves through the mining community since his election in 2015 with actions he says are aimed at ensuring that the African country benefits from its natural wealth.

The country passed new laws in July to increase mining taxes, to force companies to re-negotiate their contracts and to allow the state to own up to 50 percent of mining firms.

Nicknamed “the Bulldozer” for his forceful leadership style, Magufuli is increasing pressure on miners, including Acacia Mining, the biggest gold miner in Tanzania, to pay more taxes.

Magufuli fired Sospeter Muhongo in May after an investigation into possible undeclared exports by mining companies. Several senior officials resigned or were fired after allegations of impropriety in Tanzania’s mining sector.

The president appointed Angellah Kairuki as the new mining minister. The 41-year-old lawyer by training previously served as minister of state in the president’s office responsible for public service management and good governance.

The four-day event is dedicated to comics, graphic novels, anime, manga, video games, toys, movies, and television with exhibitors like Marvel and Disney to Japanese game developer Square Enix setting up flashy booths showcasing their latest goods. It also has panels with comic book authors and industry executives, meet and greets with movie and television stars and screenings of latest films. This year, organizers expect 200,000 visitors to ""geek out"" during its four-day run. The secret to its success is inclusivity, explained organizer Kristina Rogers, who said it transcends everything, from race, religion, age or sexual orientation. The convention is also attracting international talent such as French comic book artist Alexis Sentenac who came to New York Comic Con for the first time.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

L‘incremento del rischio politico, dopo il referendum del primo ottobre scorso, ha già aumentato la volatilità del mercato finanziario. Gli spread sui crediti sui bond delle banche spagnole si sono allargati in linea con i quelli dei bond sovrani e il loro prezzo di mercato è diventato più volatile.

Secondo Fitch, se la fiducia degli investitori si indebolisse per un periodo prolungato, i costi di finanziamento potrebbero aumentare a seguito di ulteriore debito emesso dalle banche per costruire i requisiti minimi per i loro accantonamenti.

Demnach habe die Geschäftsführung Arbeitnehmervertretern am Donnerstag mitgeteilt, dass dem gesamten Bodenpersonal bis Ende Oktober gekündigt werden solle.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s finance minister ordered the government pension fund on Friday to investigate possible irregularities at the fund to help ally concerns that politicians are trying to “influence” it.

The Public Investment Corporation (PIC), which holds a large chunk of government bonds and stakes in leading South African companies, has come under the public spotlight after reports that the finance ministry had requested 100 billion rand ($7 billion) from the fund to bail out struggling state firms.

Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has denied making such a request, which drew sharp criticism from opposition parties and civil society.

Gigaba said in a statement on Friday he was concerned about the “politicisation” of the PIC and asked its management to conduct a “forensic investigation” into its operations.

“We need to assure pension holders that those with political or economic power will not be allowed to unduly influence the PIC,” Gigaba said.

Gigaba also asked the PIC to provide a list of all its beneficiaries and the investments it has made.

The PIC, which was given two weeks to respond to Gigaba’s request, could not immediately comment on the matter.

The PIC board said last week its chief executive Daniel Matjila had been cleared of any wrongdoing following an internal audit triggered by allegations that he had allocated funds improperly.

Particolarmente colpita l‘occupazione del settore ricreativo e ricettivo, che ha subìto una flessione mensile di 111.000 occupati, la peggiore dall‘inizio della serie nel 1939.

Secondo i numeri del dipartimento del Lavoro Usa, 1,5 milioni di persone non hanno potuto lavorare a settembre a causa delle avverse condizioni meteo, mentre 2,9 milioni sono state costrette a lavorare part-time.

Il tasso di disoccupazione è sceso di due decimi a 4,2% -- livello più basso da febbraio 2001 -- mentre le attese suggerivano un tasso invariato a 4,4%.

Il salario medio orario dei lavoratori del settore privato ha segnato un incremento mensile di 0,5% in settembre dopo +0,2% segnato in agosto, a fronte di attese per un rialzo di 0,3%. Su base annua il salario medio orario a settembre ha segnato una crescita di 2,9% da 2,7% di agosto, anche in questo caso superiore alle stime che suggerivano un incremento di 2,5%.

Secondo gli analisti, è necessario una crescita annua dei salari del 3% per portare l‘inflazione al target del 2% perseguito dalla Fed.

I numeri contrastanti del rapporto mensile sull‘occupazione non dovrebbero modificare l‘idea prevalente del mercato, e cioè che Federal Reserve alzerà il costo del denaro a dicembre.

The attack took place near the city of Beni and, if the deaths are confirmed, would be the first mass-killing this year in that area. It has seen relative peace since more than 800 people were killed in dozens of massacres between 2014 and 2016.

The spate of attacks raised serious questions about the state’s ability to impose order over a region full of ethnic tensions and plagued by pockets of lawlessness where armed groups prey on populations and exploit rich mineral reserves.

In the latest attack, on Saturday, assailants armed with machetes and guns ambushed travelers on the main road linking Beni territory in North Kivu province to neighboring Uganda, Boris Maelezo, a member of parliament from the area, told Reuters.

He said about 30 civilians were riding on motorbikes, with several people on each vehicle, and that most of them could have been killed.

Albert Baliesima Kadukima, another lawmaker from the area, said two women freed by the militants had told local authorities the assailants had slit the throats of more than a dozen people.

Mak Hazukay, a local army spokesman, said Congolese forces were battling the militants and attempting to dislodge them from a section of the road that was several kilometers long.

The two lawmakers and the army spokesman said the militants belonged to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active near the border between Congo and Uganda.

Congolese authorities have blamed almost all the massacres of the past three years on the ADF but independent and U.N. experts say several armed groups as well as national army commanders have orchestrated the killings as they vie for influence in the area.

Eastern Congo is a tinderbox of ethnic tensions and has been racked by conflict for more than two decades. It is the world’s biggest source of coltan, used in mobile phones and other electronic products.

Various armed groups have committed atrocities around Beni since late 2014 to settle scores and undermine rivals, with attacks sometimes sectarian in nature.

Separately, armed men from an ethnic Bantu militia broke out more than 50 inmates on Saturday from a prison in the southeastern town of Pweto, Celestin Ngombe, a local government official, told Reuters.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will pay up to C$750 million ($598 million) in compensation to thousands of aboriginals who were removed as children from their families decades ago, a top official said on Friday, promising to end “a terrible legacy.”

The move is the latest bid by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to repair ties with Canada’s often-marginalized indigenous population, which says it has been the victim of systemic racism for centuries.

In the so-called “Sixties Scoop,” welfare authorities took around 20,000 aboriginal children from their homes between the 1960s and 1980s and placed them in foster care or allowed them to be adopted by non-indigenous families.

The compensation package is designed to settle many of the lawsuits launched by survivors, who say the forced removal deprived them of their heritage and led to mental disorders, substance abuse and suicide.

“Language and culture, apology, healing -- these are essential elements to begin to right the wrong of this dark and painful chapter,” said Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister in charge of relations with the indigenous population.

Canada’s 1.4 million aboriginals, who make up about 4 percent of the population, experience higher levels of poverty and incarceration and have a lower life expectancy than other Canadians. They are often victims of violent crime and addiction.

Indigenous activists complain Trudeau has broken repeated promises to improve their lives since taking office in late 2015. He reshuffled his cabinet in August to put more emphasis on helping aboriginal people.

Bennett, at times fighting back tears, told a news conference she had heard “truly heartbreaking stories” about loss of identity and alienation.

Marcia Brown Martel, an aboriginal chief who led the campaign for compensation, lamented the “stealing of children” and noted some of those involved lived as far away as New Zealand.

“Think of it as a puzzle, a great big puzzle. Pieces, people are missing,” she told reporters.

Ottawa agreed the settlement after a Canadian court ruled earlier this year that the government breached its duty of care to the children.

Trudeau and other Canadian leaders have already apologized for the many abuses committed over a 150-year period when 150,000 aboriginal children were forcibly separated from their parents and sent to church-run residential schools.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Sunday that the United States was serving the interests of Islamic State by preventing the Syrian army and its allies advancing in some areas of eastern Syria.

American jets have this year targeted pro-government militias in eastern Syria that were advancing towards Washington’s local allies.

Nasrallah said the United States was delaying the Syrian military in its battle to retake territory from Islamic State.

“The American air force in some areas prevents the Syrian army and its allies from advancing in areas controlled by Islamic State,” said the leader of Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shi‘ite movement designated by Washington as a terrorist group.

“The Americans are working to hinder the battle against Islamic State,” he said in a speech, part of a commemoration for Hezbollah fighters killed in clashes against Islamic State.

His comments came after a senior U.S. official said President Donald Trump was considering putting sanctions on Iran for its support of Hezbollah, and as the U.S. Congress prepares to consider tighter sanctions on Hezbollah itself.

The battlefield situation in Syrian is complex, comprising both a civil war that pits Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government against rebels, as well as two separate campaigns against Islamic State.

The Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran and Shi‘ite militias including Hezbollah, has advanced against Islamic State in an offensive across the central Syrian desert in recent months.

The United States is meanwhile leading a rival international coalition against the Sunni jihadists that includes an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias.

Russia and the United States have put in place measures to prevent outright conflict between the two offensives against Islamic State, but there have been times when they fired on each other.

Security sources in Lebanon have said that Hezbollah has lost hundreds of fighters in Syria since it entered the conflict in support of Assad in 2013 against rebel groups.

“We already own more than 15 percent and we’re not done buying,” White Tale investors David Millstone and David Winter told Finanz und Wirtschaft in a joint interview released on Friday.

The next disclosure threshold would be 20 percent. They had previously reported a stake of just over 15 percent.

Calling themselves “long-term oriented investors” who are “here to stay”, Millstone and Winter reiterated their opposition to the planned merger that would give Clariant 52 percent of the combined entity should shareholders approve.

“We want Clariant to become a better and stronger company, and we don’t see that happening with Huntsman.”

The proposed deal, they said, significantly undervalued Clariant and overvalued Huntsman.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil producers may need to take “some extraordinary measures” next year to rebalance the oil market, the OPEC secretary-general said on Sunday.

“There is a growing consensus that ... a rebalancing process is under way. We are gradually but steadily achieving our common and noble objectives,” Mohammad Barkindo told reporters at the India Energy Forum organized by CERAWeek in New Delhi.

“To sustain this into next year, some extraordinary measures may have to be taken in order to restore this stability on a sustainable basis going forward,” he said, without elaborating.

Saudi Arabia and Russia helped secure a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 rival producers to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March 2018 in an effort to reduce a glut.

Barkindo said consultations were under way for the extension of the OPEC-led pact beyond March 2018 and that more oil producing nations may join the supply pact, possibly at the next meeting of OPEC in Vienna on Nov. 30.

He also said that Nigeria and Libya, who are exempted from the pact, “are making progress towards full recovery” of production, after which they could join the OPEC-led agreement.

Oil futures fell more than 2 percent on Friday, ending Brent crude’s longest multi-week rally in 16 months as oversupply concerns reappeared as producers have started hedging future drilling. [O/R]

But Barkindo said he was not worried about the rise in U.S. shale oil and gas output.

“It is a big market and demand is very strong. Between the first half and second half this year, demand growth is almost about 2 million barrels (per day), which is very robust,” he said. “So everybody has a role to play.”

On Friday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he hoped to reach a consensus with Russia and other major oil producers on the future of the deal before November’s meeting.

Falih was speaking in Moscow two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was possible that the supply reduction deal could run to the end of next year, although Russia has not made any commitment.",Extraordinary steps may be needed in 2018 to rebalance oil market: OPEC's Barkindo,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-india/extraordinary-steps-may-be-needed-in-2018-to-rebalance-oil-market-opecs-barkindo-idUSKBN1CD0HN?il=0

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Everything old is new again in finance. Navient, which services debt, is buying startup student-loan refinancer Earnest for less than half its 2015 valuation. Even then, it’ll eat into the new owner’s earnings and share buybacks. Worse, Navient faces a fresh lawsuit over dodgy practices.

The Pennsylvania attorney general’s office filed charges on Thursday that follow ones from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January with Illinois and Washington. All allege that Navient in some way or other cheated borrowers paying for college, which the company denies.

Regardless of how the cases turn out, the $3.5 billion company spun out of giant lender Sallie Mae in 2014 makes a strange bedfellow for Earnest. Like other startups in the sector, its founder Louis Beryl aimed to take advantage of not just the technological and marketing shortcomings of older financial institutions but also the post-crisis reputational damage they suffered.

Instead, it’s like déjà vu all over again. Two of the bigger breakout fintech firms have been embroiled in scandals. A mis-selling fiasco cost Lending Club its founder and boss Renaud Laplanche last year, evoking the mortgage misdeeds of earlier this century. And over the summer SoFi parted ways with its top executive, Mike Cagney, after he was accused of the same sorts of sexual harassment allegations that have plagued Wall Street for decades.

What’s more, the business model for many of these entrepreneurial ventures has been challenged by interest-rate concerns and rising defaults. Some, like Avant, Prosper and Vouch had to close or significantly scale back operations.

Earnest was one of the few that powered through, thanks in part to its focus on borrowers with decent credit ratings and salaries. It had long-term funding from New York Life and got ever better rates on its asset-backed deals. Even so, Earnest’s $155 million price tag suggests most in the industry have downgraded their expectations about profitable growth.

The reaction of Navient shareholders is informative. A couple of years ago, buying a well-run fintech lender probably would have sent the stock soaring, perhaps even drowning out news of a regulatory probe. Instead, Navient shares tumbled 12 percent, erasing market value more than three times the value of the acquisition.

The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.

“We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters, saying there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage.

The fourth major storm to strike the United States in less than two months, Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.

Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.

The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the National Hurricane Center said. Heavy rainfall and storm surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.

Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.

Flood waters swept over streets in communities across Alabama and Mississippi, including over Highway 90 and to oceanside casinos in Biloxi, according to reports on social media.

Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.

“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”

Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.

“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

On Saturday, states of emergency were declared in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as in more than two dozen Florida counties. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned of tornadoes springing up in the Pandhandle region.

In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey urged residents in areas facing heavy winds and storm surges to take precautions. U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.

About 47,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, while more than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.

Utility Alabama Power said some 82,000 customers were without electricity.

Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches, were expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the NHC said.

NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu lifted a curfew on Saturday evening that was originally scheduled to last until Sunday morning. He said in a statement on social media however, that there was still a serious threat of storm surge outside levee areas.

Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Plaquemines Parish President Amos Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.

The ports of New Orleans in Louisiana and Mobile in Alabama remained closed, and refineries and port authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were reviewing when they could reopen.

The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.

Workers were evacuated from 301 platforms and 13 rigs as of Saturday, said the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.","Hurricane Nate weakens as it soaks Mississippi, Alabama",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-storm-nate/hurricane-nate-weakens-as-it-soaks-mississippi-alabama-idUKKBN1CD059

LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices regained momentum in September, recording their fastest annual rise since February as buyers shrugged off the possibility of higher Bank of England interest rates, figures from major mortgage lender Halifax showed on Friday.

House prices rose 0.8 percent on the month in September alone, beating all economists’ forecasts in a Reuters poll, while prices in the three months to September were 4.0 percent higher versus average expectations of a 3.6 percent rise.

But economists doubted the figures, which contrast with more subdued numbers from rival lender Nationwide, heralded a real end to the slowdown in British house prices seen since the start of the year.

“Despite some overall firming in mortgage activity from mid-2017 lows, we remain sceptical about any marked housing market upturn,” Howard Archer of consultancy EY ITEM Club said.

British house prices were likely to be “muted” for the rest of the year and would rise by 2-3 percent in 2018, he predicted.

Halifax said prices were boosted by a lack of properties for sale and solid growth in full-time employment, though a squeeze on spending power from higher consumer price inflation and the high cost of property might limit future demand.

Most economists expect the BoE to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade next month. But Halifax said it did not expect this likely increase in official rates to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent to hurt the housing market.

“There has been recent speculation on the possibility of a rise in the Bank of England base rate. We do not anticipate this will have a significant effect on transaction volumes,” said Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax’s community bank.

Halifax is part of Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), and is one of Britain’s two biggest mortgage lenders, alongside Nationwide Building Society.

Alphabet, which announced its Project Loon in 2013 to use solar-powered, high-altitude balloons to provide internet service in remote regions, said in an FCC filing it was working to “support licensed mobile carriers’ restoration of limited communications capability” in Puerto Rico.

Earlier on Friday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced he was forming a Hurricane Recovery Task Force with an emphasis on addressing challenges facing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

“It is critical that we adopt a coordinated and comprehensive approach to support the rebuilding of communications infrastructure and restoration of communications services,” Pai said in statement.

Separately, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a Twitter posting late on Friday that he had a “great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities. Next steps soon to follow.”

Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc, said on Friday the company would send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island over two weeks ago.

Musk said he was diverting resources from a semi-truck project to fix Model 3 bottlenecks and “increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.”

In late September, Tesla said it was sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Hurricane Maria.",Google to use balloons to provide Puerto Rico cell service,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-cellular/google-to-use-balloons-to-provide-puerto-rico-cell-service-idINKBN1CC03B

REUTERS/Brian Snyder

In his home just outside of Boston in the early hours of Monday Michael Rosbash, clad in his bathrobe and pajamas, answered the door when a Reuters photographer rang the doorbell.

He invited the man, whom he’d never met, into his home and allowed him to photograph him drinking coffee in his kitchen because, for Rosbash, this was not an ordinary morning. He had just been named one of three American scientists awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work unravelling molecular mechanisms that control our internal body clocks.

Even as Reuters photographer Brian Snyder was making his overture to Rosbash, his Reuters colleague Mike Blake was working to capture another iconic image – this one related to the tragedy at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino where a lone gunman opened fire on a country music concert and killed 59 people. Both photos tell vastly different stories but both relied on the same depth of preparation that goes into what photographers call “making” a picture.

In the case of the Nobel Prize winner, the photographer’s road to Rosbash’s door - and the viral of image of the professor in his dressing gown clutching a mug of coffee that produced - involved journalists on two continents, who had spent almost a month planning Reuters’ coverage of the Nobel Prizes, which are shrouded in secrecy.

The effort is coordinated in our Stockholm bureau and an important part of it is having journalists on standby in cities such as Boston because so many winners come from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

As the news of the winners hit the Reuters wire on Monday, a senior photo editor alerted his counterparts globally on the winners’ names and their potential locations.

Snyder, who has been based in Boston for almost 30 years, was woken at 5:45 a.m. on Monday by a phone call from his editor, putting him on the hunt for Rosbash, a professor at nearby Brandeis University.

He found his address, and managing to avoid Boston’s notorious rush-hour traffic, made it to Rosbash’s home in 20 minutes. The first photographer to arrive at the scene, he found the scientist taking congratulatory phone calls.

To get access to Rosbash, Snyder simply rang the doorbell and was invited in to take his pictures of the pajama-clad prize-winner.

""There's no downside to winning the Nobel,” Snyder said. ""Maybe that makes them less likely to turn you away.”

At the same time Snyder was getting his early morning assignment, Blake got a call in the middle of the night. He was expecting it to be a Nobel Prize winner—but this assignment was grim. Blake was dispatched to Las Vegas from Southern California to cover the aftermath of the mass shooting.

Because the police had the adjacent area locked down really well, Blake decided to stay at a Hooters hotel, which had a limited view of Mandalay Bay resort and the outdoor Las Vegas Village where the Route 91 Harvest country music festival took place.

On Wednesday, ahead of the president’s visit to Las Vegas, Blake got an idea for a frame.

From his hotel room window, which faced the Mandalay Bay, he had seen planes taking off over the hotel. He decided to try to capture the president’s plane and hotel together in one photograph.

The president’s schedule was not well known at that point. The media had had an idea he would leave around 1 p.m., so the team sat and waited.

Eventually, the plane came into Blake’s viewfinder, and much lower than he expected. “I zoomed out a little to put the plane over the stage of the venue. I zoomed in as it went over a Mandalay Bay sign and then it disappeared behind the hotel. I quickly framed up the broken windows and waited for it to appear somewhere behind them,” he said. “When it did, I hit the motor drive, captured the scene and sent three images back to the news desk.

One week after suffering a staggering collision with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is in the throes of an agonizing humanitarian disaster.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish army reconnaissance team scouted out Syria’s Idlib province on Sunday, a senior Syrian rebel said, before an expected military operation to impose peace in the bitterly contested Syrian northwest.

“When we don’t go to Syria, Syria comes to us,” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party. “If we didn’t take our measures, bombs would fall on our cities.”

Turkey says it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed, aiming to implement a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area, the most populous pocket of Syria still in rebel hands.

Although Turkish officials say they are helping the rebels from within Turkey, in past interventions they have also sent troops across the frontier.

Any incursion could bring them into conflict with powerful jihadists from al Qaeda’s former Syrian branch, although there were signs on Sunday that they were working to avoid a confrontation.

Local sources said the Turkish military vehicles were escorted into Idlib by a convoy of fighters from the group, which has joined a jihadist alliance called Tahrir al-Sham and disavowed links to the network founded by Osama bin Laden.

Nonetheless, the jihadists and the Turkish military earlier exchanged fire nearby, underscoring the tension as Turkey builds up its forces and the rebel groups it backs prepare to enter Idlib.

“We will never allow a terror corridor that begins in Afrin and goes to the Mediterranean,” Erdogan said, referring to the stretch of Turkey’s southern border which is controlled on the Syrian side by Kurdish fighters and Tahrir al-Sham.

Related Coverage Erdogan says Turkey working with Syria rebels to implement Idlib accord

Turkey has been one of the biggest supporters of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the six-and-a-half-year war, but its focus has moved from ousting him to securing its own border against jihadist and Kurdish groups.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim stressed the importance of ensuring de-escalation near the border, following an agreement reached in Astana, Kazakhstan last month that was backed both by the Turks and by Russia, which supports Assad.

“We will ensure safety in Idlib, and will cooperate with Russia,” Yildirim said.

Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former Nusra Front, which was al Qaeda’s Syrian branch until last year when it changed its name and broke allegiance to the global network, has been a formidable military force since early in the conflict.

Since early this year it has battled other rebel groups as it tried to gain control over areas including Idlib.

UNDER ESCORT

Idlib and neighboring parts of northwest Syria are now home to more than 2 million people, many of them refugees from other formerly rebel-held regions that fell to pro-government forces.

A local resident and another local rebel said they had seen Turkish military vehicles enter Idlib and then travel under Tahrir al-Sham escort along a road.

The senior Syrian rebel said the reconnaissance team went to Sheikh Barakat, a location that overlooks both rebel-held areas of Aleppo province, adjacent to Idlib, and the Kurdish-controlled area of Afrin.

Erdogan gave no details of the operation, but said it was going ahead “without problems at the moment”.

Turkey’s biggest security concern on the frontier is the Kurdish YPG militia, which as part of a U.S.-backed alliance is fighting against Islamic State in eastern Syria. Ankara regards the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey.

Mortars were fired from the area under YPG control near to the location where the Turkish reconnaissance team was operating, the senior rebel said.

“The Turkish team is on its way back. Its mission has been accomplished. They visited areas of disengagement and locations where the Turkish army would be positioned,” the rebel said.

Reuters witnesses, local people, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said earlier on Sunday the Turkish military and Tahrir al-Sham had clashed near the village of Kafr Lusin in Idlib.

Tahrir al-Sham began the exchange by firing on a Turkish bulldozer removing sections of a border wall and Turkish artillery returned fire, they said. The area was later quiet.

Rebel groups that will take part - drawn from the Euphrates Shield campaign that Turkey backed with armor and troops in another part of Syria to the east since last year - said on Saturday they expected the Idlib operation to start very soon.

Tahrir al-Sham said “the lions of jihad and martyrdom will be waiting to pounce” against any incursion into Idlib.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Militants ambushed a group of about 30 civilians in northeastern Congo and killed many of them before fighting a fierce battle with the army, politicians said on Sunday.

The attack took place near the city of Beni and, if the deaths are confirmed, would be the first mass-killing this year in that area. It has seen relative peace since more than 800 people were killed in dozens of massacres between 2014 and 2016.

The spate of attacks raised serious questions about the state’s ability to impose order over a region full of ethnic tensions and plagued by pockets of lawlessness where armed groups prey on populations and exploit rich mineral reserves.

In the latest attack, on Saturday, assailants armed with machetes and guns ambushed travellers on the main road linking Beni in North Kivu province to neighbouring Ituri province, Boris Maelezo, a member of parliament from the area, told Reuters.

He said about 30 civilians were riding on motorbikes, with several people on each vehicle, and that most of them could have been killed.

Albert Baliesima Kadukima, another lawmaker from the area, said two women freed by the militants had told local authorities the assailants had slit the throats of more than a dozen people.

Mak Hazukay, a local army spokesman, said Congolese forces were battling the militants and attempting to dislodge them from a section of the road that was several kilometres long.

The two lawmakers and the army spokesman said the militants belonged to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active near the border between Congo and Uganda.

KCNA/via REUTERS.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear weapons were a “powerful deterrent” that guaranteed its sovereignty, state media reported on Sunday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said “only one thing will work” in dealing with the isolated country.

Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.

In a speech to a meeting of the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party on Saturday, a day before Trump’s most recent comments, state media said Kim had addressed the “complicated international situation”.

North Korea’s nuclear weapons are a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,” Kim said, referring to the “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

North Korea is preparing to test-launch such a missile, a Russian lawmaker who had just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday.

Donald Trump has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies.

The situation proved that North Korea’s policy of “byungjin”, meaning the parallel development of nuclear weapons and the economy was “absolutely right”, Kim Jong Un said in the speech.

“The national economy has grown on their strength this year, despite the escalating sanctions,” said Kim, referring to U.N. Security Council resolutions put in place to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program.

SISTER PROMOTION

The meeting also handled some personnel changes inside North Korea’s secretive and opaque ruling center of power, state media said.

“It shows that her portfolio and writ is far more substantive than previously believed and it is a further consolidation of the Kim family’s power,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University’s 38 North website.

In January, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo Jong along with other North Korean officials over “severe human rights abuses”.

Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol, two of the three men behind Kim’s banned rocket program, were also promoted.

State media announced that several other high ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee in what the South Korean unification ministry said could be an attempt by North Korea to navigate a way through its increasing isolation.

“The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong Un is taking the current situation seriously, and that he’s looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians,” the ministry said in a statement.

North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, who named Donald Trump “President Evil” in a bombastic speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, was promoted to full vote-carrying member of the politburo.

“Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea’s top policy makers,” said Madden.

“Even if he has informal or off the record meetings, Ri’s interlocutors can be assured that whatever proposals they proffer will be taken directly to the top,” he said.","Kim Jong Un praises nuclear program, promotes sister to center of power",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-kim/kim-jong-un-praises-nuclear-program-promotes-sister-to-center-of-power-idUSKBN1CD03V

Interviews with more than a dozen diplomats and government officials based in Washington, Yangon and Europe revealed that punitive measures aimed specifically at top generals were among a range of options being discussed in response to the crisis.

Nothing has yet been decided and Washington and Brussels may decide to hold off for now, the sources said. There are also discussions about increasing aid for violence-riven Rakhine state.

The active discussion of sanctions – not even on the table a month ago – shows how the dramatic exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar’s northwest is putting pressure on Western policymakers to take action.

While much of the outcry overseas has focused on Nobel laureate and Myanmar’s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, few Western diplomats see an alternative to her leadership. Suu Kyi does not control the military, which still wields considerable power under Myanmar’s army-written constitution.

The EU Foreign Ministers Council will discuss Myanmar on Oct. 16, although officials do not expect any move on sanctions that soon. Danish minister for development cooperation, Ulla Tornaes, told Reuters that Copenhagen had been working to get the crisis on the agenda, “with the wish to put further pressure on the military”.

Two Washington-based U.S. officials with knowledge of the Trump administration’s Myanmar deliberations said targeted sanctions against commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and several other generals, as well as leaders of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist militias accused of torching Rohingya villages, were under consideration.

Such sanctions - if decided on - would likely entail U.S. asset freezes, bans on travel to the United States, prohibitions against Americans doing business with them and other unspecified penalties. Washington was moving cautiously as it consulted with governments in Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia, the U.S. officials said.

A senior Yangon-based European diplomat also said Western countries were coordinating their response to the crisis and were in agreement that it was the military, and specifically the commander-in-chief, who needed to be targeted in any punitive action.

Any punishment was likely to be symbolic at first to allow room for further talks, Yangon-based diplomats said, giving the example of formally banning the army chief, who over the past year visited Brussels, Berlin and Vienna, from further travel to Europe.

Western diplomats admit their leverage is limited: compared with China, whose ties with Myanmar have warmed since Suu Kyi took office 18 months ago, U.S. and European investment and military engagement with the country are small.

They are also wary of action that could hurt the wider economy or destabilize already tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army.

PRESSURE BUILDING

The United Nations is pressing for increased humanitarian access to other parts of Rakhine, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain. How Myanmar responds to calls for increased aid, the investigation of alleged atrocities or repatriation of refugees would be a key consideration in deciding what action to take, U.S. and EU diplomats in Myanmar said.

“We can pile political pressure, look into financing we have in Myanmar. We have humanitarian aid, as well as development aid ... the European Commission won’t invest in the development of Myanmar if the conditions, including security, are not there,” said a Brussels-based EU diplomat who follows Myanmar.

“There is also the arms trade embargo and we discuss regularly whether we should reward the reforms in Myanmar and look at gradual easing of that, or the opposite.”

EU economic sanctions on Myanmar were lifted after the army stepped back from direct rule of the country in 2012, beginning the democratic transition that brought Suu Kyi to power last year, but an arms embargo in force since the 1990s remains. The United States removed most sanctions on Myanmar last autumn. It too has kept an arms embargo in place.

One Washington-based U.S. official said that, while there was no firm deadline, Washington hoped to have a plan of action on Myanmar in place by the time President Donald Trump travels to Asia for a series of summits in the first half of November.

The administration wanted to send a strong message to Myanmar’s military, but was concerned that too drastic action could allow China to expand its growing diplomatic and economic influence in the country, the official said.

There is little support in the administration for the re-imposition of broader economic sanctions, the official added.

The White House declined comment on internal deliberations on the Rohingya crisis.

STRAINED RELATIONS

In another sign of pressure building on Myanmar, New York-based diplomats said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the U.N. General Assembly was pushing for a human rights resolution on the country.

Last year the EU announced that for the first time in 15 years it would not introduce a resolution at the General Assembly’s Third Committee, which focuses on human rights, condemning Myanmar’s record - rewarding it for progress.

The European bloc could revive the resolution in the current session, taking on board the OIC draft and broadening it out beyond the Rohingya crisis, one diplomat in New York said.

Diplomats said some members of the U.N. Security Council were exploring whether the 15-member body could agree a formal statement, or even a resolution, calling for an end to the violence, full access for aid and the safe return of refugees.

However, Myanmar has said it was negotiating with China and Russia, which have veto powers in the Security Council, to protect it from any possible action. China and Russia have both expressed support for the Myanmar government.

Myanmar’s relations with the U.N. have grown increasingly testy since the discovery of World Food Programme-branded biscuits at a suspected militant camp in July prompted the government to accuse the U.N. agency of supporting the insurgents, forcing it to shut down its operations in Rakhine.

Myanmar is stalling on accepting a plan by the U.N. to upgrade the U.N. country head to the more powerful rank of Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) when its current top official, who is due to be rotated, is replaced.

Thaung Tun, Suu Kyi’s National Security Advisor, told Reuters that the U.N. “must treat us equally”.

“We’ll be fine with anybody if all member states have an ASG assigned. Not just us,” he said.",West edges towards punishing Myanmar army leaders over Rohingya crisis: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CD0RN-OCATP

The warning came after the White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump would announce new U.S. responses to Iran’s missile tests, support for “terrorism” and cyber operations as part of his new Iran strategy.

“As we’ve announced in the past, if America’s new law for sanctions is passed, this country will have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km range of Iran’s missiles,” Guards’ commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, according to state media.

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the United States, according to state media, and issued a stark warning to American troops.

“If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world particularly in the Middle East,” Jafari said.

The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are Iran’s most powerful internal and external security force. The Quds Force, the IRGC’s foreign espionage and paramilitary wing, and individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are on the US list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

Iran sees the Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State as an existential threat to the Islamic Republic where the majority of the population are Shi‘ites.

On June 7, Islamic State claimed an attack on Tehran’s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, killing 18 people. The Guards fired missiles at Islamic State bases in Syria on June 18 in response.

Guards commanders have framed their military involvement in Iraq and Syria, where they are fighting to support the government of President Bashar al-Assad, as a fight against Islamic State.

Dozens of members of the Guards, including senior commanders, have been killed in Syria and Iraq.

MISSILE PROGRAM

The website for state TV reported Jafari as adding that the United States was mistaken if it thought it could pressure Iran into negotiating on regional issues.

Jafari also said that Tehran would ramp up its defense capabilities, including its missile program, if the U.S. undermined a nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers.

Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions.

However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel.

“The Americans should know that the Trump government’s stupid behavior with the nuclear deal will be used by the Islamic Republic as an opportunity to move ahead with its missile, regional and conventional defense program,” Jafari said, according to state media.

The prospect of Washington backtracking on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis in the shape of North Korea.

If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. U.N. inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms.

The Guards navy was also carrying out a military exercise on Sunday in the Gulf, an area of tension with the U.S. navy in recent months.

More than 110 vessels were involved in the exercise, including some that have rocket and missile capabilities, a state media report quoted a Guards commander as saying.",Iran warns U.S. against imposing further sanctions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-guards/iran-warns-u-s-against-designating-guards-a-terrorist-group-idUSKBN1CD081

SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton was within reach of his fourth Formula One title on Sunday after winning the Japanese Grand Prix for Mercedes while Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel suffered engine problems and failed to finish.

The Briton, who started from pole position, crossed the line 1.2 seconds ahead of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo to move 59 points clear at the top of the overall standings.

Vettel made it no further than the fourth lap before retiring in the pits.

Already 34 points behind Hamilton before the start, the setback was the third in as many races for the German, whose hopes now rest on Hamilton suffering similar misfortune in the last four grands prix.

“I could only have dreamed of having this kind of gap,” said Hamilton, interviewed on the podium by Indianapolis 500 winner Takuma Sato.

“I wouldn’t say that I have one hand on it (the title),” he added later. “There’s still 100 points available so I‘m still going to keep the pedal to the metal.”

Sunday’s win was the 61st of Hamilton’s career and third at the Suzuka circuit. It came a day after the 32-year-old smashed the track record to seize pole at the 5.8-km track in dominant style.

With the gap he now holds over Vettel, the 32-year-old could clinch the title as soon as the next race in Austin, Texas, on Oct. 22.

HURT AND DISAPPOINTED

Vettel had lined up alongside the Briton, raising the prospect of the two title rivals racing side by side to the first corner, but the Ferrari had already run into trouble before the start.

Vettel’s mechanics changed his car’s spark plug on the grid and seemed to have resolved the problem. But while he made a clean start, Hamilton chopped across to keep the lead at the first corner.

Clearly lacking power, Vettel fell back through the field before getting the call from his race engineer to retire the car.

“Of course it hurts, and we’re all disappointed,” said the four times world champion, who hugged his mechanics and gave the crowd a quick wave after returning to the pits.

“For sure now you don’t look at the positives because it’s not the day to look at positives,” he added.

With Vettel sidelined and Mercedes back up to speed after two lacklustre weekends, Hamilton’s afternoon should have consisted of a straightforward drive to victory but late tyre vibrations allowed Verstappen to reel him in.

For a moment it looked like the Dutchman could cause a late upset and snatch a second consecutive win to add to his triumph in Malaysia.

But with back markers between him and the chasing Red Bull, Hamilton hung on.

“The first half of the race was very well under control and the second part was a lot harder,” said Hamilton. “I had massive understeer. I‘m really grateful the car stuck in and I didn’t make any mistakes.”

Valtteri Bottas, who had started sixth due to a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, fought through to finish fourth for Mercedes.

Fellow Finn Kimi Raikkonen, also struck by a gearbox-related grid penalty, was the sole-surviving Ferrari in fifth.

YANGON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders over an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the country, officials familiar with the discussions say.

Interviews with more than a dozen diplomats and government officials based in Washington, Yangon and Europe revealed that punitive measures aimed specifically at top generals were among a range of options being discussed in response to the crisis.

Nothing has yet been decided and Washington and Brussels may decide to hold off for now, the sources said. There are also discussions about increasing aid for violence-riven Rakhine state.

The active discussion of sanctions – not even on the table a month ago – shows how the dramatic exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar’s northwest is putting pressure on Western policymakers to take action.

While much of the outcry overseas has focused on Nobel laureate and Myanmar’s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, few Western diplomats see an alternative to her leadership. Suu Kyi does not control the military, which still wields considerable power under Myanmar’s army-written constitution.

The EU Foreign Ministers Council will discuss Myanmar on Oct. 16, although officials do not expect any move on sanctions that soon. Danish minister for development cooperation, Ulla Tornaes, told Reuters that Copenhagen had been working to get the crisis on the agenda, “with the wish to put further pressure on the military”.

Two Washington-based U.S. officials with knowledge of the Trump administration’s Myanmar deliberations said targeted sanctions against commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and several other generals, as well as leaders of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist militias accused of torching Rohingya villages, were under consideration.

Such sanctions - if decided on - would likely entail U.S. asset freezes, bans on travel to the United States, prohibitions against Americans doing business with them and other unspecified penalties. Washington was moving cautiously as it consulted with governments in Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia, the U.S. officials said.

A senior Yangon-based European diplomat also said Western countries were coordinating their response to the crisis and were in agreement that it was the military, and specifically the commander-in-chief, who needed to be targeted in any punitive action.

Any punishment was likely to be symbolic at first to allow room for further talks, Yangon-based diplomats said, giving the example of formally banning the army chief, who over the past year visited Brussels, Berlin and Vienna, from further travel to Europe.

Western diplomats admit their leverage is limited: compared with China, whose ties with Myanmar have warmed since Suu Kyi took office 18 months ago, U.S. and European investment and military engagement with the country are small.

They are also wary of action that could hurt the wider economy or destabilise already tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army.

PRESSURE BUILDING

The United Nations is pressing for increased humanitarian access to other parts of Rakhine, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain. How Myanmar responds to calls for increased aid, the investigation of alleged atrocities or repatriation of refugees would be a key consideration in deciding what action to take, U.S. and EU diplomats in Myanmar said.

“We can pile political pressure, look into financing we have in Myanmar. We have humanitarian aid, as well as development aid ... the European Commission won’t invest in the development of Myanmar if the conditions, including security, are not there,” said a Brussels-based EU diplomat who follows Myanmar.

“There is also the arms trade embargo and we discuss regularly whether we should reward the reforms in Myanmar and look at gradual easing of that, or the opposite.”

EU economic sanctions on Myanmar were lifted after the army stepped back from direct rule of the country in 2012, beginning the democratic transition that brought Suu Kyi to power last year, but an arms embargo in force since the 1990s remains. The United States removed most sanctions on Myanmar last autumn. It too has kept an arms embargo in place.

One Washington-based U.S. official said that, while there was no firm deadline, Washington hoped to have a plan of action on Myanmar in place by the time President Donald Trump travels to Asia for a series of summits in the first half of November.

The administration wanted to send a strong message to Myanmar’s military, but was concerned that too drastic action could allow China to expand its growing diplomatic and economic influence in the country, the official said.

There is little support in the administration for the re-imposition of broader economic sanctions, the official added.

The White House declined comment on internal deliberations on the Rohingya crisis.

STRAINED RELATIONS

In another sign of pressure building on Myanmar, New York-based diplomats said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the U.N. General Assembly was pushing for a human rights resolution on the country.

Last year the EU announced that for the first time in 15 years it would not introduce a resolution at the General Assembly’s Third Committee, which focuses on human rights, condemning Myanmar’s record - rewarding it for progress.

The European bloc could revive the resolution in the current session, taking on board the OIC draft and broadening it out beyond the Rohingya crisis, one diplomat in New York said.

Diplomats said some members of the U.N. Security Council were exploring whether the 15-member body could agree a formal statement, or even a resolution, calling for an end to the violence, full access for aid and the safe return of refugees.

However, Myanmar has said it was negotiating with China and Russia, which have veto powers in the Security Council, to protect it from any possible action. China and Russia have both expressed support for the Myanmar government.

Myanmar’s relations with the U.N. have grown increasingly testy since the discovery of World Food Programme-branded biscuits at a suspected militant camp in July prompted the government to accuse the U.N. agency of supporting the insurgents, forcing it to shut down its operations in Rakhine.

Myanmar is stalling on accepting a plan by the U.N. to upgrade the U.N. country head to the more powerful rank of Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) when its current top official, who is due to be rotated, is replaced.

Thaung Tun, Suu Kyi’s National Security Advisor, told Reuters that the U.N. “must treat us equally”.

“We’ll be fine with anybody if all member states have an ASG assigned. Not just us,” he said.",Exclusive: West edges towards punishing Myanmar army leaders over Rohingya crisis - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-sanctions/exclusive-west-edges-towards-punishing-myanmar-army-leaders-over-rohingya-crisis-sources-idINKBN1CD0R9?il=0

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Catalonia’s capital Barcelona on Sunday to express their opposition to declaring independence from Spain, showing how divided the region is on the issue.

A crowd estimated by local police to number 350,000 waved Spanish and Catalan flags and carried banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”. They poured into the city center after politicians on both sides hardened their positions in the country’s worst political crisis for decades.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Saturday he would not rule out removing Catalonia’s government and calling a fresh local election if it claimed independence, as well as suspending the wealthy region’s existing autonomous status.

The stark warning came days before Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the region’s parliament, on Tuesday, when he could unilaterally declare independence.

The anti-independence demonstration, which included Catalans and people from other parts of Spain, underlined how the dispute has riven the region itself, coming less than a month after a million people rallied in the same city to support independence.

“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said during Sunday’s rally. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.”

The northeastern region of 7.5 million people, which has its own language and culture, held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 in defiance of a Spanish court ban.

More than 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who voted backed secession, according to Catalan officials. But that turnout represented only 43 percent of the region’s 5.3 million eligible voters as many opponents of independence stayed away.

The Spanish government sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers fired rubber bullets and charged crowds with truncheons in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and dramatically escalated the dispute.

CATALONIA‘S IMPORTANCE

Losing Catalonia is almost unthinkable for the Spanish government.

It would deprive Spain of about 16 percent of its people, a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. Catalonia is also the top destination for foreign tourists, attracting about a quarter of Spain’s total.

There is widespread opposition to a Catalan breakaway among people in the rest of the country.

The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia. The board of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis will meet on Monday to discuss moving its head office elsewhere in Spain, a source familiar with the matter said.

Concern is growing in EU capitals about the impact of the crisis on the Spanish economy, the fourth largest in the euro zone, and on possible spillovers to other economies.

Some European officials are also worried that any softening in Spain’s stance towards Catalan independence could fuel secessionist feelings among other groups in Europe such as Belgium’s Flemings and Italy’s Lombards.

‘DRASTIC SOLUTIONS’

Until this weekend, Rajoy has remained vague on whether he would take the unprecedented step of triggering Article 155 of the constitution, the so-called nuclear option which enables him to sack the regional government and call a local election.

However, asked if he was ready to do so, Rajoy told El Pais newspaper on Saturday: “I don’t rule out anything that is within the law ... Ideally, we shouldn’t have to take drastic solutions but for that not to happen there would have to be changes.”

Rajoy also said he planned to leave in Catalonia the 4,000 national police the government had shipped in for the referendum, until the crisis was over.

He ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said he is open to - and added the issue would not force a snap national election.

Sunday’s demonstration in Barcelona was organized by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society to mobilizes what it believes is a “silent majority” of citizens in Catalonia who oppose independence.

“The people who have come to demonstrate don’t feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”

The rally was addressed by Nobel prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who has dual Spanish and Peruvian nationality. He told reporters it showed many Catalans “don’t want the coup d‘etat the Catalan government is fostering”.

Tens of thousands of people had gathered in 50 cities across Spain on Saturday, some defending Spain’s national unity and others dressed in white and calling for talks to defuse the crisis.",Thousands protest in Barcelona against Catalan independence,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/thousands-protest-in-barcelona-against-catalan-independence-idUSKBN1CD0ES?il=0

With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

LONDON (Reuters) - British shops enjoyed their biggest jump in sales in more than three years in September, a survey of the retail sector showed, suggesting consumers are finding ways to cope with the squeeze on their incomes.

Accountancy firm BDO said on Friday its High Street Sales Tracker found overall like-for-like store sales rose by an annual 2.9 percent, adding to a smaller rise in August.

However, the increase was distorted by weak sales in September 2016, suggesting underlying growth remained slow.

Britain’s economy slowed sharply in the first half of 2017 as the rise in inflation since last year’s Brexit vote and modest pay growth squeezed spending power for households.

The Bank of England expects consumer demand to pick up. It said three weeks ago that most of its policymakers believed a first interest rate hike in a decade was likely to be needed in the coming months, if inflation pressures continued to build.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Friday pushed back the unveiling of the company’s big rig truck until mid-November, tweeting that the electric vehicle maker was diverting resources to fix production bottlenecks of its new Model 3 sedan and to help Puerto Rico.

Musk said Tesla’s Model 3 was “deep in production hell” echoing his own comments in July, when he showed off some of the first cars of that model.

The Model 3 could help Tesla approach its goal of becoming more of a mass market producer. Recent comments have tempered expectations about the speed of the increase in production, though.

Musk’s comments came after the close of stock trading on Friday. The company’s shares fell 0.8 percent in extended trading.

The Palo Alto, California-based company delivered just 220 Model 3 sedans and produced 260 in the third quarter. It had planned to produce more than 1,500.

Musk also tweeted the company was diverting resources to increasing battery production to help hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, where most residents remain without electricity.

Earlier this week Tesla reported that “production bottlenecks” had left it behind the planned ramp-up for the Model 3.

In response to a Tesla customer asking if he would get his car delivered this year, Musk tweeted, “December will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now.”

A Wall Street Journal report said parts of Model 3 were being made by hand as recently as early September, adding to production delays. (on.wsj.com/2kt5E17)

Musk also said Tesla would reschedule the unveiling of its semi-truck to Nov. 16 as it focuses on fixing production issues tied to Model 3 and increases battery production for Puerto Rico.

The unveiling of the truck, called Tesla Semi, has been delayed for the second time this year. Musk had initially said the truck would be unveiled in September, but he later rescheduled it to late October.

“Semi specs are better than anything I’ve seen reported so far. Semi eng/design team work is aces, but other needs are greater right now,” Elon replied to a twitter user who asked him about the specifications of the semi-truck.

Reuters in August reported that the truck would have a working range of 200-300 miles.

Earlier in the day, Musk said the company will send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out power on the island over two weeks ago.",Tesla delays big rig truck debut; Model 3 in 'production hell',https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CB2NQ-OCATC

Russian officials have accused Washington of putting unwarranted pressure on the U.S. operations of RT, a Kremlin-funded broadcaster accused by some in Washington of interfering in domestic U.S. politics, which it denies.

The foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said the full weight of the U.S. authorities was being brought to bear against RT’s operations in the United States, and that Moscow had the right to respond.

“We have never used Russian law in relation to foreign correspondents as a lever of pressure, or censorship, or some kind of political influence, never,” Zakharova said in an interview with Russia’s NTV broadcaster. “But this is a particular case.”

She cited a 1991 Russian law which, she said, stated that if a Russian media outlet is subject to restrictions in a foreign country, then Moscow has the right to impose proportionate restrictions on media outlets from that country operating inside Russia.

“Correspondingly, everything that Russian journalists and the RT station are subject to on U.S. soil, after we qualified it as restriction of their activities, we can apply similar measures to American journalists, American media here, on Russian territory,” Zakharova said.

She did not identify any specific U.S. media outlets that would be targeted. She said it made no difference from the Russian government’s point of view if those outlets were backed by the U.S. state, or privately-funded.

Late last month, Russia’s state communications regulator accused U.S. TV channel CNN International of violating its license to broadcast in Russia and said it had summoned the broadcaster’s representatives in connection with the matter.

The watchdog did not publicly disclose the nature of the violation. The head of the regulator said it was a technical matter and denied that politics was involved.

U.S. intelligence officials, in a report in January this year into allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, said RT was part of a state-run propaganda machine that supported a Kremlin campaign to influence U.S. politics.

AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish army reconnaissance team scouted out Syria’s Idlib province on Sunday, a senior Syrian rebel said, before an expected military operation to impose peace in the bitterly contested Syrian northwest.

“When we don’t go to Syria, Syria comes to us,” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party. “If we didn’t take our measures, bombs would fall on our cities.”

Turkey says it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed, aiming to implement a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area, the most populous pocket of Syria still in rebel hands.

Although Turkish officials say they are helping the rebels from within Turkey, in past interventions they have also sent troops across the frontier.

Any incursion could bring them into conflict with powerful jihadists from al Qaeda’s former Syrian branch, although there were signs on Sunday that they were working to avoid a confrontation.

Local sources said the Turkish military vehicles were escorted into Idlib by a convoy of fighters from the group, which has joined a jihadist alliance called Tahrir al-Sham and disavowed links to the network founded by Osama bin Laden.

Nonetheless, the jihadists and the Turkish military earlier exchanged fire nearby, underscoring the tension as Turkey builds up its forces and the rebel groups it backs prepare to enter Idlib.

“We will never allow a terror corridor that begins in Afrin and goes to the Mediterranean,” Erdogan said, referring to the stretch of Turkey’s southern border which is controlled on the Syrian side by Kurdish fighters and Tahrir al-Sham.

Related Coverage Erdogan says Turkey working with Syria rebels to implement Idlib accord

Turkey has been one of the biggest supporters of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the six-and-a-half-year war, but its focus has moved from ousting him to securing its own border against jihadist and Kurdish groups.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim stressed the importance of ensuring de-escalation near the border, following an agreement reached in Astana, Kazakhstan last month that was backed both by the Turks and by Russia, which supports Assad.

“We will ensure safety in Idlib, and will cooperate with Russia,” Yildirim said.

Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former Nusra Front, which was al Qaeda’s Syrian branch until last year when it changed its name and broke allegiance to the global network, has been a formidable military force since early in the conflict.

Since early this year it has battled other rebel groups as it tried to gain control over areas including Idlib.

UNDER ESCORT

Idlib and neighboring parts of northwest Syria are now home to more than 2 million people, many of them refugees from other formerly rebel-held regions that fell to pro-government forces.

A local resident and another local rebel said they had seen Turkish military vehicles enter Idlib and then travel under Tahrir al-Sham escort along a road.

The senior Syrian rebel said the reconnaissance team went to Sheikh Barakat, a location that overlooks both rebel-held areas of Aleppo province, adjacent to Idlib, and the Kurdish-controlled area of Afrin.

Erdogan gave no details of the operation, but said it was going ahead “without problems at the moment”.

Turkey’s biggest security concern on the frontier is the Kurdish YPG militia, which as part of a U.S.-backed alliance is fighting against Islamic State in eastern Syria. Ankara regards the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey.

Mortars were fired from the area under YPG control near to the location where the Turkish reconnaissance team was operating, the senior rebel said.

“The Turkish team is on its way back. Its mission has been accomplished. They visited areas of disengagement and locations where the Turkish army would be positioned,” the rebel said.

Reuters witnesses, local people, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said earlier on Sunday the Turkish military and Tahrir al-Sham had clashed near the village of Kafr Lusin in Idlib.

Tahrir al-Sham began the exchange by firing on a Turkish bulldozer removing sections of a border wall and Turkish artillery returned fire, they said. The area was later quiet.

Rebel groups that will take part - drawn from the Euphrates Shield campaign that Turkey backed with armor and troops in another part of Syria to the east since last year - said on Saturday they expected the Idlib operation to start very soon.

Tahrir al-Sham said “the lions of jihad and martyrdom will be waiting to pounce” against any incursion into Idlib.

The Syrian Civil Defence, better known as the White Helmets rescue workers, said on its Twitter account that jets it believed to be from the Syrian military had struck a marketplace in Maarat al-Numan in Idlib on Sunday, killing at least six.",Turkish army surveys Syria's Idlib before deployment - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/turkish-army-surveys-syrias-idlib-before-deployment-sources-idINKBN1CD06M?il=0

As many of 15 percent of U.S. IPOs in recent years have used dual share classes meant to give insiders outsized voting rights, according to the Council of Institutional Investors.","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When data center operator Switch Inc goes public on Friday it will be the latest tech firm using special shares to limit the rights of minority investors, making it ineligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 under new rules meant to deter such practices.

The Las Vegas company, run by enigmatic founder and Chief Executive Officer Rob Roy, plans to sell 31.3 million shares in an initial public offer late on Thursday for between $14 and $16 a piece, which would raise nearly $500 million and make it the largest technology listing this year after Snap Inc .

Underwriters closed their order book late on Wednesday and the deal was oversubscribed, according to a source close to the IPO.

Roy, who describes himself as an “inventrepreneur” and “tech futurist,” will have 68 percent of voting power following the IPO, thanks to a special share class providing 10 votes per share.

That will keep Switch out of the S&P 500 and other related indexes under new rules instituted by S&P Dow Jones in July after Snap sold shares without any voting rights in its $3.4 billion IPO earlier this year.

Rule changes enacted last month for FTSE Russell indexes, also in reaction to Snap, require new constituents of its indexes to have at least 5 percent of their voting rights in the hands of public shareholders.

The shares being sold in Switch’s IPO will include 4.9 percent of the company’s voting rights, or 5.6 percent if underwriters exercise an option to buy additional shares.

In its IPO filing and a profile of Roy on the company website, Switch gives no details about what he did before founding the company in 2000 or his academic qualifications. The profile describes him as “a recognized expert in advanced end-to-end solutions for mission-critical facilities.”

A company spokesman declined to provide additional information about Roy, and he does not appear in a 38-minute video marketing the IPO.

The IPO could value Switch, which operates three data centers in Michigan and Nevada, at almost $4 billion.

Snap co-founder Evan Spiegel was well known to Wall Street ahead of the Snapchat-owner’s February share offer, with many investors essentially betting on his talent. With Roy less known, investors may be taking a greater risk on a company in which they will have little say.

“Investors do look at voting control as well as the price you pay. If you put so much stock in the CEO, normally he’s going to part of the sales pitch for the company,” said Ken Bertsch, Executive Director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents top U.S. pension funds.

As many of 15 percent of U.S. IPOs in recent years have used dual share classes meant to give insiders outsized voting rights, according to the Council of Institutional Investors.

Inclusion in a stock index can be an important milestone for young companies, bringing their shares into many passive funds and others that closely follow indexes like the S&P 500, a guide for trillions of dollars of capital worldwide.

Other companies excluded from major indexes under their new rules include video-streaming company Roku Inc , whose IPO last week kept 97 percent of voting power with insiders. Software seller Mulesoft Inc’s IPO in February included a share class with 10 votes per share, as did Blue Apron Holdings Inc in its June debut.

Suggesting that the tide may be turning toward sharing power with minority investors, privately-held ride-hailing company Uber on Tuesday said it would abandon a dual share class system that favored insiders including former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick.

Responding to a shareholder lawsuit, Facebook Inc in September gave up plans for a new class of stock that was meant to be a way for Mark Zuckerberg to retain control over the company he founded while fulfilling a pledge to give away his wealth.",Switch IPO the latest to limit investor voting rights,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-switch-stocks/switch-ipo-the-latest-to-limit-investor-voting-rights-idUSKBN1CA26D

(Reuters) - World number one Rafael Nadal produced a ruthless performance to thrash Australian Nick Kyrgios 6-2 6-1 in the China Open final on Sunday for his 75th career singles title.

The 31-year-old was given a tough fight early on but Kyrgios’s challenge faded after he lost his temper and was docked a penalty point at 2-5 in the first set.

Nadal’s previous title at the tournament came 12 years ago.

“I had very tough draw here,” Nadal, who saved match points in his opening round against Frenchman Lucas Pouille, said.

“I was lucky the first day saving the two match points but after that I think I played one of my best events of the year.”

World number 19 Kyrgios matched Nadal early on, winning his opening two service games but became involved in a debate with umpire Mohamed Lahyani over a close line call against him.

“I can’t play at 100 percent if that stuff happens -- and then you expect me not to be angry,” Kyrgios told Lahyani.

He continued to argue the toss with the official who eventually awarded a penalty point against the Australian during the changeover when he trailed 2-5, meaning he began the eighth game already 0-15 behind.

Nadal was well in control by then and he raced into a 5-0 lead in the second set before Kyrgios slightly delayed the inevitable as the Spaniard sauntered to his 12th consecutive win.

“He played well. I played terrible. He’s in great form. He just destroyed me today, so it was too good,” Kyrgios, who struck 20 winners but 35 unforced errors, said.

“I put in a pretty good week, had some good wins. It’s tough to find positives when you won three games in the final. But I guess there were positives. In the semi-final I played well, obviously beating Alex (Zverev).”

Kyrgios still has a chance of qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals as he is 15th in the Race standings with several tournaments remaining to close the gap on those in front.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Sunday that the United States was serving the interests of Islamic State by preventing the Syrian army and its allies advancing in some areas of eastern Syria.

American jets have this year targeted pro-government militias in eastern Syria that were advancing towards Washington’s local allies.

Nasrallah said the United States was delaying the Syrian military in its battle to retake territory from Islamic State.

“The American air force in some areas prevents the Syrian army and its allies from advancing in areas controlled by Islamic State,” said the leader of Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shi‘ite movement designated by Washington as a terrorist group.

“The Americans are working to hinder the battle against Islamic State,” he said in a speech, part of a commemoration for Hezbollah fighters killed in clashes against Islamic State.

His comments came after a senior U.S. official said President Donald Trump was considering putting sanctions on Iran for its support of Hezbollah, and as the U.S. Congress prepares to consider tighter sanctions on Hezbollah itself.

The battlefield situation in Syrian is complex, comprising both a civil war that pits Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government against rebels, as well as two separate campaigns against Islamic State.

The Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran and Shi‘ite militias including Hezbollah, has advanced against Islamic State in an offensive across the central Syrian desert in recent months.

The United States is meanwhile leading a rival international coalition against the Sunni jihadists that includes an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias.

Russia and the United States have put in place measures to prevent outright conflict between the two offensives against Islamic State, but there have been times when they fired on each other.

Security sources in Lebanon have said that Hezbollah has lost hundreds of fighters in Syria since it entered the conflict in support of Assad in 2013 against rebel groups.

LONDON (Reuters) - Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said he hoped a new requirement for lenders to hold more capital would dampen signs of a “bit of exuberance” in credit card and personal lending to British consumers.

The Bank of England said last month that lenders had underestimated the risks from a surge in consumer borrowing, and they needed to hold an extra 10 billion pounds of capital to guard against future dangers.

Cunliffe said on Sunday that banks were being over-optimistic in estimating the likely losses from credit card and personal loan debt because they were confusing good economic conditions with the credit quality of the actual borrowers.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - He runs a company that is a byword for technological innovation -- but Nokia’s chairman had no qualms about going back to school to learn more about artificial intelligence (AI).

Risto Siilasmaa, 51, said he signed up this summer for online courses on AI programming run by Stanford University.

“I realized that I don’t have deep enough knowledge on this phenomenon... Now I‘m back studying programming after 30 years,” he told Reuters on Friday by email.

“I do not want to become an AI programmer. I want to deeply understand the abilities and limitations of AI.”

Since starting the courses, Siilasmaa said he had briefed the Finnish telecom infrastructure firm’s board and managers on the subject.

“I want to raise awareness ...on this, because AI will be a key driver of the ongoing industrial revolution.”

Once the preserve of researchers, artificial intelligence has grabbed the attention of businesses from healthcare to financial services looking to use algorithms to parse data in search of patterns to solve problems.

Nokia aims to offer more sophisticated software to analyze the mountains of data that telecom network operators collect, in order to create more powerful and more personalized services.

Potential AI applications Nokia has begun to roll out this year include troubleshooting network bottlenecks and traffic analysis for use in driverless cars and “smart cities” filled with billions of network-linked devices.

Siilasmaa received plaudits for transforming the Finnish company from an ailing mobile phone manufacturer into one of the world’s biggest telecoms network equipment makers.

“I’ve noticed that when doing something ...that people are not used to see the chairman doing, that inspires people and encourages them to think out of the box,” he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said on Sunday her new party aims to offer voters a “middle of the fairway” choice, seeking to differentiate her group from ruling, conservative Liberal Democratic Party and smaller, left-leaning opposition parties.

Koike’s Party of Hope, launched just last month, is challenging Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party-led ruling coalition in an Oct. 22 election, promising to freeze a planned 2019 sales tax hike and consider a new tax on companies’ retained earnings.

“If I use a golf course metaphor, right now, I believe we have right (wing parties) and left (wing parties) and nothing in between. So we will present ourselves as the fairway, the very centre of the way,” Koike told a policy debate by major party leaders.

The outlook for the election is unclear but some analysts say Koike’s party may be losing steam because it had too little time to prepare for the snap poll. Her decision not to run for a lower house seat herself could also deter voters, they said.

A Yomiuri newspaper survey published online later on Sunday showed that 32 percent of voters planned to cast ballots for the LDP in proportional representation districts where voters pick a party, not a candidate, outstripping the 13 percent opting for the Party of Hope. Another 7 percent chose the small, new left-leaning Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CSDJ).

Koike said her party’s policies aim to bring a new idea such as basic income and will be closer to consumers.

“The idea of basic income is still experimental but we think this is something we should consider in the future,” she said.

But Koike declined to reveal who would lead a government should her party, formed only about two weeks ago by her supporters and some opposition lawmakers, be in a position to form one.

“I will think about it after we see the results of the election,” she said.

Koike, a former LDP lawmaker, has repeatedly denied she would run for a seat in the election, which means she could not lead a government herself as the constitution stipulates a prime minister has to be selected from elected lawmakers.

That has led to speculation her Party of Hope may tie up with some LDP lawmakers who have been alienated by Abe, such as former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba.

She told Reuters on Friday that all options were on the table regarding whom her party would back when parliament convenes to vote on a prime minister after the election.

While Party of Hope’s economic policies differ from those of Abe’s conservative LDP, but many of its security and diplomatic policies echo LDP’s agenda, including revision to Japan’s pacifist constitution.

The campaign for the Oct. 22 election kicks off formally on Oct. 10.

Abe reiterated during the debate that his government would remain in power if the ruling coalition wins a simple majority of the 465 seats up for grabs, although some analysts suggest he himself could face pressure to resign if his LDP fares badly.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Disagreement among U.S. congressional Republicans is already swirling around a tax cut plan unveiled days ago by President Donald Trump, who has proposed repealing the tax on inheritances and eliminating a deduction for state and local tax payments.

The discord shows the difficulty of overhauling the complex U.S. tax code. This task has defied Washington since 1986, the last time a comprehensive rewrite was completed despite lobbyists who defend each tax break.

Trump has yet to score a major legislative win since taking office in January and is pushing hard for a tax code revamp. But his plan is meeting the same internal Republican tensions between moderates and conservatives that have sunk his efforts this year to repeal the Obamacare health law.

“There’s a lot of give and take,” Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn told Fox Business Network on Friday.

Members of the administration “have been meeting everyday with the tax writers trying to figure out where they need to end up to get the votes ... we’re going to make sure the president gets what he asks for,” he added.

One obstacle is the projected fiscal impact of the plan, which would slash U.S. revenues and expand the federal deficit and the national debt, which now exceeds $20 trillion.

Republican lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York exited meetings this week with Kevin Brady, chairman of the House of Representatives’ tax-writing committee, saying there would be some sort of compromise on repealing the deduction for state and local tax payments.

Separately, some Republican senators were questioning the repeal of a 40 percent inheritance tax levied on estate assets worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for married couples. That tax affects only about 0.2 percent of estates, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank.

“That is not a priority for me as we seek to craft this tax bill,” Senator Susan Collins, who has often been a key Republican vote, said in a statement on Thursday.

Republicans want to use a procedure known as budget reconciliation to pass eventual tax legislation, which allows passage with a simple majority in the 100-seat Senate. Republicans hold 52 Senate seats and can only afford to lose support from two senators, with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a tie-breaking vote. Democrats will likely oppose the legislation.

One Republican fiscal hawk, Senator Bob Corker, has already said he cannot support tax legislation that adds to the annual federal deficit.

“We remain very bearish on any tax legislation passing this year - or next,” Cowen and Co analyst Chris Krueger said in a Friday research note.

The Trump plan, made public last week, calls for up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. Without accompanying spending reductions, the budget would hugely expand the deficit, according to some estimates.

The administration contends tax cuts would spur so much economic growth that the resulting new revenues would help offset the cost.

In addition, Republicans are proposing “revenue raisers,” such as ending the deduction for payments of state and local tax, known as SALT. Doing that would raise about $1.3 trillion over a decade, the Tax Policy Center said.

Almost 30 percent of taxpayers currently deduct state and local taxes. In New Jersey, for example, 41 percent of tax filers, meaning individuals or married couples, claimed the deduction, which averaged $17,850, according to a Government Finance Officers Association analysis of Internal Revenue Service data.

Although the deduction disproportionately benefits people in high-tax states and localities, individuals in all states claim it. In Georgia, for example, 33 percent of tax filers claim an average deduction of $9,158, the report said.

Republican Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Trump ally, told reporters earlier this week that lawmakers from high-tax states, such as his own, were discussing “ways to level the playing field,” including capping the amount of the deduction or putting other limits on it.

“There are many districts with Republican members where state and local deduction is used by a large portion of the taxpayers,” said Frank Sammartino, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. “So it’s not surprising that it’s not strictly a blue state/red state thing.”

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the state and local tax deduction the “Achilles’ heel” of tax reform and said his party would oppose any move to repeal it. He dismissed compromise plans as unfeasible.

Brady said on Thursday that at this point there has been no change to the framework, but tax writers are “listening very carefully” to lawmakers’ concerns.

“It’s got to be frustrating when you’re in a state where local and state officials really put the screws to taxpayers,” Brady told reporters. “We are determined to provide tax relief to every American, regardless of where they live.”",Discord among Republicans already weighs on Trump's tax plan,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-salt/discord-among-republicans-already-weighs-on-trumps-tax-plan-idUSKBN1CB13X?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Catalonia’s capital Barcelona on Sunday to express their opposition to declaring independence from Spain, showing how divided the region is on the issue.

A crowd estimated by local police to number 350,000 waved Spanish and Catalan flags and carried banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”. They poured into the city center after politicians on both sides hardened their positions in the country’s worst political crisis for decades.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Saturday he would not rule out removing Catalonia’s government and calling a fresh local election if it claimed independence, as well as suspending the wealthy region’s existing autonomous status.

The stark warning came days before Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the region’s parliament, on Tuesday, when he could unilaterally declare independence.

The anti-independence demonstration, which included Catalans and people from other parts of Spain, underlined how the dispute has riven the region itself, coming less than a month after a million people rallied in the same city to support independence.

“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said during Sunday’s rally. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.”

The northeastern region of 7.5 million people, which has its own language and culture, held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 in defiance of a Spanish court ban.

More than 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who voted backed secession, according to Catalan officials. But that turnout represented only 43 percent of the region’s 5.3 million eligible voters as many opponents of independence stayed away.

The Spanish government sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers fired rubber bullets and charged crowds with truncheons in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and dramatically escalated the dispute.

CATALONIA‘S IMPORTANCE

Losing Catalonia is almost unthinkable for the Spanish government.

It would deprive Spain of about 16 percent of its people, a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. Catalonia is also the top destination for foreign tourists, attracting about a quarter of Spain’s total.

There is widespread opposition to a Catalan breakaway among people in the rest of the country.

The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia. The board of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis will meet on Monday to discuss moving its head office elsewhere in Spain, a source familiar with the matter said.

Concern is growing in EU capitals about the impact of the crisis on the Spanish economy, the fourth largest in the euro zone, and on possible spillovers to other economies.

Some European officials are also worried that any softening in Spain’s stance towards Catalan independence could fuel secessionist feelings among other groups in Europe such as Belgium’s Flemings and Italy’s Lombards.

‘DRASTIC SOLUTIONS’

Until this weekend, Rajoy has remained vague on whether he would take the unprecedented step of triggering Article 155 of the constitution, the so-called nuclear option which enables him to sack the regional government and call a local election.

However, asked if he was ready to do so, Rajoy told El Pais newspaper on Saturday: “I don’t rule out anything that is within the law ... Ideally, we shouldn’t have to take drastic solutions but for that not to happen there would have to be changes.”

Rajoy also said he planned to leave in Catalonia the 4,000 national police the government had shipped in for the referendum, until the crisis was over.

He ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said he is open to - and added the issue would not force a snap national election.

Sunday’s demonstration in Barcelona was organized by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society to mobilizes what it believes is a “silent majority” of citizens in Catalonia who oppose independence.

“The people who have come to demonstrate don’t feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”

The rally was addressed by Nobel prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who has dual Spanish and Peruvian nationality. He told reporters it showed many Catalans “don’t want the coup d‘etat the Catalan government is fostering”.

Tens of thousands of people had gathered in 50 cities across Spain on Saturday, some defending Spain’s national unity and others dressed in white and calling for talks to defuse the crisis.",Thousands protest in Barcelona against Catalan independence,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CD0ES-OCATP

Google’s new products, including a Pixelbook laptop, wireless earbuds and a small GoPro-like camera, showcase Google-developed operating systems and services, notably the voice assistant. That means usage of those devices should stoke the company’s core ad sales business as buyers of the hardware use Google services like search and maps.

Speaking at the launch in San Francisco, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said the new products “perfectly demonstrate our strategy of re-imagining hardware from the inside out.”

The Pixel 2 smartphone comes in two sizes, with comparable features, including aluminum bodies and no traditional jacks for headphones. Prices for the base model start at $649, while the high-end version starts at $849. The phones will be available Oct. 19.

The Pixel phones lack the brand lustre and market share of similarly priced smartphones such as the Apple iPhone or Samsung Electronics Co’s Galaxy S and Galaxy Note smartphones. Still, the original Pixel’s camera and software drew acclaim from reviewers, many of whom expect the line to become a robust competitor at the high end of the Android smartphone market.

Pixelbook, priced at $999, is the first laptop powered by Google Assistant and will support Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat, the company said. The keyboard folds behind the screen to turn the 12.3-inch touchscreen into a tablet. It will be available in stores from Oct. 31.

Google Home Mini, one of the new speakers, is priced at $49 in the United States and would rival Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) popular Echo Dot. It will be available Oct. 19. The Home Max, with dual woofers for more powerful sound, is priced at $399 and with availability by the end of the year.

The Pixel Buds, which are priced at $149, arrive in November. Clips, which is pocket-sized camera with object detection and automatic recording capabilities, “soon” goes on sale for $249, Google said. Videos last only a few seconds and do not contain audio.

The Pixel smartphone debuted a year ago, with analysts estimating sales of more than 2 million, pushing Google to record amounts of non-advertising revenue.

Google’s “other” revenue category, which includes both hardware and sales of online storage services, accounted for about 12 percent of overall sales in its most recent quarter.

Last month, Google expanded its hardware development capabilities by picking up a 2,000-person smartphone engineering team at HTC (2498.TW) for $1.1 billion.

“It’s pretty clear Google is serious about hardware,” said Avi Greengart, research director at consumer data firm GlobalData. “Given that there is a Pixel 2, and given the financial investment, there must be a longer-term strategic intent.”

HARDWARE CHIEF HAS SECOND GO

Google moved into smartphones five years ago with the $12.5-billion purchase of Motorola Mobility. But Motorola’s hardware team, under Osterloh, and Google’s Android mobile operating system division remained independent. Google wanted to avoid giving it a special advantage and protect its relationships with Samsung, LG and other distributors of Android. The company later sold the Motorola smartphone business.

Osterloh, now working inside Google, moved to bring in-house the HTC team Google contracted to design the Pixel. He enjoys a strong relationship with Hiroshi Lockheimer, the Android division head. The pair have been friends since working together for several years at Good Technology in the early 2000s.

Protecting relationships with others in the Android ecosystem has become less of a concern. Samsung ratched down the rivalary with Google after the firms agreed to a major patent licensing deal in early 2014. Other vendors have seen their market share dip.

Google’s eye is now on Apple, whose iPhone has become the smartphone to beat.

The first Pixel debuted a year ago with a significant marketing push: during the last three months of the year, Google spent an estimated $110 million to air 12 Pixel-related commercials, according to data from advertising measurement firm iSpot.tv.

Apple spent $147 million during the same span, iSpot.tv said. Apple has sustained its TV time throughout the last year, while Google’s efforts have tapered off.

In the speakers market, Google’s personal-assistant lags Amazon’s Echo devices in market share, according to investment bank Cowen & Co. Last week, Amazon released several new models of the Echo, including one with a display as it tried to find a place in every niche.

Rishi Chandra, vice president of product management for Google’s Home hardware unit, said in an interview that Google was being “a little bit more thoughtful” than the online shopping company.

“Amazon is taking a broad approach,” Chandra said. “We’re going to iterate until we have a good product story to tell.”","Google launches new phones, speakers in hardware push",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-hardware/google-launches-new-phones-speakers-in-hardware-push-idUSKBN1C92IQ

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly excited about the prospects for much faster growth in the solar power industry in Southeast Asia, which has until now been a backwater for renewable energy.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Toronto home sales plunged in September from a year earlier and prices were down 15.5 percent from their April peak, but sales and prices inched up from August, suggesting housing in Canada’s largest city may be stabilizing, data showed on Wednesday.

Sales fell 35.1 percent from September 2016, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) said in a report. It was the sixth straight month of declining year-on-year sales after a years-long boom that sparked fears of a bubble.

The average selling price was up 2.6 percent compared with a year earlier, while new listings and days on the market both rose, TREB said. Market watchers have been waiting to see if buyers and sellers would come back to the market after taking to the sidelines during the traditionally slow summer months.

The average selling price for all home types combined was C$775,546 ($621,680), down 15.5 percent from a peak of C$918,285 in April.

The Ontario government introduced multiple measures in late April, including a foreign buyers tax, in a bid to cool the housing market in Toronto and the surrounding areas.

“The improvement in listings in September compared to a year earlier suggests that home owners are anticipating an uptick in sales activity as we move through the fall,” TREB President Tim

Syrianos said in a statement.

”As we move through the fourth quarter we could see some buyers moving off the sidelines, taking advantage of a better-supplied marketplace,” he added.

New listings rose 9.4 percent from a year earlier, while active listings were up 69.0 percent as properties sit on the market for longer.

The Bank of Canada has begun what most analysts believe will be a gradual process of raising interest rates from near historic lows, which has in turn boosted mortgage rates and other borrowing costs.

The central bank raised its key rate by a total of 50 basis points to 1.00 percent in two back-to-back moves in July and September, and some expect at least one more hike before the end of the year.","Toronto home sales fall again, prices down 15.5 percent from peak",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1C91FI-OCADN

LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Toyota intends to build the next version of its Auris car at its British car plant on the assumption that the government secures a transitional Brexit deal, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The final decision is due to be made by the end of the year, according to the sources and a government briefing document released to Reuters under a freedom of information request.

The new Auris would keep one of Britain’s biggest car plants operating, secure thousands of jobs and provide a welcome endorsement to Prime Minister Theresa May.

Toyota builds the current generation of Auris hatchbacks at its Burnaston plant in central England, with the run due to end in around 2021, but firms make model decisions up to three years in advance partly to organise supply chains.

“Toyota UK management have a working assumption that the UK will retain the next generation Auris because it is too early to determine the nature of the trading relationship with the EU,” one of the two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

“They believe that there will be a transitional period,” according to the source who said the firm was highly likely to build the next-generation Auris in Britain.

The final decision will be made by Toyota’s board by the end of the year and announced shortly afterwards, the sources said.

Toyota declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. A spokesman at Britain’s business ministry said it was a commercial matter for Toyota.

In March, the company said it would invest 240 million pounds to upgrade to a new global car-building platform but has not confirmed which models it will build going forward.

The platform investment decision was helped by a government letter reassuring the firm over post-Brexit trading arrangements, sources have told Reuters.

Britain’s car industry is concerned that 10 percent tariffs, border checks and loss of free access to Europe could hit the viability of their plants if May fails to secure a good Brexit deal.

IMPORTANCE OF TRANSITION

May said last month that she would seek a Brexit transition period of around two years after Britain formally leaves the EU in 2019, aiming to appease businesses concerned that the country could leave the European Union without a deal.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond emphasised this week the importance to businesses of a period which would ease Britain out of the European Union and into a new trade relationship, causing as little disruption as possible.

“We have got businesses that have to make decisions over the next few months,” he told BBC radio, not naming which firms he was referring to.

“Some of those decisions, once made, will be irreversible and if we don’t give business clarity over the future, they will have to make decisions assuming the worst possible outcome,” he added.

Toyota could delay its model investment decision for a few months, the second source said, as it did with its March architecture investment decision.

A key part of the current decision-making is around how much they could increase the local supply chain, the first source said.

In March, Toyota said its new vehicle architecture investment would also “promote UK supply chain efficiencies.”

AVENSIS UNCERTAINTY

The Burnaston plant also builds the family Avensis car but Toyota has yet to make a final decision on whether to keep building the vehicle, whose sales have been disappointing.

“They’ve not given up on Avensis,” the first source said.

In March, Executive Vice President Didier Leroy said no final decision had been taken on the future of the Avensis.

“Can we afford to have a specific model specifically for Europe, designed for Europe, produced in Europe and sold only in Europe or do we want some thing that is a little bit more global which can be designed and produced in Europe but using more global components?”

Japanese firms Nissan, Honda and Toyota built around half of British car output, which stood at 1.7 million units last year, but is likely to fall in 2017.

In the first eight months of the year, Toyota’s British production fell around 20 percent with the Avensis model declining the most, according to the second source.

May visited Japan earlier this year, partly to allay Tokyo’s concerns over Brexit. She met a number of business leaders including Toyota’s Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada.

Her meeting came just weeks after foreign minister Boris Johnson also travelled to Tokyo in July.

A government briefing note related to his visit released to Reuters under a freedom of information request, confirms that Toyota is due to make a model decision before the end of the year.

Hawkins, nicknamed “The Hawk” and a Brooklyn playground legend, played four All-Star seasons with the Suns from 1969 to 1973. He also played for the Los Angeles Lakers and Atlanta Hawks.

The Suns, who retired Hawkins’ number 42 jersey, announced Saturday that he passed away on Friday.

”‘The Hawk’ revolutionized the game and remains to this day an icon of the sport and one of basketball’s great innovators,“ the Suns said in a statement. ”His unique combination of size, grace and athleticism was well ahead of its time and his signature style of play is now a hallmark of the modern game.

“Connie’s passion for the game was only matched by his desire to give back to the Phoenix community, a role which he played proudly as a Suns community ambassador, spreading warmth and kindness to everyone he encountered. We will miss Hawk dearly. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends as we mourn the passing of a true Suns legend.”

The 6-foot-8 Hawkins averaged 16.5 points, 8.0 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.2 steals during his NBA career.

Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hurricane Nate had curtailed 92 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output and up to 3 percent of refining capacity on Saturday as it sped toward energy facilities in the central U.S. Gulf Coast that largely were spared by Hurricane Harvey’s wrath nearly six weeks ago.

The fast-moving storm has forced evacuations at more than 300 U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore platforms, far more than the number affected by Harvey, which packed more of a punch when it hit the Texas coast.

Nate could still become a Category 2 storm, the second-weakest on a five-category scale used by meteorologists, with winds of up to 110 miles per hour (177 kph) before landfall later on Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said.

The storm was about 50 miles (80 km) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River on Saturday afternoon and moving at 23 mph, according to the NHC.

Its track has taken it closer to offshore production than Harvey, whose impact was greatest on refining centers. On Saturday, some 1.6 million barrels per day of oil and 2.48 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas output were halted by the storm, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement reported.

Colby Goatley, a meteorologist at Weather Decision Technologies Inc, said his firm is helping about 10 drilling rig operators chart a course away from Nate, which is producing waves of up to 30 feet (9.1 m) near its center.

“Rigs on the eastern side (of Nate) are racing westward to get on that more favorable side,” he said.

Weather Decision is expecting tropical storm-force winds to last about 12 hours, Goatley said, a relatively short period that will help offshore producers return to full operations quickly and rigs to return to their drilling sites.

Nate is converging on refineries that remained in operation during Harvey, with Phillips 66’s (PSX.N) Alliance plant, Valero Energy Corp’s (VLO.N) Meraux facility, and PBF Energy’s (PBF.N) Chalmette plant - all in Louisiana - and Chevron Corp’s (CVX.N) plant in Pascagoula, Mississippi, all within the impact zone.

Chevron halted production at the Pascagoula plant on Saturday, according to energy intelligence company Genscape. A Chevron spokesman declined to comment. Phillips 66 confirmed that it shut its Alliance refinery on Saturday.

Combined, the two process 587,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, of the nation’s refining capacity. Hurricane Harvey, which brought intense rains that flooded the Texas Gulf Coast, shut nearly a quarter of U.S. oil refining capacity.

Valero and PBF Energy were planning to keep running during Nate’s passage, according to sources familiar with those operations.

An up to 11-foot (3.4-m) storm surge is expected at the mouth of the Mississippi River in the next few hours, the NHC said at 5 p.m. (0900 GMT).

Am Sonntag treffen sich in Berlin CDU-Chefin Angela Merkel und CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer und weitere Unionspolitiker, um die Streitigkeiten um die von der CSU geforderte Obergrenze für die Aufnahme von Flüchtlingen beizulegen und Unions-Positionen für die Sondierungen mit FDP und Grüne abzustecken.

Er habe in den vergangenen Tagen eigene Vorschläge zur Flüchtlings- und Migrationspolitik vorgelegt, sagte de Maizière, wollte aber keine Details nennen. Merkel betonte in Dresden, sie arbeite daran, dass eine Lösung gelinge. Dies wirke zwar noch wie eine “Quadratur des Kreises”, sei aber mit gutem Willen aller Seiten sehr wohl möglich. Sie mahnte, dass CDU und CSU unbedingt ihre Einheit erhalten müssten, auch wenn die Flüchtlingspolitik sie in den vergangenen Jahren entzweit habe. Auch in der gemeinsamen Nachwuchsorganisation Junge Union wurden in Dresden am Samstag die Spannungen zwischen den Bayern und den 15 CDU-Landesverbänden deutlich.

CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt bekräftigte ebenfalls den Willen zu einer Einigung mit der CDU. Da etwa der Wohnungs- und Arbeitsmarkt nur begrenzt aufnahmefähig sei, “ist es doch folgerichtig, dass wir bei der Zuwanderung eine Obergrenze brauchen”, betonte er. Dobrindt sagte allerdings gleichzeitig, dass es bei der Aufnahme von individuell Verfolgten bleibe und die Zuwanderung von Fachkräften besser gesteuert werden solle. “Die Obergrenze ist nicht nur ein Bekenntnis, sie hat auch einen thematischen Unterbau”, fügte er hinzu. Dazu gehörten etwa die Fluchtursachenbekämpfung sowie sichere Grenzen, sagten sowohl der CSU-Politiker. Dies seien Felder, in denen die Bundesregierung längste handele, aber mehr tun müsse, sagte auch Merkel. Die Junge Union hatte in ihrer “Dresdner Erklärung” ihre 2015 aufgestellte Forderung nach der von der CSU geforderten Obergrenze für die Flüchtlingsaufnahme nicht wiederholt.

Deutliche Unterschiede zeigten sich bei den Unionspolitikern in der Einschätzung, wie schnell eine Jamaika-Koalition zustande kommen könne. “Es muss rote Linien geben. Es gibt Punkte, die für uns nicht verhandelbar sind”, sagte etwa Dobrindt. Er hatte sich zuletzt mehrfach kritisch über ein Jamaika-Bündnis zwischen CDU, CSU, Grünen und FDP geäußert. Er rechne mit einem Verhandlungsmarathon, bei dem man weder das Ergebnis noch die Dauer vorhersagen könne, sagte Dobrindt nun. Die CSU sorgt sich vor einem negativen Einfluss eines Bündnisses mit den Grünen auf Bundesebene auf die bayerische Landtagswahl 2018, bei der die Partei ihre absolute Mehrheit verteidigen will.

Dagegen forderte EU-Kommissar Oettinger eine Regierungsbildung bis Weihnachten. Kanzlerin Angela Merkel brauche zudem eine Koalitionsvereinbarung, die ihr erlaube, bei Reformen in Europa voranzugehen. Auch de Maiziere dringt auf Tempo. Deutschland als größter EU-Staat könne es sich nicht leisten, die Koalitionsbildung zu verschleppen. “Wir müssen schnell eine Regierung bilden. Da geht um mehr als uns selbst”, mahnte der CDU-Politiker. Merkel hatte zugesagt, dass ein CDU-Parteitag am Ende über den ausgehandelten Koalitionsvertrag entscheiden soll.",De Maiziere und Oettinger dringen auf rasche Regierungsbildung,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-koalition-union-idDEKBN1CD099

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to block a Chinese-backed firm from buying a U.S.-based chipmaker this week is detrimental to America’s growth and the global economy, China’s state news agency Xinhua said in a commentary on Saturday.

Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ planned $1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp was one of the largest attempted by a Chinese-backed firm in the U.S. microchip sector and was the first announced deal for the buyout fund, which launched last year with a focus on technology investment.

U.S. regulatory scrutiny grew after Reuters reported in November that Canyon Bridge was funded partly by capital from China’s central government and had indirect links to its space program.

Trump said in an executive order on Wednesday that Lattice and Canyon Bridge “shall take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed transaction” within 30 days.

“The move, which is detrimental to both America’s growth and global economic recovery, also runs counter to the mutually-beneficial and win-win nature of China-U.S. relations,” the Xinhua commentary said.

Security reviews of investments in sensitive sectors “should not be used as a tool to implement protectionism”, it added, echoing comments by a Commerce Ministry spokesman last week.

Citing analysts who said Trump’s decision was made with an eye to the 2018 midterm election, Xinhua called it “penny wise and pound foolish ... It is a short-sighted move to take protectionist measures amid sluggish global growth.”

“Chinese investment is not ‘Trojan Horse’ with hidden purposes,” it said.

Trump is set to visit China in November.

“The two countries need to strengthen dialogue and communication, promote cooperation and exchanges in various fields and properly handle issues of common concerns. Only then can China and the United States push forward the world’s most important bilateral relationship,” Xinhua said.",Trump move to block chipmaker deal bad for America - Xinhua,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-trade-commentary/trump-move-to-block-chipmaker-deal-bad-for-america-xinhua-idUSKCN1BR062

“Julie Girling and ... Richard Ashworth were suspended from the Conservative Party last night after supporting a resolution ... to block Brexit talks moving forward,” the party said on Sunday in a statement that highlighted divisions over Britain’s move to quit the European Union in 18 months.

Prime Minister Theresa May supported the move. A government source said the two had behaved “totally irresponsibly”.

“They left the party no choice but to act,” Ashley Fox, leader of the 20-strong group, said in the statement, describing the decision of Ashworth and Girling, a former group leader and chief whip respectively, as “extremely regrettable”.

Girling, who like Ashworth and Fox opposed Brexit during last year’s referendum, defended her decision to vote with the overwhelming majority in Strasbourg on Tuesday on a non-binding resolution which urged EU leaders not to accept London’s request for talks on post-Brexit trade without further concessions.

“I did not vote to prevent trade talks,” she said, noting she called for such negotiations. However, she said in a statement that it was “patently obvious” that the EU’s test of “sufficient progress” on key divorce issues were not yet met.

Her vote, she said, put the interests of her constituents over party discipline and referred to support on the far-right for Britain to walk out without a deal: “I have never agreed to silently acquiesce as our country heads towards a cliff edge,” she said, describing that as “wanton economic self-harm”.

The race from the northern city of Darwin to the southern city of Adelaide is expected to take a week for most cars, with speeds of 90-100 kmh (55-62 mph) powered only by the sun.

The fastest time was achieved by Japan’s Tokai University in 2009, completing the transcontinetal race in only 29 hours and 49 minutes.

But reigning 2015 champions Nuon from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands believes it has a good chance of retaining the prize.

“All the cars look completely different (this year), and all we know is we’ve got a good car, we’ve got it running perfectly the last couple of days and we’re confident we’re going to do everything to win,” tour manager Sarah Benninkbolt said Sunday.

Russian officials have accused Washington of putting unwarranted pressure on the U.S. operations of RT, a Kremlin-funded broadcaster accused by some in Washington of interfering in domestic U.S. politics, which it denies.

The foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said the full weight of the U.S. authorities was being brought to bear against RT’s operations in the United States, and that Moscow had the right to respond.

“We have never used Russian law in relation to foreign correspondents as a lever of pressure, or censorship, or some kind of political influence, never,” Zakharova said in an interview with Russia’s NTV broadcaster. “But this is a particular case.”

She cited a 1991 Russian law which, she said, stated that if a Russian media outlet is subject to restrictions in a foreign country, then Moscow has the right to impose proportionate restrictions on media outlets from that country operating inside Russia.

“Correspondingly, everything that Russian journalists and the RT station are subject to on U.S. soil, after we qualified it as restriction of their activities, we can apply similar measures to American journalists, American media here, on Russian territory,” Zakharova said.

She did not identify any specific U.S. media outlets that would be targeted. She said it made no difference from the Russian government’s point of view if those outlets were backed by the U.S. state, or privately-funded.

Late last month, Russia’s state communications regulator accused U.S. TV channel CNN International of violating its license to broadcast in Russia and said it had summoned the broadcaster’s representatives in connection with the matter.

The watchdog did not publicly disclose the nature of the violation. The head of the regulator said it was a technical matter and denied that politics was involved.

U.S. intelligence officials, in a report in January this year into allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, said RT was part of a state-run propaganda machine that supported a Kremlin campaign to influence U.S. politics.

The warning came after the White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump would announce new U.S. responses to Iran’s missile tests, support for “terrorism” and cyber operations as part of his new Iran strategy.

“As we’ve announced in the past, if America’s new law for sanctions is passed, this country will have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km range of Iran’s missiles,” Guards’ commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, according to state media.

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the United States, according to state media, and issued a stark warning to American troops.

“If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world particularly in the Middle East,” Jafari said.

The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are Iran’s most powerful internal and external security force. The Quds Force, the IRGC’s foreign espionage and paramilitary wing, and individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are on the US list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

Iran sees the Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State as an existential threat to the Islamic Republic where the majority of the population are Shi‘ites.

On June 7, Islamic State claimed an attack on Tehran’s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, killing 18 people. The Guards fired missiles at Islamic State bases in Syria on June 18 in response.

Guards commanders have framed their military involvement in Iraq and Syria, where they are fighting to support the government of President Bashar al-Assad, as a fight against Islamic State.

Dozens of members of the Guards, including senior commanders, have been killed in Syria and Iraq.

MISSILE PROGRAM

The website for state TV reported Jafari as adding that the United States was mistaken if it thought it could pressure Iran into negotiating on regional issues.

Jafari also said that Tehran would ramp up its defense capabilities, including its missile program, if the U.S. undermined a nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers.

Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions.

However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel.

“The Americans should know that the Trump government’s stupid behavior with the nuclear deal will be used by the Islamic Republic as an opportunity to move ahead with its missile, regional and conventional defense program,” Jafari said, according to state media.

The prospect of Washington backtracking on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis in the shape of North Korea.

If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. U.N. inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms.

The Guards navy was also carrying out a military exercise on Sunday in the Gulf, an area of tension with the U.S. navy in recent months.

More than 110 vessels were involved in the exercise, including some that have rocket and missile capabilities, a state media report quoted a Guards commander as saying.",Iran warns U.S. against imposing further sanctions,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-usa-guards/iran-warns-u-s-against-imposing-further-sanctions-idUKKBN1CD083

(This article has been corrected to remove a reference to Advent and Apax steering clear of Japan.","HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Japan is finally warming up to buyouts. The world’s third-biggest economy should be a prime hunting ground for private equity: Japanese firms make great products and are often parochial, poorly run, and undervalued, offering lots of room for improvement. Yet the country has long frustrated foreign PE shops. This year offers proof things are improving.

A few early triumphs, like the 2000 takeover of what became Shinsei Bank, sparked a backlash against “vultures”. And bosses have tended to mistrust leveraged buyout specialists. So some big private equity names, like Permira, have done just a few deals. Others, including Advent and TPG, have left or scaled back.

Now Bain Capital is leading an $18 billion takeover of Toshiba’s memory unit. That will be a record-breaking LBO for Japan, and an unorthodox one, given the involvement of Apple, Dell and others. Thanks largely to this single deal, buyout volumes have already topped $20 billion this year, Preqin data shows. That is a massive uptick on recent years.

Those statistics maybe skewed, but last year was also busy, and it is revealing that private equity’s involvement with Toshiba was not politically controversial. Meanwhile, Bain is simultaneously bidding for local advertising agency Asatsu-DK, and Blackstone is expanding in Tokyo.

Elsewhere, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s drive for better returns is weakening the corporate taboo against shedding non-core businesses. Buyers have also adapted, becoming better at convincing blue-chip sellers they will be responsible stewards of unwanted units, helping them grow rather than relying on cuts to generate profits. Hitachi, Nissan and Panasonic have all done deals with KKR, for example. These tie-ups can be a long process and favour the few firms with deep roots in Tokyo.

The next question for buyout firms is how to snag more deals. Shareholder pressure means there are likely to be many more corporate cast-offs. So buyout firms need to be better at spotting upfront how they can make businesses more valuable, says Jim Verbeeten of Bain & Co, the consulting firm, or they will be routinely outbid by corporate rivals. Still, all the signs suggest that private equity has broken through the ice in Japan.

As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, whose presidential campaign was jolted a year ago by the release of a recording in which he boasted about groping women, said on Saturday he was not surprised by sexual harassment allegations against media mogul Harvey Weinstein.

The Oscar-winning movie producer said he was taking a leave of absence from his company and seeking therapy after the New York Times reported he had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who made allegations of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact.

“I’ve known Harvey Weinstein for a long time. I‘m not at all surprised to see it,” Trump told reporters at the White House.

Trump faced resounding criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike after the release of a 2005 recording from NBC’s “Access Hollywood” in which he talked in vulgar terms about grabbing women by the genitals and trying to have sex with an unidentified married woman.

The recording was released a year ago. Asked about that by a reporter on Saturday, Trump said: “That’s just locker room.”
