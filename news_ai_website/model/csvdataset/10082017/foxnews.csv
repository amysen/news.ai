""It's been hard to process what happened the other night...still feel like I'm in a daze,"" the expecting mom wrote on Instagram Wednesday.

A gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas onto a crowd of 22,000 people, killing at least 58 and injuring more than 500.

The 30-year-old said she wanted to thank the first responders who ""completely put everyone else's lives before theirs and we are all forever grateful.""

Brittany wrote she was not with her husband when the gunfire started but ""with some friends in a tent closer to Mandalay.""

""As you can imagine my first instinct was to run to him and his was the same.""

ZDNet reports that the Uber app can read the screen buffer in iOS, allowing it to view and potentially record anything on your iPhone’s screen without your knowledge.

Uber isn’t doing this illicitly: Apple granted the app the permission. According to researchers, it’s the only third-party app out there that has the ability to read the screen buffer.

Uber told ZDNet that the ability was only intended for a very specific Apple Watch application, in which maps could render in the background on your iPhone, and then be pushed to your Apple Watch.

There are two issues at stake here. Uber having the ability to secretly record your device’s screen is scary in its own right, given its previous history with tracking user data and locations. But the scarier problem is the potential for Uber’s permissions to be used by hackers.

Nate roared ashore with maximum sustained winds near 85 mph, but weakened later to a tropical depression as it moved inland, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.

As of 11 a.m. EDT, the NHC said Nate was centered about 40 miles southwest of Birmingham, Ala. and moving north-northeast near 23 mph.

The storm originally made landfall in southeast Louisiana in a sparsely populated area. The storm is now expected to bring 3 to 6 inches of rain from the central Gulf Coast into the Deep South, along with the threat of isolated tornadoes from the Florida Panhandle and eastern Alabama across western and northern Georgia, according to the NHC.

Mississippi hit with flooding, power outages

As Nate pushed ashore, the hurricane spawned storm surge in coastal areas, flooding the parking structure of the Golden Nugget casino in Biloxi and pushing water several blocks deep into the city.

""It kind of surprised us,"" Mike Kovacevich, who lives two blocks north of U.S. 90, told Biloxi officials on their Facebook page. ""We didn't expect to be this deep. It come in pretty good — a lot of water.""

Around 28,000 customers from multiple utility companies are without power in southern portions of the state, but officials from Mississippi Power, which covers all three counties on the state's Gulf Coast, told Fox News they expect to fully restore power by Sunday night.

“Following Hurricane Nate, our dedicated team at Mississippi Power is actively assisting our customers and restoring service,"" Mississippi Power CEO Anthony Wilson said. ""The safety of our customers and employees is our top priority. We know how important electrical service is to restoring quality of life after a storm and we are working hard for our customers and their businesses.”

On Belle Fontaine Beach, a narrow strip of land between the Mississippi Sound and a coastal marsh that was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, one resident told the Associated Press said it wasn't as bad as he thought.

""This is my first hurricane,"" John Adams said hours before the storm made landfall. ""So far, it's kind of a fizzle.""

Governors in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama declared states of emergency. The three states have been mostly spared during a hurricane season that has spawned devastating storms such as Harvey, Irma, and Maria.

""This is the worst hurricane that has impacted Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina,"" Mississippi Emergency Management Director Lee Smithson said Saturday. ""Everyone needs to understand that, that this is a significantly dangerous situation.

Nate sends floodwaters into coastal Alabama

In Alabama, the storm's rising water flooded homes and cars on the coast and inundated at least one major thoroughfare in downtown Mobile.

Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier told the AP he woke up around 3 a.m. Sunday to discover knee-deep water in his yard.

Although some homes and cars on the island had flooded, Collier said he hadn't heard of any reports of residents needing to be rescued from the floodwaters. Collier added water levels appeared to be falling as dawn approached.

Storm surge also flooded Water Street in downtown Mobile and a ground-level causeway across Mobile Bay. Alabama Department of Transportation traffic cameras show water still standing on both those routes before dawn Sunday.

Alabama Power said as of 8 a.m. there are 71,000 customers without service with most ""in the Mobile area, but the effects are moving north.""

New Orleans spared worst from Nate

The hurricane passed to the east of New Orleans, which placed the most ferocious winds and storm surge away from the city. Nate's quick forward speed lessened the likelihood of prolonged rain that would tax the city's weakened drainage pump system.

The city famous for all-night partying was originally placed under a curfew, effective at 7 p.m., but the mayor lifted it about an hour after it had begun when it appeared the storm would pass by the city.

Streets in the famed French Quarter were not nearly as crowded as they typically are on a Saturday night, and Mayor Mitch Landrieu asked people to still shelter in place. Some bars were closed in the French Quarter but music blasted from others.

""I don't think it's going to be that bad, as far as a hurricane,"" Michael Dennis of Atlanta told the AP.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu said at a news conference Sunday there’s no reported damage in New Orleans, but there was localized flooding outside the flood protection zone.

He thanked first responders at a morning news conference, saying city officials felt ""100 percent"" in their response, and noted a few arrests last night that were unrelated to the brief curfew.

""We knew in a fairly short period of time there was a chance we would have tropical storm and hurricane winds,"" he said.

The storm wasn't enough to stop a Georgia couple from getting married at the World War II Museum in New Orleans.

Mike and Kendra Groves told NOLA.com the museum's early closure meant their scheduled 7 p.m. wedding would have to be pushed up, but they planned to head to the hotel bar to ride out the curfew.

""We never considered canceling,"" Mike told the news outlet.

In Plaquemines Parish south of New Orleans, officials evacuated 240 residents who were not protected by its levee system as the storm approached.

“While it appears we’re being spared, our hearts go out to Mississippi,” said Amos Cormier, president of the parish.

Even though the worst of Nate moved east of New Orleans, officials were still busy with water rescues to due choppy waters before the storm.

Officials in Louisiana said that people had to be rescued from two sailboats as Nate approached.The first rescue happened about noon Saturday, when two people had to be helped off a 41-foot sailboat that lost its engine in Lake Pontchartrain. The Coast Guard said both sailors were in stable condition.

A second rescue occurred in the Mississippi Sound, according to Melissa Scallon, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources Scallon said a distress call came in around 3 p.m. after a sailboat struck rocks at Bayou Caddy west of Waveland.

Scallon said the state Marine Patrol responded and plucked three people from the water, but no injuries were reported.

Meanwhile, key shipping ports across the U.S. Gulf Coast were closed Saturday, as Nate drew close, Reuters reported.

Daily oil production in the region was slashed 92 percent and daily natural gas production was down 77 percent, the report said.

In addition, workers were evacuated from 301 platforms and 13 rigs as of Saturday, Reuters reported, citing information from the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

Orlando Police said David Gray, 35, faces charges of sexual battery of a child younger than 12, lewd or lascivious battery and molestation, child abuse and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was denied bond when he appeared before a judge Saturday, FOX 35 reported.

A customer told police he was in the bathroom at the restaurant Friday morning when he noticed there was activity in one of the bathroom stalls, and caught a glimpse of the child’s reflection with Gray, according to a police report obtained by WFTV.

“(The witness) was not sure if the baby was bouncing or if they were having sex,” the report said. “(The witness) stated he flushed the toilet on purpose to let the man hear him in the bathroom. (The witness) stated, if he panics, then he must be doing something wrong.”

The customer then told he flushed the urinal and saw Gray panic when he realized someone else was in the bathroom with him.

Gray, who was in a motorized wheelchair at the time, quickly attempted to get dressed and then pulled out a stun gun to keep the customer from leaving the bathroom, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

“I’ll [expletive] kill you,” Gray told the man, according to police.

The 35-year-old then left the bathroom, and the customer started yelling ""call the police, a child is being abused in the bathroom.""

Police said Gray was working as a home day care provider for the family of the child, and was a frequent visitor to the restaurant

Not long ago, “interest-based advertising” creeped out a lot of people who couldn’t understand why Facebook, for example, knew what they had just shopped for on Amazon. The truth is that personalized ads are the result of a very impersonal process.

Interest-based advertising crunches bits of data gathered from your browser to make marketing more efficient. Special algorithms analyze your visits over time and across different websites, making it possible to predict your preferences and show ads that are likely to interest you.

But sometimes, all this tracking can be overwhelming. While the process is basically automatic and unmanned, interest-based ads can feel like an invasion of privacy. That’s why many people look for ways to throw the trackers off their scent.

Here are three simple ways to do just that.

1. Wipe out history, turn off cookies

To start, you’ll want a clean slate. You should eliminate any trace of your past searches by clearing all the browsing data, history, cache and cookies from your web browsers.

Next, disable or limit tracking on your gadget, including on favorite services like Facebook. If you’re not sure how how to do this, click here for the steps to wipe out where you’ve been and what you’ve done. Next, make sure to delete third-party advertising cookies. Click here to learn how to remove them and prevent them from coming back.

When you’re finished, take a moment to test your browser with an online security and privacy checker. I like the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s tool that shows you the information about the browser you’re using and your risk level. Click here for the free download and more details.

2. Opt out of ads

You may notice only a handful of culprits, but many companies use algorithms to track your behavior and send you targeted ads.

Thankfully, there’s a way for you to opt out of interest-based, or “behavioral,” ads. The Digital Advertising Alliance lets you review its participating partners. When you first visit the DAA, the websites will scan your computer. Once the scan is complete, you’ll be shown a list of partners advertising directly to you.

From there, you can learn more about the practices these companies use for interest-based ads. You can opt out using “opt-out cookies” that are stored in your browser with your preferences.

Click here for the steps to opt-out of this form of online targeted advertising.

3. Go incognito

Every major web browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera — has private, or incognito, browsing. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies, including ad-tracking cookies, and your computer won’t record your browsing history. It’s almost like you were never online.

When your browser is in private browsing mode, it will show a special icon. In Firefox, it’s a mask; in Chrome, it’s a little spy; in Edge, it’s “InPrivate.” These all indicate that you’re in incognito or private mode.

Private browsing will keep your computer safe from casual snoopers. Someone who jumps on your computer won’t see where you’ve been.

Keep in mind that online ads aren’t necessarily a bad thing. Yes, they can annoy us, but they’re also the reason most online content is free. Without them, media outlets and content creators would have to find a different source of revenue. For most of us, seeing a few presumptuous ads is a tiny price to pay.

Different cabinet surfaces require different cleaning techniques. Whether your cabinets are stained, painted or laminate, they all need special attention. Here are a few easy tips and cleaning recipes for keeping them looking their best.

Stained wood cabinets. You will want to thoroughly clean and oil your stained wood cabinets once or twice a year. Clean them with a mixture of seven-eighths distilled white vinegar and one-eighth rubbing alcohol, with a few drops of dish soap added. Wipe the cabinets down with this cleaning mixture using a microfiber cloth. Next, rinse the cabinets completely with warm water then use a furniture oil that contains beeswax to seal the finish. This process will keep your cabinets looking new for a long time.

Painted cabinets. Painted cabinets need to be cleaned with a gentle cleaner, rinsed and dried. If you use a harsh cleaner on the painted surface, the cleaner can actually remove the paint.

Instead, mix up a DIY cleaner of distilled white vinegar and a few drops of dish soap, but this time leave out the rubbing alcohol. Try putting this mixture into a spray bottle to better control the amount. After spraying, wipe the cabinets down with a damp microfiber cloth. Finally, use another clean microfiber cloth to dry.

Black cabinets. Whether painted black or stained ebony, black cabinets create a chic look in a kitchen, but they do take some extra care. Every water and grease spot will show up on these cabinets as will an accumulation of dust. You should get into a routine of wiping them down at least once a week with a damp microfiber cloth. It will only take a few minutes but doing this will prevent nasty buildup.

White cabinets. White cabinets provide a fresh, clean look to many a kitchen, but they also show every fingerprint and scrape. Just like black cabinets, white ones should be wiped at least once a week with a damp microfiber cloth. You should also have a small bottle of matching white paint on hand to fix chips and scrapes that are bound to show up with white cabinets.

Laminate cabinets. Laminate cabinets are the easiest to keep clean because their surface doesn’t have porous wood grains that absorb dirt and grease. A damp microfiber cloth and minimal elbow grease once a week usually does the trick.

For deeper cleaning, the same DIY cleaner for stained wood cabinets will do the trick. Vinegar is a natural acid and will work to lift off stuck-on food. The alcohol cuts through grease and oil. And the few drops of dish soap help to create a mild lather for easier cleaning.

Get a handle on it. Areas around handles can get very sticky. The oils from your hands can mix with the finish on your wood and break down the finish. You can prevent this from happening by wiping the areas around the handles with a damp microfiber cloth. If you get that sticky buildup, you can wash it off with a gentle hand soap mixed with some rubbing alcohol.

To really get at hidden grime, it is recommended that you remove your pulls and knobs at least once a year and clean the fronts of your cabinets before putting handles back on.

Nooks and crannies. Cabinets with nooks and crannies need extra care to remove dirt, dust and buildup in those tight places. You can use a microfiber cloth wrapped around a table knife to get into flat areas that need to be cleaned. While a pointed knife will also work, just be careful it doesn’t penetrate the cloth and scratch or nick the wood. A toothpick will also work for tight corners and small crevices.

Around the stove. Cabinets around your stove can get spattered with grease and oil. You can clean them quickly with a spray bottle of vodka and a few drops of Castile soap. The vodka will work to cut through the grease and oil, while the soap will lift it away.

This is the right call, because decertification is the indispensable first step toward fixing a deeply flawed agreement that puts Iran on the path to becoming another North Korea.

Decertifying the deal, which was designed to limit Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons for over a decade in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, does not mean pulling out of the agreement. If President Trump refuses to certify by the Oct. 15 deadline, Congress could reimpose sanctions, but it should first give the White House a chance to negotiate a better deal.

The nuclear deal with Iran was reached in 2015 by President Obama’s administration and the governments of Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. The agreement prohibits the U.S. from reimposing the original sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program, but does not rule out tough sanctions on Iranian entities responsible for terrorism, missile development, regional aggression, corruption and human rights violations. These kinds of sanctions could exert the pressure necessary to bring Iran back to the negotiating table.

This kind of pressure could work because Iran does not want to give up the extraordinary economic benefits delivered by the nuclear deal. While attention has justifiably focused on how the nuclear deal has failed to stop Iran from launching nuclear-capable missiles or blocking U.N. inspectors access to military research facilities, Americans should also focus on the perpetual windfall the deal gives Tehran.

Iranian income from oil and natural gas exports increased by $24 billion, or 70 percent, in the first full year after the nuclear deal went into effect. The International Monetary Fund projects that energy exports will continue to grow steadily during the next five years, providing Tehran with $174 billion more of oil revenue than it would have earned if sanctions remained in place.

This windfall should not surprise anyone, although it may come as news to senior Obama administration officials who insist that the deal is not providing Tehran with the means to promote its agenda of terrorism and aggression throughout the Middle East.

According to Adam Szubin, who served as undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence during the final years of the Obama administration: “There are, to be sure, benefits to Iran for staying in the deal, but those benefits will take years to accrue. And contrary to the warning, Iran’s client Hezbollah has been under unprecedented financial pressure.”

Szubin’s opinions, contained in an op-ed he wrote for The Washington Post, command respect even among critics of the nuclear deal, because he was a leading architect of the comprehensive sanctions regime that put so much pressure on Iran. Though he has deep first-hand knowledge of this subject, in this instance the data and the facts tell a very different story.

As noted above, Iranian oil and gas exports began to surge immediately after sanctions were lifted. According to the International Monetary Fund, oil exports increased from 1.4 million barrels per day to 2.4 million in the first full year after the nuclear deal took effect.

Since oil drives the Iranian economy, this surge in exports translated into impressive overall growth of 6.6 percent. In sharp contrast, Iran’s economy shrank by 1.8 percent prior to the implementation of the nuclear deal and by 6.6 percent when sanctions were biting hardest in 2012. The World Bank reported a similar reversal of fortune. Moreover, both organizations project Iranian economic growth to be close to 4 percent this year and then stay above 4 percent for several years to come.

The economic benefits that followed the implementation of the nuclear deal also included lower Iranian inflation, which peaked near 35 percent in 2013 yet has now fallen to single digits, according to World Bank figures. In addition, Iran’s currency went into freefall as a result of sanctions pressure, but stabilized after the beginning of the negotiations that led to the nuclear deal.

Szubin does not acknowledge any of these extraordinary benefits. Instead he writes that Iranian gross domestic product (GDP) will still be 35 percent lower in 2017 than it was in 2011, thereby suggesting that Iran is nowhere close to recovering from the damage imposed by sanctions.

Arriving at this figure of a 35 percent decline requires some creative use of statistics. There are several ways to measure GDP, but Szubin chooses the only one that shows this kind of sharp contraction. Also, 2011 is a misleading year to use as the baseline for measuring changes in GDP, since oil prices shot up to an average of $108 per barrel that year, supercharging every oil- dependent economy. Had he used 2009 or 2010 as a baseline, there would be little or no decline to speak of.

In addition, Szubin understates by tens of billions of dollars the value of frozen assets released to Iran upon implementation of the nuclear. Whereas he offers a figure of $50 billion, a 2015 study by our colleagues at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies shows that this estimate is far too low, because of its narrow focus on liquid assets. A broader look at Tehran’s foreign holdings shows that it gained access to somewhere between $90 billion and $120 billion – a remarkable infusion for a $400 billion economy.

Szubin also asserts, without providing data, that the terrorist group Hezbollah is “under unprecedented financial pressure.” A new study of Hezbollah’s finances, also by our colleagues at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, reaches a very different conclusion.

Our study reports that Iranian support for Hezbollah fell sharply in 2014 and 2015, “likely due to international sanctions and low oil prices.” Yet even though oil prices remained low following the implementation of the nuclear deal, Iranian assistance returned to its previous level of about $700 million to $800 million per year, or 70 to 80 percent of Hezbollah’s estimated budget. It seems Iran has money to spare.

In light of the extraordinary economic benefits Iran has received from the nuclear agreement, it is certainly a good deal for Tehran. But it is getting harder and harder to see how anyone can look at the facts and serenely insist that this is also a good deal for the United States.

Courtney Hacking told “Fox & Friends” Saturday that the sentence in a Texas state court doesn’t compensate her for the loss of her 36-year-old husband Peter, a volunteer firefighter, 4-year-old daughter Ellie and 22-month-old son Grayson in the accident.

“People think his crime and his punishment seem to fit because he was an illegal immigrant,” she said, referring to Mexican Margarito Quintero Rosales who pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide in connection with the crash. “But to me being illegal in the country was a crime on its own so I don’t understand how he did get only two years.”

She added, “To me I take it offensively. I take it personally.”

Cops say Quintero swerved into Hacking’s vehicle which was coming the other way when he fell asleep at the wheel, WFAA-TV reported.

The sentencing took place Sept. 29. The sentence was the maximum under state law, the station reported.

Quintero has been jailed since the accident. He will complete the sentence in about another 110 days.

He is serving that sentence as he serves a two-year federal sentence for reentering the U.S. illegally after being deported. Court records show he was charged with that crime after the accident and sentenced last month.

Quintero was also arrested after the crash for having no driver’s license, the Dallas Morning News reported.

Peter Hacking was driving Ellie and Grayson home after picking them up at the babysitter, according to the paper.

“I want our laws enforced,” Hacking said on “Fox & Friends.”

“The message needs to be put across to them that when you come to this country you need to do it legally because when they come here all they’re getting is…they’re committing crimes, they’re getting a slap on the wrist and they’re going back to Mexico or they’re going back to whatever country they came from.”

Her husband was a legal immigrant from England, she said.

Hacking is now caring for her other four children alone.

The star went off on social media about his efforts to donate blood as a gay man.

Bass, 38, was riled up after the tragedy when he realized that he could not give blood to the victims. He sounded off in a video to TMZ on the current U.S. policy that prohibits some gay men from donating blood.

“Every time a tragedy like this happens, I get reminded that I can’t donate blood. People just don’t know that there is a ban on my blood and we have to educate people out there that there is this stigma on my blood, my gay blood, and it needs to change,” he said in the video. “This tragedy has brought us together, and I honestly don’t have faith that this country is going to come together and make any common sense gun laws right now, so I would love, out of this tragedy, to have something good come from it. I think this ban on blood should be the easiest thing to pass.”

Rules imposed by the Food and Drug Administration prohibits gay men from donating blood if they’ve engaged in any kind of sexual encounter with another man for the past 12 months.

The rule is intended to ensure that the spread of HIV isn’t exacerbated through the blood donation process, and gay men were initially considered to be the highest carriers of the disease when the regulation was established. But Bass said all blood is now tested before it is used, regardless of the person’s sexual orientation. As a result, he feels that the rule is discriminatory to gay men. Late in the video, he went on to call out the American Red Cross directly, which abides by the FDA’s regulations.

“Shame on the Red Cross for not being a leader in this over the last 20 years to help relieve the stigma of HIV in gay man’s blood and donating,” he said. “They should really be the ones at the forefront of this movement.”

Those who say gun control is the answer to massacres like Sunday’s in Las Vegas are really saying they are willing to live with such outrages.

Gun-control proposals always float up in the aftermath of mass shootings, singularly detached from any plan that could be carried out, much less command majority support from the U.S. electorate. A law banning gun sales is not in the cards. A law seriously curtailing private gun ownership, as exists in the U.K., is not in the cards. If it were, enforcing it would be a whole other nightmare.

Non-meaningful gun regulations, in fact, were the specialty of a Democratic senator who long represented Nevada, scene of Sunday’s killings. Harry Reid had a lifetime “B” rating from the National Rifle Association. A New York Times columnist on Monday, under the web headline “Preventing Mass Shootings Like the Vegas Strip Attack,” proposed eight steps that, whatever their slight utility in lowering the rate of other kinds of gun crimes and suicides, even the writer admitted would have no “overwhelming effect” on gun deaths, let alone mass shootings.

Mass shootings of the modern ilk are a lot more like terrorist attacks than they are like routine gun crimes, in which guns are used to settle an argument, facilitate a robbery or eliminate a rival.

The change announced Thursday affects most of Netflix's 53 million U.S. subscribers.

WHAT GOES UP

Netflix will now charge $11 per month instead of $10 for a plan that includes HD and allows up people to simultaneously watch programs on two different internet-connected devices.

The price for another plan that includes ultra-high definition, or 4K, video, is going up by 17 percent, to $14 from $12 a month. A plan that limits subscribers to one screen at a time without high-definition will remain at $8 a month.

The increase would be the first in two years for Netflix, although it won't seem that way for millions of subscribers. That's because Netflix temporarily froze its rates for long-time subscribers the last two times it raised its prices, delaying the most recent increases until the second half of last year for them.

Netflix isn't giving anyone a break this time around. It will start emailing notifications about the new prices to affected subscribers Oct. 19, giving them 30 days to accept the higher rates, switch to a cheaper plan or cancel the service.

WHY PRICES ARE RISING

The price increase are being driven by Netflix's desire to fatten its profit margins as it spends more money to finance a critically acclaimed slate of original programming that includes shows such as ""House of Cards,"" ''Orange Is The New Black,"" ''Stranger Things,"" and ""The Crown.""

Those series' success helped Netflix land more Emmy award nominations than any TV network besides HBO this year. It's also the main reason Netflix's U.S. audience has nearly doubled since the February 2013 debut of ""House of Cards"" kicked off its expansion into original programming.

But paying for exclusive TV series and films hasn't been cheap. Netflix expects to spend $6 billion a year alone on programming this year, and the expenses are likely to rise as it competes against streaming rivals such as Amazon, Hulu, YouTube and, potentially, Apple for the rights to future shows and movies.

Both Amazon (at $99 per year, or about $8.25 per month) and Hulu ($10 per month) now offer lower prices than Netflix.

POSSIBILITY OF BACKLASH

Netflix believes its price rate is justified by recent service improvements, such as a feature that allows people to download shows onto phones or other devices to watch them offline.

But Netflix subscribers have rebelled against price increases in the past, most notably in 2011 when the company stopped bundling its streaming service with its DVD-by-mail service, resulting in price increases of as much as 60 percent for customers who wanted both plans. Netflix lost 600,000 subscribers and its stock price plummeted by 80 percent in the subsequent backlash. The company rebounded strongly, though, propelling its stock from a split-adjusted low of $7.54 in 2012 to about $184 now.

And Netflix blamed a temporary slowdown in subscriber growth last year on the lifting of its price freeze on long-time customers who decided to drop the service rather than pay slightly more money.

But watching live sports can put some serious stress on your heart, a new, small study finds.

Watching a hockey game live can more than double a fan's heart rate, according to the study. And you don't even have to be in the arena for your heart rate to climb: Catching the game on TV can also have an effect, according to the study, published today (Oct. 5) in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology.

The excitement of sports is likely responsible for the observed increases in heart rate, said study author Dr. Paul Khairy, a cardiologist at the Montreal Heart Institute.

MOM LOSES FINGER IN FREAK ACCIDENT AT SON'S BASEBALL PRACTICE

But the new study is the first to demonstrate that the ambience of a live game — being surrounded by cheering fans, being closer to the action and experiencing an increased level of engagement — may all contribute to the heightened emotional stress response in fans, Khairy told Live Science.

In the study, the heart rates of fans who watched a hockey game in person increased by 110 percent, on average, from their resting heart rates. That's comparable to the increase you'd see in someone running, jumping rope or doing any other vigorous form of exercise, Khairy said.

Fans who watched the same game on TV had a 75 percent increase in their heart rates, on average, which is similar to the heart rates seen with moderate physical activity, such as a casual bike ride, Khairy noted.

This is the first time that the heart-rate response of hockey spectators has been measured, the researchers wrote. But previous studies from Europe have found higher heart rates in soccer fans who watched World Cup matches in person. These increases occurred after their team scored a goal or after their team beat an opponent.

In the new study, the researchers looked only at fans of the Montreal Canadiens, a team with an avid fan base in a country where hockey is considered the national winter sport. The study was the brainchild of two 13-year-old girls in Canada, one of whom was Khairy's daughter.

They recruited 20 participants ages 23 to 63. Half of the participants attended Canadiens games while the rest watched the action at home. Both groups wore heart-rate monitors during the games.

Because the researchers included fans of only one team, the results may not apply to all hockey fans, the study noted.

Taking hockey to heart

The study found that fans' heart rates peaked most often during overtime periods. The second-most-stressful time for fans was during scoring opportunities by the Canadiens, followed by the opposing team's attempts to put the puck in the net.

Surprisingly, a person's interest in the sport and engagement as a fan were not linked to changes in heart rate during the game, Khairy said. However, he added that he suspects there might have been a different result if researchers had developed their own way to measure passion in hockey fans rather than adapting a tool originally designed for soccer spectators.

DONORS CONTINUE TO LINE UP AT BLOOD CENTERS IN RESPONSE TO LAS VEGAS MASSACRE

Although fans watching any sport can experience a similar amount of excitement as was observed in this group of hockey enthusiasts, these results may not apply to other sports, Khairy said. There are too many elements that differ among sports — such as the pace of the game, a fan's emotional attachment to a team, and even the number of high-intensity moments — that prevent researchers from making similar generalizations, he said.

A fan's emotional reaction to a game can be intense, Khairy said, and that could trigger cardiovascular problems.

Fans who experience cardiac symptoms during a game should seek immediate medical attention rather than waiting for a convenient moment, such as in-between periods, Khairy said. Many arenas and ice rinks have cardiac defibrillators on hand, as well as people trained in using them, he added.

Bloom was facing mounting criticism for standing by the disgraced Hollywood producer while making a career of representing a long list of women who have been harassed or abused by powerful men. Her mother, Gloria Allred, is also famous for representing sexual harassment victims.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN TO TAKE INDEFINITE LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM COMPANY FOLLOWING SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS

In an interview Friday with ABC, Bloom was grilled over her about-face.

“I’ve done a lot of cases for women and I’ve often thought, ‘Gee, I wish I could get on the other side and smack that guy around a little bit verbally,’” Bloom said. ""Here was an opportunity of a guy saying, ‘Lisa, what should I do? I have behaved badly.’ I’m like, ‘Good. I’m going to tell you what to do. Be honest. Be real.’”

In the wake of the incident, a number of liberal celebrities have been criticized for remaining silent on the matter.

The New York Times published a story Thursday that the co-chairman of the Weinstein Company has over the years reached at least eight legal settlements with women over alleged harassment. In the report, actress Ashley Judd described being lured to Weinstein’s hotel room, only to find him wearing a bathrobe and requesting sexual favors.

The report also detailed encounters Weinstein allegedly had with other women working for the Weinstein Company, as well as official settlements from people associated with him, including actress Rose McGowan, who was issued a $100,000 settlement that Weinstein specifically said was not an admission of guilt.

On Twitter Friday night, McGowan blasted Hollywood actresses for staying silent in wake of the report.

“Ladies of Hollywood, your silence is deafening,” McGowan tweeted.

McGowan praised actresses Patricia Arquette, Lena Dunham, Jessica Chastain, Amber Tamblyn and Brie Larson for supporting her and Judd.

She also praised MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski for stating she would drop the three book deal with Weinstein’s company if he did not resign, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

The New York Times reported McGowan refused to comment in their article.

Other actresses, including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lawrence, Holly Hunter, Mira Sorvino, Anna Paquin and Kate Winslet were all awarded Oscars for Weinstein movies.

The Daily Beast reported that it reached out to a number of famous actors who have collaborated with Weinstein in the past and were told “no comment.”

In wake of the report, many congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Elizabeth Warren have given money they received as a donation from Weinstein to charity.

Weinstein and his family have given more than $1.4 million in political contributions since the 1992 election cycle, nearly all of it to Democratic lawmakers, candidates and their allies, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Weinstein, who co-founded Miramax and the Weinstein Company with his brother Bob, announced he has left the company indefinitely as an internal investigation was launched.

Weinstein released a statement in response to the allegations.

“I came of age in the 60’s and 70’s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then. I have since learned it’s not an excuse, in the office – or out of it. To anyone. I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person and my interactions with the people I work with have changed.

More non-news on the Russia-collusion front came Wednesday, when the Senate Intelligence Committee said it has now verified what everyone knew nine months ago: Russia worked to sow chaos during the 2016 election; vote totals weren’t affected; and no evidence has emerged that Donald Trump was in cahoots with Moscow.

But in the more distant, less camera-filled corners of Washington, there actually is some interesting new information. It centers on the document that increasingly looks central to the “chaos” Russia sowed: the Trump dossier.

That was the infamous list of accusations compiled starting in the summer of 2016 by a former British spook, Christopher Steele, who had been hired by the liberal opposition-research firm Fusion GPS. The discredited rumors about Mr. Trump came from anonymous Russian sources. This is notable, since it turns out Fusion was separately—or maybe not so separately—working with entities tied to the Kremlin.

How close was Fusion’s leader, Glenn Simpson, to Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Kremlin-linked lawyer? Did the Russians know about the dossier all along and help plant the information in it? Were American law-enforcement agencies relying on Russian-directed disinformation when they obtained secret warrants against Trump associates? Chaos, indeed.

Witness how hard the Federal Bureau of Investigation is fighting to avoid divulging any information about the dossier. More than a month ago the House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas to the FBI and the Justice Department, asking for dossier-related documents. Lawmakers were told to go swivel.

A little more than a week ago, the committee’s frustrated chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, took the case all the way to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who finally offered to make an FBI official available for a briefing. But the bureau is still withholding all documents. To date, Sen. Chuck Grassley’s Judiciary Committee has not received any paper from the FBI on Russia matters, despite numerous requests, some countersigned by the Democratic ranking member, Dianne Feinstein.

Increasingly, one name is popping up: Gregory Brower, who leads the FBI’s Office of Congressional Affairs. Mr. Brower is an odd man for the job. These gigs tend to go to more-junior people, since they involve the drudgery of answering calls from grumpy congressional staffers. Yet Mr. Brower is a former U.S. attorney—a job that requires Senate confirmation—and a former Nevada state senator.",About That Trump Dossier 'Wall',http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/06/about-trump-dossier-wall

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson may be upset that the rumored spinoff movie, that will reportedly star Johnson’s Lucas Hobbs character and Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw, is getting fast-tracked ahead of the ninth movie.
In it, he mused that he was using the comments section of Johnson’s Instagram because the star wouldn’t answer his calls.

Tyrese Gibson, who has played Roman Pearce in the second, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth films in the franchise, hasn’t been shy about blaming fellow costar Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson for being the reason that the yet untitled “F9” will be late. Soon after the news broke that the release date had been pushed from April 19, 2019 to April 10, 2020, he took to Instagram where he sounded off on Johnson saying that his desire to be a solo act is to blame, and took a shot at his newest box-office flub, “Baywatch.”

Later the same day, he posted another photo of the cast of the original “The Fast and the Furious” film - which included neither him nor Johnson - with more harsh words for The Rock.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson may be upset that the rumored spinoff movie, that will reportedly star Johnson’s Lucas Hobbs character and Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw, is getting fast-tracked ahead of the ninth movie. However, the outlet also notes that the film may have been pushed back in an effort to court director Justin Lin, who may be returning to the franchise. Sadly, it’s unclear at this time as Universal Pictures has not made a statement on the matter other than to push the release date of “F9.”

As US Weekly notes, Gibson previously talked about the project in a comment on the former WWE star’s Instagram, which has since been deleted. In it, he mused that he was using the comments section of Johnson’s Instagram because the star wouldn’t answer his calls.

Nah. They turned to newly promoted, left-wing hack and occasional funnyman Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel, you’ll recall, served as the Democratic mouthpiece on ObamaCare recently. So he was all primed to do so again.

And he delivered an achingly embarrassing rant that journalists went nuts for. USA Today highlighted late-night show reaction calling for gun control under the headline: “If not now, then when?” The Washington Post bombarded readers with hot takes on Kimmel. Pop culture writer Emily Yahr called his comments an “emotional, scathing monologue about gun control” in one of the three separate stories she wrote about Kimmel’s monologue.

Post TV critic Hank Stuever agreed, adding: “Jimmy Kimmel is saying everything right.” He went on to discuss “a curious evolution process that turned late-night hosts into the nation’s moral conscience.” But remember, The Washington Post, D-Resist, is neutral.

Singing Kimmel’s praises became a journalism default. The New York Times conveniently used nearly identical phrasing, saying Kimmel was “acting as a social conscience as he called out politicians, the National Rifle Association and complacent citizens.” Even the sports site The Ringer tried this strategy, proclaiming that “Kimmel has become the voice that’s best encapsulated a large section of America’s conscience.”

CNN’s Bill Carter wrote an especially ridiculous piece under the headline: “How Jimmy Kimmel became America's conscience.” Carter’s piece read like a press release from Kimmel’s publicist: “Kimmel simply sounds like a regular guy making reasonable points – because he is a regular guy.”

Maybe he seems like a regular guy, but he’s not. Kimmel earns $10 million a year and has a net worth of about $35 million, according to Celebritynetworth.com. Everybody reading who’s a millionaire, raise your hands.

And with all the sudden pretense that Kimmel is such a moral leader, it might be good to recall the Jimmy Kimmel origin story. Kimmel built his career with jokes about genocide and promoting R. Kelly, who’s accused of sex with minors. And then there’s Kimmel’s time on “The Man Show,” where he urged young women to get on a trampoline and jump around to please the audience. Several even stripped, much to the pleasure of our new moral conscience.

The PR-ish Carter swallowed the Kimmel talking points 100 percent. Carter practically cheered Kimmel’s claim that “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this. I just want to give you something to laugh about at night.""

Don’t believe a word of it. If Kimmel wanted to make us laugh, he could try. Instead, he had an agenda to push. Just like he did on ObamaCare. Just like all the other late-night hosts and most of TV – news or entertainment.

2. Media Push Gun Control, Attack NRA: The media have a pre-written script for gun stories – shift as soon as possible into a discussion of gun control and declare the National Rifle Association evil. Or worse.

GQ’s professional kook Keith Olbermann called the NRA “a terrorist organization” and the media ate it up. The Hill, HuffPost and Raw Story were just a few to highlight his comments, even though it’s been years since Olbermann has been anything other than a circus sideshow to American politics.

But Olbermann isn’t alone. Former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw came out against the NRA in full attack mode, urging citizens “to organize on the other side.” He even claimed if members of Congress run against the NRA “you’re portrayed as a traitor to America.”

New York Times theoretically conservative columnist Bret Stephens made a mockery of his credentials and called for a complete repeal of the Second Amendment. Claiming he “never understood the conservative fetish for the Second Amendment,” Stephens skewered most of what the left proposes for gun control. “Expansive interpretations of the right to bear arms will be the law of the land — until the ‘right’ itself ceases to be,” he argued.

MSNBC proven liar and anchor Brian Williams said he didn’t understand why the Sandy Hook shooting hadn’t resulted in more gun regulation. “Why don't we act? What is the problem? What was it about first graders losing their lives that wasn't sad enough to result in changes?” he asked. Fellow MSNBC host Joe Scarborough blamed ""extreme gerrymandering"" for NRA success. Apparently, he’s never heard of the Democratic gerrymander in Maryland.

And when the media weren’t pushing an agenda, they were busy being outright wrong about guns. The Free Beacon’s Stephen Gutowski could work 24-7 squashing these errors and barely make a dent. Gutowski summed it up nicely, writing: “There is no way around it: The news industry is incomprehensibly inept at reporting on guns.” He noted that only three news organizations cover the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives – the Washington Free Beacon, The Trace, and Guns.com.

3. Look to Hollywood to Learn How to Think Correctly: You don’t have to look far in Tinseltown to find stars saying all the right (left) things about guns. Singer Nancy Sinatra recommended that NRA members “should face a firing squad.” Public Enemy’s Chuck D echoed much of the left, describing the NRA as a “terrorist organization.” Comedian Michael Ian Black repeated an identical sentiment: “The NRA is a terrorist organization. There's no other way to say it.”

Hollywood was awash in such declarations. Perennial left-winger Michael Moore came out with a complete rewrite of the Second Amendment that essentially guts it and doesn’t even let owners keep guns in their homes. Britain’s Piers Morgan declared: “The NRA is killing America” and singer Lady Gaga said “there is blood on the hands of those who have the power to legislate.”

All of that makes perfect sense because we know that Hollywood never makes any movies with guns or gun violence in them. Never at all. Last year’s top 10 movies included four superhero flicks that feature tons of gun violence – including “Suicide Squad” and “Deadpool.” And 2017 is already shaping up to have the top 10 films also filled with gun violence. That is, after all, how Hollywood stars get paid.

4. ‘Decades of Sexual Harassment Accusations Against Harvey Weinstein’: That’s the actual headline of The New York Times piece on a Hollywood A-lister long-rumored to have a major dark side. The story is both horrifying and hard to put down. Weinstein has simultaneously apologized for having “caused a lot of pain,” and claimed he will sue the paper for $50 million.

The story begins with an anecdote featuring actress Ashley Judd being “asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower.” The creep factor is about 112 on a scale of 1-10. ABC and CBS evening news shows covered the incredible story. NBC skipped it entirely.

In nearly three decades, “after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity,” wrote The Times.

Weinstein’s statement is especially bizarre, as he begs for forgiveness from left-wingers in Hollywood and offers them exactly what they want – war with the NRA. “I want a second chance in the community, but I know I’ve got work to do to earn it,” he wrote. A few sentences later, he vowed to go to war against the gun group. “I am going to need a place to channel that anger, so I’ve decided that I’m going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party.”

Welcome to Hollywood, where you can rape a young girl and get an Oscar and a standing ovation, like Roman Polanski did. And you can be accused of decades of sexual harassment and try to buy yourself out of it by warring against the right.

And This Is Awful, Too: Some stories are worth noting, even if they didn’t garner a ton of media coverage. MSNBC lefty and political director Chuck Todd wants to build the wall. No, not the wall between the U.S. and Mexico. That’s too conservative. No, Todd wants to “reinforce the wall between the news media and the politicians.” That and more fun nuggets were included in Sunday’s New York Times Magazine piece with the hilarious headline: “Chuck Todd Thinks It’s Important to Stay Neutral.” Stop laughing.

Religion might be in the First Amendment, but it shouldn’t be near the National Mall, according to Washingtonian magazine. The mag ran an article on a new D.C. museum, with the bigoted headline: “The Museum of the Bible Will Probably Be a Big Hit. But It Doesn’t Belong Near the Mall.” Politics and Culture Editor Rob Brunner admitted: “I couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable with the whole endeavor.” He ended with a typically secular journalist comment: “The Museum of the Bible, well intentioned though it may be, feels like something of a violation.” That’s probably how most Christians feel when they read any news about faith.","Journalists claim Kimmel is America's 'conscience,' NRA is 'terrorist,' and other awful media mistakes",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/journalists-claim-kimmel-is-americas-conscience-nra-is-terrorist-and-other-awful-media-mistakes.html

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

- Steve Wynn, CEO Wynn Resorts“This is a man who behaved rationally, privately, a little introverted, liked to play video poker.
But he was a rational man.
And every historical review of his behavior indicates that he was a rational man; so was his girlfriend.","A week after a gunman used the 32nd floor of a Las Vegas hotel as a hunting perch to kill 58 people in what is the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history, casino magnate Steve Wynn says the gunman was known to staff, seemed like “a rational man,” and that beefing up security, re-training staff and implementing strict “do not disturb” rules are key to keeping visitors safe.

Wynn, the billionaire CEO of Wynn Resorts, in an exclusive interview with “Fox News Sunday,” said he reassessed his casino’s security in 2015, when he developed a high-level counterterrorism program.

“I got every consultant and adviser I can think of to come through from Ray Kelly to the people from Seal Team 6. It took us from Thanksgiving until May to develop and institute and recruit a program of counterterrorism and it will be two years this May,” Wynn told ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace.

“Basically we had to recruit and expand security by tens of millions of dollars to cover every entrance, to retrain the entire workforce -- from housekeeping and room service -- and people are in the tower and observing people. We had to cover every exit and every aspect of the building to see if we could identify and preempt any kind of terroristic or violent action. It is never perfect, of course, but what you can do, to use local vernacular: you can change the odds,” Wynn said.

The Las Vegas gunman, Stephen Paddock, reportedly was holed up in his suite at the Mandalay Bay for three days, instituting a type of “do not disturb” policy that Wynn says would have alerted his Wynn Resorts staff to investigate.

“We also have rules about do not disturb,” Wynn said. “If a room goes on do not disturb for more than 12 hours, we investigate. We constantly -- we don't allow guns in this building unless they're being carried by our employees and there's a lot of them. But if anybody's got a gun and we find them continually, we eject them from the hotel.”

Wynn also said Stephen Paddock and his girlfriend were well-known to his staff.

“He's been staying in Las Vegas since ‘06. So you know, we're talking about 11 years with his girlfriend or at least in recent years, frequent visitor, once or twice a month, to this hotel and others. The most vanilla profile one could possibly imagine. A modest gambler at least by our standards, you know, nothing serious, paid promptly, never owed any money anywhere in Las Vegas. He didn't fit the profile of a problem or compulsive gambler.”

When asked whether he had a motive regarding Paddock’s murderous rampage, Wynn suggested that his previous behavior suggested the gunman was “a rational man.”

'Every historical review of his behavior indicates that he was a rational man.' - Steve Wynn, CEO Wynn Resorts

“This is a man who behaved rationally, privately, a little introverted, liked to play video poker. But he was a rational man. And every historical review of his behavior indicates that he was a rational man; so was his girlfriend. And yet he prepared over an extended period of time, a totally irrational act.

“Now, this sounds like someone either totally demented -- a behavior which he never evidenced -- or someone who's sending a message. This is a plan. We don't know what that message is or if there is one, but this behavior, according to my employees, is as stunning, as unexpected as anybody, any of them have ever met. And that's the status, you know, that I hear from the sheriff, and watching television that seems to be the moment -- the momentary analysis of this situation. I really don't have anything to add to that.”","Las Vegas gunman seemed like 'a rational man,' Steve Wynn tells 'Fox News Sunday'",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/08/las-vegas-gunman-seemed-like-rational-man-steve-wynn-tells-fox-news-sunday.html

And there’s no better dragstrip than Atco Dragway in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a muscle car hotbed and home to the legendary Jersey Devil.

That’s where I had the chance to strap into the driver’s seat and take a Demon for a dozen runs. I should say “the seat,” because it comes with only one, making it the world’s most awesome pizza delivery vehicle.

And it can haul.

The Demon is the most powerful American car ever made. It has a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that puts out 808 hp and still gets 22 mph on the highway. It’s an update of the Challenger SRT Hellcat’s 707 hp motor, which now seems quaint — even more so if you fit the Demon with the special engine control module, included in a tool-and-parts kit called the Demon Crate, that allows it to run on 100 octane race gas and bumps the power up to 840 hp to go with its 770 lb-ft of torque.

Over half of the Hellcat engine’s components were modified in the, including the block, and a monstrous 2.7-liter supercharger strapped on to the top of it. The Demon’s 8-speed automatic transmission, driveshaft, differential and half shafts are appropriately beefed-up, as well.

There is no manual transmission available, but the automatic is one of the coolest ever made. It’s equipped with a feature called a TransBrake. It’s a drag racing technology that, in this case, engages first and second gears simultaneously to bind the transmission, so you can step on the gas to build up torque in the engine and drivetrain without having to use the brakes, which wouldn’t be able to hold back much of what the Demon dishes out before the tires started spinning. Meanwhile, a torque converter with a high stall speed lets you rev engine even higher than you normally could without moving as you await the green light.

Before we get to that, a few other notes on the Challenger’s transformation from Hellcat to Demon. With the project’s goals being a sub-10-second quarter-mile and the ability to lift the front wheels on launch, the SRT team knew it had to trim a few pounds — 232 pounds, it turns out — from the coupe’s over 2-ton weight.

Eliminating the passenger seat and rear bench (both can be added back in for $1 each) along with the trunk carpet and spare tire was the easy part. Swapping in some lightweight suspension parts and smaller brakes is indicative of the Demon’s drag racing focus — although it retains its computer-controlled shock absorber system and still handles pretty well for a behemoth.

The suspension plays an important role in the Demon’s straight-line speed, too. When you set the car to Drag Mode, it stiffens the rear shocks and softens the fronts to help transfer the weight to the meaty, 12.4-inch wide Nitto drag radials at launch. The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny “front-runner” tires installed. The Demon Crate comes with a set of rims for a pair.

The first time I gave it a shot, I skipped the TransBrake and used the traditional launch control system to get a feel for things. And oh, how it felt.

You simply press the brake pedal hard, floor the gas, release the brake and become one with the deep bucket seat. I’ve been in quick production cars before, but none prepared me for the violence the Demon took off with. The thunder coming out of the exhaust mixed with the screeching supercharger enhanced the experience in a way the silent electric motors of a ‘Ludicrous’ Tesla never could.

And it pulled all the way down the strip, which I covered in 10.2 seconds at 134 mph. And to think that launch control neuters the car. Using the TransBrake is the way to unleash its full abilities, but you’ll need plenty of your own to go with it.

To engage it, you pull both paddles behind the steering wheel, give it some gas (but not too much) and then, when the screen on the instrument cluster tells you it’s OK, you let one paddle go and take your foot off the brake.

It’ll let you sit there like that for about 15 seconds. You release the other paddle to get moving, and then it’s all you. There’s no traction control in this mode, so you need to modulate the throttle to keep from smoking the tires. It’s easier said than done with all that power, even on a strip prepped with sticky traction compound and rubbered-in. On my first three tries, I botched it pretty good.

I eventually managed to get away cleanly a couple of times, but never did better than the launch control. I’m sure a drag racing regular could.

Jim Wilder, the Demon’s development manager, is one of those. He took me for a run in a two-seat car with front-runners on it and pretty much all I can remember is getting walloped in the back and looking at the sky as we left the line. He may have overseen its development, but the launch control has nothing on him. I was so taken aback by the ride that I spaced out and forgot to check his time. Pride wouldn’t allow me to tell you what it was, anyway.

Dodge isn’t the first to hop up a Hellcat, of course. Plenty of shops have figured out how to get this much power and more out of it. The difference is that the Demon comes with a warranty. Wilder said his team did over 500 quarter-mile runs on a single axle, and more than 900 with the same transmission, and both looked like new when they pulled them out to inspect them. It’s doubtful any Demons will see that much action in the real world.

The Demon starts at $86,090. That’s a lot for a toy, and that’s exactly what it is. But it’s likely a steal at that price.

Dodge is building only 3,300 of them for the U.S. and Canada, and they’ve all been allocated. It did its best to keep dealers from marking them up, but some people are already trying to flip cars they don’t have yet for double what they’re paying, and a few probably will. If not now, then in a few years at one of those collector car auctions on TV.

That is, unless Dodge manages to outdo itself. When the Hellcat came out a few years ago, everyone thought it marked the end of days for the muscle car, and then they went and made the Demon and turned the Hellcat into a commodity. While it is a one-year-and-done model, the Challenger is going to be around at least until 2020, so there’s time for an even more evil encore.

But what the devil would they call it?

""This event underscores the turbulent times we're living in when senseless killings are taken to such an extreme level,"" radio music exec Mike McVay told Fox News. ""You'd find many in the country music community supportive of the right to bear arms.

""There will be a debate,"" added McVay, EVP of content and Programming for Cumulus Media and Westwood One. ""We'll know more in a couple of weeks how it's going to change.""

The debate has already started; Caleb Keefer, the guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival hours before the shooting occurred, spoke out in favor of gun control on Monday.

""I've been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life,"" Keefer wrote on Twitter. ""Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was...We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.""

Echoing Keefer's statements is the daughter of country music legend Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash, a longtime advocate for gun control, who penned an op-ed urging her fellow musicians to take action.

Cash said the National Rifle Association (NRA) ""funds domestic terrorism"" and country music artists associated with its group ""NRA Country"" must speak up against it.

""For the past few decades, the National Rifle Association has increasingly nurtured an alliance with country music artists and their fans. You can see it in 'N.R.A.

Country star Luke Bryan seemed to want to keep the focus on the victims. When asked about the tragedy on ""Good Morning America"" Wednesday alongside his fellow ""American Idol"" judges, Bryan steered clear of politics.

Last year's prize went to three British-born researchers who applied the mathematical discipline of topology to help understand the workings of exotic matter such as superconductors and superfluids.","For decades astronomers tried to prove Albert Einstein right by doing what Einstein thought was impossible: detecting the faint ripples in the universe called gravitational waves. They failed repeatedly until two years ago when they finally spotted one. Then another. And another. And another.

Three American scientists — including one who initially flunked out of MIT — won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday that launched a whole new way to observe the cosmos. Sweden's Royal Academy of Sciences cited the combination of highly advanced theory and ingenious equipment design in awarding Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Barry Barish and Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology.

""It's a win for the human race as a whole. These gravitational waves will be powerful ways for the human race to explore the universe,"" Thorne told The Associated Press in a phone interview.

The trio were part of a team of more than 1,000 astronomers who first observed gravitational waves in September 2015. When the discovery was announced several months later, it was a sensation not only among scientists but the general public. These are waves that go through everything — including us — but carry information on them that astronomers could not get otherwise.

""The best comparison is when Galileo discovered the telescope, which allowed us to see that Jupiter had moons. And all of a sudden, we discovered that the universe was much vaster than we used to think about,"" Ariel Goobar of the Swedish academy said.

Weiss said he hopes that eventually gravitational waves will help science learn about ""the very moment when the universe came out of nothingness.""

Gravitational waves were first theorized a century ago by Einstein, but he didn't think technology would ever be able to detect the tiny wobbles, smaller than a piece of an atom.

The waves are like ""a storm in the fabric of space-time that is produced when two black holes collide,"" Thorne said. The first detection came from a crash 1.3 billion light-years away. A light-year is about 5.88 trillion miles.

The prize is ""a win for Einstein, and a very big one,"" Barish told the AP.

The waves are detected by a laser device, called an interferometer, which must be both exquisitely precise and extremely stable in a project that cost $1.1 billion dollars. The first observation involved two of the devices about 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) apart — in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana. They came about 7 milliseconds apart, consistent with the speed of light.

A new detector in Italy went online and helped in the discovery of the fourth wave.

With the technology that the three developed ""we may even see entirely new objects that we haven't even imagined yet,"" said Patrick Sutton, an astronomer at Cardiff University in Wales.

The German-born Weiss, 85, who initially spearheaded the research effort, was awarded half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize amount. Thorne, 77, a theorist, and Barish, 81, who was a project director, will split the other half.

For decades, the scientists pushed for money to start the massive LIGO project, getting their first National Science Foundation grant in 1992. The first version of the detector went through six long runs looking for gravitational waves, but didn't find them because it wasn't technologically precise enough, Barish said.

And computer programs needed to solve Einstein's equations weren't quite right and ""the quest was foundering,"" said Thorne, who peeled away from the detector work to form another collaboration to get better computing for detection.

Two decades after construction ""we finally struck gold,"" Barish said.

Weiss also overcame failure. After flunking out of MIT, he didn't have anything to do so he offered himself as an electronics technician to a lab at MIT and learned how to solder and deal with people. He returned to school, got his bachelor's and doctorate at MIT and ended up as a professor there.

""There was a person who thought I was OK. I wasn't a complete dope,"" Weiss said. ""I got some confidence out of that.""

In a moment of poetry aimed at making the distant and infinitesimal phenomenon understandable to non-experts, the academy announcement said gravitational waves ""are always created when a mass accelerates, like when an ice-skater pirouettes or a pair of black holes rotate around each other.""

Professor Alberto Vecchio, from the University of Birmingham's Institute of Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said this discovery will produce results for decades to come.

""They have taken me, as well as hundreds of my colleagues, through such an intellectually rewarding and recently adrenaline-packed journey that we could not have even remotely imagined,"" he said. ""The best part is that this is just the beginning of a new roller-coaster exploration of the universe.""

Identifying quality wood furniture can be difficult these days. Many pieces look great in the store, only to prove flimsy once you get them home and start to use them. Here’s what to look for, and what to avoid, when shopping for your next piece of wood furniture.

When made with high-quality materials and solid construction, wood furniture can last for decades and sometimes even centuries. But not everything you see in stores is built to last. Buy something that’s made poorly and you’ll start to see wear and tear way too soon. How can you tell the difference? It’s harder than you might think. The first thing to pay attention to is the wood itself.

Solid wood. The highest-quality material for wood furniture is solid wood. This type of furniture will be made from single pieces of wood or wood boards that are glued together to make panels — trees are only so wide, after all. If something is described as being made with solid wood, find out if that describes the entire piece or just certain parts.

Hardwood. Solid wood can be categorized as either hardwood or softwood. Hardwood comes from slower-growing trees and the wood is denser and more resistant to dings. Common hardwoods include oak, ash, walnut, cherry and maple.

Softwood. Softwood comes from faster-growing trees and the wood is less dense. Some common softwoods are pine, fir and poplar. Since these trees grow faster, furniture made using their wood tends to be less expensive than pieces made from hardwood.

Domestic wood. Domestic wood comes from trees that are grown and processed in the United States. Common domestic wood species include oak, maple, cherry, walnut, ash, poplar and pine.

A quick note about how wood is described: The species can describe either the material or the stain color. So something described as walnut might be stained that color but actually be made from pine. This isn’t necessarily bad — just make sure you know what you’re getting. You shouldn’t be paying walnut prices for a piece of furniture made from less-expensive wood.

Imported wood. A lot of imported furniture is made from tropical wood species such as rubberwood (sometimes known as plantation hardwood), mango, acacia or sheesham (a type of rosewood). These species can produce a sturdy piece of furniture, but they may be susceptible to cracking if they’re coming from a humid environment to a drier one.

Benefits of solid wood. Ensuring that your furniture is 100 percent solid wood is a pretty fail-safe way to know that you’re purchasing something high-quality. Solid wood construction is extremely long-lasting and can be easily refinished and repaired down the road.

Cons of solid wood. Solid wood is definitely the best choice for furniture but, as with any natural material, there can be downsides. Solid wood is more susceptible to changes in climate, which may cause it to crack or warp. It’s also more expensive than furniture made from engineered wood products.

Plywood. Plywood (sometimes called engineered hardwood) is made by gluing together thin layers of solid wood. When used in furniture construction, plywood is covered with a thin layer of stained and finished wood — a veneer.

Pros of plywood. The main benefit of plywood is that it’s stable when the climate changes and is less likely to warp or crack in dry climates. It can also give you a sturdy piece of furniture at a lower cost than solid wood.

Cons of plywood. Sometimes the quality of plywood comes down to the quality of the veneer. Poor-quality veneers can chip, revealing the lower-quality wood underneath. Damage may also be difficult to repair since the bulk of the furniture is made using a different wood species than the veneer. Also, some plywood is made using chemicals with formaldehyde, which can affect indoor air quality, although formaldehyde-free plywood is available.

MDF. Medium-density fiberboard is made from wood waste products (basically sawdust) that have been mixed with resins. The mixture is compressed to create large, flat boards. For furniture, MDF is finished with a layer of real-wood veneer or non-wood laminate.

Pros and cons of MDF. There are more cons than pros when you’re talking about MDF furniture. Pieces made from it are less expensive than those made of solid wood or plywood, which makes them budget-friendly. However, MDF requires a lot of chemicals to make and is the highest-formaldehyde-emitting wood product out there. Other downsides: It can easily be damaged by water, it’s difficult to repair, it doesn’t hold screws very well and it’s heavy.

Particle board. Made similarly to MDF, particle board uses larger wood scraps to create boards. You can differentiate particle board from MDF by spotting the pockets of air when looking at it from the side.

Pros and cons of particle board. The one thing particle board has going for it is that it’s inexpensive. And then there are the downsides: It emits formaldehyde, requires a lot of chemicals to produce, is susceptible to moisture damage and really doesn’t hold screws well. Particle board furniture tends to loosen up quickly, resulting in wobbles.

Veneers. A veneer is a thin sheet of real wood that is applied to the outside of a piece of wood furniture. It can be added to any of the wood products mentioned above. Veneers are used when you want to match up wood grain to create a design, or to cover a lower-cost piece of furniture.

Selecting veneered furniture. Veneer quality varies widely. Look for those that are thicker, have good adhesion and are glued to solid wood or plywood as opposed to MDF or particle board. Poorly done veneers can peel and chip.

We can’t spend our lives locked behind closed doors and afraid to go to concerts, sporting events or other large gatherings.
Lessons learned by providing medical treatment in wars over the past 100 years have improved health care for everyone.
And helicopters played a key role in quickly evacuating the wounded to medical treatment.","For centuries, medical professionals have learned lessons from the casualties of war. In the wake of the horrendous shooting spree that left 58 people dead and sent nearly 500 to hospitals in Las Vegas last Sunday, the medical community – and ordinary citizens as well – should learn lessons about how to respond when an American city is turned into a war zone.

Learning these lessons is critically important to save lives, because the sad truth is that it is just a matter of time before guns, bombs, cars, trucks, planes or something else is used by mentally disturbed people or terrorists to attack innocent people again somewhere in our country.

When people are seriously injured, a rapid response can be the difference between life and death. But we can’t always count on trained medical professionals to be nearby when we need them.

Here are some ideas that can help us all deal with the possibility of violence or another medical emergency suddenly engulfing us:

First, as terrible as the attack in Las Vegas was, we shouldn’t panic. We can be sure that some people will be in the wrong place at the wrong time and fall victim to a violent attack, but the overwhelming majority of us never will. So while we need to be better prepared for an attack, we must not be paralyzed by fear. That in itself is harmful to our health. We can’t spend our lives locked behind closed doors and afraid to go to concerts, sporting events or other large gatherings.

Second, as many of us as possible should get some basic first-aid training. Learn how to administer CPR. How to tie a tourniquet to stop bleeding from a wound. What you can do if someone is burned. How to immobilize a broken arm or leg. You don’t have to be a doctor or nurse to learn the basics of dealing with a medical emergency until the person you are helping can get treatment from a medical professional. Schools should provide this training to children and community groups should make it available to adults.

As a practicing physician I taught my children at home how to administer CPR, how to apply a proper tourniquet and how to deal with penetrating injuries. I remember some of my friends telling me: “Manny, if you want your kids to be doctors that’s fine, otherwise, you’ll be traumatizing them!” No, I don’t necessarily want my kids to be doctors, but rather be involved in our society. We all need to be part of the solution.

Third, know your blood type and have a card in your wallet listing it. Should you ever need a transfusion in an emergency, this information will be important for those treating you.

Fourth, donate blood to a blood bank. Having a plentiful blood supply on hand in an emergency can help medical professional save lives. The American Red Cross website makes it easy to find a blood drive near you by typing in your ZIP code.

In addition to these steps that everyone can take, emergency medical responders should learn lessons from what went right and what might have gone better following the Las Vegas attack and other mass casualty incidents, such as natural disasters. Studies of the emergency response should be shared widely in the medical community and among government officials.

Lessons learned by providing medical treatment in wars over the past 100 years have improved health care for everyone. New lessons learned in domestic attacks can do the same.

For example, the horror of World War I accelerated the learning and technical proliferation of surgery in the field of wound management. We began to learn about what unsanitary conditions could do not only in the battlefield, but in the cities to where the wounded would be transported.

In addition, the development of wound drainage techniques and surface wound antiseptics became the standards in many military hospitals in World War I, minimizing complications from infection. Civilian hospitals then made these improvements.

World War I also brought us the first concept of a blood bank and how the utilization of blood products would potentially save lives. Specific typing of blood became available and preservation of blood products was discovered in order to maintain the freshness of blood.

Surgeons and scientists during World War I became aware of the treatment of shock. Many scientists began to publish in the field of physiology, which led to discoveries for the treatment of hypothermia, fluid resuscitation and oxygen delivery.

World War II gave us the analysis of medical triaging and how important survival is from the time of injury to treatment. This discovery is the hallmark of trauma victim treatment to this day.

In addition, during WWII surgical techniques were improved and subspecialties in surgical training became the norm. The war taught us about the importance of medical teams of nurses, technicians, anesthesiologists and surgeons. More antibiotics were developed beyond penicillin. The treatment of trauma became more sophisticated.

From the end of the Korean War through the Vietnam War and up until 2006, Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) units were set up in a matter of hours, providing medical treatment near the front lines to wounded soldiers. A book, film and hit TV show made millions of Americans aware of the MASH units.

The Vietnam War gave us not only more sophistication in vascular surgery but also the framework of what it is today to have a trauma center. And helicopters played a key role in quickly evacuating the wounded to medical treatment. Now helicopters are used for the same purpose in this country.

In the long run, I know things will get better. Things will change. Because Good will prevail against Evil.

In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, some pundits are calling for the shredding of the Constitution and the eradication of our right to keep and bear arms.

Leading the charge is so-called conservative New York Times writer Bret Stephens, who is also a contributor over at conspiracy factory MSNBC.

“Repealing the [Second] amendment may seem like political mission impossible today, but in the era of same-sex marriage, it's worth recalling that most great causes began as improbable ones,” Stephens wrote. “Gun ownership should never be outlawed, just as it isn't outlawed in Britain and Australia. But it doesn't need a blanket constitutional protection, either.”

Good luck to any law-abiding citizen of those countries who wants a gun for protection. And anyway, it has been demonstrated over and over that banning guns does not prevent crime.

Catalonia's separatists camp has grown in recent years, strengthened by Spain's recent economic crisis and by Madrid's rejection of attempts to increase self-rule in the region.","Hundreds of thousands of people rallied Sunday in downtown Barcelona to protest against the plans of Catalonia's regional government to secede from the rest of Spain. The march was the largest pro-union showing since the rise of separatist sentiment in the prosperous northeastern region that has pushed Spain to the brink of a national crisis.

Barcelona police said 350,000 people participated, while march organizers Societat Civil Catalana said that 930,000 people turned out.

Those numbers resemble the pro-independence rallies that Barcelona has seen in recent years.

Many in the crowd who marched through the city center under the slogan of ""Let's recover our common sense!"" carried Spanish, Catalan and European Union flags. Some chanted ""Don't be fooled, Catalonia is Spain"" and called for Catalan president Carles Puigdemont to go to prison.

Sunday's rally comes a week after the Catalan government went ahead and held a referendum on secession that Spain's top court had suspended and the Spanish government said was illegal.

Catalan authorities say the ""Yes"" side won the referendum with 90 percent of the vote, though only 43 percent of the region's 5.3 million eligible voters turned out in polling that was marred by police raids of polling stations on orders to confiscate ballot boxes.

Puigdemont has pledged to push ahead for independence anyway and is set to address the regional parliament on Tuesday ""to report on the current political situation.""

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy vows that his government will not allow Catalonia, which represents a fifth of Spain's economy, to break away from the rest of the country.

In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais published Sunday, Rajoy said that he will consider employing any measure ""allowed by the law"" to stop the region's separatists.

Rajoy said that includes the application of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would allow the central government to take control of the governance of a region ""if the regional government does not comply with the obligations of the Constitution.""

""The ideal situation would be that I don't have to find drastic solutions, but for that to happen there will have to be some rectifications (by Catalan leaders),"" Rajoy said.

Rallies were held Saturday in Madrid, Barcelona and other cities to demand that Rajoy and Puigdemont negotiate to find a solution to Spain's worst political crisis in nearly four decades.

Pro-union forces hope to gather steam with Sunday's protest in Barcelona after a series of large businesses, including Catalonia's top two banks, announced they were relocating their headquarters to other parts of Spain. Other companies are reportedly considering leaving Catalonia to avoid being cast out of the European Union and its common market in the case of secession.

""I hope that nothing will happen. Because (Catalonia) is going to lose more than (Spain) because businesses are fleeing from here already,"" said protester Juliana Prats, a Barcelona resident. ""I hope it will remain like it has been up until now, 40 years of peace.""

The rally drew Spaniards from outside the northeastern region to the Catalan capital. One group held a large banner boasting ""Marbella,"" a town on Spain's southern coast. An AP reporter spoke with another man who had come from the northern Basque Country region.

Nobel Literature Prize laureate Mario Vargas Llosa and former president of the European Parliament Josep Borrell addressed the rally.

""Besides Catalans, there are thousands of men and women from all corners of Spain who have come to tell their Catalan companions that they are not alone,"" said Llosa, who took on Spanish citizenship in addition to that of his native Peru in 1993. ""We want Barcelona to once again be the capital of Spanish culture.""

Borrell added that: ""Catalonia is not a state like Kosovo where rights were systematically violated.""

The most recent polls taken before the referendum showed that Catalonia's 7.5 million residents were roughly split over secession, while a majority would support an official referendum on independence if it were condoned by Spanish authorities

Rajoy's government has repeatedly refused to grant Catalonia permission to hold a referendum on grounds that it is unconstitutional since it would only poll a portion of Spain's 46 million residents.

Catalonia's separatists camp has grown in recent years, strengthened by Spain's recent economic crisis and by Madrid's rejection of attempts to increase self-rule in the region.",Hundreds of thousands rally in Barcelona against Catalonia secession,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/08/hundreds-thousands-rally-in-barcelona-against-catalonia-secession.html

So when cousins Larry McCullough and Cedric Ingram Lewis ignored the coach’s orders and decided to protest, the coach took immediate action. Click here to watch the video.

He made both players remove their uniforms on the field and dismissed them from the team.

“I want to be clear that I don’t have a problem with people protesting if it is done the right way,” the coach said. “But to disrespect the flag that gives us the right to protest is the wrong way to do it. I gave the two players other ways to protest that I felt was fair.”

But instead of following their coach’s instructions, the young men took matters into their own hands.

“I pretty much knew how he looked at us when I was holding my fist up and my cousin was kneeling,” Lewis told CBS in Houston.

His mother was furious with the coach’s actions – accusing him of humiliating the boys in front of the crowd.

The boys were not kicked off the team for protesting the national anthem. They were kicked off the team for disobeying their coach.

“A man with integrity and morals and ethics and who truly believes by that would not have done anything like that,” parent Brady told the Houston Chronicle.

On the contrary, a football coach without integrity would’ve allowed the football team to do whatever they wanted – without consequences.

“Actions speak louder than words,” Brady told a local news reporter.

“Though many may disagree with me this is what I believe and as an American I have that right,” he said. “I pray these young men across American can come to understand there is a right and wrong way to do things.”

By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., The Wall Street Journal



Those who say gun control is the answer to massacres like Sunday’s in Las Vegas are really saying they are willing to live with such outrages.

Gun-control proposals always float up in the aftermath of mass shootings, singularly detached from any plan that could be carried out, much less command majority support from the U.S. electorate. A law banning gun sales is not in the cards. A law seriously curtailing private gun ownership, as exists in the U.K., is not in the cards. If it were, enforcing it would be a whole other nightmare.

Non-meaningful gun regulations, in fact, were the specialty of a Democratic senator who long represented Nevada, scene of Sunday’s killings. Harry Reid had a lifetime “B” rating from the National Rifle Association. A New York Times columnist on Monday, under the web headline “Preventing Mass Shootings Like the Vegas Strip Attack,” proposed eight steps that, whatever their slight utility in lowering the rate of other kinds of gun crimes and suicides, even the writer admitted would have no “overwhelming effect” on gun deaths, let alone mass shootings.

Mass shootings of the modern ilk are a lot more like terrorist attacks than they are like routine gun crimes, in which guns are used to settle an argument, facilitate a robbery or eliminate a rival.

Mass shootings typically involve a substantial measure of planning and preparation. Stephen Paddock walked into a luxury hotel—correction, he walked into a hotel-casino, where it’s part of the business model to know and watch customers carefully—with 23 weapons, ammo and related equipment.

Wynn, the billionaire CEO of Wynn Resorts, in an exclusive interview with “Fox News Sunday,” said he reassessed his casino’s security in 2015, when he developed a high-level counterterrorism program.

“I got every consultant and adviser I can think of to come through from Ray Kelly to the people from Seal Team 6. It took us from Thanksgiving until May to develop and institute and recruit a program of counterterrorism and it will be two years this May,” Wynn told ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace.

“Basically we had to recruit and expand security by tens of millions of dollars to cover every entrance, to retrain the entire workforce -- from housekeeping and room service -- and people are in the tower and observing people. We had to cover every exit and every aspect of the building to see if we could identify and preempt any kind of terroristic or violent action. It is never perfect, of course, but what you can do, to use local vernacular: you can change the odds,” Wynn said.

The Las Vegas gunman, Stephen Paddock, reportedly was holed up in his suite at the Mandalay Bay for three days, instituting a type of “do not disturb” policy that Wynn says would have alerted his Wynn Resorts staff to investigate.

“We also have rules about do not disturb,” Wynn said. “If a room goes on do not disturb for more than 12 hours, we investigate. We constantly -- we don't allow guns in this building unless they're being carried by our employees and there's a lot of them. But if anybody's got a gun and we find them continually, we eject them from the hotel.”

Wynn also said Stephen Paddock and his girlfriend were well-known to his staff.

“He's been staying in Las Vegas since ‘06. So you know, we're talking about 11 years with his girlfriend or at least in recent years, frequent visitor, once or twice a month, to this hotel and others. The most vanilla profile one could possibly imagine. A modest gambler at least by our standards, you know, nothing serious, paid promptly, never owed any money anywhere in Las Vegas. He didn't fit the profile of a problem or compulsive gambler.”

When asked whether he had a motive regarding Paddock’s murderous rampage, Wynn suggested that his previous behavior suggested the gunman was “a rational man.”

“This is a man who behaved rationally, privately, a little introverted, liked to play video poker. But he was a rational man. And every historical review of his behavior indicates that he was a rational man; so was his girlfriend. And yet he prepared over an extended period of time, a totally irrational act.

“Now, this sounds like someone either totally demented -- a behavior which he never evidenced -- or someone who's sending a message. This is a plan. We don't know what that message is or if there is one, but this behavior, according to my employees, is as stunning, as unexpected as anybody, any of them have ever met.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

On a cool and rainy afternoon during the first week of classes at Centennial High School in this well-to-do Baltimore suburb, about 50 members of the boys' cross-country team sauntered across the parking lot for their after-school run.

Meanwhile, about 30 kids in helmets and pads were going through drills on the pristine artificial turf field at the school's hillside football stadium.

""It used to be the other way around,"" said Al Dodds, Centennial's cross-country coach, who has 64 boys on his team this year. ""Now, there's a small turnout in football and cross-country is huge.""

Across the athletic complex, a practice football field sat empty, even though it was recently mown and painted with yardage lines and hash marks. In years past, the junior-varsity team would have been relegated to that grass field. But on this day they had the stadium to themselves, as they will for every practice this fall. Centennial isn't fielding a varsity football team because not enough kids signed up to play.

The situation at Centennial — where a long history of losing has dampened students' enthusiasm for football — is unique to this part of central Maryland, but there are plenty of similar examples around the U.S. Participation in high school football is down 3.5 percent over the past five years, according to the annual survey by the National Association of State High School Federations, or NFHS.

The decline would be much steeper if not for a handful of states in the South and the West. Throughout the Northeast, the Midwest and the West Coast, in communities urban and rural, wealthy and working-class, fewer kids are playing football.

""I've never been interested in football,"" said 16-year-old Zach Deming, a cross-country runner at Centennial with the solid build of a defensive back. ""I'm afraid of getting hurt badly, like getting a serious concussion .""

The risks of football have never been more apparent. This summer, researchers at Boston University said they'd found evidence of a brain disease linked to repeated head blows in nearly all of the 202 former football players they studied. The athletes whose brains were donated to the study had played football in the National Football League, college and even high school.

The report doesn't confirm chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, is common in all football players, because many donors or their families participated in the study because of the players' troubling symptoms.

After years of denials, the NFL acknowledged a link between head blows and brain disease and agreed in 2015 to a $1 billion settlement to compensate former players who had accused the league of hiding the risks.

""There's no question about it. The amount of publicity, beginning with the NFL and what you see on national news, has caused concern among parents,"" said Bob Gardner, the NFHS executive director. ""Probably some who would have been more inclined to let their young men play, maybe are making different decisions now.""

A study published last month in the medical journal Translational Psychiatry showed that kids who played football before age 12 were more than twice as likely to have mood and behavior problems.

The news hasn't escaped the parents at Centennial, one of the top-rated public high schools in Maryland, where 97 percent of students go on to college after they graduate. Just 10 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, an indicator of poverty.

""Families around here are more into academics,"" Zach said.

Maryland is one of 14 states where participation in football was down 10 percent or more over the past five years, according to NFHS data. In all, 41 states saw a decline between the 2011-12 and 2016-17 school years, and just nine states and the District of Columbia saw increases.

In West Windsor Township, New Jersey, which borders Princeton University and has a median household income of $137,000, one of the two public high schools dropped varsity football this year, and the other might have to do the same next year.

Trinity High School in Manchester, New Hampshire, also disbanded its varsity team, with hopes that it could return in a lower division next year.

At the first practice, the team ""had three seniors, one junior, 12 sophomores and one freshman,"" athletic director Chip Polak told the New Hampshire Union Leader in August. ""Two of the seniors have never played any kind of organized football and the other senior is dealing with concussion symptoms.""

In Ventura County, California, northeast of Los Angeles, Thousand Oaks High School disbanded its junior-varsity team this season because it needed sophomores and juniors to fill out the varsity roster. In Marin County, north of San Francisco, Novato High School announced that it wouldn't field a varsity team this year, but the program got a last-minute reprieve when more athletes than expected showed up for practice.

The decline in participation isn't just limited to wealthy, coastal communities. Among the states where participation is down more than 10 percent are Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois. Population in Illinois has also declined over that period, while in Michigan and Wisconsin it has only grown slightly.

Researchers at the University of Colorado, who studied data from the NFHS and the Census, said in an analysis published Sept. 26 that high school football participation peaked in 2009 before beginning a decline that is likely to continue.

The NFL is paying attention to the numbers and trying to find ways to get kids playing the sport.

""It is important for kids to play sports because it's healthy, it's fun, and they learn important values,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. ""Of course, we think football is the best team sport and we aim to ensure there are a range options for young players today — both tackle and flag.""

While participation in tackle football is down, flag football is becoming more popular. Participation in the NFL Flag program run by USA Football for kids ages 6-17 increased by 66 percent from 2013 to 2016, with 385,000 kids playing last year.

In high schools, the expense of the sport and increasing specialization by young athletes are also factors. And while football is declining, other sports are growing, among them soccer and lacrosse. But football is different because it remains the nation's most popular spectator sport, and schools expect to sell tickets on Friday nights.

""The key thing about football is that it's such an important part of the financial picture of schools. Some of these schools rely on the attendance in high school football to pay for these other sports,"" Gardner said. ""While we certainly applaud the growth of all sports, we remain vigilant about what's going on in football because of the economic impact.""

Around the Centennial football program, there is optimism that varsity football could return next year if the JV team can put together a reasonably competitive season. The team has a strong freshman class, some of whom have never played organized football before.

Toward the end of the 2-hour practice, coaches wanted the first-team defense to get some full-speed reps. That required some creativity.

""If you're not on first-team defense, I need 11 of you to make an offense,"" an assistant coach barked. ""I need a running back, I need a fullback, I need five linemen, I need a tight end, I need two wide receivers. Let's go!""",Schools disbanding football teams as participation declines,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/06/schools-disbanding-football-teams-as-participation-declines.html

Kim’s appointment of his 28-year-old sibling was viewed as a move to further consolidate his power.

The sister reportedly replaces Kim Jong Un's aunt, Kim Kyong Hee, who was a key decision maker when Kim’s father – the late Kim Jong Il – ruled the country, Reuters reported.

The promotion was announced Saturday, at a meeting in which Kim also described North Korea’s nuclear weapons program as a “powerful deterrent” that guaranteed the nation’s sovereignty, Reuters reported, citing the state media report.

Kim Yo Jong, a vice director of propaganda for North Korea’s ruling Workers Party, was sanctioned in January -- along with six other North Korean officials -- by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control for “human rights abuses and censorship activities,” Bloomberg reported.

But the sister has appeared more prominently in public in recent months, Bloomberg reported.

“She’s been recognized for the work she’s done in the past year to idolize Kim Jong Un,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at South Korea’s University of North Korean Studies, the news agency reported. “Kim Jong Un is extending his father and grandfather’s practice of empowering family members.”

At Saturday’s meeting, Kim Jong Un said his country’s nuclear weapons were a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia” against “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”

The report of Kim’s remarks came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that “only one thing will work” in negotiations with the Hermit Kingdom, Reuters reported.

Trump’s remark seemed to suggest that the president was thinking about possible military action.

“Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in ’18. Tennessee not happy!” the president tweeted Friday morning.

In Chattanooga, Tenn., last week, Corker leveled harsh criticism at the president.

“The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order for him to be successful – and our nation and our world needs for him to be successful, whether you are Republican or Democrat,” Corker reportedly said at a Rotary Club meeting in his district on Aug. 17. “He also recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation.”

Corker told reporters that Trump has “not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great and what it is today.”

The comments were made during a week when numerous Republicans were joining Democrats in criticizing his response to the violence in Charlottesville. After a counter-protester was killed during a white supremacist rally there, Trump took heat for blaming ""both sides"" even as he condemned neo-Nazis.

The Corker-Trump tensions reflect a deterioration in a relationship that was once close. Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had been considered for secretary of state.

This is the right call, because decertification is the indispensable first step toward fixing a deeply flawed agreement that puts Iran on the path to becoming another North Korea.

Decertifying the deal, which was designed to limit Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons for over a decade in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, does not mean pulling out of the agreement. If President Trump refuses to certify by the Oct. 15 deadline, Congress could reimpose sanctions, but it should first give the White House a chance to negotiate a better deal.

The nuclear deal with Iran was reached in 2015 by President Obama’s administration and the governments of Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. The agreement prohibits the U.S. from reimposing the original sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program, but does not rule out tough sanctions on Iranian entities responsible for terrorism, missile development, regional aggression, corruption and human rights violations. These kinds of sanctions could exert the pressure necessary to bring Iran back to the negotiating table.

This kind of pressure could work because Iran does not want to give up the extraordinary economic benefits delivered by the nuclear deal. While attention has justifiably focused on how the nuclear deal has failed to stop Iran from launching nuclear-capable missiles or blocking U.N. inspectors access to military research facilities, Americans should also focus on the perpetual windfall the deal gives Tehran.

Iranian income from oil and natural gas exports increased by $24 billion, or 70 percent, in the first full year after the nuclear deal went into effect. The International Monetary Fund projects that energy exports will continue to grow steadily during the next five years, providing Tehran with $174 billion more of oil revenue than it would have earned if sanctions remained in place.

This windfall should not surprise anyone, although it may come as news to senior Obama administration officials who insist that the deal is not providing Tehran with the means to promote its agenda of terrorism and aggression throughout the Middle East.

According to Adam Szubin, who served as undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence during the final years of the Obama administration: “There are, to be sure, benefits to Iran for staying in the deal, but those benefits will take years to accrue. And contrary to the warning, Iran’s client Hezbollah has been under unprecedented financial pressure.”

Szubin’s opinions, contained in an op-ed he wrote for The Washington Post, command respect even among critics of the nuclear deal, because he was a leading architect of the comprehensive sanctions regime that put so much pressure on Iran. Though he has deep first-hand knowledge of this subject, in this instance the data and the facts tell a very different story.

As noted above, Iranian oil and gas exports began to surge immediately after sanctions were lifted. According to the International Monetary Fund, oil exports increased from 1.4 million barrels per day to 2.4 million in the first full year after the nuclear deal took effect.

Since oil drives the Iranian economy, this surge in exports translated into impressive overall growth of 6.6 percent. In sharp contrast, Iran’s economy shrank by 1.8 percent prior to the implementation of the nuclear deal and by 6.6 percent when sanctions were biting hardest in 2012. The World Bank reported a similar reversal of fortune. Moreover, both organizations project Iranian economic growth to be close to 4 percent this year and then stay above 4 percent for several years to come.

The economic benefits that followed the implementation of the nuclear deal also included lower Iranian inflation, which peaked near 35 percent in 2013 yet has now fallen to single digits, according to World Bank figures. In addition, Iran’s currency went into freefall as a result of sanctions pressure, but stabilized after the beginning of the negotiations that led to the nuclear deal.

Szubin does not acknowledge any of these extraordinary benefits. Instead he writes that Iranian gross domestic product (GDP) will still be 35 percent lower in 2017 than it was in 2011, thereby suggesting that Iran is nowhere close to recovering from the damage imposed by sanctions.

Arriving at this figure of a 35 percent decline requires some creative use of statistics. There are several ways to measure GDP, but Szubin chooses the only one that shows this kind of sharp contraction. Also, 2011 is a misleading year to use as the baseline for measuring changes in GDP, since oil prices shot up to an average of $108 per barrel that year, supercharging every oil- dependent economy. Had he used 2009 or 2010 as a baseline, there would be little or no decline to speak of.

In addition, Szubin understates by tens of billions of dollars the value of frozen assets released to Iran upon implementation of the nuclear. Whereas he offers a figure of $50 billion, a 2015 study by our colleagues at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies shows that this estimate is far too low, because of its narrow focus on liquid assets. A broader look at Tehran’s foreign holdings shows that it gained access to somewhere between $90 billion and $120 billion – a remarkable infusion for a $400 billion economy.

Szubin also asserts, without providing data, that the terrorist group Hezbollah is “under unprecedented financial pressure.” A new study of Hezbollah’s finances, also by our colleagues at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, reaches a very different conclusion.

Our study reports that Iranian support for Hezbollah fell sharply in 2014 and 2015, “likely due to international sanctions and low oil prices.” Yet even though oil prices remained low following the implementation of the nuclear deal, Iranian assistance returned to its previous level of about $700 million to $800 million per year, or 70 to 80 percent of Hezbollah’s estimated budget. It seems Iran has money to spare.

In light of the extraordinary economic benefits Iran has received from the nuclear agreement, it is certainly a good deal for Tehran. But it is getting harder and harder to see how anyone can look at the facts and serenely insist that this is also a good deal for the United States.

As of 11 a.m. EDT, the NHC said Nate was centered about 40 miles southwest of Birmingham, Ala. and moving north-northeast near 23 mph.

The storm originally made landfall in southeast Louisiana in a sparsely populated area. The storm is now expected to bring 3 to 6 inches of rain from the central Gulf Coast into the Deep South, along with the threat of isolated tornadoes from the Florida Panhandle and eastern Alabama across western and northern Georgia, according to the NHC.

Mississippi hit with flooding, power outages

As Nate pushed ashore, the hurricane spawned storm surge in coastal areas, flooding the parking structure of the Golden Nugget casino in Biloxi and pushing water several blocks deep into the city.

In Alabama, the storm's rising water flooded homes and cars on the coast and inundated at least one major thoroughfare in downtown Mobile.

Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier told the AP he woke up around 3 a.m. Sunday to discover knee-deep water in his yard.

Although some homes and cars on the island had flooded, Collier said he hadn't heard of any reports of residents needing to be rescued from the floodwaters. Collier added water levels appeared to be falling as dawn approached.

Storm surge also flooded Water Street in downtown Mobile and a ground-level causeway across Mobile Bay. Alabama Department of Transportation traffic cameras show water still standing on both those routes before dawn Sunday.

Alabama Power said as of 8 a.m. there are 71,000 customers without service with most ""in the Mobile area, but the effects are moving north.""

New Orleans spared worst from Nate

The hurricane passed to the east of New Orleans, which placed the most ferocious winds and storm surge away from the city. Nate's quick forward speed lessened the likelihood of prolonged rain that would tax the city's weakened drainage pump system.

The city famous for all-night partying was originally placed under a curfew, effective at 7 p.m., but the mayor lifted it about an hour after it had begun when it appeared the storm would pass by the city.

Streets in the famed French Quarter were not nearly as crowded as they typically are on a Saturday night, and Mayor Mitch Landrieu asked people to still shelter in place. Some bars were closed in the French Quarter but music blasted from others.

""I don't think it's going to be that bad, as far as a hurricane,"" Michael Dennis of Atlanta told the AP.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu said at a news conference Sunday there’s no reported damage in New Orleans, but there was localized flooding outside the flood protection zone.

He thanked first responders at a morning news conference, saying city officials felt ""100 percent"" in their response, and noted a few arrests last night that were unrelated to the brief curfew.

""We knew in a fairly short period of time there was a chance we would have tropical storm and hurricane winds,"" he said.

The storm wasn't enough to stop a Georgia couple from getting married at the World War II Museum in New Orleans.

Mike and Kendra Groves told NOLA.com the museum's early closure meant their scheduled 7 p.m. wedding would have to be pushed up, but they planned to head to the hotel bar to ride out the curfew.

""We never considered canceling,"" Mike told the news outlet.

In Plaquemines Parish south of New Orleans, officials evacuated 240 residents who were not protected by its levee system as the storm approached.

“While it appears we’re being spared, our hearts go out to Mississippi,” said Amos Cormier, president of the parish.

Even though the worst of Nate moved east of New Orleans, officials were still busy with water rescues to due choppy waters before the storm.

Officials in Louisiana said that people had to be rescued from two sailboats as Nate approached.The first rescue happened about noon Saturday, when two people had to be helped off a 41-foot sailboat that lost its engine in Lake Pontchartrain. The Coast Guard said both sailors were in stable condition.

A second rescue occurred in the Mississippi Sound, according to Melissa Scallon, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources Scallon said a distress call came in around 3 p.m. after a sailboat struck rocks at Bayou Caddy west of Waveland.

Scallon said the state Marine Patrol responded and plucked three people from the water, but no injuries were reported.

Meanwhile, key shipping ports across the U.S. Gulf Coast were closed Saturday, as Nate drew close, Reuters reported.

Daily oil production in the region was slashed 92 percent and daily natural gas production was down 77 percent, the report said.

In addition, workers were evacuated from 301 platforms and 13 rigs as of Saturday, Reuters reported, citing information from the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

“This is an incredibly tragic situation and ultimately, the ones most affected by this are those innocent, beautiful babies,” Boynton Beach police said in a Facebook post announcing the arrests. “We hope this serves as a wake-up call for these moms, and that they seek further treatment for their addiction. We sincerely wish them all the best.”

Family members of the two women took custody of the newborns.

Police said O’Connor and Schweinhart went to a parking garage Thursday to snort heroin in the company of the two babies. They bought the heroin from a drug dealer for $60.

Schweinhart called 911 when O’Connor began to overdose but then she started convulsing, police said.

“Fortunately, there was a Good Samaritan nearby who saw all of this happening and took the phone from her to speak with dispatchers,” Boynton Beach police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater said in the Facebook post.

Cops found the babies strapped in their car seats, the Palm Beach Post reported.

At the hospital, O’Connor told police she and Schweinhart knew each other from a drug treatment program and decided to “hang out” on Thursday, the paper reported.

O'Connor also told police she and Schweinhart became friends because their babies were due the same day, according to the paper. The infants were born four days apart.

O’Connor was released on $4,500 bond, the paper reported. Schweinhart was being held in lieu of $3,000 bail.

A judge told O’Connor she can only see her baby if her mother is present, according to the paper.

Schweinhart was told that if she makes bail she can have contact with her baby if another adult is present.","Florida moms overdosed on heroin while their newborns were in the backseat, police say",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/07/florida-moms-overdosed-on-heroin-while-their-newborns-were-in-backseat-police-say.html

Woods tweeted this summer that he had “accepted the fact that” he was blacklisted from Hollywood because of his views. He has said being conservative has made it tough to find work in Hollywood the past few years.

The “Casino” actor has twice been nominated for an Academy Award and has won an Emmy Award three times. His movie credits include “Salvador (1986)” and “Ghosts of Mississippi (1996),” both of which earned him a nomination for an Oscar. He's also played H.R. Haldeman in Oliver Stone's ""Nixon (1995),"" starred alongside Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford in Sydney Pollack's ""The Way We Were (1973)"" and was also in Martin Scorsese's epic crime drama ""Casino (1995).""

Woods was a Hollywood favorite -- and a Democrat -- until at least 1998, when he broke ranks with the party after former President Bill Clinton's impeachment.

He said on Twitter that he switched parties because of his disgust with the former president.

""Every single #Democrat without exception stood behind a convicted perjurer,"" he wrote on Twitter this summer. ""That was the end.""

His luck in Hollywood turned sour soon after he became a Republican. He has not had a major role in a film in at least a decade.

The news of his retirement was included in a press release issued by Woods' real estate agent offering Woods' Rhode Island lake house for sale.

Allen Gammons said Friday that Woods is 70 and wants to relax. He says the actor's brother and mother recently died, and he hopes to spend more time on passions including photography, antiquing and poker.

Gammons said Woods' decision was not political.

The announcement comes after Woods was in a Twitter feud with actress Amber Tamblyn, who last month accused him of trying to pick her up when she was 16. Woods called it a lie. Gammons said Woods declined to comment Friday when asked about Tamblyn's accusation.

Woods has said there are many conservative stars who didn’t speak up because “the blacklist against conservatives in Hollywood is very real.”

I personally think he was sincere in thinking Frank needed to back away from the lawn mower.
My guess is that if this had taken place under former President Obama’s watch, Mr. Greenhouse would have refrained from said tweet.
I also have no idea if Mr. Greenhouse has boys of his own.
And I have no idea if he owns a lawn mower.","My pop, a WWII veteran, devoted husband and the sort of father I aspire to be, didn’t raise no fools. Except me.

I know I’m a fool because back when I was 9 years old and sporting a flat top and a pair of black Converse All-Stars, my pop advised me that I was now taking over the lawn mower duties from one of my older brothers. That brother was being promoted to the job of painting the house for the summer. So, head room being what it is, Pop handed the keys to the mower to his youngest boy.

Actually, no keys were involved. The mower was an old Sears model. For those of you too young to know your American history, Sears was the Amazon of the 20th century. Anytime between 1893 and ’round about 1985, if you wanted pants, a dishwasher, football pads, a lava lamp or a reciprocating sprocket wrench with detachable sprockets, then by damn you got it at Sears.

The lawn mower I inherited as a 9-year-old that early summer afternoon was a late-’60s gas-powered Sears model my brothers called “Chopper.” Chopper ate anything that got too close to its massive rotating semi-sharp blades. It belched smoke as clumps of grass, rocks and half-chewed army men flew out from all sides. As a 9-year-old, I calculated Chopper’s weight to be somewhere between 160 pounds and a two-door Buick. It took all 85 pounds of me, and about three hours, to push that beast around our yard.

Now I know Pop raised a fool, because when he announced solemnly that Chopper was my responsibility, I looked him in the eye and said what I typically said back then: “Yes sir… you bet.” What I should have said was, “Pop, I don’t mean to tell you your business, but do you have any idea how dangerous lawn mowers are to kids?” And then I would have handed him a couple of articles detailing those dangers, and for good measure recited current regulations related to child labor laws and how he just might be in violation of said laws.

Yes sir, that’s what I should have done. I know that now because that’s what former New York Times labor reporter Steven Greenhouse recently suggested following the curious case of Frank the Amazing Mowing Boy.

By now you’ve likely heard the heartwarming tale of Frank Giaccio, the 11-year-old kid from Virginia. Frank has himself a lawn mowing business. According to reliable sources, he charges $8 a lawn. I’m not that good at math, but I believe that’s approximately 8 clams more per yard than I made during my mowing career, so I think it’s safe to say that Frank is some kind of business genius.

Anyway, one day Frank reached out to the White House Office of Lawns and Shrubbery, which is overseen by the Department of Landscaping over at the Ministry of the Interior I believe, and said it would be his honor to mow the White House lawn. Apparently realizing the lawn in fact did need mowing, they reached out to Frank and Bob’s your uncle. I do not know if Frank was also tasked with picking up dog poop prior to mowing. That may well fall under a different department.

Bottom line, Frank got his wish, and by all accounts he did a very fine job mowing the White House lawn. President Trump came out to greet and thank him. In the video of the encounter, Frank almost looks too busy to stop and shake hands. Clearly he’s worried about keeping the mowing line straight. And to be honest, he probably had a couple more lawns to get to that day. And as if this story needed any more of a kick in the pants, Frank apparently told the president that when he grows up, he wants to be a Navy Seal.

I don’t know about you, but after my experience as a kid, and now as a father raising three young boys, I wanted to shake Frank’s hand and tell him well done, keep it up.

But then, Steven Greenhouse came along and rained on my freshly cut lawn. He sent out a tweet that read, in part: “Not sending a great signal on child labor, minimum wage & occupational safety.” Now there’s a good chance that all Mr. Greenhouse was doing was pointing out that children and lawn mowers can be a dangerous combination. He is, after all, a writer on a wide variety of labor topics.

I don’t believe he was making any statement about the need to teach kids responsibility and the value of hard work. I personally think he was sincere in thinking Frank needed to back away from the lawn mower. But, frankly, children and anything else can be a potentially dangerous combination. My boys Scooter, Sluggo and Muggsy could take a cantaloupe, two mini marshmallows and a feather duster and turn it into a deadly weapon. Just the other day, Muggsy broke his nose while using a cardboard tube as a pirate sword.

Given that I’m a bit of a cynical sort, there is also the chance that Mr. Greenhouse didn’t vote for the current president and saw this as an opportunity to creatively take a dig at him. My guess is that if this had taken place under former President Obama’s watch, Mr. Greenhouse would have refrained from said tweet. That’s just speculation, folks.

I also have no idea if Mr. Greenhouse has boys of his own. My research staff is off on another team-building exercise at an all-inclusive resort, and I can’t remember the Wi-Fi password in the office. And I have no idea if he owns a lawn mower. If he resides in New York City, another fact I can’t be bothered to check, there’s a good chance that he has limited experience with yard implements.

What’s my point? When I started writing, I was going to take an easy potshot at Mr. Greenhouse and talk about how we all spend way too much time coddling our kids and trying to reduce life’s risks down to zero, and how mowing lawns teaches kids responsibility and the value of hard work. But Mr. Greenhouse has already been lambasted for his tweet in social media circles … and I don’t have the energy to leap on that dog pile.

Speaking of dog piles, I can look out my kitchen window and see my boy Scooter picking up after our dog Hendricks in the back yard. Scoot’s only 10, but sitting inside the garage is a gas-powered mower with fairly dull blades, and it’s now become his responsibility.

Not to worry, Mr. Greenhouse, I gave him a safety briefing… told him to watch out for flying rocks and chewed-up action figures, advised him not to stick his fingers where they don’t belong and, when pushing it up hill, don’t let it roll back on you. It was the same briefing I got from my pop. Scooter listened attentively, and I’m proud to say his response was, “You bet.” He’ll be just fine.","Frank, the lawnmower boy, still has liberals all worked up.

It was her eyes, though, that truly terrified me. You could see the unrelenting, unshakable, unmovable fear they held.

In all fairness, nothing about fear should shock us. We’ve all been fearful at some point in our own lives.

But this was different.

This was a terrifying mix for when anger, shock and absolute horror all roll into one perilous package. It was as if you were about to tell someone they were going to...and then I knew what was about to happen.

And there is no preparation for it. None.

The doctor looked at me, looked at her patient, my wife Jennifer, and then looked down at the paperwork she had in front of her that contained Jen's test results. She repeated this over and over, as if she didn’t believe what her eyes were telling her.

When she finally stopped, the words for her were hard to find. But when she did speak, our world would be transformed forever.

The prognosis came in two parts. First, Jennifer’s thyroid had stopped working—certainly not good but something that happens to many people and was treatable. However, the second part was devastating: her kidneys were near total failure and her body was shutting down. If emergency measures weren’t enacted—and soon—she would be dead within six weeks.

Six weeks.

No one said anything at first. Then, after maybe ten seconds, we all looked at each other—no one really had a reaction. It felt like, for a moment, in that doctor’s office, time stopped.

For me, when I heard the news my reaction was paused for a simple reason: I wanted to cry, scream and yell—all at the same time.

I instantly blamed myself. I knew I should have pushed Jen to go to the doctor sooner. I should have been persistent, I should have seen the signs for what they were. But we kept making excuses for what was happening for months, and now we were paying the price—perhaps the ultimate price.

You see, starting in January 2015, Jennifer, the love of my life, my best friend—my everything—saw her health slowly start to slip away.

At first, we dismissed her symptoms as the result of her efforts to lose weight through diet and exercise. But as her health became gradually worse—her energy level deteriorated, she felt aches and pains throughout her body and felt awful all the time—we started to worry.

By the time the summer rolled around, things had gotten much worse. Jennifer was now losing weight dramatically. By July, she had lost almost seventy pounds in seven months. When we would go to the grocery store, separating into different aisles, there would be times I couldn’t find her as she looked like a completely different person.

Even at this point we dismissed the symptoms—now blaming Jennifer’s stressful job as a travelling psychologist, treating adolescent patients in some of the most poverty stricken and crime ridden neighborhoods of Washington, D.C.—as the culprit. It would take me comparing pictures of her from then to a few years prior to understand she needed medical treatment—or I might lose her.

When we walked out of the doctor’s office and went out onto the street we both grabbed for each other. Our heads nearly collided, each of us sobbing, shaking and crying uncontrollably, a reaction that words could never do justice to.

We both said at the same time: “What are we going to do?”

Once the shock washed away she did the only thing she could do, the only thing left to do: fight for her life.

And let there be no doubt, this was a battle that would test Jennifer’s will to live, test the strength of our marriage and make us rethink everything that was important to us.

Forever.

But just like every battle, there are some constants that aren’t changeable.

Ask anyone who has fought kidney disease and they will tell you a hard truth: you don’t ever beat it. You can become stable, even achieve some sort of remission from its unrelenting advance, but once your kidneys start to have problems they don’t ever heal themselves, they never return to their ‘normal’ state. So, the best result we could hope for in the war for Jennifer’s life was a draw, that no matter how hard she battled, no matter how much I supported her, no matter what sacrifice she was willing to make, all we could hope for is that it would not get any worse.

With this knowledge in hand, Jennifer’s struggle would begin.

The first order of battle began with constant visits to George Washington Hospital here in Washington, D.C. for battery after battery of tests. The constant blood work, doctor’s appointments and follow-up checkups were exhausting.

But none of that would compare to a kidney biopsy.

In what should be the latest Lannister torture method from ""Game of Thrones,"" Jennifer laid down on her stomach with her hands extended, holding onto what can only be described as grips. She was then given a small amount of numbing medication. After about a minute the doctor used a small device to remove a small 1cm piece of her kidney—while she was awake. When she came back to her hospital room she cried for hours as the pain was so intense.

Jennifer’s struggle, though, was just beginning.

Her kidney functioning levels were dropping fast and the amount of poison in her blood was increasing. If this could not be stopped, she would soon need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Her doctors recommended she be placed on steroids that could, emphasis on could, help stabilize her and maybe allow her kidneys to function slightly better. But there was a big downside to this treatment. Not only would Jennifer gain weight dramatically, but she would become temporarily—but horribly—disfigured as her whole body would swell uncontrollably.

She asked what other options she had. The doctor responded quite simply: “None.”

And with that, Jennifer’s descent into hell began.

If there was a dark time in this whole ordeal—or darker than any other—this was it. Jennifer was placed on the highest possible steroid dosage a person can take. From January 2016 to May of that year, Jen would be able to do very little as her arms and legs would begin to swell nonstop. When she did go outside, if she even had the energy to do so, people would shun her, as her face swelled to the point where she could no longer smile or make normal facial expressions. If she went to buy shoes, since all her pre-kidney disease shoes no longer fit, no one would wait on her. People would go to the other side of the street when they saw her, giving her dirty looks, time and time again.

Eventually, she stopped going outside—the physical and now emotional pain was too much to bear. The only thing that brought her joy was sitting by the window in our apartment, to feel a little bit a part of the outside world, looking down from six floors up as people walked to work or went about their lives. She would ask me constantly: “Am I going to die?” or “Is this my fate? To slowly rot away, just watching the world pass me by?”

Compounding all of this was the havoc this caused on her personally and professionally. She was fired from her job—they simply could not hold her position any longer after being out of the office for months. That meant she now had no health insurance—what could have been a death sentence, as the costs of treatment could easily bankrupt someone if they could not afford a private insurance plan that covered kidney disease. Thankfully my employer was able to add her to my plan quickly.

There was also the challenge of having to apply for Social Security Disability—a process so painful, so soul draining, so time consuming that it is hard for me to fathom how anyone can successfully navigate the process, especially if you’re sick. Despite countless forms that needed to be filled out repeatedly—with Jennifer’s hands so swollen at times it proved nearly impossible—hours and hours on the phone with lawyers and being sent for medical evaluations for the wrong things, Jennifer fought hard to get the assistance she needed. To this day, after one year of waiting and two denials in what should be a cut and dry case, Jennifer will now have to fight the federal government in court for the help she deserves. If we were not married and Jen needed Social Security and Medicare for survival she would already be dead.

Watching Jennifer go through all of this, knowing I could do almost nothing to help, took its toll on me as well.

This is where I started to break—and where our marriage was tested. How does one emotionally make peace with the fact that they are potentially watching their wife die?

At first, I became very quiet, withdrawn from the world. I then became very angry, feeling like we were robbed of the life we planned. Jennifer and I started to fight about anything—everything—as we did not know how to interact anymore. We did not know how to live in a world where she might not be part of it for much longer. And that scared me to my core.

Thankfully, our marriage would hold through this tough time—and get even stronger. We sat down one day and faced our fears together. Through hours of tough talk, laughter, heartache and sobbing, we admitted our greatest fear: not wanting to lose each other. We made a deal, right then and there: that no matter what, we would not take out our fears out on one another. That we would fight this no matter what, hand and hand, side by side, to the end—no matter where that brought us.

And then a small miracle happened. We made the decision to move out of the hustle and bustle of Washington, D.C. to the quiet suburbs of Rockville, 20 miles north. There, Jennifer and I spent the summer of 2016 laughing, swimming and learning to live with our fears—and we made a sort of peace with them. Once we let go of worrying about what we could not control, Jennifer starting getting some good news: the amount of poisons in her blood started to decrease. Month after month the functioning of her kidneys were improving ever-so-slightly. Her energy started to improve and her appearance started to return to normal, as the doctor started weaning her off the steroids.

Today, Jennifer is a as close to ‘normal’ as she will likely ever be. We know her battle with kidney disease will be one she wages for the rest of her days, but she has begun to reclaim the life she knew, piece by piece. She won’t ever be able to work again, as the daily stresses of any sort of employment could push her kidneys back toward failure. Her energy level can change hour by hour, many days she simply can’t leave the house.

But most importantly and positively, her spirit held strong and never broke. We moved back to Washington, D.C. in July, as she felt she needed to be close to the nation’s capital. She is back to being the happy, uplifting and inspirational person I love more than anything—someone who helped me in my darkest hours. In some small part, I was able to do the same for her.

We know the road in this struggle will be long and challenging, with many ups and downs along the way, but I know we can face it together, whatever comes. And for that, we are most grateful.",The doctor told my wife she had six weeks to live -- two years ago,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/09/22/doctor-told-my-wife-had-six-weeks-to-live-two-years-ago.html

The team, owner Bill Foley’s charity and the NHL recently announced a $300,000 joint donation to support victims of the massacre. Fans were also encouraged to donate to the fund through the Vegas Golden Knights Foundation.

NHL teams and players will also honor victims of the shooting through the opening week of the season.

Engelland told the Las Vegas Sun he hopes the team’s first game in franchise history will offer a temporary distraction, if only for a few hours.

“A big part is just turning your mind off a little bit,” Engelland said. “You come to a sporting event, and you’re not sitting around talking about it. You’re enjoying the experience of the game and the atmosphere of the arena.”

“I don’t know that these events would have inevitably happened whether or not he got elected, but he has rhetorical powers every president has to encourage or to discourage,” she said of the Las Vegas shooting. “So far all he’s done is to encourage violence.”

Fifty-eight people were killed about 500 were injured in the attack when Stephen Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino at attendees of a country music concert.

Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task.
The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving.
It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving.
Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.","The infotainment technology that automakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, an AAA study says.

The study released Thursday is the latest by University of Utah professor David Strayer, who has been examining the impact of infotainment systems on safety for AAA's Foundation for Traffic Safety since 2013. Past studies also identified problems, but Strayer said the ""explosion of technology"" has made things worse.

Automakers now include more options to allow drivers to use social media, email and text. The technology is also becoming more complicated to use. Cars used to have a few buttons and knobs. Some vehicles now have as many as 50 buttons on the steering wheel and dashboard that are multi-functional. There are touch screens, voice commands, writing pads, heads-up displays on windshields and mirrors and 3-D computer-generated images.

""It's adding more and more layers of complexity and information at drivers' fingertips without often considering whether it's a good idea to put it at their fingertips,"" Strayer said. That complexity increases the overall amount of time drivers spend trying to use the systems.

The auto industry says the new systems are better alternatives for drivers than mobile phones and navigation devices that were not designed to be used while driving.

The vehicle-integrated systems ""are designed to be used in the driving environment and require driver attention that is comparable to tuning the radio or adjusting climate controls, which have always been considered baseline acceptable behaviors while driving,"" said Wade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.

But Jake Nelson, AAA's director for traffic safety advocacy and research, said drivers took their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel while using infotainment systems in each of the 30 cars and light trucks, all 2017 models, that were tested in the study. The drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.

Clearly automakers haven't worked hard enough to make the systems quick and easy to use, Nelson said. Researchers rated 23 of the 30 vehicles ""very high"" or ""high"" in terms of the attention they demanded from drivers. Seven were rated ""moderate."" None required a low amount of attention to use.

Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task. At 25 mph (40 kph), a car can travel the length of four football fields during the time it takes to enter a destination. Previous research has shown that drivers who remove their eyes from the road for just two seconds double their risk for a crash.

Under pressure from the industry, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2012 issued voluntary safety guidelines to automakers for dashboard technology instead of enforceable safety standards. The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving. However, the ability to program navigation while driving was available in 12 vehicles in the study.

The guidelines also recommend automakers prevent drivers from texting while driving, but three-quarters of the vehicles tested permit drivers to text while the car is moving. Texting was the second-most distracting task performed by test drivers.

Drivers looked away from the road less when using voice commands, but that safety benefit was offset by the increased amount of time drivers spent interacting with the systems.

AAA said drivers should use infotainment technologies ""only for legitimate emergencies or urgent, driving-related purposes."" It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving. Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.

Nearly 70 percent of U.S. adults say they want the new technologies in their vehicles, but only 24 percent feel that the technology already works perfectly, according to an opinion survey conducted for AAA.

""Drivers want technology that is safe and easy to use,"" said Marshall Doney, AAA's president and CEO, ""but many of the features added to infotainment systems today have resulted in overly complex and sometimes frustrating user experiences for drivers.""",Technology crammed into cars worsens driver distraction,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/06/technology-crammed-into-cars-worsens-driver-distraction.html

They need to know that God is at work even during a time of tragedy.
So, let’s remind the world that even—and especially—when it seems like the world is falling apart, Christ is present with us.","On Sunday night a shooter rained gunfire on 22,000 music fans along the Las Vegas Strip. The gunman, Stephen Paddock, fired from the 32nd floor of a Mandalay Bay Resort hotel, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500 others. Paddock’s motives are unknown.

In the face of horrors like this, we want refuge, comfort, answers, solutions. We want to know who the shooter is and why he did it. We want to know where God is in the midst of such evil. We want to know what we could have done to stop this evil act.

Most importantly, we want to know what we should do in response. Let me suggest five things we can do as we are processing this tragedy.

First, we should weep with those who weep. When Jesus stood by Lazarus’ grave with Mary and Martha, he wept. He mourned the loss of Lazarus’ life and expressed sympathy for his loved ones. Similarly, we should mourn. We should express genuine love and concern, opening ourselves up to experience some of the sadness and grief experienced by the victims and their families.

Sit with people. Cry with them. Express sympathy for them. Take a moment to reflect on the horror of sin. Say to the person next to you, “I don’t know why this happened, but God is present with us even when we can’t see him, even in the midst of a tragedy like this. And we are promised that he will return one day to make things right, to rid the world of sin and its consequences.”

During a time like this, people need to know that life is not a meaningless chaos. They need to know that God is at work even during a time of tragedy. In other words, they need us to be Christians...

Second, pray for the victims, for civic leaders and for Las Vegas churches. Several times this year, social media flash mobs mocked evangelicals for saying we would pray in the aftermath shootings or other harrowing events. In their view, our tweets about prayer were simply a means of circumventing difficult issues instead of acting upon them. The Las Vegas shootings are no exception, with the #ThoughtsAndPrayers hashtag trending in a negative way after the shootings.

For our part, however, we’d turn the criticism around and say that prayer is a more powerful form of activism than social media flash mobbing. Our obedience to the biblical command to pray for our society is more important than the sum total of our Tweets or opinion pieces. So, as Ed Stetzer wrote this week, let’s determine to pray for the civic leaders, churches, and charities who are serving victims, family members, and communities in the aftermath of this horror.

Third, reject the speculations of self-appointed prophets. Often our neighbors and Facebook friends will reach out to us during moments like this, looking for a theological explanation or wanting to justify God’s goodness in light of such a horror. But the Bible doesn’t give easy or neat answers, so we shouldn’t either. We don’t know why God intervenes to stop some tragedies but doesn’t intervene in others. For that matter, we don’t know whether or not he intervened in this particular tragedy. What we do know is that God doesn’t sin but people do. Let’s stick to what we know.

We should be especially careful to dismiss the speculations of self-appointed prophets. It never fails that, after a terror act or natural disaster, some Christian leader will claim that the event is God’s judgment on a particular individual or nation or political faction. Yet, as Russell Moore wrote yesterday, “Jesus told us specifically not to do this, after his disciples asked whether a man’s blindness was the result of his or his parents’ sin. Jesus said no to both (Jn. 9:1-12). Those self-appointed prophets who would blame the victims for what befalls them are just that, self-appointed. We should listen to Jesus and to his apostles, not to them.”

Fourth, don’t try to score political points. Inevitably in the aftermath of terror incidents, political partisans try to score points. Let’s resist the temptation to join them in capitalizing on the tragedy. The time will come for debates about gun control and gun rights. But the week of the tragedy is not that time. So, during this time of mourning, let’s refuse to take cheap shots at people on the other side of the aisle whose policy views you think are harmful or foolish.

Fifth, point people to the day when Christ will return to make things right. During a time like this, people need to know that life is not a meaningless chaos. They need to know that God is at work even during a time of tragedy. In other words, they need us to be Christians, to be people who remind the world that God has promised to return one day to make things right.

As He told his disciples immediately after having been beaten, stabbed, and crucified, “I am with you always, even to the end of the age” (Mt. 28:20).

So, let’s remind the world that even—and especially—when it seems like the world is falling apart, Christ is present with us. And not only is he with us now, but he will be with us in the future when he returns to rid the world of tragedy once and for all.","Christians, here are five ways to respond to the Las Vegas shootings",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/06/christians-here-are-five-ways-to-respond-to-las-vegas-shootings.html

“That’s like him. He’s just someone who cares about a lot of people. He has all their feelings at heart,” Rheta Engle said. “It would make any parent, grandparent very, very proud of him.”

A friend of Robert’s added that his friend is a “great guy. Just one of the kindest human beings you’ll ever meet.”

The “hack,” demonstrated by food blogger Bev Weidner, is for peanut butter “slices” and it involves smooth peanut butter, parchment paper and a freezer – and a lot of confusion.

GLADWARE'S CONTAINER LIDS ARE BLOWING PEOPLE'S MINDS

For her tutorial, Weidner first takes a jar of peanut butter and spreads “globbies” onto a sheet of parchment paper with a wooden spoon. She then smooths out a hefty offering of the nutty spread before folding the parchment paper over the top of the butter and rolling it out a couple of times with a rolling pin. From there, she places the peanut butter in the freezer.

In the Facebook video, which had 8.6 million views as of Sunday, Weidner says the frozen peanut butter can be cut into slices and then placed on the bread easily.

“It comes to room temperature semi-quickly, but you have time to drizzle it with maybe some honey on top, some chocolate sprinkles. Kid's love it,” Weidner says.

This method, Weidner explains, prevents mess and “torn bread” from spreading the peanut butter right out of the jar.

Facebook is less convinced.

The video has received over 11,000 comments with most of them questioning the need to add steps in making a peanut butter sandwich.

“Because nothing is easier than spreading peanut butter on waxed paper, rolling it flat with a rolling pin, freezing it overnight, then cutting the frozen sheets of peanut butter into bread sized squares and using them to make your honey and peanut butter sandwiches.....” a user commented.

Another said, “I cant(sic) be the only one that doesn't have an issue spreading peanut butter.”

A few joked about the length freezing the peanut butter would take.

“The time it took to spread it on wax paper, smooth it with a rolling pin, freeze it and then cut it with scissors, I could have made you 308 peanut butter sandwiches.”

“Child-‘Mama? Can I have a peanut butter sandwich please?’

Mom-‘Sure honey, give me a few hours though. I have to FREEZE THE PEANUT BUTTER.’”

The residential facility, which opened its doors this fall semester, chose lemurs as its mascot, as the name of the animal is a play on the name the building is named after (Pau-LI-MUR-ray), Yale Alumni magazine reported.

""Welcome PauliMurs!"" reads a message on the website of the residential college, which has a ""coat of arms"" showcasing Murray's ""own sometimes transgressive gender expression.""

Murray, a Yale alumna, is heralded by the school for her work on civil rights and the advancement of women. She became the first African American to receive a J.S.D. from the Yale Law School in 1965 and was a co-founder of the National Organization for Women.

“Pauli Murray represents the best of Yale: a pre-eminent intellectual inspired to lead and prepared to serve her community and her country,” Yale President Peter Salovey said in April 2016.

According to the school, Murray also helped organize the March on Washington with Martin Luther King, Jr. and was appointed by former President John F. Kennedy to the Committee on Civil and Political Rights of the President’s Commission on the Status of Women.

The college’s coat of arms features three pierced, eight-pointed “mullets” that signify Murray’s work to “spur” changes on issues such as race relations, women’s rights and gender identities, according to its website.

“The blue and white circle is conceptually derived from a mark that consistently appeared on Murray’s stationery. The counterchanging of its form reflects her transformational activism as well as her own sometimes transgressive gender expression. The red, white, and blue color scheme references the flag of the United States of America—recognizing that this nation has been profoundly changed by Murray’s vision and actions,” the website adds.","New Yale college celebrates 'transgressive gender expression', calls its students 'lemurs'",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/25/new-yale-college-celebrates-transgressive-gender-expression-calls-its-students-lemurs.html

Upon seeing this, Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossello‏ tweeted back at Musk, writing ""Let's talk."" Musk responded, saying he would be happy to talk and is hopeful Tesla can help.

According to several media reports, 95 percent of the U.S. territory is still without power after the category 4 hurricane battered the island weeks ago. Some estimates have said that a full restoration of power may not return to Puerto Rico for as long as six months.

Tesla has not responded to a request for comment from Fox News.

Big opportunity for Tesla

In addition to selling electric cars, including the recently introduced Model 3, Tesla has an energy storage business, selling battery packs to commercial utilities, as well as home residences. It also has a solar panel business, after it acquired Solar City, co-founded by Musk's cousin Lyndon Rive, for $2.6 billion in November 2016.

Tesla has powered such smaller islands as Kauai in Hawaii and Ta'u in American Samoa, according to the company's website. The populations of those islands is far less than the 3.4 million people living in Puerto Rico.

James Murdoch, the CEO of 21st Century Fox, parent of Fox News, is a member of Tesla's board of directors.

Tesla has already sent a number of its battery packs to Puerto Rico to help the island store energy in an effort to offset the shortage. Musk has also personally donated $250,000 in an effort to rebuild the island.

Other case studies

The conversation between Rossello and Musk is similar to one that took place several months ago, between Musk and billionaire entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes, who asked if Musk was serious about ending South Australia's rolling blackouts.

Musk responded by saying the company could do it in 100 days from the time the contract was signed or it would be free.

It has since won a contract to help fix the issues in South Australia.

As I watched the news coverage in the hours after the carnage in Las Vegas, I couldn’t peel my eyes from the television.
Those in Las Vegas were exhibiting a new kind of protest, the kind everybody watching was uniting around: a protest against death, terrorism, evil and division.","Ironically, I was in bed last Sunday night reading a book about the challenges of America, when my 18-year-old daughter pushed open my bedroom door and blurted: “Have you heard what’s happening in Vegas? There’s a man with a machine gun who’s killing people at a concert!”

As I rushed to put on some clothes I caught myself whispering, “No, no, not another tragedy.”

I ran downstairs and flipped on the TV, where coverage had started only moments earlier. The first thing I saw was a reporter stopping wandering people and asking what they saw. Their zombie-like responses showed they were still in shock.

One shirtless guy in a cowboy hat had been splashed with blood, which prompted the reporter to ask if he had been injured. Unaware of the crimson stains, he semi-stuttered that the blood wasn’t his own but came from a victim he had helped to carry to safety.

Another guy who looked to be in his mid-20s, when asked where his shirt was, stumbled and stammered out the reply that he took off his shirt to cover the faces of the dead.

Neither seemed to comprehend nor consider the paradox: the worst of men and the best of men … utter grace amidst utter evil. I glanced at my daughter who just sat there clutching a pillow to her chest and cried.

Our nation has been repeatedly ravaged by numerous shootings of individuals, police officers and mass groups of people. On top of that, we are plagued with natural disasters, racial division, political upheaval and even nuclear missile threats from abroad.

We are a nation filled with unrest, a people who have been saturated by every tragedy as it has been plastered across our televisions, newspapers, internet and social media. We grieve for those brothers and sisters who suffer, we are repulsed and sickened by the depraved perpetrators, and we are inspired by the gallant saviors who courageously disregard their own safety at the expense of complete strangers.

Lights shine brightest on the darkest of nights and unknown heroes arise in the days of adversity.

Television networks have given airtime to those champions who scampered through gunfire in Las Vegas to help, just as they did to those who waded through floods and storm damage recently in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. But we long for more; we desire to be quenched from their personal wells that drip with honor and valor.

In those heroes who willingly trod at death’s door, we see what is good in America and a portrait of who we can and should be. It’s why, now more than ever, we need less blame, politicizing and villains. We need more exposure to the common people who epitomize courage in the midst of cowardice – those who give us hope when all hope seems to be lost.

As I watched the news coverage in the hours after the carnage in Las Vegas, I couldn’t peel my eyes from the television. By the time my TV screen went dark after 4 a.m., the details were slim but there was less focus on the murderer and more on his victims.

Those in Las Vegas were exhibiting a new kind of protest, the kind everybody watching was uniting around: a protest against death, terrorism, evil and division. They were physically, verbally and morally objecting to the mayhem that sought to instill fear, hate and darkness. Their resistance converted into shielding others from bullets, calming the wounded as they were in the throes of death and carrying victims to safety.

And let’s never forget our brave law enforcement officers – the lately vilified men and women in blue who didn’t hesitate or vacillate when called upon to apprehend a demonic madman who was mowing down the innocent.

The book of John in the Bible states that there is a type of love that is greater than any other: it is the kind that embraces death so that others might have life. It is the rare, unconventional love that is dispensed independent of merit, worth or obligation but is gifted willingly because it comes from the purest of place … self-sacrifice.

This example has been written about for over 2,000 years and contains our greatest hope and purpose for eternal peace, purpose and brotherhood.","Las Vegas shooting: America, we've witnessed a new kind of protest -- against death, terror and hate",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/demonic-las-vegas-killer-brings-out-grace-and-heroism-in-others.html

Judge Sheelagh Canavan called the teacher “bright, intelligent and gifted” and “knew right from wrong,” but that “she had committed the grossest breach of trust.”

“You engaged in a full-blown sexual relationship with a 15-year-old child. I accept he was consenting – what 15 year-old schoolboy would turn down such an attractive offer?” the judge said.

""I accept you truly believed this was a great romance, you were in love with him and vice versa, and that age didn't matter. But it did. You were supposed to keep him safe, to help him make the right decisions,” the judge said.

""Instead, you helped him make all the wrong ones,"" she concluded.

Emma Shafton, who defended McBrearty, said she has had “a spectacular fall from grace.”

""This is a young lady who has had a spectacular fall from grace - university educated, comes from a respectable family - she has been utterly disgraced by this,” Shafton said.

Shafton argued the woman “was not sexually attracted to children.”

The Obamas have been looking at 10 Gracie Square on the Upper East Side, situated between East End Avenue and East River Drive and near the mayor’s residence, Gracie Mansion, according to sources who have seen the couple arriving at the building for viewings.

Built in 1930, the white-glove, full-service, pre-war building has 15 floors and 43 apartments. Other notables who have lived there include Gloria Vanderbilt, conductor André Kostelanetz and New Yorker critic Alexander Woollcott.

Plus there’s a gym and an indoor basketball court, which would appeal to the fitness-loving ex-president and first lady. Most importantly, the building has strong security, including an underground drive-in garage, from which they could directly access their apartment without stepping outside.

A duplex apartment at 10 Gracie Square went into contract last week for $10 million, and real estate insiders are speculating that could be the Obamas’ new NYC pad, although this could not be confirmed at press time.

The apartment was designed by architect Daniel Romualdez and features five bedrooms, four baths, a library with a wood-burning fireplace, and views of the East River.

The Obamas could easily afford it, given reports that the bidding to the rights for their joint book deal had skyrocketed to a record $60 million earlier this year. Barack now commands a reported $400,000 for a speaking engagement, while Michelle, also a Harvard-trained lawyer, has taken a much more outspoken role at appearances and in the media.

The couple purchased a nine-bedroom, 8,200-square-foot, Tudor-style mansion in the Washington, DC, neighborhood of Kalorama for $8.1 million earlier this year. A spokeswoman for the Obama family declined to comment.

Waste pullouts are a secret weapon of the well-oiled kitchen machine. They do the dirty job of handling your garbage, recycling and more. In fact, among surveyed homeowners who are remodeling a kitchen and upgrading cabinets, the No. 1 storage addition is a pullout waste or recycling cabinet, according to the latest Houzz kitchen trends study. But what makes them better than a regular garbage can? Actually, a pullout bin can have quite a few advantages, both in style and function. Here are some reasons why a humble pullout cabinet for waste deserves a little consideration and a space in your kitchen.

Out of sight, out of mind. When you think about your dream kitchen, what do you imagine? I’ll bet the garbage bin is not the first thing that comes to mind. But then, this is the whole point of a waste pullout: It tucks the garbage, recycling and other waste bins out of sight but within easy access. That way you don’t have to look at a messy freestanding bin or struggle with a tiny, seemingly always full can tucked under the sink.

RELATED: Do You Dream of a White Kitchen? Find Inspiration Here

Seamless integration. Because a waste pullout is essentially just a very deep drawer, it can easily be integrated into the look of your cabinetry, bringing some great contemporary functionality to very traditional or transitional style.

In fact, it’s quite common for a pullout drawer to be faced out with multiple false fronts to help it blend more seamlessly into a cabinet scheme.

RELATED: Pick Out the Perfect Drawer Pulls

Ease of use. If you cook often, one of the trickiest and yet most common tasks is sweeping away the remnants from chopping. You can carefully carry a chopping board to the bin, or you can bring the bin to the chopping board. Locating your garbage or compost pullout below a chopping zone means you can sweep waste directly into the bin with ease.

Here’s another smart take on this idea: a pullout chopping block (in place of a typical drawer) positioned above a waste pullout, with a simple hole to allow for trimmings to be swept directly into the bin. A great option for small kitchens, as the whole chopping station can be closed away when not in use, and the main counter can still be used for other things.

Waste sorting. Pullout cabinets aren’t just useful for holding your garbage bins. More and more cities today not only facilitate recycling or composting, they also require some level of waste sorting, and this requires managing multiple bins.

Depending on the system you use, you can easily have space for two sizable bins, or many smaller ones, configured with one tucked behind the other in a full-depth cabinet, or side by side, or many other configurations to suit your typical needs.

Odor control. One major concern that people often have with waste bins is the odors that can linger in the kitchen. There are several possible ways to combat this issue, and one is by using compartments with individual lids for organic waste.

Some waste pullout systems even integrate a special bin with a securely sealing lid specifically to hold compost, so you don’t have to change it with excessive frequency just to keep odors in check. Keep in mind how quickly it will fill; you’ll want to plan ahead so that organic waste isn’t left sitting exposed to air for too long.

Another option is to put different types of waste into their own cabinets with appropriately sized bins so that you only have to open the relevant compartment at any particular time. You can devote more space for plastics and less for compost, or vice versa, depending on your needs.

All-in-one storage. If you want to make sure nobody has an excuse for not changing the bin when it’s full, try a drawer that includes a small storage drawer inside, and you can keep garbage bags and related products right by the bins themselves.

You can also use interior drawers to split compartments into smaller subcompartments or to keep cleaning products or deodorizers on hand.

RELATED: Kitchen Storage to Fit All of Your Needs

Griffin filed her own restraining order against Mezger two weeks ago after the comedian and her neighbor got into an altercation. Griffin’s boyfriend, Randy Bick, called in a noise complaint on Mezger.

Mezger claimed Griffin and Bick have been recording and filming conversations he has had on his property for more than a year, the restraining order filing stated.

“Ms. Griffin (and/or cohabitant Randy Bick) has admitted to making audio (and video) recordings of private conversations on my property over the past 15 months. In addition, Griffin (and/or Bick) have aimed an outdoor video-recording device at areas including a Jacuzzi where my young grandchildren sometimes play,” he says along with a photo of the specific outdoor camera,” the order stated.

“We have also been forced to keep the windows that face the Griffin-Bick residence closed with the blinds drawn at all times, to reduce the chance of becoming the unwilling subject of further illegal recordings,” Mezger claimed in the order.

The file concluded: “Ms. Griffin and Mr. Bick have completely deprived my family and me of the use of our yard, and have essentially rendered living in our home intolerable.”

Last month, Bick reportedly called in a noise complaint on Mezger after hours of excessive partying on the CEO’s property.

Mezger fired back reportedly shouted homophobic expletives at Griffin and Bick, calling her a, “c—t,” “d—e,” mocking her shaved had and bringing up her severed head photo controversy.

The controversy he was referring to was when Griffin came under fire for a photo of her with a fake severed head of President Trump.

Griffin shaved her head out of solidarity for her sister Joyce Griffin, who died of an undisclosed form of cancer on Sept. 14.

Following Mezger’s alleged verbal tirade against Griffin, KB Home took 25 percent out of the CEO’s annual bonus.","Kathy Griffin's neighbor files for restraining order, claims comedian spies on him",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/07/kathy-griffins-neighbor-files-for-restraining-order-claims-comedian-spies-on-him.html

A Russian mechanics expert has restored a Soviet-era military vehicle that moves without the use of wheels or tracks - but is entirely screw-propelled.

Originally built in the 1970s, the vehicle uses giant metal screws which move it forward by twisting across the ground.

Formerly used by the Russian military, the truck was purchased by Alexei Anikin, who is the Director at JSC Plant of All-terrain Vehicles.

His team restored the motor back to working order, recently testing it swampland near the Nizhniy Novgorod Region in Russia.

Alexei Anikin said: “We’re proud that we’re the first in the country who started producing this vehicles after a roughly 30-year break, because, starting from the 1970s such automobiles hadn’t been produced in our country.”

The unique truck can move across most difficult terrains, including water, swampland and snow.

Fitted with a 159bhp engine, it is capable of carrying diggers, cranes and rescue equipment to areas that were previously inaccessible by land.

Umar Vakhidov, Deputy Head of the Construction at Novgorod State Technical University said: “We think, that it will be actively used, at first, by the army, at second, by geologists, by oil and gas producers.

""We got used to solid surfaces, but regions of Siberia and the Far North mostly have creeping soil. This car is vital for oil and gas producers.”

Screw-propelled machines were first used by the military during the Second World War, after a German soldier came up with a design for a snow machine using the mechanism.

The USA used similar vehicles to transport supplies across swamp lands during the Vietnam War, but they have remained largely disused since the mid-1970s.

Did Paddock have any brain abnormalities or life-threatening illness that caused him to become a mass murderer and commit suicide?

An autopsy found that mass murderer Charles Whitman, who killed his wife and mother and then shot and killed 14 people at the University of Texas in 1966 before police killed him, had a malignant brain tumor. Whitman, who used a rifle to shoot at random from observation deck of the 27-story university clock tower, also wounded 31 people.

In a note written the day before he killed his victims, Whitman discussed his hatred for his family and plans to kill them, adding: “After my death, I wish an autopsy on me to be performed to see if there’s any mental disorders.”

In addition to examining Paddock’s brain, an autopsy on his body will show if he had the scars of a prior suicide attempt. What clues can be found for why decided to use the guns he loved to end his life and the lives of so many others?

Toxicological analysis will show whether there were any illegal or prescription drugs in Paddock’s blood when he died. Analysis of his hair will show what drugs he had taken during the weeks or months before he died.

For the Las Vegas Coroner’s Office, the task of investigating so many deaths at once in a high-profile national tragedy is an enormous one.

Based on my over 50 years of experience examining more than 20,000 bodies to determine the cause of death and investigating many mass disasters – hurricanes, fires, airplane crashes and more – its clear that the Coroner’s Office right now must be a place of organized chaos.

Families want the bodies of their loved ones to be immediately released, while the bodies are still being studied by teams of pathologists, police, FBI agents, dentists and radiologists. The investigators are trying to reconstruct what happened and whether there are any clues as how to prevent future such deaths.

Here is an explanation of the work facing the Las Vegas Coroner’s Office:

First, the Coroner’s Office has the responsibility to properly identify each person who died and then to determine the cause of each death. Did everyone die from bullet wounds? Or did anyone die of a heart attack, a fall or from being trampled?

Then pathologists must remove bullets from the bodies of the shooting victims for ballistics examination. This is necessary to determine if there is a bullet taken from one of the deceased that does not match the weapons at the scene. That would indicate it had come from a second shooter.

Also, the coroner must confirm after an autopsy that Paddock did in fact shoot himself.

There are also certain procedures that coroners or medical examiners must employ in all mass disasters where many lives are tragically lost.

The Clark County coroner had to make sure there was enough cold storage space at his office to prevent decomposition of bodies and would have obtained additional refrigeration trucks if necessary.

The coroner also had to make sure that there are sufficient personnel available to professionally respond to all families making inquiries, whether in person, by telephone or email. In addition, the coroner needs staff to obtain descriptive information from family members regarding tattoos, birthmarks, scars and medical and dental information of those who died.

Family members may also be asked to provide photographs or DNA, if necessary.

Each body will be photographed and fingerprinted and may be X-rayed and autopsied as necessary. Examination of clothing, jewelry, rings and watches may assist in identification and will be returned to the families.

The Coroner’s Office must work closely with families to assure them that the bodies of their loved ones will be released as soon as they are definitely identified. Identification documents that may be with each body may have to be confirmed by direct visualization or photographs.

Sadly, we can’t turn back the clock on this mass murder. The nation mourns the senseless loss of life. All we can do is investigate each death to help us better understand this tragedy and perhaps get some idea of what led Paddock to commit such a terrible crime.",Autopsy of Las Vegas gunman's body may provide clues about the mystery of why he became a mass murderer,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/autopsy-las-vegas-gunmans-body-may-provide-clues-about-mystery-why-became-mass-murderer.html

Gun owners see this, and instead of encouraging dialogue across the divide, it simply stiffens their will to resist.

Gun owners are not evil.","Gun control is the hot topic of the day, and as usual it’s devolved into entrenched positions where many people supporting the Second Amendment will not give an inch, no matter the proposal. Why is that?

Do people who own firearms really believe that everyone should have the right to legally modify an AR platform so that it nearly duplicates the cyclic rate of a military assault weapon?

I had this conversation recently with a friend of mine, a former special operations soldier, who now makes a living providing firearms instruction to police SWAT units. As for me, I own two AR platforms, several pistols, shotguns and other rifles. I’m also a former special operations soldier, a member of the National Rifle Association, and support and defend the Second Amendment. We both agreed that bump stocks should be illegal.

Previously, bump stocks were simply toys that allowed recreational shooters to pretend they were firing an automatic weapon on the range. Because of the bump stock’s firing system, it isn’t inherently accurate, and the wasting of ammo using it relegated it to a gimmick. That was before the massacre in Las Vegas.

Bump stocks are no longer a gimmick. Accuracy became irrelevant when the target set was a crowd of 22,000 concert-goers in an open field in Las Vegas, where 58 people were shot dead and nearly 500 were hospitalized when a gunman opened fire last Sunday in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Fully automatic weapons are currently prohibited without an enormous expenditure of time, effort and money. Any mechanical device that is designed to enhance the cyclic rate of fire of a semiautomatic weapon to duplicate that capability should be illegal – and should include devices separate from the bump stock, such as hand cranks.

I imagine the majority of gun owners would feel the same way, although I’m sure I’ll get hate mail from some.

After some vacillating from members of Congress about studies and research, the NRA finally issued a statement Thursday that called on the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives “to immediately review whether these devices (bump stocks) comply with federal laws.” The statement added: “The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.”

Why did the NRA and staunch Second Amendment defenders in Congress not immediately call for making bump stocks illegal after the deadly rampage in Las Vegas Sunday? Why the equivocating when the issue is pretty clear-cut?

The answer is that gun owners see the fight in zero-sum terms, believing that the other side doesn’t care about preventing another Las Vegas, but instead wants to attack firearms ownership however it can. There is no faith in the intentions of gun control advocates, and for good reason.

The blood hadn’t even dried in the streets of Las Vegas before the de facto leader of the left, Hillary Clinton, tweeted about a suppressor bill currently in Congress. Immediately, the Twittersphere took up the charge, proclaiming that if the killer had used a “silencer,” the death toll would have been exponentially worse.

This is absolute hogwash, as everyone who has a modicum of knowledge about guns knows. To us, it’s a window into the true agenda. Hollywood would have you believe that a suppressor renders the bullet whisper quiet. That is simply untrue.

The shooter was four football fields away from his victims, and the sound everyone hears on the videos is not the explosion of the gunpowder, it’s the noise of the bullets breaking the sound barrier, something the suppressor does nothing to muffle.

In fact, the average suppressor simply lowers the gunfire to hearing-safe levels, but it’s certainly still loud (full disclosure: one of my AR rifles is suppressed). The fact is that suppressors would not have increased the death toll in Las Vegas, and Clinton knows it or should know it – even if her minions do not.

And yet Clinton used the tragedy of Las Vegas to further her agenda of attacking anything pertaining to firearms instead of working toward a solution to prevent a future mass casualty event. Gun owners see this, and instead of encouraging dialogue across the divide, it simply stiffens their will to resist.

Make no mistake, among ourselves gun owners are the first to decry the heinous use of a firearm. But when faced with the clearly partisan and cynical use of every event to further an overarching agenda, we close ranks reflexively – even over something as simple as the bump stock.

Gun owners are not evil. But we do fear the hidden machinations of the people espousing “common sense solutions” – especially when the proposal in question is anything but. If we as a nation truly want to work together to prevent tragedies like Las Vegas, the first requirement is trust in the good faith of the other side, and as Clinton just illustrated, that trust isn’t there.","Gun owners are not evil, but their opponents want to attack firearms ownership however they can",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/gun-owners-are-not-evil-but-their-opponents-want-to-attack-firearms-ownership-however-can.html

An old rule of thumb holds that when someone says it’s not about the money, it’s really about the money.

But there are exceptions to almost every rule. The National Rifle Association is a case in point.

In the wake of the horror in Las Vegas this week, countless politicians, journalists and commentators are insisting that the National Rifle Association has a “stranglehold” on the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton claimed that the GOP-controlled Congress simply does “whatever they are told to do” by the NRA and the gun lobby.

The Washington Post and New York Times laid out splashy reports chronicling how much money the NRA has given to Republican congressmen. “Since 1998, the National Rifle Association has donated $3,533,294 to current members of Congress,” the Post reported in 2016.

The New York Times listed total NRA donations to certain GOP politicians alongside their statements offering condolences and prayers for the victims in Las Vegas. And the op-ed pages have been suffused with claims that the NRA has bought Republicans with blood money, stifling the popular will and thwarting democracy in the process.

During my years of painting people’s homes, I’ve learned that small spaces don’t have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home’s exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

RELATED: What Color Works Best in a Traditional-Style Bathroom?

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I’ve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home’s overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home’s design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn’t too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it’s between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room’s features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

8. Laundry room. You can’t avoid the task of laundry, so at least make it a room that is easy on the eyes and generates positivity. Think of a paint color you would never dream of using in the social areas of your home but would make you happy, such as a playful orange, a bold purple or a sunshine yellow. Who knows, being around your favorite color might even make the chore a little more enjoyable.",Transform a whole house by painting these 8 small spaces,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/22/transform-whole-house-by-painting-these-8-small-spaces.html

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

""I said 'How do you know I'm not an asthma patient, how do you know that,'"" Beacham said.
""And he said, 'I just know, that is not an asthma cough.'""
Kamean said if you have an unexplained cough, see a lung doctor and an ear, nose and throat specialist first.
""There is still a debate in our field as to how much reflux really causes cough and sinus issues,"" Kamean said.","At 72, Jane Beacham loves to travel, and she's serious about it.

""The kind of traveling I like to do is to hop off the airplane with the plugs still in my ears and hit the ground moving,"" Beacham said.

But more than a decade ago, Beacham began coughing and clearing her throat, constantly.

""It was embarrassing,"" she said.

A lung doctor listened to her symptoms and diagnosed her with asthma, prescribing a series of medications.

""I bet I went through 7 or 8 different types of inhalers,"" Beacham remembered.

But nothing helped; the cough continued.

""I was just getting out of breath, getting out of the air,” she said.

Desperate, Beacham went online and found DeKalb gastroenterologist Dr. Jeffrie Kamean and his partners, who immediately suspected Beacham's problem wasn't asthma.

""I said 'How do you know I'm not an asthma patient, how do you know that,'"" Beacham said. ""And he said, 'I just know, that is not an asthma cough.'""

After extensive testing, Beacham was diagnosed with ""silent reflux."" She didn't have heartburn.

But during sleep, acid would leak from her stomach, up through her esophagus, pooling in the back of her throat. Kamean said that caused the irritation triggering her cough.

""So the idea is that it's at night,"" Kamean said. ""It's real reflux, but it's 'silent' because you're 'sleeping.'""

Put on on an acid-reducing medication, Beacham stopped coughing.

""And when she came back in two months, she said it was a miracle,"" Kamean said. ""Her cough was gone, she was sleeping, she was ready to travel.""

Earlier this year, Beacham underwent the LINX procedure, to stop the reflux.

Kamean said if you have an unexplained cough, see a lung doctor and an ear, nose and throat specialist first. Then, if you're still coughing, find a gastroenterologist willing to look deeper.

""There is still a debate in our field as to how much reflux really causes cough and sinus issues,"" Kamean said. ""We are firm believers here at DeKalb that that is true. We've had a lot of successful surgeries here correcting reflux, and medication as well.""

These days, Beacham is traveling again.

""I just got back from France,"" she said. ""Had a great trip. Do it again in a minute. Waiting for the next one!""

Q: I have a bunch of old photos from my mother’s estate. What’s the easiest way to scan them?

A: Mounds of old photos are still gathered in shoeboxes, and if we don't digitize them soon, we risk losing those images. There are plenty of services that can scan the images for you professionally, and, of course, you can always photograph these pictures with your phone.

Converting VHS tapes

Q: My son is getting married, and I’d like to make a video using his childhood VHS tapes. Help! The wedding is in two months!

A: If you have a massive library of VHS tapes, you can buy a converter. But if you're looking to transfer a few tapes, the most cost-effective solution is to use a service. The process can be pricy; each DVD can hold up to two hours, so you want to make sure you're watching the length of your home movies.

A: This is such a vital question, and it’s likely to become even more pressing in the coming years.

Android Oreo vs. iOS 11

Q: How does the new Android operating system compare with Apple iOS 11? Are they just the same pig with different lipstick?

A: Wouldn't it be great if you could open two applications at the same time on your smartphone? Until now, this hasn't been very practical. But larger screens and increased reliance on our pocket-sized gadgets have made this kind of multitasking more attractive. For the most part, these two operating systems are very similar to each other, and each is very much in keeping with the traditions of its brand. But this new feature, known as “Picture-in-Picture,” is a pretty significant leap, and only one of these two operating systems has it. Can you guess which? Click here for a comparison of Android Oreo and iOS 11.

Buying used smartphones

Q: I’d like to save money and buy a used smartphone. I’m afraid of getting a bad phone. Any pointers?

A: You are wise to be cautious, and for two big reasons. First, there might be damage that isn’t obvious when you pick it up, or the software might not run as smoothly as you’d hoped. I have a friend who bought a used iPhone that worked great, except for a fuzzy camera lens that made it unusable for taking photos. Second, buying a used phone can be a security risk, especially if the vendor is crooked and has installed spyware. Certain phones are extremely susceptible to this, especially when they change hands. I recommend refurbished phones, which are usually less expensive and work great, but if you’re dead set on buying a secondhand phone, there are ways to avoid getting swindled.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that prosecutors ultimately expect Weber to serve about six months in jail.

Weber, a history teacher at Douglas S. Freeman in Henrico County, turned herself in on Aug. 1, two months after police were tipped off about the relationship.

Prosecutor Stacey Davenport said Weber met the student during the 2015-16 school year. That summer, Weber took the boy to her parents' home in Henrico, where they had sex. Davenport said the boy was 15 at the time of this first encounter.

Judge Margaret Deglau ordered that Weber not be allowed to contact the boy and criticized the teacher for what she called ""victimization.""

According to a statement released by the directors, the next steps for the Hollywood mogul's future with the company will depend on his therapeutic progress and the results of an internal investigation.

The statement was signed by four of six remaining board members.

The move comes after The New York Times reported Thursday that Weinstein has reached at least eight legal settlements with women over alleged harassment.

Weinstein's alleged inappropriate behavior with women in the last 30 years was detailed in the bombshell report. In it, actress Ashley Judd described being lured to Weinstein's hotel room, only to find him wearing a bathrobe and requesting sexual favors.

The report also detailed encounters Weinstein allegedly had with other women working for the Weinstein Company, as well as official settlements from people associated with him, including actress Rose McGowen, who was issued a $100,000 settlement that Weinstein specifically said was not an admission of guilt.

Following the report from The Times, Weinstein announced plans to sue the publication for $50 million. The producer said he would sue because he allegedly wasn't afforded the opportunity to ""respond appropriately"" to specific allegations.

“What I am saying is that I bear responsibility for my actions, but the reason I am suing is because of the Times’ inability to be honest with me, and their reckless reporting,” Weinstein told the New York Post. “They told me lies. They made assumptions.

“The Times editors were so fearful they were going to be scooped by New York Magazine and they would lose the story, that they went ahead and posted the story filled with reckless reporting, and without checking all they had with me and my team,” Weinstein continued.

The Times says it stands by its reporting.

Weinstein also spoke of wanting to ""respect women and do better.""

“I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different,” Weinstein told the Post. “I worked at a record company that, if you were five minutes late, they’d hit you with a baseball bat.

“In the past I used to compliment people, and some took it as me being sexual, I won’t do that again. I admit to a whole way of behavior that is not good. I can’t talk specifics, but I put myself in positions that were stupid, I want to respect women and do things better,” he said.

News of the leave of absence follows reports that Anita Dunn, a key aide to former President Barack Obama, ""counseled"" the Tinseltown titan following the report from The Times.

Dunn, the managing director of K-Street firm SKDKnickerbocker, released a statement acknowledging she spoke to Weinstein following the report but noted that the firm's ""commitment to defending women’s rights remains as strong as ever.""

The board of directors of The Weinstein Co. named attorney John Kiernan of the firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP as the head of the internal investigation.

It is essential for The Weinstein Co. to have a culture where women can work with respect and without fear of harassment or discrimination, the company statement said.

In making the announcement, Wallace said, “Harris, Dana and Sandra are rising stars and their combined background and expertise across news, business and politics will enable us to provide a more in-depth look at the major stories breaking out of Washington, and around the country. We are living in unprecedented times and this new lineup ensures our viewers will get the best news, information and analysis on the news of the hour across the nation and around the globe.”

Outnumbered Overtime originally debuted as a web show led by Faulkner following the TV version every day and her new program will seek to harness the popularity of that effort.

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

With her understanding of what makes news, how to respond to it and her unique political expertise, Perino will break it all down with insight from key Beltway experts.

Perino remarked, “Our new show will aim to take on the major issues facing Americans and explore them from all angles.

London's Metropolitan Police said the man has not been charged, and has been released while an investigation continues.

A total of 11 people were injured in the crash Saturday afternoon on Exhibition Road in London's busy museum district including the driver, police said.

Authorities initially feared the incident to be a possible terrorist attack.

""Enquiries have established that this incident is not terrorist related and I'd like to thank those who came to assist the injured.""

The incident seemed to resemble incidents earlier this year when extremists in vehicles attacked pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and on London Bridge.

Police said after several hours of urgent investigation that it was a road traffic collision not related to terrorism, but did still ask for any pictures or video of the crash as the investigation continues.

""We would ask anybody who saw what happened, or who have any pictures or moving footage that could help us gain a greater understanding of what happened, to get in touch with us,” Case said.

The leg and head injuries suffered by pedestrians were not life-threatening, according to police.

Escudero, a 53-year-old woman from Alcala de Guadaira, a town outside of Seville in southern Spain, has been unable to renew her driver’s license or go to the doctor since 2010 because various government officers believe she’s dead -- the result of a seven-year-old clerical error.

“[I have] suffered for more than six years,” she told EFE, according to El Diario de Sevilla.

Escudero said she first learned of the error when she visited the emergency room and her primary care physician checked her out.

“He looked at her, not knowing how to break it to her, and told her that according to Social Security records she was deceased,” her daughter, Marta, told the newspaper, adding “the family has not found the funny side of this story for a long time now.”

The doctor still treated Escudero “because she knew me and knew my situation was urgent,” but that the error needed to be fixed sooner rather than later.

At first, Escudero thought it was just a computer error that could be fixed quickly at the Social Security offices. That wasn’t the case.

“They explained to me that someone probably made a typo or maybe it was a computer error. But we went to the treasury, to the courts…and everywhere I appeared as deceased,” she told the newspaper.

When her husband passed away in 2011, she needed a certification of life to receive widow benefits, but instead was told she could be charged with identify fraud.

“On top of killing me, they find me, without hearing my story,” Escudero said, joking that she is dead to everyone but the banks, to whom she pays loans and mortgage on a regular basis. “On the government’s computers I am dead, but for the banks I am alive and kicking.”

In April 2016, she found out that a woman with her name and data had been buried six years prior in Malaga – about 127 miles away.

She said her daughter called the cemetery and confirmed the burial date and that the remains has been transferred to an ossuary because maintenance fees had not been paid. She also confirmed her mother’s social security and date of birth.

“'Look,' my daughter told them, 'that person is my mother and she is here right next to me,'” Escudero said. “Imagine the woman’s face at the cemetery.”

Earlier this month she filed a petition with Malaga courts to have the grave opened and has offered to do a DNA test – anything – to prove that the woman buried is not her.

Escudero says no one has explained to her how the woman has died, but believes that she has been confused with a sister with whom she has no contact and whose whereabouts are unknown. She said she has no connection to Malaga.",Spanish woman wants to open up grave to prove she's alive,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/27/spanish-woman-wants-to-open-up-grave-to-prove-shes-alive.html

One source told the network that Paddock displayed anti-social traits common to other mass shooters. Others point out that Paddock appeared to have trouble forming meaningful relationships and was seen by some acquaintances as disconnected or standoffish.

However, Paddock's girlfriend told FBI agents Wednesday that she had not noticed any changes in his mental state or indications he could become violent, a federal official told the Associated Press.

Investigators have spent the past week trying to pin down a specific motive for why Paddock targeted the Route 91 Harvest Festival before taking his own life Sunday evening. They have investigated whether Paddock was with a prostitute days before the shooting, scrutinized cruises he took and tried to make sense of a cryptic note with numbers jotted on it found in his hotel room.

Three police officers who responded to Paddock's hotel room at the Mandalay Bay have told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that the note included handwritten calculations about where he needed to aim to maximize the carnage.

""I could see on it he had written the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for the crowd,"" Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Officer Dave Newton told the newsmagazine. ""So he had that written down and figured out so he would know where to shoot to hit his targets from there.""

Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters Friday that investigators had pursued over 1,000 leads, but admitted ""We still do not have a clear motive or reason why.""

""We have looked at literally everything,"" McMahill added.

It is unusual to have so few hints of a motive five days after a mass shooting. In previous mass killings or terrorist attacks, killers left notes, social media postings and information on a computer — or even phoned police.

""The lack of a social media footprint is likely intentional,"" Erroll Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California, told the Associated Press ""We're so used to, in the first 24 to 48 hours, being able to review social media posts. If they don't leave us a note behind or a manifesto behind, and we're not seeing that, that's what's making this longer.""

What officers have found is that Paddock planned his attack meticulously.

He requested an upper-floor room overlooking the festival, stockpiled 23 guns, a dozen of them modified to fire continuously like an automatic weapon, and set up cameras inside and outside his room to watch for approaching officers.

In a possible sign he was contemplating massacres at other sites, he also booked rooms overlooking the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago in August and the Life Is Beautiful show near the Vegas Strip in late September, according to authorities reconstructing his movements leading up to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

His arsenal also included tracer rounds that can improve a shooter's firing accuracy in the dark, a law enforcement official told AP. It wasn't clear whether Paddock fired any of the illuminated bullets during the high-rise massacre.

Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of the .308-caliber and .223-caliber tracer ammunition from a private buyer he met at a Phoenix gun show, a law enforcement official not authorized to comment on the investigation said on condition of anonymity.

Tracer rounds illuminate their path so a gunman can home in on targets at night. But they can also give away the shooter's position.

Video shot of the pandemonium that erupted when Paddock started strafing the festival showed a muzzle flash from his room at the Mandalay Bay resort, but bullets weren't visible in the night sky.

Catalonia's separatists camp has grown in recent years, strengthened by Spain's recent economic crisis and by Madrid's rejection of attempts to increase self-rule in the region.","Hundreds of thousands of people rallied Sunday in downtown Barcelona to protest against the plans of Catalonia's regional government to secede from the rest of Spain. The march was the largest pro-union showing since the rise of separatist sentiment in the prosperous northeastern region that has pushed Spain to the brink of a national crisis.

Barcelona police said 350,000 people participated, while march organizers Societat Civil Catalana said that 930,000 people turned out.

Those numbers resemble the pro-independence rallies that Barcelona has seen in recent years.

Many in the crowd who marched through the city center under the slogan of ""Let's recover our common sense!"" carried Spanish, Catalan and European Union flags. Some chanted ""Don't be fooled, Catalonia is Spain"" and called for Catalan president Carles Puigdemont to go to prison.

Sunday's rally comes a week after the Catalan government went ahead and held a referendum on secession that Spain's top court had suspended and the Spanish government said was illegal.

Catalan authorities say the ""Yes"" side won the referendum with 90 percent of the vote, though only 43 percent of the region's 5.3 million eligible voters turned out in polling that was marred by police raids of polling stations on orders to confiscate ballot boxes.

Puigdemont has pledged to push ahead for independence anyway and is set to address the regional parliament on Tuesday ""to report on the current political situation.""

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy vows that his government will not allow Catalonia, which represents a fifth of Spain's economy, to break away from the rest of the country.

In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais published Sunday, Rajoy said that he will consider employing any measure ""allowed by the law"" to stop the region's separatists.

Rajoy said that includes the application of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would allow the central government to take control of the governance of a region ""if the regional government does not comply with the obligations of the Constitution.""

""The ideal situation would be that I don't have to find drastic solutions, but for that to happen there will have to be some rectifications (by Catalan leaders),"" Rajoy said.

Rallies were held Saturday in Madrid, Barcelona and other cities to demand that Rajoy and Puigdemont negotiate to find a solution to Spain's worst political crisis in nearly four decades.

Pro-union forces hope to gather steam with Sunday's protest in Barcelona after a series of large businesses, including Catalonia's top two banks, announced they were relocating their headquarters to other parts of Spain. Other companies are reportedly considering leaving Catalonia to avoid being cast out of the European Union and its common market in the case of secession.

""I hope that nothing will happen. Because (Catalonia) is going to lose more than (Spain) because businesses are fleeing from here already,"" said protester Juliana Prats, a Barcelona resident. ""I hope it will remain like it has been up until now, 40 years of peace.""

The rally drew Spaniards from outside the northeastern region to the Catalan capital. One group held a large banner boasting ""Marbella,"" a town on Spain's southern coast. An AP reporter spoke with another man who had come from the northern Basque Country region.

Nobel Literature Prize laureate Mario Vargas Llosa and former president of the European Parliament Josep Borrell addressed the rally.

""Besides Catalans, there are thousands of men and women from all corners of Spain who have come to tell their Catalan companions that they are not alone,"" said Llosa, who took on Spanish citizenship in addition to that of his native Peru in 1993. ""We want Barcelona to once again be the capital of Spanish culture.""

Borrell added that: ""Catalonia is not a state like Kosovo where rights were systematically violated.""

The most recent polls taken before the referendum showed that Catalonia's 7.5 million residents were roughly split over secession, while a majority would support an official referendum on independence if it were condoned by Spanish authorities

Rajoy's government has repeatedly refused to grant Catalonia permission to hold a referendum on grounds that it is unconstitutional since it would only poll a portion of Spain's 46 million residents.

So many people have to make their living doing things they don’t really enjoy, but are necessary for their family.
But we had a pretty good working relationship, all of us on the show.
Eden: No, I didn’t, I really didn’t.","Barbara Eden enchanted audiences across the country with a nod and a blink in the beloved ‘60s sitcom “I Dream of Jeannie” — and 47 years later, she’s still celebrated as a beloved TV icon.

The 86-year-old was recently honored by the Library of American Broadcasting Foundation at the Giants of Broadcasting Luncheon for her decades-long career in film and television. But don’t expect Eden to sit back and enjoy her success.

She has never stopped working and still headlines shows both in the United States and abroad. Simply put, this genie has been long out of the bottle and doesn’t have any plans to vanish in a cloud of smoke.

Eden spoke with Fox News about her favorite memories on set, what her life is like these days and why her belly button was such a hot topic:

Fox News: How does it feel to still be recognized as an icon in American TV?

Barbara Eden: It feels really good! I like it. I’m still active, I’m still working. It’s always good to be recognized for hard work you’ve done in the years past. While you’re doing it, you don’t think of it so much. You’re just working. It’s a wonderful thing for someone to acknowledge it.

Fox News: What’s keeping you motivated these days?

Eden: I just like my work. I think I’m very, very lucky to have found a profession that I fit in. So many people have to make their living doing things they don’t really enjoy, but are necessary for their family. I’m just lucky, very lucky.

Fox News: What is it about ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ that continues to entertain audiences?

Eden: I think it’s a happy show. Of course, the genie and the fantasy is a classic story. So I think people will always be entranced by that magic. But we had a pretty good working relationship, all of us on the show. It made a difference. Larry [Hagman] was so good. And our Dr. Bellows (Hayden Rorke) was wonderful. It just made everything click.

Fox News: What’s one memory you have of Larry Hagman that still makes you smile?

Eden: Oh, there’s so many! We seemed to have the same rhythm in our comedic timing, which was fortunate for both of us. We enjoyed working together… The most outstanding story with Larry was the one when we had a lion as a guest. I had done two feature films with lions and I’ve been told how to treat them. They’re male lions, they’re lazy. If they’re well fed, they don’t really want to eat you. But they do want to play with you if you run around! You have to be very quiet with them. So I went over and I told Larry, ‘We have to go make friends with the lion.’ He goes, ‘I’m not going to make any friends with any bleep lion!’ And walks off!

And so, I walked over and I did the usual things I’ve been trained to do. I scratched him behind the ears. Never the ears, just behind the ears. And I rehearsed with the cat. He was 600 pounds, a big male lion. They put a little bowl of raw meat beside me. He put his head down and nom, nom, nom. Oh boy, that was good. He looks around and he’s very happy. Very, very happy. And then Larry came in. They started the scene.

They put the meat down and he ate his meat. He turned around, looked at Larry, and let out a huge roar! It was the loudest roar you have ever heard in your life. Larry was on the next set. He was gone! But not only was he gone, every single man on that set ran. They broke the camera, one of the pieces fell over and I had a 600 pound lion on my lap purring. He put his head in my lap and started to lick my arm, like a great, big pussycat.

Fox News: Was there a moment from your time on ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ that still sticks out to you?

Eden: Oh my goodness, so many things happened on set. One of them was [when] my mother came to visit the set for the first time. And it was a show in which the genie was trapped in a safe. And inside that safe, don’t ask me why, there was a huge lipstick and a bottle of aspirin. I don’t know why that was in the safe, but it was! And of course, they would jiggle the set whenever someone would pick up this safe. Well, they jiggled it a little too hard and the lipstick fell over and hit me on the head. I was out for a couple of minutes. My mother was having a fit! Just having a fit.

Fox News: What’s the story behind the belly button controversy?

Eden: I have a big 'thank-you' to the media for that. I was on the set one day and [a writer] for The Hollywood Reporter walked on the set and right over to me. He said, ‘I don’t believe you have one.’ I said, ‘A what?’ And he goes, ‘A belly button!’ And then he poked me in the middle! He started writing about my belly button... The next thing I knew, the 'Laugh-In' wanted to premiere my navel on NBC. I know a lot of women are known for very glamorous body parts, but my navel? Ha!

Fox News: You previously starred in the 1960 film ‘Flaming Star’ alongside Elvis Presley. What was your impression of Elvis?

Eden: He was a lovely man. Well brought up. Was a hard worker. A very good actor and wanted to be. This was the only film that he really had a chance of showing he could act. He got excellent reviews on the film. And, of course, it didn’t make a penny because... he didn’t sing a song. That wasn’t what his fans wanted. But he was excellent.

Fox News: How was it working alongside Lucille Ball in “I Love Lucy”?

Eden: Oh my, that was mind-boggling for me. It was the third job I had in Los Angeles and she was so good to me. I can’t tell you how sweet she was. I had a dress on that she didn’t think was outstanding enough. She asked me to take it off and the next thing I knew, she was sitting there putting sparkling things all over it, just to make it look better.

Here’s the star of the show making this young woman look better. She was just so wonderful and so talented. Of course, I couldn’t believe I was there. She wanted to sign me to a contract because she believed in comedy and thought I had a great bent for that. But at the time I had already tested at Fox, and I received the phone call while I was on the set. They picked up my option and so, instead of ""Lucy"" I went to Fox.

Fox News: At any point in your career, did you ever feel typecast because of your success in ‘I Dream of Jeannie’?

Eden: No, I didn’t, I really didn’t. Because after I did ‘I Dream of Jeannie,' I did at least two other television shows. And I don’t know how many television movies playing entirely different kinds of people. I was so busy… So, I didn’t feel that I was ever typecast. In fact, I wasn’t. ‘Jeannie’ just so happens to be the one people remember and that’s all right with me. She’s easy to live with. I really like her.","'I Dream of Jeannie' star Barbara Eden describes working with Larry Hagman, Elvis and Lucille Ball",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/06/dream-jeannie-star-barbara-eden-describes-working-with-larry-hagman-elvis-and-lucille-ball.html

Another mass shooting has spurred another rush to judgment. After the Las Vegas shooting, Democrats complain about Republican leniency on the gun industry. But White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has flipped the argument.

In two separate interviews Thursday, Conway pointed out that the previous administration was responsible for the regulatory oversight that first made ""bump stocks"" legal. In short, the Trump White House now argues that it's former President Barack Obama's fault.

""I would just note for the viewers that since ‘bump stock' has not probably been in the lexicon before,"" Conway said on ""Fox and Friends,"" ""this is a device that President Obama's ATF decided would not be regulated in 2010. I think that's an important part of this conversation.""

And she's right. Halfway through Obama's first term, the ATF approved bump stocks, that device found in the possession of the Las Vegas shooter, which allows a semi-automatic rifle to fire almost at full-auto.

On Friday the President and First Lady will host me, along with many other Latino leaders, for a celebration at the White House commemorating Hispanic Heritage Month.

Being a very public Hispanic supporter of Donald Trump is never easy, and I’ve endured myriad insults, from constant social media accusations that I’m a “Tio Tomas” (Uncle Tom), to in-person insults calling me a “coconut” (brown on the outside, white on the inside).

For the most part, I take these barbs in stride and realize that in the incredibly polarized political environment of recent years, politics truly is hardball. For my part, accepting insults is a small price to pay for saving our country from its slide toward mediocrity.

For far too long, the Democratic Party has shamelessly exploited race and ethnicity to create predictable voting blocks. But, despite big promises at election cycles, those same politicians have consistently failed to deliver tangible solutions to communities of color, as recent years see both a widening economic inequality vs. white households and a marked recent upturn in violent urban crime, which disproportionately afflicts blacks and Hispanics.

For far too long, the Democratic Party has shamelessly exploited race and ethnicity to create predictable voting blocks. But, despite big promises at election cycles, those same politicians have consistently failed to deliver tangible solutions to communities of color.

In contrast, in just nine months in office President Trump has already delivered real results for Hispanics in three key areas…with much more promise ahead!

First, and most importantly, our economy accelerates in tangible ways since the Inauguration, with manufacturing and consumer confidence indices soaring. This palpable economic uplift of course benefits all Americans, but particularly the incredibly entrepreneurial Hispanic community, which starts small businesses at about 1.5 times the rate of non-Hispanic Americans. President Trump has already moved forcefully to reduce the regulatory burden that stifles small business growth, empowering these amazing Latino business creators. The last decade has been wonderful for owners of assets, especially stocks and real estate. Most minorities, and most Hispanics, are not yet among that ownership class and, as such, badly needed growth in wages and entrepreneurship. The tax package announced by this administration will propel a renewed economic dynamism that will vault Hispanic prosperity.

Second, the President displayed wisdom and empathy in continuing the DACA program protecting illegal immigrants brought here as children. He recognizes that these young adults broke our immigration statutes through no fault of their own and comprise a separate category from adults who knowingly defied our laws. The President has sensibly charged the Congress with finding a sustainable and Constitutional solution this vexing issue, likely a compromise protecting these DACA recipients in exchange for large immigration reforms.

Third, Trump’s response to Puerto Rico has been as swift as it is impressive. Despite the constant grandstanding of the absurd T-shirt wearing mayor of San Juan, enabled by a mainstream media hell-bent on manufacturing “Trump’s Katrina,” the reality is that federal response to this epic catastrophe represents a triumph of both logistics and humanitarian concern. Despite the carnage of two category 5 hurricanes, today two-thirds of gasoline stations on the island are fully operational as well as the majority of grocery stores – a testimony to the determination of the Americans who call that island home as well as the 12,000 federal “boots on the ground” providing aid. And don’t take my word for it, listen to the Democrat Governor Ricardo Rossello who told Fox’s Maria Bartiromo that “the president and the administration, every time we’ve asked them to execute, they’ve executed quickly.”

The mainstream media narrative in 2016, which I fought so vociferously on-air, painted Donald Trump as some anti-Hispanic bigot. That slur was always false and was, thankfully, largely rejected by our own communities as Trump surpassed the Hispanic vote percentage garnered by Mitt Romney in 2012. What Trump has shown in his first months in office, through economic growth, a reasoned approach to DACA, and an outpouring of support for Puerto Rico, is that he intends to govern for the increased prosperity and security of the forgotten common working American…including, of course, Hispanics.

I would have missed out on so much if I had been given – and had accepted – the option of assisted suicide.
On top of that, the legalization of assisted suicide injects government and profit-driven insurance companies into everyone’s end-of-life decisions.
Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.
But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.","I’m thankful I don’t live in a state like Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal. When I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and told I would probably be dead in four months, I went in an instant from living the American Dream with my wife and son to living a nightmare. In that moment of depression, I might have chosen to end my life.

After a seizure sent me to the hospital, the neurosurgeon told me I had a brain tumor known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and that the tumor was inoperable. In fact, three different doctors told me there was nothing that they could do.

The news was overwhelmingly depressing. As a United States Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq War, I could have lost my life on a faraway battlefield serving my country. Thankfully I survived, but I had now received a death sentence at home.

With the support of my family, I chose to fight the cancer. I have had some great success with an experimental, cutting-edge treatment and am still alive three years after I was told I had only a few months to live.

Not everyone is so lucky to have the support I do. Since my diagnosis of terminal brain cancer my wife and I welcomed our second son into the world. I would have missed out on so much if I had been given – and had accepted – the option of assisted suicide.

Assisted suicide laws require a prognosis of six months or less to live, but how can we let our life-and-death decisions rest on these prognoses, when even the most experienced doctors are often wrong? My own experience reveals how tragic that could turn out to be.

We also know from the 2016 Oregon Health Report that in Oregon, which 20 years ago became the first state to make assisted suicide legal, only 4 percent of patients considering ending their lives were referred for psychological evaluation.

Yet a 2008 study, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ, revealed that 25 percent of patients requesting assisted suicide suffered from major depressive disorder. These numbers suggest that people with mental illness could well be prescribed a death-too-soon, instead of the treatment they deserve.

On top of that, the legalization of assisted suicide injects government and profit-driven insurance companies into everyone’s end-of-life decisions. Just in the last year, more cases have surfaced of patients being denied coverage for care, showing how legalizing assisted suicide results in more abuse and less choice.

Take, for example, Stephanie Packer, a California mother of four suffering from a serious case of scleroderma, a chronic connective tissue disease. She reported that her insurance company denied her coverage for chemotherapy treatment but would pay for her to kill herself.

Then there is Dr. Brian Callister, a Nevada physician who asked insurance medical directors to approve lifesaving, curative treatments for a patient in California and another in Oregon – two states that have legalized assisted suicide. Callister’s requests were denied, and the patients were offered coverage for suicide drugs instead.

People are starting to realize the threat that assisted suicide poses. Though an onslaught of new bills has been introduced, 23 states have rejected laws designed to legalize assisted suicide this year.

And states like Alabama and Ohio recently enacted laws to strengthen the prohibition of assisted suicide. Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.

Some vulnerable populations, like people with disabilities and terminal illness, are at more immediate risk to be adversely affected by the legalization of assisted suicide. But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.

—Accommodation providers meanwhile received the highest marks when it comes to making travel accessible.","There are more than two billion people around the world who face travel accessibility issues tied to their age or extenuating disabilities.

A significant portion of this population would like to be able to travel more and be offered a greater variety of personalized services and destinations to choose from.

But according to a new study commissioned by Amadeus, Voyage of discovery. Working towards inclusive and accessible travel for all, the needs of these travelers are not being met by the travel industry or the public sector. As a result, accessible travel is far from being a reality for everyone.

“Over the past 30 years, travel has undergone a revolution that has brought it within the reach of hundreds of millions more people. The rise of low-cost options, the ubiquity of the internet and sharing platforms have created unprecedented demand and choice. In turn, more people are visiting more destinations than ever before,” states the report.

“One demographic that is yet to truly benefit from this democratization of travel: people with accessibility needs.”

These people wish to be considered as mainstream travelers, the report adds. They don’t expect special accommodations but merely the ability to plan, search, book and purchase travel like everyone else.

The report was commissioned to develop a deeper understanding of this growing segment of travelers and raise awareness surrounding accessibility issues.

Among its findings:

—One of the biggest barriers to accessible travel remains inaccurate or incomplete information being available.

—When it comes to booking travel online, 53% of respondents said they need assistance to complete bookings.

—Travelers with accessibility concerns increasingly expect their needs to be met as part of mainstream service, rather than at an added cost.

—The least satisfactory travel experiences for this population are related to railway stations.

—Accommodation providers meanwhile received the highest marks when it comes to making travel accessible.

Transitioning to a travel environment that works for everyone will require numerous improvements. Among them, more effective communication that facilitates access to relevant information regarding accessibility as well as more responsive service, including trained staff to address the varying access needs of travelers.

Standardizing content across the industry would also help. The report recommends more collaboration between the public and private sectors to help meet the needs of travelers with accessibility concerns.

“Improving accessibility in travel means enhancing usability for all customers. Lifting barriers to travel, personalizing the travel offer, using technology to further facilitate travelers’ experiences and creating more accessible infrastructure where people can navigate autonomously will benefit everybody,” said Amadeus Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Alex Luzárraga.

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



More non-news on the Russia-collusion front came Wednesday, when the Senate Intelligence Committee said it has now verified what everyone knew nine months ago: Russia worked to sow chaos during the 2016 election; vote totals weren’t affected; and no evidence has emerged that Donald Trump was in cahoots with Moscow.

But in the more distant, less camera-filled corners of Washington, there actually is some interesting new information. It centers on the document that increasingly looks central to the “chaos” Russia sowed: the Trump dossier.

That was the infamous list of accusations compiled starting in the summer of 2016 by a former British spook, Christopher Steele, who had been hired by the liberal opposition-research firm Fusion GPS. The discredited rumors about Mr. Trump came from anonymous Russian sources. This is notable, since it turns out Fusion was separately—or maybe not so separately—working with entities tied to the Kremlin.

How close was Fusion’s leader, Glenn Simpson, to Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Kremlin-linked lawyer? Did the Russians know about the dossier all along and help plant the information in it? Were American law-enforcement agencies relying on Russian-directed disinformation when they obtained secret warrants against Trump associates? Chaos, indeed.

Witness how hard the Federal Bureau of Investigation is fighting to avoid divulging any information about the dossier. More than a month ago the House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas to the FBI and the Justice Department, asking for dossier-related documents. Lawmakers were told to go swivel.

A little more than a week ago, the committee’s frustrated chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, took the case all the way to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who finally offered to make an FBI official available for a briefing. But the bureau is still withholding all documents. To date, Sen. Chuck Grassley’s Judiciary Committee has not received any paper from the FBI on Russia matters, despite numerous requests, some countersigned by the Democratic ranking member, Dianne Feinstein.

Increasingly, one name is popping up: Gregory Brower, who leads the FBI’s Office of Congressional Affairs. Mr. Brower is an odd man for the job. These gigs tend to go to more-junior people, since they involve the drudgery of answering calls from grumpy congressional staffers. Yet Mr. Brower is a former U.S. attorney—a job that requires Senate confirmation—and a former Nevada state senator.",About That Trump Dossier 'Wall',http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/06/about-trump-dossier-wall#commenting

The flying museum, better known as the “Madras Maiden” touched down in Columbia, S.C. Sunday, where volunteers give 30-minute tours to veterans, visitors or families of those who served in the military.

“They do fine…I’m proud of them. [They’re] down in that plane like they were born in it,” WWII Army veteran William Pate said about the volunteers.

From 1944 to 1947, Pate jumped out of C-47’s and C-82’s as an 82nd Airborne paratrooper.

“I enjoyed what I was doing. If I could, I would do it again. But I have a lot of age on me now. I ain’t no spring chicken,” he told Fox News.

Pate and other veterans in attendance swapped war stories with each other and the crew after taking one of the flights over the city.

“It’s just an honor to be able to hear their stories, talk to their families and just keep their memories alive for generations,” Rodney Schneider said.

An aircraft maintainer by trade, Schneider explained his love for planes stretched back to his childhood. This motivated him to reach out to the Liberty Foundation, which organizes the event.

“I’ve been with the airplane now seven-days straight. Sometimes its weeks between when I’m needed,"" Schneider said.

Robert “Max” Maiden, 21, is a co-pilot for the bomber. He flies to different cities every weekend for six months.

“I’ve always loved flying old airplanes…They have a cool story to tell and they are an important part of history,” Maiden said. “You really see people get really emotional and they sit there and they go, 'Aww man this is what my dad did,' or ‘my dad built them’ or 'my dad flew them or is a gunner.' It’s really cool to share that with people.”

Erin Creed traveled to Columbia from Virginia with her father and husband to honor her grandfather, who fought the Nazis in Europe.

“I just could not believe I was on a World War Two plane,” she said. “I had his picture and his favorite hat and I just couldn’t believe [I] was flying in memory of him.”

One of only 12 B-17’s still flying the “Madras Maiden” was built toward the end of the war but never saw combat. In 2016, The Liberty Foundation began operating the aircraft and spends over a million dollars every year for upkeep. The money that is generated from ticket sales or donations helps to cover the costs.

“If that goes away, it goes back into a museum and starts collecting dust and you don’t get to hear it or smell it,” Schneider explained.

The crew’s age and skills may vary, but one thing remains the same -- the love for planes and veterans.

“We get to ride on a WWII airplane that not everybody can do and just the satisfaction of just doing it,” Schneider said.

As a part of its tour across the U.S. the plane is scheduled to make stops in Tennessee and Kentucky.",B-17 bomber flies cross country to honor World War Two veterans,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/29/b-17-bomber-flies-cross-country-to-honor-world-war-two-veterans.html

Plastic bags

California became the first state in the U.S. to ban single-use plastic bags in 2015, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Businesses that continue to offer the bags have to charge customers a fee.

Non-essential state-funded travel was already banned from Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee.

California bars the possession of certain “restricted animals” without a specific permit, including hamsters, ferrets and gerbils.

Hedgehogs, certain parakeets and piranhas are also banned from being kept as pets.

Foie gras

California’s foie gras ban was reinstated this month by a federal appeals court. It found that a state law preventing sales of the food product made by force-feeding ducks and geese was not preempted by federal authority to regulate poultry products.

The ban was signed into law in 2004 after proponents said the process of fattening the birds’ livers was cruel and inhumane. The law took effect in 2012, but was blocked by a court in 2015, delighting chefs who wanted to serve it.

Woods tweeted this summer that he had “accepted the fact that” he was blacklisted from Hollywood because of his views. He has said being conservative has made it tough to find work in Hollywood the past few years.

The “Casino” actor has twice been nominated for an Academy Award and has won an Emmy Award three times. His movie credits include “Salvador (1986)” and “Ghosts of Mississippi (1996),” both of which earned him a nomination for an Oscar. He's also played H.R. Haldeman in Oliver Stone's ""Nixon (1995),"" starred alongside Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford in Sydney Pollack's ""The Way We Were (1973)"" and was also in Martin Scorsese's epic crime drama ""Casino (1995).""

Woods was a Hollywood favorite -- and a Democrat -- until at least 1998, when he broke ranks with the party after former President Bill Clinton's impeachment.

He said on Twitter that he switched parties because of his disgust with the former president.

""Every single #Democrat without exception stood behind a convicted perjurer,"" he wrote on Twitter this summer. ""That was the end.""

His luck in Hollywood turned sour soon after he became a Republican. He has not had a major role in a film in at least a decade.

The news of his retirement was included in a press release issued by Woods' real estate agent offering Woods' Rhode Island lake house for sale.

Allen Gammons said Friday that Woods is 70 and wants to relax. He says the actor's brother and mother recently died, and he hopes to spend more time on passions including photography, antiquing and poker.

Gammons said Woods' decision was not political.

The announcement comes after Woods was in a Twitter feud with actress Amber Tamblyn, who last month accused him of trying to pick her up when she was 16. Woods called it a lie. Gammons said Woods declined to comment Friday when asked about Tamblyn's accusation.

Woods has said there are many conservative stars who didn’t speak up because “the blacklist against conservatives in Hollywood is very real.”

MOM LOSES FINGER IN FREAK INJURY AT SON'S BASEBALL PRACTICE

...Sudden Unexplained Blindness…

“A 60+-year-old glaucoma patient came in as an emergency appointment with sudden unexplained blindness. Turns out, she mixed up her glaucoma drops with cyanoacrylate, an extremely fast-acting and an extremely effective adhesive. The glaucoma eye drop bottle and the adhesive bottle are very similar and she was working on building models and inadvertently glued her eyelids shut. Turns out, the adhesive worked beautifully on human tissue, causing the upper and lower eyelids to be sealed shut, with the eyeball underneath being totally immobile. Utilizing topical anesthetic and extremely sharp micro surgical scissors, I separated her eyelids. Thereafter, with lots of anesthetic drops, Q-tips, rounded forceps, and gentle pressure, I was able to free up the eyeball and remove residual glue. Each eye took at least 30 minutes, and her vision was restored.” —Mendelsohn

...An Ice Pick in His Eyeball…

“I did my eye surgery residency training at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, a major trauma center in the heart of the city's most violent neighborhoods. Every night was an adventure, with man's inhumanity to man showing up in the form of all sorts of injuries. After my first year, I stopped asking patients how they got their injuries and just marveled at the human body's ability to survive. One night, a fellow showed up at the emergency room with an ice pick in his eyeball. Because he couldn't afford an ambulance, he drove himself to the ER—on a motorcycle. He apologized for not wearing a helmet for obvious reasons.” —John Hovanesian, M.D., an eye surgeon at Harvard Eye Associates in Laguna Hills, Calif., and a member of the clinical teaching faculty at the UCLA Jules Stein Eye Institute.

...A White Spot on the Surface of Their Eye...

“A couple of years ago when I was doing a fellowship in Miami, the ophthalmology residents in the emergency room were seeing a patient who came in for a white spot on the surface of their eye. The first-year resident who was looking at it was perplexed at what the lesion could be, so he called over some other first-year residents to take a look. They were all sort of confused, so they called their senior resident to come take a look. The senior member saw the patient, then grabbed a cotton tip applicator, and flicked the ‘lesion’ off…it was a popcorn kernel!” —Alberto Distefano, M.D., an oculoplastics fellow at the Yale School of Medicine.

...A Spike Had Flown Off the Metal...

""A couple of years ago I had a patient who came to me for decreased vision and a little pain in one eye. The patient had been working on his car using a metal grinder, which is used to remove rust off of the car frame. He thought something hit him but wasn't sure—he had poor vision and could only see a hand moving in front of his face. It turns out, a spike had flown off the metal grinder, had punctured his cornea, and was sitting in the middle of his eyeball. It was an inch long, which is the length of the eye. Fortunately, it didn't touch his retina, but he needed emergency surgery to remove this very large foreign body from his eyeball, which involved removing the lens and jelly from the back of the eye. After that surgery and another surgery months later, he ended up seeing 20/30 uncorrected."" —Jonathan Criss, M.D., a comprehensive ophthalmologist at Florida Eye Microsurgical Institute.

DONORS CONTINUE TO LINE UP AT BLOOD CENTERS IN RESPONSE TO LAS VEGAS MASSACRE

… Foreign Body Sensation, Discharge, Redness...

“Two years back, an older lady visited my clinic with complaints of foreign body sensation, discharge, and redness. There was history of multiple consultations in the past to many ophthalmologists and using many eye drops without any relief. On examination, I found a folded contact lens in the upper fornix of her right eye. I removed that contact lens. Later, the patient said that she had some eye problems 20 years ago during her visit to her son's place in Australia. The ophthalmologist had placed a contact lens in her eye and asked her to come back after a month, but the patient missed the visit and forgot about that contact lens. That same lens was in her eye for 20 years and that was irritating her eye. On her one-week follow-up visit with me, she was very relaxed and she said that she had a sound sleep, as all these years she could not sleep properly due to irritation by her contact lens.” —Vaibhev Mittal, D.O.M.S., a fellow in comprehensive ophthalmology at iCliniiq.

...The Lenses Were Placed Off Axis...

“A patient of mine came in explaining how her son, a middle schooler, had trouble focusing in school. He had been seen by a therapist who was testing him for ADD, but recommended having his eyes tested. He was already my patient and wearing glasses. I retested his vision and there was no change. But when we checked his glasses, the problem immediately became apparent. The lenses were placed into the frame 90 degrees off axis. His mom had purchased the glasses at a ‘buy-one-get-one’ optical special with a reputation among professionals for poor quality. Once his lenses were corrected, his focusing issue in school was no longer an issue. A buy-one-get-one special is not always a good deal.” —Mendelsohn

In remarks on the South Lawn of the White House before leaving for a fundraising trip to North Carolina, the president referred to a popular GOP proposal that would have the federal government turn over money for health care directly to states in the form of block grants.

“If we could do a one-year deal or a two-year deal as a temporary measure, you'll have block granting ultimately to the states, which is what the Republicans want,” he said. “That really is a repeal and replace.”

Meanwhile, in an interview taped earlier this week and aired Saturday night on Trinity Broadcasting Network, the president assured host Mike Huckabee that “We'll have health care before the election.”

Earlier Saturday, Trump said he had spoken with the Senate's Democratic leader on Friday to gauge whether the minority party was interested in helping pass ""great"" health legislation.

Democrats said they willing to hear his ideas, but were not willing to scrap the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.

Trump's latest overture to Democrats followed GOP failures so far to fulfill the party's years-long promise to repeal and replace the ACA, despite controlling the White House and Congress since January.

The president tweeted that he called Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Friday to discuss the ACA, which Trump said was “badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!”

Trump said he wanted “to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill.”

Schumer said through a spokesman Saturday that Trump ""wanted to make another run at repeal and replace and I told the president that's off the table."" Schumer said if Trump ""wants to work together to improve the existing health care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions.""

Trump has suggested before that he would be open to negotiating with Democrats on health care, but there have been no clear signs of a compromise between the two parties.

Schumer said a starting point could be negotiations led by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., who have been discussing a limited bipartisan deal to stabilize state-level markets for individual health insurance policies. People covered under the health law represent about half of those who purchase individual policies.

Trump irritated GOP leaders in Congress when he reached a deal with Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on a spending bill and the debt ceiling. The president has referred to those two Democrats as ""Chuck and Nancy.""

But the Trump administration announced Friday that it would allow more employers to opt out of no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections. The move was one more attempt to roll back Obama's health overhaul, prompting Democrats to question whether Trump is committed to avoiding sabotaging the law.

Trump floated the potential talks as he approved an emergency declaration for a large part of Louisiana and ordered federal assistance for the state as Hurricane Nate approached the central Gulf of Mexico.

The president headlined a fundraiser on Saturday night in Greensboro, N.C., to benefit his Trump Victory joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee. The event was expected to raise $2 million, with donors paying up to $35,000 per couple to serve as co-hosts.

The reason we have that type of sensor package is … to be deeply integrated into Level Five, you should have some redundancies (back-up measures in case of equipment failures).”

Mr Miller added: “Do you really want to trust one sensor measuring the speed of a car coming into an intersection before you pull out? I think you need some confirmation.”

Mr Miller said lydar and radar systems do a good job of measuring object speed and cameras do a great job of identifying objects.

Tesla’s autopilot hardware technology suite includes eight cameras, one radar and ultrasonic sensors.

“You can use the right sensor images to give you competence in what you’re seeing,” said Mr Miller. “That’s important if we’re going to put this technology out for general consumption to the public.

“Could you do it with what’s in the current (Tesla) Model S? I don’t think so.”

Kim’s appointment of his 28-year-old sibling was viewed as a move to further consolidate his power.

The sister reportedly replaces Kim Jong Un's aunt, Kim Kyong Hee, who was a key decision maker when Kim’s father – the late Kim Jong Il – ruled the country, Reuters reported.

The promotion was announced Saturday, at a meeting in which Kim also described North Korea’s nuclear weapons program as a “powerful deterrent” that guaranteed the nation’s sovereignty, Reuters reported, citing the state media report.

Kim Yo Jong, a vice director of propaganda for North Korea’s ruling Workers Party, was sanctioned in January -- along with six other North Korean officials -- by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control for “human rights abuses and censorship activities,” Bloomberg reported.

But the sister has appeared more prominently in public in recent months, Bloomberg reported.

“She’s been recognized for the work she’s done in the past year to idolize Kim Jong Un,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at South Korea’s University of North Korean Studies, the news agency reported. “Kim Jong Un is extending his father and grandfather’s practice of empowering family members.”

At Saturday’s meeting, Kim Jong Un said his country’s nuclear weapons were a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia” against “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”

The report of Kim’s remarks came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that “only one thing will work” in negotiations with the Hermit Kingdom, Reuters reported.

Trump’s remark seemed to suggest that the president was thinking about possible military action.

Prior to her diagnosis, Beth exercised regularly, going for long walks with friends, strength training and doing cardio, which made the diagnosis all the more shocking for the couple.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

Often they’re women you’ve heard of—say, Beyonce or Madonna—and just as often, they’re not. But regardless of who’s in this NYC salon owner’s chair, conversation almost always turns to hair product. And while the topic has long inflamed passions, there’s a definite desire of the moment: “Women want more natural ingredients,” says Hazan, whose product formulators have started using corn, for example, to help create gentle shampoo suds—and protect hair color in the process.

“Patients have shown a greater interest in natural skin care, too,” says Doris Day, M.D., clinical associate professor of dermatology at the New York University Langone Medical Center. The reason? It’s no longer simply the perception that naturals are better for you and the environment, but the realization that they can be highly effective, too: “Some of the most potent antioxidants are produce-derived,” she notes.

GET BRIGHTER, GLOWING SKIN WITH THESE TIPS

So where does this growing appetite leave the beauty industry? In search of a broade array of ingredients, says veteran cosmetic chemist Ni’Kita Wilson: “There’s such a huge interest that companies are taking a closer look at all kinds of different foods to see what can be used in products.” Indeed, R&D teams are going well beyond the rosemary that zings up your bath and the honey that soothes your skin to hit every last corner of the grocery store.

Read on for five of their most surprising beauty finds.

Corn

A multitasking beautifier, corn is an effective alternative to increasingly unpopular synthetic exfoliants (those tiny plastic spheres that turn out to be big water pollutants)—and to synthetic lathering agents. You’ll find it in such products as Rita Hazan True Color Shampoo and Caudalie Deep Cleansing Exfoliator. One important note: These products smell nothing like corn. The shampoo is actually a cult favorite for, among other things, its gorgeous blend of white flower scents. Meanwhile, the exfoliating cleanser smells only faintly of mint, if anything. In fact, rest assured: Not one of the products to follow smells like a surprising grocery find.

Beans

“There is a navy bean extract that has been shown to reduce melanogenisis,” says Wilson. Read: Diminished pigment production and dark spots. Thus the navy bean extract in Mary Kay’s beauty editor-beloved TimeWise Tone-Correcting Serum and ClearProof Deep-Cleansing Charcoal Mask. But beans of all kinds, including those on offer at global grocers, are turning up in beauty products as well. One of the best examples: mung beans, long used in Chinese medicine as a detoxing and cooling agent, and now the star of Wei Mung Bean Sprout Stress-Relieving Soothing Mask.

Peas

Little did you know during your childhood protests against those bright green piles on your plate that you’d someday be seeking peas for your skin and hair. “Pea extract is a great ingredient,” says Wilson. “In hair, it strengthens and pumps up strands by forming an imperceptible film.” (Thus such launches as Honest Beauty Honestly Uplifted Volumizing Spray.) “In skin, that same film helps retain moisture,” Wilson explains. One great example? Ole Henriksen Sheer Transormation Perfecting Moisturizer.

Beets

Beets are known as super-moisturizers, so they’re turning up in all kinds of formulations. In Tula's Pro-Gycolic 10% pH Resurfacing Gel, for example, a hydrating beet derivative helps defend against external forces (pollution, UV radiation). Meanwhile, the beetroot extract in Pili Ani Intense Hydrating Facial Cream helps boost the concentration of NMF (natural moisturizing factor) in your skin.

Every year, millions of Americans go after this same goal, some successful and others not so much. To attain their goals, they may choose from the over-abundance of diets and exercise programs available, and some turn to weight loss supplements as well.

While you shouldn’t rely on supplements to do all the work for you, there are a few that can be used safely to boost your weight loss efforts.

Before you decide on weight loss supplements, though, you should consider the health effects carefully. Always check with your doctor first to be sure about safety, and remember that these pills are supplements. They’re meant to be used alongside healthy eating habits and proper exercise.

DO YOU HAVE LIVER DAMAGE?

Again, never use supplements by themselves to lose weight. Some people turn to weight loss pills so that they can continue an unhealthy lifestyle while staying thin.

This dangerous mentality could lead to frightening situations like addiction, overdose or death. Also, brands that claim to shed weight without any effort may contain ingredients that will do you more harm than good. If you have any doubt about a supplement, stay away.

Weight Loss Supplements that Work

Just like any other medication, weight loss supplements have both benefits and side effects. When choosing a supplement, you should know all the possible effects and consider them in light of your own health history. Especially if you have other health issues, you should check carefully for ingredients that may trigger or worsen your symptoms.

Let’s look at 3 supplements that you could consider adding to your weight loss program:

1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea has long been known for its health benefits, mainly because the drink is high in antioxidants. In particular, green tea contains large amounts of polyphenol antioxidants called catechins, which may help reduce oxidative stress.

For weight loss, studies have shown that green tea extract can help boost the metabolism. Researchers think that the combination of antioxidants and caffeine work together to accomplish this goal.

MOM LOSES FINGER IN FREAK ACCIDENT AT SON'S BASEBALL GAME

For example, in one study, researchers gave participants green tea and guarana extract 30 minutes before each meal. Researchers then analyzed how much energy the participants were burning.

After testing multiple times, researchers found that participants burned an extra 180 calories per day with just this supplement. In addition, green tea extract enhances norepinephrine, a hormone that tells the body to break down stored fat for energy.

Side Effects: Nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach or headaches may occur due to the dietary change or caffeine content. Rare side effects include tremors, seizures or irregular heartbeat. Because of the caffeine content, you should consult with your doctor about using green tea extract if you have a heart condition.

2. Berberine

Another lesser known supplement that provides powerful help is berberine. This supplement is derived from plants and actually enters the body’s cells through the bloodstream, changing the function of the cell. One major benefit that berberine has is its ability to regulate and reduce blood sugar content.

In addition, studies suggest that berberine does boost weight loss directly. In one study, researchers tested 37 participants who suffered from metabolic syndrome.

During testing, the participants took berberine three times per day for three months, and in turn reduced their BMI from 31.5 to 27.4. Also, the researchers noticed that many participants lost abdominal weight and improved other areas of their health.

IS YOUR THYROID SLEEPING ON THE JOB?

Side Effects: Common problems with berberine include cramping, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation and stomach pain. Also, you’ll want to discuss whether or not to take berberine if you are already on medication to lower your blood sugar.

3. Meratrim

One relatively new but promising supplement is Meratrim, a blend of two plant extracts. In one study of the supplement, researchers tested over 50 overweight individuals. Participants were told to take the supplement or a placebo twice a day in addition to eating a 2000-calorie diet and walking for 30 minutes, five times per week.

At the end of 16 weeks, researchers found that participants had decreased their weight, triglycerides and total cholesterol. In addition, no participants reported side effects. Because Meratrim is new, you should consider a more well-tested supplement if you have any major health issues.

As popular as it is to use fad diets and supplements to lose weight, your main program should focus on exercise and healthy eating.

However, if you choose to boost your efforts with a weight loss supplement, choose one that fits your lifestyle and keeps you safe. Most supplements do have side effects and risks and should never be taken to lose weight alone. In the end, remember that your improved health is the main goal and that healthy weight loss happens gradually for lasting results.

General Motors is developing a self-driving pack animal. Correction: self-driving pachyderm.

The SURUS borrows its name from a legendary elephant that helped Hannibal cross the Alps and turns it into an acronym that stands for Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure.

It’s a flatbed truck without a cab that’s equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain and fully autonomous driving capability.

GM is pitching the zero-emissions vehicle as both a commercial cargo carrier and military supply truck that can stealthily operate in warzones without putting troops at risk.

The platform features an electric powertrain at each end of the vehicle that gives it four-wheel-drive for off-road capabilities and four-wheel-steering to improve its maneuverability in tight spaces.

A cab for a human driver and passengers can be attached to help lead several of the vehicles wirelessly linked in a virtual train.

Instead of loading it with gear or containers, modules outfitted as mobile hospitals or for other functions can potentially be attached.

GM says SURUS has a range of 400 miles per fill up of the hydrogen tanks built into the chassis, and can be used to generate power and produce water from its exhaust in remote locations.

The project follows the creation of a fuel cell-powered Colorado pickup called the ZH2 that is currently being tested by the U.S. Army’ Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC.)

Fuel cell powertrains are nothing new to General Motors. It's spent billions on them since it unveiled the Autonomy concept in 2002, which was a hydrogen-powered chassis that was envisioned to work with different bodies, much like a passenger car-size version of SURUS.

The vehicle also brings to mind the ‘Autotrucks’ conceptual designer Nick Pugh created for the film ‘Logan’ starring Hugh Jackman.

Pugh’s idea was to separate the drivetrain into independent twin-axle pods that could travel in tandem to a loading area and pick up a shipping container at either end. They were a menacing and memorable element of the blockbuster, which was set in the year 2029.

SURUS could be on the road, or at least lugging stuff around battlefields and worksites sooner than that. General Motors is in talks to provide TARDEC with a SURUS for an evaluation, and is working toward putting autonomous vehicles into production within a couple of years.

The SURUS is making its public debut at the Association of the U.S. Army's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Oct. 9-11.",GM developing stealthy self-driving hydrogen-powered cargo truck with military in mind,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/06/gm-developing-stealthy-self-driving-hydrogen-powered-cargo-truck-with-military-in-mind.html

What they can’t confirm yet is whether anybody else knew about his planned attack before it took place.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said Friday in a news conference that while tips and information have helped them build a “profile into the madness of this suspect,” they still don’t know why he fired a heavy stream of bullets into a crowd of concertgoers at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.

“In the past, terror attacks or mass murder incidents, motive was made very clear,” McMahill said about police examination of social media posts or evidence left at the scene. “We have looked at everything, literally, to include the suspect’s personal life, any political affiliation, his social behaviors, economic situation and any potential radicalization that so many have claimed.”

He also confirmed that investigators hadn’t found any evidence to suggest that the Islamic State was in any way responsible for the attack, despite the Muslim group’s earlier claims.

Police said they have reviewed video footage from the hotel and didn’t see anyone that they view as a suspect.

They reiterated that authorities found Tannerite, a binary explosive, in the shooter’s car but said they do not know what Paddock was planning to do with it and based on the condition it was found in, it did not resemble an IED.

They also confirmed that authorities located a missing car they were looking for, a Hyundai Tucson with Nevada plates. It was at Paddock’s house in Reno, Nev.

In a timeline of events, police confirmed that a security officer initially went up to the 32nd floor of the hotel because an alarm sounded.

It was there that the security guard, Jesus Campos, came under fire by the suspect, during which he was hit by a bullet in the leg.

However, Lt. Howard Black told Fox News on Wednesday that it’s “absurd” that anyone would be discouraged from calling the department about a story and an incident.

“There is no update. I am just not going to be doing interviews,” he added. “Our concern is that this individual be identified.”

Black said that while he understands the bathroom humor behind the story, he wants to determine if the female jogger has mental health issues and, if so, get her any help she needs.

Bruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West’s Mallory Square as a “reclamation party” got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.

“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”

The legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.

Harris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”

Residents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

There’s a man with a machine gun who’s killing people at a concert!”

As I rushed to put on some clothes I caught myself whispering, “No, no, not another tragedy.”

I ran downstairs and flipped on the TV, where coverage had started only moments earlier. The first thing I saw was a reporter stopping wandering people and asking what they saw. Their zombie-like responses showed they were still in shock.

One shirtless guy in a cowboy hat had been splashed with blood, which prompted the reporter to ask if he had been injured. Unaware of the crimson stains, he semi-stuttered that the blood wasn’t his own but came from a victim he had helped to carry to safety.

Another guy who looked to be in his mid-20s, when asked where his shirt was, stumbled and stammered out the reply that he took off his shirt to cover the faces of the dead.

Our nation has been repeatedly ravaged by numerous shootings of individuals, police officers and mass groups of people. On top of that, we are plagued with natural disasters, racial division, political upheaval and even nuclear missile threats from abroad.

We are a nation filled with unrest, a people who have been saturated by every tragedy as it has been plastered across our televisions, newspapers, internet and social media. We grieve for those brothers and sisters who suffer, we are repulsed and sickened by the depraved perpetrators, and we are inspired by the gallant saviors who courageously disregard their own safety at the expense of complete strangers.

Lights shine brightest on the darkest of nights and unknown heroes arise in the days of adversity.

Television networks have given airtime to those champions who scampered through gunfire in Las Vegas to help, just as they did to those who waded through floods and storm damage recently in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. But we long for more; we desire to be quenched from their personal wells that drip with honor and valor.

In those heroes who willingly trod at death’s door, we see what is good in America and a portrait of who we can and should be. It’s why, now more than ever, we need less blame, politicizing and villains. We need more exposure to the common people who epitomize courage in the midst of cowardice – those who give us hope when all hope seems to be lost.

As I watched the news coverage in the hours after the carnage in Las Vegas, I couldn’t peel my eyes from the television. By the time my TV screen went dark after 4 a.m., the details were slim but there was less focus on the murderer and more on his victims.

Those in Las Vegas were exhibiting a new kind of protest, the kind everybody watching was uniting around: a protest against death, terrorism, evil and division. They were physically, verbally and morally objecting to the mayhem that sought to instill fear, hate and darkness. Their resistance converted into shielding others from bullets, calming the wounded as they were in the throes of death and carrying victims to safety.

And let’s never forget our brave law enforcement officers – the lately vilified men and women in blue who didn’t hesitate or vacillate when called upon to apprehend a demonic madman who was mowing down the innocent.

The book of John in the Bible states that there is a type of love that is greater than any other: it is the kind that embraces death so that others might have life. It is the rare, unconventional love that is dispensed independent of merit, worth or obligation but is gifted willingly because it comes from the purest of place … self-sacrifice.

This example has been written about for over 2,000 years and contains our greatest hope and purpose for eternal peace, purpose and brotherhood.","Las Vegas shooting: America, we've witnessed a new kind of protest -- against death, terror and hate",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/las-vegas-shooting-america-weve-witnessed-new-kind-protest-against-death-terror-and-hate.html

Now, the 86-year-old and his wife, Joy, are hoping his fans will listen in again as he discusses the importance of choosing the right statin, and keeping your heart health in check.

In 1992, heart health wasn’t a major concern for the then-cohost of Live! With Regis and Kathy Lee, and he never made it a point to check in on his cholesterol. His father had heart trouble and died in his 60s, but Philbin had kept an active lifestyle and was never overweight.

But during a trip to Florida, Philbin began having chest pains and knew he should seek help. He had an angioplasty and discovered his cholesterol levels had soared to 300 mg/dL. Anything above 240mg/dL is considered high.

HOW HOCKEY FANS' HEARTS REACT TO STRESSFUL MOMENTS IN THE GAME

“I couldn’t get over it,” the Emmy-Award-winning talk show host told Fox News. “Me? 300, I mean, give me a break!”

Joy flew down to meet her husband and had a similar reaction.

“I knew Regis did not have a great diet, but to me, he was indestructible,” she told Fox News. “It never occurred to me that he would have that high of a cholesterol level.”

The pair traveled back to New York and met with his doctor who put him on his first statin, while they vowed to make some lifestyle changes that included cleaning up his diet.

“I realized we had better have him checked out and put him on a statin because I knew that I couldn’t be a watchdog to Regis,” Joy said. “I felt that we finally took control of it and he was on a statin and things were fine.”

Somewhere along the way Regis began having aches in his legs, and it was attributed to the statin he was prescribed. Rather than become part of the 50 percent who stop taking statins within one year of starting, Philbin consulted with his doctor who prescribed him a different one, and his side effects subsided.

“We were so surprised to find out that 50 percent of people taking a statin top taking it after one year,” Joy said. “I thought, ‘What are they going to do about their cholesterol?’”

BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS SHARE THEIR ADVICE

Their concern for others moved the couple to become part of the Take Cholesterol to Heart Campaign, which encourages patients to check on their heart and cholesterol health. The campaign’s website provides users with information regarding different statins and suggests helpful talking points to take to the doctor. The campaign resonates with the Philbins, who opened their home to viewers in 2008 as Regis underwent a triple bypass surgery.

“The audience always felt that they were up to date on everything Regis was doing,” Joy said, adding that he always discussed what was happening in his life while hosting Live!.

Philbin said he wants others to realize that just because one statin might not be working, it doesn’t mean another won’t be right for you.

“A lot of people just give up and say, ‘I’m not going to take it,’” Philbin said. “I didn’t do that, I stayed with it. So here I am, 86 years old. Twenty-five years on the thing and here I am!”","Regis Philbin opens up on heart issues, cholesterol health",https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/06/regis-philbin-opens-up-on-heart-issues-cholesterol-health.html

Frida, the beloved Labrador rescue dog, has been dispatched to Mexico City to help search for survivors caught in the rubble, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The brave pooch is part of the Mexican Navy’s Canine Unit. Frida, 7, has been credited with finding 52 people - 12 alive – in her career. The dog has been dispatched to a few natural disasters, including the aftermath of an earthquake in Ecuador in 2016.

Two weeks ago, the canine found a police officer’s body in Juchitan after an earthquake in Oaxaca.

Frida’s handlers have put the pup to work in Mexico City wishing she would discover survivors following a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that hit the region Tuesday, killing at least 273 people, including 137 in the capital.

So far 15 dogs have been stationed to search for bodies in the capital but Frida has quite a following. The Mexican Navy tweeted a series of photos of Frida, which garnered over 8,000 likes on Twitter.

On Tuesday, Frida was sent to the Enrique Rebsamen school in Mexico City that collapsed in the earthquake. Other emergency workers found 11 children alive and 25 people dead.

Frida worked long hours Thursday before being sent to rest.

Israel Arauz Salina, Frida’s handler, said Frida follows dogs when they appeared to have found a person.

“They act afraid,” Salinas said when dogs find a body. “That indicates to us that there is a cadaver.”

The veteran dog also trains other Labradors, ages 1 to 5, in her unit.

Yes, you want to differentiate your lineup to increase your odds at winning in tournaments, but you can't ignore the studs that are still worth their high price tags. Here are the studs to consider for Week 5:

-- --

DAK PRESCOTT, QB, Dallas ($6,800 DraftKings/$7,700 FanDuel)

Prescott has come close to 20-plus points in every game so far and has thrown for seven touchdowns in the last three games. Two of those games include road starts against the Broncos and Cardinals. Prescott adds rushing upside, too, hitting the 20-yard mark three times and running for a score in the one week when he only had 16 rushing yards. The Packers are playing better against the pass this year, but they've faced mediocre play the past two weeks and still push the pace offensively. The Cowboys, especially Prescott, will need to be aggressive to keep pace given the weakness of their own secondary. At $6,800 and $7,700, Prescott is actually a relative bargain and one of three quarterbacks with a great chance to hit 3X value.

LE'VEON BELL, RB, Pittsburgh ($9,500, $9,500)

Find a way to afford Bell this week, especially if it's a cash lineup. Bell is in line for his best game of the season. While the Jaguars are dominant against the pass, they are the third worst team against the run and just let Bilal Powell and Elijah McGuire combine for 256 rushing yards, 65 receiving yards and two touchdowns last week. Alex Collins ran for 82 yards on nine carries against them and Derrick Henry had 92 and a touchdown on 14 carries. The Jaguars just can't stop the run, and they have no shot at even limiting Bell this week.

JORDY NELSON, WR, Green Bay ($8,100/$8,600)

Going back to that Packers-Cowboys game, the Cowboys secondary is among the worst in the league. Randall Cobb is another great play this week, but when you can go with Aaron Rodgers' No. 1 man, you have to do it. Nelson is 6 for 6 on his red zone targets with four touchdowns. If the Packers are in scoring position, there is a great chance that Nelson will have an opportunity for a touchdown. On top of that, Rodgers has increased his touchdown total each week, and while he likely won't push it to five this week, he's a lock for more than one. If Davante Adams is out, Nelson becomes an even better play, as Adams has eight red zone targets of his own.

DELANIE WALKER, TE, Tennessee ($4,700/$6,000)

In Matt Cassel's one full start last year, he targeted Walker eight times. While Walker only finished with 35 yards, he did catch five passes and was second only to Rishard Matthews in targets, receptions and yards. The tight end is a quarterback's best friend when that quarterback is young, lacking in talent or both. The Dolphins defense is struggling this year, and while Coby Fleener and Austin Seferian-Jenkins didn't do much the past two weeks, the Dolphins gave up plenty to the Chargers. Hunter Henry went 7 for 7 with 80 yards and Antonio Gates caught a touchdown. Walker can get close to double-digit targets this week, returning 2X-plus value.

EAGLES DEFENSE ($3,100/$4,600)

While the Eagles secondary is one of the worst, the defensive line can get after the quarterback. That's where the upside of using this defense comes into play. Yes, the Eagles defense/special teams carries risk if they do nothing to stop Carson Palmer and company, but if they can get pressure on Palmer, he's shown to become turnover prone. Just look to the Cardinals' first game of the season. The Lions got to Palmer early and often and he ended up throwing three interceptions. Not surprisingly, the Lions scored a defensive touchdown as a result, and the Eagles already have 10 sacks, four recovered fumbles, three interceptions and a defensive touchdown of their own.",Week 5 Daily Fantasy Football Plays,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/08/week-5-daily-fantasy-football-plays.html

A crazed gunman took the lives of at least 59 people and injured more than 500 innocent country music fans at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night.

The tight-knit country music community immediately came together to commemorate those who were murdered and to stand behind the victims and their families.

Some of the industry's biggest stars like Keith Urban and Vince Gill performed at a vigil hosted by the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp and the Country Music Association drawing a reported crowd of 600 people on Monday night.

Urban serenaded the audience with Simon & Garfunkel's ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" after recalling his 9-year-old daughter asking him if he knew any of the victims.

""[Fans are] like family,"" Urban said at the vigil. ""It's the one thing about country music. It is a community. I do know those people. It just hit me.""

Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said at the emotional event, ""Love is the answer and the only thing we know.""

Country singer Lee Brice, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival two nights before the deadly shooting, told Fox News he feels ""attacked by an enemy.""

""I feel like the fans are probably reacting for the most part like I’m reacting,"" Brice told us. ""They feel the same way – they feel like they’re being attacked by an enemy but they’re not going to let that enemy win. The enemy is hate.""

""It was a tragedy of unimaginable proportions,"" Pence said as he addressed nearly 300 people at Las Vegas City Hall Saturday afternoon. ""Those we lost were taken before their time, but their names and their stories will forever be etched into the hearts of the American people.""

At the same time, federal agents started removing piles of backpacks, baby strollers and lawn chairs still strewn about the site of a country music festival that Stephen Paddock fired upon last Sunday night. Investigators remain stumped about why the reclusive 64-year-old high-stakes video poker player would shoot at the crowd from his 32nd-floor Mandalay Bay hotel room, killing 58 and wounding hundreds before killing himself.

Investigators believe a note found on a nightstand in Paddock's hotel room contained a series of numbers that helped him calculate a more precise aim, accounting for the trajectory of shots being fired from that height and the distance between his room and the concert, a law enforcement official said Saturday. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the details of the ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The unity service came after dozens of people — many wearing shirts that said ""Vegas Strong"" — marched from Mandalay Bay to City Hall. After speeches from Pence and other politicians, 58 doves were released into the air, flying in a wide arc and then disappearing into the distance as someone shouted, ""God bless America!""

Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman told the audience that the focus needs to remain on the victims, not ""that horrific senseless animal.""

Lisa Rhoads-Shook, whose brother-in-law was inside the Mandalay Bay when the shooting broke out, said she wanted to attend the unity service to be part of the conversation about change.

""I'm so sad and it's not fair, really, for us to experience another avoidable tragedy. We have to acknowledge that there is no better time to talk about gun control,"" she said. ""I don't think the Founding Fathers wanted the right to bear arms to become the right to build an arsenal in your home.""

Investigators have chased 1,000 leads and examined Paddock's politics, finances, any possible radicalization and his social behavior — typical investigative avenues that have helped uncover the motive in past shootings. But Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said there's still no clear motive.

What officers have found is that Paddock planned his attack meticulously.

He requested an upper-floor room overlooking the festival, stockpiled 23 guns, a dozen of them modified to fire continuously like an automatic weapon, and set up cameras inside and outside his room to watch for approaching officers.

“The talking points might change for Dianne Feinstein, but the underlying agenda never does,” he told Fox News.

… But her life is no more valuable than the single mom living in Chicago working the late shift who wants to own a gun and carry it to defend herself.”","National Rifle Association official Chris Cox on Sunday defended the influential group’s call last week to look into whether a gun device used in the Las Vegas shooting massacre complies with federal law -- arguing the move was not a call for a weapons ban and that gun-rights advocates welcome the effort.

“There were NRA members who were shot [in Las Vegas]. There were members who were murdered,” Cox, the NRA's executive director, told “Fox News Sunday.” “What we’re getting from NRA members is grief and fear, the same way other Americans are grieving.”

Fifty-eight people were killed and more than 500 others were wounded in the Oct. 1 Las Vegas massacre, executed by a gunman with a cache of weapons and a device that converts a semi-automatic rifle into a full-automatic one.

The NRA statement last week in part called on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to “immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law. The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.”

The statement also called the mass shooting by Stephen Paddock “evil” and made clear, as the NRA has long argued, that “banning guns from law-abiding Americans, based on the criminal act of a madman, will do nothing to prevent future attacks.”

Cox on Sunday reiterated those points, saying, “What we saw last week was pure evil. … We don’t believe that bans have ever worked on anything.”

He also said the ATF needs to “do its job” and that devices like the so-called “bump stock” that Paddock used should be “regulated differently” if they indeed convert semi-automatics into fully-automatics.

Cox also argued the country needs to look at the “broader picture,"" including the connection between mental illness and the perpetrators of mass killings, including those without the use of guns.

Republicans and other politicians in conservative parts of the country have largely voted in line with the influential lobby group’s positions on Second Amendment rights. However, Democrats largely support tougher gun laws.

Cox on Sunday argued Democrats including Hillary Clinton and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and liberal Hollywood try to politicize mass shootings as a way to limit gun ownership in the United States.

“The talking points might change for Dianne Feinstein, but the underlying agenda never does,” he told Fox News.

“Hillary Clinton ran as the most pro-gun control candidate in American history and she lost. She gets an award for hypocrisy because she will never spend a moment, a breath, without armed security surrounding her the rest of her life. … But her life is no more valuable than the single mom living in Chicago working the late shift who wants to own a gun and carry it to defend herself.”","NRA says no gun bans, but members 'in grief' after Las Vegas massacre",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/08/nra-says-no-gun-bans-but-members-in-grief-after-las-vegas-massacre.html

He recalls the first day he stepped on American soil:“It was a very beautiful day,” he says.
Instead, he started working for the Minneapolis School District and then the city’s housing authority.
Along the way, Tufaa maried and he and his wife have five children ranging in age from eight to 21.
“I believe in the American dream because I appreciate what this country can provide to people like me,” Tufaa says.","When Minneapolis entrepreneur Tashitaa Tufaa came to the United States from his native Ethiopia he quickly embodied the American spirit.

The political refugee, now in his late 40s, came to this country in 1992 with nothing to his name and worked his way up from washing dishes to running his own transportation company that still continues to grow.

Tufaa says that his drive was inspired by his adopted home.

“I had read a lot about America,” he said in a recent interview with Fox News. “Even though I had never been, I have always been a fan of the American way.”

Tuftaa was born in the Ethiopian village of Aloo and grew up working on his family’s farm with his 13 siblings until he attended an American college in Zimbabwe. He eventually returned to Ethiopia, where he was a history and English teacher until the early 90s when he decided to leave due to his native country’s changing political climate.

“I wasn’t forced to leave my country,” he says. “I just knew that it was time to leave when I saw politicians fleeing. I knew it wasn’t safe. I came here and decided not to go back.”

“Even though I had never been, I have always been a fan of the American way...” - Tashitaa Tufaa

He was granted political asylum and wound up in the city of Minneapolis, where he stayed in low-income housing with old college friends who had emigrated from Zimbabwe. He recalls the first day he stepped on American soil:

“It was a very beautiful day,” he says. “I was in downtown Minneapolis. I was amazed by the tall buildings and how clean it was compared to where I came from.”

Tufaa says that during those initial days in the U.S. it was difficult to find a job, but he never once thought about wavering.

“It was definitely hard. If you wanted a white-collar job, there were not many available,” he says. “My first job was as a dishwasher at the Minneapolis Hilton for $5.60 an hour and I thought at the time that it was great.”

Tufaa washed dishes for about ten months before moving on to a manufacturing job and a security position before enrolling in graduate school at the University of Minnesota. He continued working security jobs as he went through school.

“I would work until midnight and during the day in between my morning and afternoon classes,” he recalled. “I had few hours to sleep, but the biggest thing was these opportunities for work. We were not able to get this back home. You were lucky if you were able to get one job, here, I could get three jobs.”

Tufaa eventually graduated from school and wanted to pursue a career as a diplomat but quickly found out that he would have to be a U.S. citizen to do so (he became a citizen in 2000). Instead, he started working for the Minneapolis School District and then the city’s housing authority. He also worked extra jobs as a taxi and bus driver.

“I would leave work at 4:30 and then go drive a bus,” he says.

In 2003, he was laid off from his job with the city.

“That’s when I decided to form my own company.”

The determined Tufaa set out to market himself to school districts in the area, looking to provide transportation services for students.

“It was rough building it up,” the entrepreneur said. “On paper, my company was incorporated, but technically, I had no experience. People generally don’t trust you if you can’t show them your experience.”

In September of that year, Tufaa finally started gaining that experience when he started providing bus services to a handful of special needs students. School administrators took notice of the stellar job he did and he started receiving more and more work from the district, putting nearly all of his profits back into the business.

Eventually, Tufaa was able to establish his company, Metropolitan Transportation Network (MetroTN) and soon after he received his first large contract with the Beacon Academy School after their original bus provider went out of business mid-year. About 300 of the school’s 400 plus students ride MetroTN buses to this day.

Business continued to grow for Tufaa and MetroTN now boasts three facilities in the state, with a fourth on the way in October. The company currently includes 300 employees, including several family members who also emigrated from Ethiopia.

“They had to apply like everyone else,” he says, half-joking.

Along the way, Tufaa maried and he and his wife have five children ranging in age from eight to 21.

He looks to continue the expansion of MetroTN and serve other facets of public transportation in the city he has called home for nearly 25 years.

“I believe in the American dream because I appreciate what this country can provide to people like me,” Tufaa says.

As of 8 p.m. ET, Nate was located about 10 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River and about 100 miles south of Biloxi, Miss. Nate was a Category 1 storm with maximum winds of 90 mph. Forecasters also said Nate could dump 3 to 6 inches of rain on the region — with isolated totals of up to 10 inches.

Mississippi's six southern-most counties declared a state of emergency, with the state's emergency management director calling Nate ""the worst hurricane that has impacted Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina.""

""Everyone needs to understand that,"" Lee Smithson told reporters. ""this is a significantly dangerous situation.""

Nate was expected to pass to the east of New Orleans, sparing the city its most ferocious winds and storm surge. However, the storm could pose a major test for the city's fragile pumping and drainage system. Key weaknesses - including the failure of some pumps and power-generating turbines - were exposed after an Aug. 5 deluge flooded homes and businesses in some sections of the city. City officials imposed a 7 p.m. curfew for Saturday.

On Alabama's Dauphin Island, water had already begun washing over the road Saturday on the island's low-lying west end, said Mayor Jeff Collier. The storm was projected to bring storm surges from seven to 11 feet near the Alabama-Mississippi state line. Some of the biggest impacts could be at the top of funnel-shaped Mobile Bay.

The window for preparing ""is quickly closing,"" Alabama Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Hastings said.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned residents of the Panhandle to prepare for Nate's impact.

The governor said Saturday that residents in evacuation zones in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties should heed the warnings and seek safe shelter from the storm. He said shelters will be available to people who have nowhere else to go.

""Hurricane Nate is expected to bring life-threatening storm surges, strong winds and tornadoes that could reach across the Panhandle,"" Scott said. The evacuations affect roughly 100,000 residents in the western Panhandle.

The Pensacola International Airport announced it will close at 6 p.m. Saturday and remain closed on Sunday.

However, the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport remained open Saturday.

""The airport does not close,"" spokeswoman Michelle Wilcut said. ""We are urging customers to check with their specific airlines to see whether their flights have been canceled because there have been some of those.""

Waterside sections of New Orleans, outside the city's levee system, were under an evacuation order. About 2,000 people were affected. But not everyone was complying.

Gabriel Black of New Orleans' Venetian Isles community sent his wife, a friend, and three dogs to a hotel in the city. Black stayed behind because an 81-year-old neighbor refused to leave.

""I know it sounds insane, but he has bad legs and he doesn't have anybody who can get to him,"" Black said.

Others nearby were staying as well. Nancy and Cleve Bell said their house is built so high off the ground that it stayed dry in the floods after Hurricane Katrina. Nancy Bell said they have a generator and plenty of supplies, and will be safe.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he spoke with President Trump on Saturday morning. ""He assured me that LA would have all the assistance we need as we prepare for #Nate,"" the governor posted on Twitter.

The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane warning was in effect from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Florida border. A hurricane warning was also in effect for metropolitan New Orleans and nearby Lake Pontchartrain. Tropical storm warnings extended west of Grand Isle to Morgan City, Louisiana, and around Lake Maurepas and east of the Alabama-Florida border to the Okaloosa-Walton County line in the Florida Panhandle.

But there were items that were off limits.

Bell said he put up “do not touch” notes around his Star Trek memorabilia.

In the suits, Altman claims that Google, Facebook and Twitter have allowed their social media platforms to be used as a tool to recruit jihadists and that these companies have even profited from advertisements on terrorist propaganda.
Companies like Facebook and YouTube have interpreted that to mean they are not liable for what their users post on their sites.
“We are committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook,” the spokesperson said in an email.
“If we win just one of these cases it is going to be like an atomic bomb went off at these social media companies,” he said.","A lawyer who earned his degree through a correspondence course and works for a company called 1-800-LAW-FIRM may seem like an odd choice to lead a series of potentially precedent-setting lawsuits against some of the world’s most powerful social media companies.

But judging Keith Altman by his resume would be underestimating the 49-year-old lawyer and his quest to make tech giants like Facebook, Twitter and Google liable for allegedly providing “material support” to followers of terror groups who commit mass murder.

“These cases seem impossible but they can have a real impact,” Altman told Fox News. “This is about holding these companies accountable for allowing terrorists to radicalize people through social media channels.”

Altman’s ambitious effort to take on the social media giants has been dismissed by some legal experts but others say the lawsuits have potential to shake up the industry and force major changes.

Starting in June 2016 while representing the family of Nohemi Gonzalez – the only American killed during the 2015 Paris terror attacks – and drawing on his previous experience taking on pharmaceutical giants, Altman has filed six lawsuits to date. In the suits, Altman claims that Google, Facebook and Twitter have allowed their social media platforms to be used as a tool to recruit jihadists and that these companies have even profited from advertisements on terrorist propaganda.

Besides the Gonzalez family, Altman represents families of victims from terror attacks in Dallas, San Bernardino, Istanbul, Barcelona and those killed at during the shooting at the Orlando nightclub last June.

“I filed that suit at 5 p.m. and had my first date with my now fiancee an hour later,” Altman said. “For the first half of the date, I was being bombarded with calls from every news organization you can think of to make a comment.”

At the heart of all these lawsuits is the interpretation of a provision tucked deep inside the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 called Section 230.

The language of Section 230 states that “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" Companies like Facebook and YouTube have interpreted that to mean they are not liable for what their users post on their sites.

“Section 230 is a free pass to online service providers as long as they act only as a pass-through,” Mark Bartholomew, a professor at the University Of Buffalo School Of Law, told Fox News. “If you set up a place for people to talk, but don't communicate on it yourself, then you are basically immune from prosecution.”

Section 230 of the CDA was implemented to help protect social media sites in their nascent years. But Altman and others have begun to argue that social media sites may be violating the provision with their heavily guarded algorithms and that these companies have the resources to monitor any terror activity on their platforms.

Altman – who before going into law developed litigation support tools and trial presentation software – said that computer programs can be developed that can filter certain key words like jihad and ISIS, shut down suspicious accounts and look out for accounts that send out mass follow and friend requests – all telltale signs of terror propaganda.

“Give me a weekend and I could write programs that do all of these things and more,” he said. “So how can these guys say with a straight face that they can’t do it?”

A spokesperson for Facebook told Fox News that the social media site does not allow any terrorist activity on its website.

“We are committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our Community Standards make clear that there is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it’s reported to us.”

A representatives from Twitter told Fox News the company does not comment on pending legislation. Google did not immediately reply to Fox News’ request for comment.

Altman is realistic about his and his client’s chances of succeeding in court, but says the real battle is going to take place in appellate courts and possibly even the Supreme Court.

“If we win just one of these cases it is going to be like an atomic bomb went off at these social media companies,” he said.

Experts in social media law don’t disagree with Altman that a victory for any his clients would create a massive sea change in the tech world, but note that it will be a tough fight to get courts to rule against Section 230.

“It sounds like a good idea, but when you get down into the weeds it get complicated,” Thaddeus Hoffmeister, a law professor at the University of Dayton and author of “Social Media in the Courtroom: A New Era for Criminal Justice?” told Fox News.

Hoffmeister says questions like how to define terrorist activity, how far does the censorship go and how do you differentiate between domestic and international terrorism are just a few of the roadblocks that Altman’s lawsuits could run into.

Whether or not any of Altman’s lawsuits are successful, experts contend that, at the very least, they are bringing light to the issue and creating a conversation that might force companies to be held more accountable.

“When he starts rattling the saber, it makes companies take action and do something about it,” Hoffmeister said. “These lawsuits add fuel to the fire.”","Lawyer takes on Google, Facebook, Twitter over terror videos",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/06/lawyer-takes-on-google-facebook-twitter-over-terror-videos.html

“My instincts told me that Donald was smart and funny,” Ivana Trump writes.","“I have a perfect life.” -- That’s how Ivana Trump, the first wife of President Donald Trump, sums up her current situation, 25 years after their messy, highly publicized divorce.

These days, Ivana writes in her new memoir, “Raising Trump,” she enjoys regular conversations with her ex, and has nothing but praise for their three children.

In fact, the proud mother writes that she wouldn’t be surprised if at least one more Trump occupies the White House in the years to come – daughter Ivanka.

“Maybe in fifteen years, she could run for president?” Ivana Trump writes, while also considering what her own title would be.

“First Lady? Holds no appeal for me personally,” she writes. “First Mother? That could work.”

Ivana Trump’s seeming contentment with the way her life has turned out might not have been predictable in 1992, the year of her infamous split from the man she famously nicknamed “The Donald.”

In the book – an early copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press -- Ivana writes that she knew her marriage was doomed not long after a day in December 1989.

""This young blonde woman approached me out of the blue and said ‘I'm Marla and I love your husband. Do you?’”



“I said ‘Get lost. I love my husband.’ It was unladylike but I was in shock.”

Donald Trump’s public affair with Marla Maples spawned the infamous ""Best Sex I've Ever Had"" headline in the New York Post in 1990. After divorcing Ivana Trump, the future president married Maples in 1993.

""Raising Trump"" is set to be released next week.

In the book, Ivana writes glowingly about her marriage to Trump and her prominent role at the Trump Organization. But then she unburdens herself about the heartache that Trump's affair with Maples caused her and the couple's three children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric.

She says Donald Jr. didn't speak to his father for a year after the split.

“I can only shake my head at how it insane it was,"" Ivana Trump writes. ""I couldn't turn on the television without hearing my name.”

But she and the president have returned to far warmer terms. She writes that they speak about once a week and that she encourages him to keep using Twitter.

Much of the book is spent recounting Ivana Trump's childhood in Europe, her burgeoning modeling career in New York and Trump's courtship. She writes that, at their first meeting, Trump secured her and friends a table at a hot Manhattan restaurant, paid the check and chauffeured her back to her hotel in a giant Cadillac.

“My instincts told me that Donald was smart and funny,” Ivana Trump writes. “An all-America good guy.”

The “hack,” demonstrated by food blogger Bev Weidner, is for peanut butter “slices” and it involves smooth peanut butter, parchment paper and a freezer – and a lot of confusion.

GLADWARE'S CONTAINER LIDS ARE BLOWING PEOPLE'S MINDS

For her tutorial, Weidner first takes a jar of peanut butter and spreads “globbies” onto a sheet of parchment paper with a wooden spoon. She then smooths out a hefty offering of the nutty spread before folding the parchment paper over the top of the butter and rolling it out a couple of times with a rolling pin. From there, she places the peanut butter in the freezer.

In the Facebook video, which had 8.6 million views as of Sunday, Weidner says the frozen peanut butter can be cut into slices and then placed on the bread easily.

“It comes to room temperature semi-quickly, but you have time to drizzle it with maybe some honey on top, some chocolate sprinkles. Kid's love it,” Weidner says.

This method, Weidner explains, prevents mess and “torn bread” from spreading the peanut butter right out of the jar.

Facebook is less convinced.

The video has received over 11,000 comments with most of them questioning the need to add steps in making a peanut butter sandwich.

“Because nothing is easier than spreading peanut butter on waxed paper, rolling it flat with a rolling pin, freezing it overnight, then cutting the frozen sheets of peanut butter into bread sized squares and using them to make your honey and peanut butter sandwiches.....” a user commented.

Another said, “I cant(sic) be the only one that doesn't have an issue spreading peanut butter.”

A few joked about the length freezing the peanut butter would take.

“The time it took to spread it on wax paper, smooth it with a rolling pin, freeze it and then cut it with scissors, I could have made you 308 peanut butter sandwiches.”

“Child-‘Mama? Can I have a peanut butter sandwich please?’

Another mass shooting has spurred another rush to judgment. After the Las Vegas shooting, Democrats complain about Republican leniency on the gun industry. But White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has flipped the argument.

And she's right.

“It’s not a compliment,” she declared.

“By making the selfie, both the objectifier and the object are assembled in one composition. Myself, as the object, standing in front of the catcallers represents the reversed power ratio which is caused by this project.”

It’s remarkable how many men are happy to smile and pose for her pictures, considering their creepy and downright offensive comments.

She claims a number of them actually followed her for a lengthy period, with one much older man even asking her to get into his car.

Others demanded to know why she wasn’t smiling, and repeatedly called her “baby” or made kissing noises as she passed.

In just over a month, she’s accumulated more than 90,000 followers — the vast majority of whom appear to be women who strongly support her project.

“Thank you for all the support and messages,” she wrote in a recent post.

“It has made it clear that catcalling is still a common occurrence that many of us are dealing with.”

The mural, located in the author’s hometown of Springfield, features illustrations from the author's first children's book, ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street.""

Three children's authors declined an invitation to the museum's inaugural Children's Literature Festival, which was set for Oct. 14 before being canceled. After the museum offered to take down the mural, the authors said they would attend, but the museum has not said if the festival is back on.

Authors Mo Willems, Mike Curato and Lisa Yee signed a letter and posted it to social media explaining why they take issue with the mural's depiction.

""We recently learned that a key component of this institution honoring Dr. Seuss features a mural depicting a scene from his first book, 'And to Think That I Saw It on Mullberry Street,' and within the selected art is a jarring racial stereotype of a Chinese man, who is depicted with chopsticks, a pointed hat and slanted slit eyes,"" the complaint reads. ""We find this caricature of 'the Chinaman' deeply hurtful, and we have concerns about children's exposure to it.""

The Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno slammed the authors’ criticism and museum’s decision to remove the mural, asking “where do we draw the line?”

“This is political correctness at its worst, and this is what is wrong with our country,” he said in a statement, according to WWLP. “We have extreme fringe groups on both the right and the left dictating an agenda to divide instead of working together towards the betterment of our country.”

The museum said Thursday that the mural will be replaced by images from later books.

""This is what Dr. Seuss would have wanted us to do. His later books, like 'The Sneetches' and 'Horton Hears a Who,' showed a great respect for fairness and diversity,"" a statemen from the Museum read, via MassLive. ""Dr. Seuss would have loved to be a part of this dialogue for change. In fact, Ted Geisel himself said, 'It's not how you start that counts. It's what you are at the finish.'""

The image in question can be seen in the video above.

Emojipedia founder Jeremy Burge said vomiting face, along with the giraffe and sauropod dinosaur, had generated the most discussion from the site’s users.

They’ll be joined by much-anticipated expressions, such as ‘swear face’ and ‘mind-blown,’ food including broccoli and dumplings, fantasy figures like vampires and zombies, and the last remaining heart in the colour rainbow when Apple releases its latest software update next week.

Even a bearded man and yoga masters will make an appearance for the hipster crowd.

The new additions are part of a 2017 emoji update decided upon by emoji non-profit governing body, the Unicode Consortium, who sets the global standard for the colorful characters and ensures they can work across software platforms.

But the Apple updates will arrive at a challenging time for emoji, amid claims a Facebook-owned app has stolen the iPhone company’s thunder, and amid less blob-shaped emoji from Google.

The iOS 11.1 download will unlock cartoon-like characters including a woman breastfeeding a baby, fairies of both genders, dinosaurs and zebras, three gender neutral characters of different hair colours and ages, and a woman wearing a purple headscarf.

The latter made the cut following the success of The Hijab Emoji Project launched by 15-year-old German teenager Rayouf Alhumedhi who could not find an emoji that represented her.

The emoji smiley face will also adopt more expressions in this generation, including star struck, investigative (complete with monocle), and a vomiting emoji that appears to have eaten too much salad.

Emojipedia founder Jeremy Burge said vomiting face, along with the giraffe and sauropod dinosaur, had generated the most discussion from the site’s users.

“Personally, I’m looking forward to the new shushing face, and the face with the raised eyebrow,” he said. “I feel like these fill some gaps in my emoji communications range.”

The fifth generation of emoji will contain up to 69 new characters, according to Emojipedia, bringing the total number of approved emoji to 2666 as of June.

But Apple’s new release might have been spoiled somewhat by Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which released what appear to be copycat versions of Apple’s new emoji designs this week, including the new additions such as wizards and zombies.

Keep in mind that online ads aren’t necessarily a bad thing.","Is this just a coincidence? You recently looked at cameras online, and now you’re seeing ads for cameras. You were browsing new outfits, and now your browser is showing ads for shirts and trousers.

Not long ago, “interest-based advertising” creeped out a lot of people who couldn’t understand why Facebook, for example, knew what they had just shopped for on Amazon. The truth is that personalized ads are the result of a very impersonal process.

Interest-based advertising crunches bits of data gathered from your browser to make marketing more efficient. Special algorithms analyze your visits over time and across different websites, making it possible to predict your preferences and show ads that are likely to interest you.

But sometimes, all this tracking can be overwhelming. While the process is basically automatic and unmanned, interest-based ads can feel like an invasion of privacy. That’s why many people look for ways to throw the trackers off their scent.

Here are three simple ways to do just that.

1. Wipe out history, turn off cookies

To start, you’ll want a clean slate. You should eliminate any trace of your past searches by clearing all the browsing data, history, cache and cookies from your web browsers.

Next, disable or limit tracking on your gadget, including on favorite services like Facebook. If you’re not sure how how to do this, click here for the steps to wipe out where you’ve been and what you’ve done. Next, make sure to delete third-party advertising cookies. Click here to learn how to remove them and prevent them from coming back.

When you’re finished, take a moment to test your browser with an online security and privacy checker. I like the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s tool that shows you the information about the browser you’re using and your risk level. Click here for the free download and more details.

2. Opt out of ads

You may notice only a handful of culprits, but many companies use algorithms to track your behavior and send you targeted ads.

Thankfully, there’s a way for you to opt out of interest-based, or “behavioral,” ads. The Digital Advertising Alliance lets you review its participating partners. When you first visit the DAA, the websites will scan your computer. Once the scan is complete, you’ll be shown a list of partners advertising directly to you.

From there, you can learn more about the practices these companies use for interest-based ads. You can opt out using “opt-out cookies” that are stored in your browser with your preferences.

Click here for the steps to opt-out of this form of online targeted advertising.

3. Go incognito

Every major web browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera — has private, or incognito, browsing. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies, including ad-tracking cookies, and your computer won’t record your browsing history. It’s almost like you were never online.

When your browser is in private browsing mode, it will show a special icon. In Firefox, it’s a mask; in Chrome, it’s a little spy; in Edge, it’s “InPrivate.” These all indicate that you’re in incognito or private mode.

Private browsing will keep your computer safe from casual snoopers. Someone who jumps on your computer won’t see where you’ve been.

The media mogul is the ultimate bro-choicer, an adoring donor to the Democratic Party, defended by some of the left’s most powerful women.

Weinstein has been accused in a lengthy New York Times story of doing some truly horrendous things to women, totally unsolicited − also known as sexual harassment − over a period of nearly three decades. His alleged victims were talented young actresses and other women who had the potential to build successful careers on their own without some ugly, creepy man coercing them into giving him a massage or worse.

Gross.

But this is Hollywood, and the feminists are the women who defend creeps like Weinstein.

Anita Dunn, a close associate of President Obama who became his communications director for a time at the White House, has been reported to have counseled Weinstein after the allegations broke in the media.

Even more troubling is that celebrity women’s advocate attorney Lisa Bloom is representing Weinstein. This is a woman who has represented victims in high-profile sexual harassment cases. Throwing that legacy away, she agreed to represent Weinstein, whom she said she has counseled that “times have changed” and he “needs to evolve into a higher standard.” Really?

Bloom’s reasoning regarding Weinstein gets better, though: “He has acknowledged mistakes he has made. He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways. He wants to reach out to any of the women who may have issues with him to talk to them in a respectful, peaceful way, with me present if that is acceptable to them.”

I hope Bloom has a better answer for the women who Weinstein is accused of sexually harassing and forcing to look at him half-clothed or with no clothes at all, with tears in their eyes, as he emotionally blackmailed them for sex.

But this is Hollywood. This is Hugh Hefner’s world. This is the liberal paradise of promoting equal rights and justice for women, yet defending the men who use them for their own satisfaction, discarding them for younger versions every year, and then complaining about it years later when the women finally have the courage to say “enough!”

This is not true feminism. Supporting men who tear down women for their own use, supporting free access to taxpayer-funded abortion so men can cover up their own conduct, and mistreating women for decades is nothing for women to get behind.

By Jonah Goldberg, The New York Post



An old rule of thumb holds that when someone says it’s not about the money, it’s really about the money.

But there are exceptions to almost every rule. The National Rifle Association is a case in point.

In the wake of the horror in Las Vegas this week, countless politicians, journalists and commentators are insisting that the National Rifle Association has a “stranglehold” on the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton claimed that the GOP-controlled Congress simply does “whatever they are told to do” by the NRA and the gun lobby.

The New York Times listed total NRA donations to certain GOP politicians alongside their statements offering condolences and prayers for the victims in Las Vegas. And the op-ed pages have been suffused with claims that the NRA has bought Republicans with blood money, stifling the popular will and thwarting democracy in the process.

And it’s what I saw when I met the men and women from Team Rubicon last weekend in Wharton, Texas.
Since that first mission, Team Rubicon has expanded and has been moving into disasters ever since to lend a hand.
Even though they were strangers, Team Rubicon worked together as though they had known each other many years.
Look for the helpers.","2017 has been a year that will go down in history as one of the worst in terms of weather disasters. Three major hurricanes – Harvey, Irma and Maria roared ashore in just a few weeks of each other – devastating islands, inundating major U.S. cities and causing catastrophic damage.

As a meteorologist, we do our best to warn as many people of a potential disaster. Thankfully, the science is getting better and we have more tools to help forecast these forces of nature to better prepare the public. But there’s always going to be the chance that one storm hits your neighborhood with tragic consequences.

One of the things that brings me hope after these horrible weather events hits is the outpouring of community and support that comes in the wake of these storms. Mr. Rogers, the friendly sweater-wearing man I used to watch every morning on television, took notice of this as well. He wrote and spoke about it often:

“I was spared from any great disasters when I was little, but there was plenty of news of them in newspapers and on the radio, and there were graphic images of them in newsreels.

For me, as for all children, the world could have come to seem a scary place to live. But I felt secure with my parents, and they let me know that we were safely together whenever I showed concern about accounts of alarming events in the world.

There was something else my mother did that I’ve always remembered: ‘Always look for the helpers,’ she’d tell me. ‘There’s always someone who is trying to help.’ I did, and I came to see that the world is full of doctors and nurses, police and firemen, volunteers, neighbors and friends who are ready to jump in to help when things go wrong.”

Always look for the helpers. We saw this most recently in the aftermath of the horrifying attack in Las Vegas – everyday people stepping forward to help those in need.

And it’s what I saw when I met the men and women from Team Rubicon last weekend in Wharton, Texas.

The history of this special group of helpers began in 2010 after the Haiti Earthquake. Two Marines, Jake Wood and William McNulty, wanted to help. They teamed up with six other veterans and first responders, gathered funds and supplies from friends and family, rented a truck and went in to help.

Since that first mission, Team Rubicon has expanded and has been moving into disasters ever since to lend a hand. They pair the skills and experience of military veterans with first responders and medical professionals.

In Wharton, Texas, I found these hard working-men and women with their grey shirts moving flood-ravaged furniture and debris, cleaning up a community center so that residents could congregate, getting essentials and finding help for those returning to their flooded homes.

Even though they were strangers, Team Rubicon worked together as though they had known each other many years. When I asked them why they do this, they’d tell me it part of their DNA – as former servicemen and servicewomen, they continue to want to serve even after retirement. One army veteran, Rob, told me you can sit and watch the news and want to do something, but to really do something – get up and get out there.

I spoke with a team of several men and women from Australia that had travelled over 30 hours to come to the small town of Wharton to spread some “Aussie hope” and to remind people that what brings us together as human beings far outweighs what divides us. It doesn’t matter what race, religion, or color you are or where you come from. No one is talking politics when they are picking up dirty, flood-torn children’s books from a school desk, or peeling away moldy wallpaper and artwork from a classroom wall.

A resident of Wharton, Texas, who was gathering supplies such as cleaning items, diapers and food for her community told me she was in love with these teams of strangers who came in and were lending a hand. She said it made her heart feel great that people all over the world think about others. “When you have a serving heart” she told me, “it means everything.”

I came away from that experience with a heart full of hope and a much stronger spirit than I had before I arrived in Wharton. I hugged a lot of people and told them they made me want to be better as a mom, wife, sister and as a human being. I too, wanted to be a helper.

As my friend Jake Wood, team leader and CEO of his wonderful Team Rubicon organization, told me, “There’s nothing more American than getting out and helping your neighbors.”

MGM Resorts has increased its level of security to add to the level of comfort and safety of our guests and employees,” MGM Resorts spokesperson Debra DeShong said in a statement.

“MGM Resorts works consistently with local and national law enforcement agencies to keep procedures at our resorts up to date, and are always improving and evolving. We continue that close working relationship now during the ongoing investigation into this tragic incident,” DeShong added.

Despite any official plans in place, experts have speculated what will happen with the aforementioned room. ""From my opinion, the room disappears,"" said Anthony Melchiorri, host of Travel Channel's ""Hotel Impossible,"" to Business Insider.

Melchiorri added that, if he were running the resprt, the room would no longer be available to book. He also suggests the hotel go so far as to have the doors sealed up, and never reopened.

Others suggest the suite be completely renovated, as other hotels have done when someone dies in a hotel room. Sunil Atreya, an associate professor at the College of Hospitality Management at Johnson & Wales University, has worked in management for Marriott and Holiday Inn hotels in the U.S. says the room will likely be gutted, refurbished and renumbered, at a minimum, or transformed into something else entirely, like storage space or a boardroom. He thinks it’s possible Mandalay Bay might even refurbish the entire 32nd floor.

“For people to go on — whether it be survivors, the families of the victims or employees — something has to happen so that that room does not stay as a reminder of this heinous act that took place in our country,” Atreya told Yahoo News.

But regardless of what happens to the room in the future, Atreya says the broken windows in Paddock’s suite need to be repaired immediately so as not to serve as a constant reminder of the horrific attack that took place.",Las Vegas shooting: What will happen to the shooter's suite at Mandalay Bay?,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/2017/10/06/las-vegas-shooting-what-will-happen-to-shooters-suite-at-mandalay-bay.html

Jennifer was shopping for a new look on LuLaRoe – an online-only retailer that sells straight to consumers from consultants, a little like Avon. Jennifer was chatting with a LuLaRoe seller in a Facebook group, trying to secure the sale of an “Amelia” style dress.

The dress — a simple knit frock with a cinched waist and pockets — was apparently available from this seller's Halloween catalog, and Jennifer messaged the seller, expressing interest.

A post shared by Yulis_posh (@yulis_posh) on Oct 2, 2017 at 7:14pm PDT

The conversation with the seller started on a strange note – Jennifer claimed her mother had suffered a stroke. The seller told Jennifer not to “worry about that” and that she was “praying for [her] mom.” Jennifer responded that she just “didn’t want [the seller] to sell it to someone else,” because she “love[d] it.”

The text exchange, which the seller uploaded screenshots of, ended there … until three hours later, when the seller got a message that she said “shook me to my core.”

“I am going through my wife’s phone,” the person wrote, via Jennifer’s account, to the seller. “She was on the way to [redacted] this morning and was hit head on by a person texting and did not make it. This is her husband. How do I pay this bill? I know how much she wanted this and I am going to have her buried in it.”

The seller was skeptical, and re-posted the strange message in a LuLaRoe Facebook group. Others in the group were similarly dubious about the claim.

“You don’t think he would have more important things to do like being at the hospital, etc with the remains, instead of buying Lula?” one said.

“I’ll bet it’s not true. Wouldn’t you think she would have taken her phone with her?? He was texting from her phone … I don’t believe that!” wrote another.

In order to test whether or not the message was legitimate, the seller reached out to Jennifer and said, “Hey girl! You’re the winner of a free Lula item in my group! Congratulations!”

Soon after, the seller received a response from Jennifer saying, “Omg I never win anything! What style can I choose from? I live in [redacted] so can you send it to me?”

The seller immediately confronted Jennifer: “I just saw a post where someone messaged from this profile about his wife dying? Is that true?”

Jennifer vehemently denied the claim, writing back, “Do what? From my profile? It is absolutely not true! What group is this in? This is crazy!” adding, “My husband is at work and hasn’t even been around my phone.”

An hour later, Jennifer — who blocked the original seller and removed herself from the Facebook group — popped back up, claiming to have “been in touch with the police” and that they had discovered that someone had “hacked into” her account.

“They also sent [redacted] a message and if she doesn’t take this down, I am pressing charges against her,” Jennifer wrote. “I did not message from her, order from her … nothing! It’s crazy! I wrote a police report out against the person who did this and they are being arrested.”

Her quick police work caught the attention of others in the Facebook group, who jokingly tagged the police department. “A+ work on the Jennifer [redacted] Facebook case. Arrested within the hour,"" one person wrote.

Someone who knew the original seller also commented that she had sold some leggings to Jennifer in the past, and after Jennifer received them, Jennifer tried to stop payment on the check so she wouldn’t be charged for them.

In another twist, after the original screenshots of Jennifer's message went viral, another woman who claimed to know Jennifer said it was Jennifer’s ex-husband who had hacked into her account and said she died. Though Facebook users have been quick to question what the ex-husband would have to gain from requesting the LuLaRoe dress. Also, the hacker that Jennifer claimed the police had “found out” about was a woman, as she herself had said earlier.

It is still unknown whether Jennifer was or wasn’t hacked — or if Jennifer is her real name, since there are three different Facebook profiles with the same name and pictures — but she did respond to the seller’s accusations.

Jennifer did, however, post a one-star rating of the seller, along with an extremely long review, where she claimed to work for the government. She also said that she had in fact ordered the Amelia dress that she initially alleged she hadn’t, and the LuLaRoe seller ripped her off by taking her money and not sending the products.",Woman may have faked her own death for LuLaRoe dress,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/05/woman-may-have-faked-her-own-death-for-lularoe-dress.html

Home remedies for cancerCancer has long been targeted by people promoting natural therapies.","In a world where you can fix almost anything with a do-it-yourself video on YouTube, you might think curing your own illness would be a piece of cake.

It might be if it weren’t for a couple of (not so small) sticking points.

One, the home remedy recommended by your friend — or one of the many websites promoting “natural therapies” — might not work.

And two, it could make you sicker or even kill you.

That’s exactly what happened to an Australian man who developed cyanide poisoning after taking high doses of apricot kernel extract, hoping to prevent his prostate cancer from returning.

BABY DIED AFTER PARENTS REFUSED TREATMENT FOR JAUNDICE, POLICE SAY

This “superfood” is touted as having anticancer properties. It’s a claim that has no reliable scientific evidence to back it up.

Apricot kernel extract isn’t alone in peddling hope alongside an increased risk of harming your health.

People use home remedies for a variety of reasons — fighting cancer, losing weight, increasing sex drive, or reducing symptoms of illnesses that have few medical treatments available.

Most home remedies or natural therapies, though, haven’t been put through the same rigorous clinical testing you expect from pharmaceutical medications.

So, does that mean you should ignore them completely?

Not necessarily. It’s more a matter of approaching them with a healthy dose of skepticism.

Dr. Harriet Hall, a retired family physician, former Air Force flight surgeon, and author of the SkepDoc column in Skeptic magazine, is one of those leading the charge against medical “treatments” not supported by science.

Like others in the medical and scientific community, Hall is bothered that many questionable home remedies that might once have been called quackery, folk medicine, or fringe medicine now take shelter under the “alternative medicine” umbrella.

“There is no such thing as ‘alternative medicine.’ There is only medicine that has been tested and proven to work, and medicine that hasn’t,” Hall told Healthline. “Alternative medicine is a marketing term, not a scientific one.”

Natural isn’t always healthy

It’s common for people to think that “natural” means healthy.

But many natural things can kill you — asbestos, ionizing radiation from radon, poison hemlock, and deadly nightshade, just to name a few.

As surprising as it may seem, some herbal supplements sold in reputable natural food stores or pharmacies can also harm you, even at doses recommended on the package.

Supplements may be toxic all by themselves, contaminated with another compound that is toxic, or interact with prescription medications.

Despite the risk of dangerous interactions between supplements and medications, only about one-third of people tell their doctor about the supplements they’re taking, according to one study.

Children are especially at risk of poisoning from herbal or dietary supplements.

A study published this summer found that calls made to poison control centers across the country about herbal and dietary supplements increased almost 50 percent between 2005 and 2012.

MOM GETS JAIL OVER REFUSAL TO VACCINATE SON

Dietary supplements were the top reason for the calls, followed by herbal, hormonal, and other products.

Serious medical problems occurred in about 4 percent of these calls. Ninety-five percent of the serious cases were in children under 6 years old. The majority of these poisonings were unintentional.

One reason for the popularity of herbal supplements is that they’re easy to buy — no visit to the doctor or prescription needed. They’re the ultimate health DIY.

There’s also little government regulation of these products. If companies don’t make claims that their product can treat or cure a health condition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) won’t bother with them.

Until there’s a problem.

Last year, the FDA issued a warning that homeopathic baby teething tablets and gels may pose a risk to infants and children.

Homeopathic remedies are based on the idea that “like cures like.” Small amounts of substances — sometimes toxic — are used to cure symptoms that those substances would cause at higher doses.

The teething tablets contained the poisonous plant belladonna, except in higher amounts than listed on the label.

The FDA investigation turned up more than 400 reports of bad reactions to these products over the past six years. Reactions included tremor, fever, and shortness of breath.

In 10 cases, children died.

On top of the dangers of some homeopathic remedies, there’s little evidence that they’re effective treatments for any condition.

The United Kingdom’s National Health Service recently decided to stop using government funds to pay for homeopathic treatments.

The debate over homeopathy, though, isn’t just about a lack of clinical trials.

One guiding principal of homeopathy is that the more you dilute the active ingredient in water or alcohol, the greater the therapeutic benefit.

Critics say that for this to work, we’d have to radically change what we know about biology, physics, and chemistry.

“Homeopathy not only doesn’t work, but couldn’t possibly work,” said Hall.

Home remedies for cancer

Cancer has long been targeted by people promoting natural therapies.

One study estimates that use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by cancer patients in 18 countries rose from 25 percent in the 1970s to 49 percent after 2000. Use of these products was highest in the United States.

Another study found that herbal supplements were the most commonly used home remedy for cancer, followed by homeopathy, vitamin and mineral supplements, medicinal teas, spiritual therapies, and relaxation techniques.

One of the most popular therapies is Essiac tea, which has been promoted as a cancer treatment since the 1920s. This herbal blend contains burdock root, sheep sorrel herb, slippery elm bark, Turkish rhubarb root, and sometimes other ingredients.

Despite its long reputation as an anticancer remedy, no clinical trials of Essiac have been completed and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Unlike apricot kernel extract, the side effects of Essiac are less severe, but they do include nausea, vomiting, increased bowel movements, and slight headaches.

DIET OF LAMB AND CHEERIOS LEADS TO BOY'S VISION LOSS

Another home remedy for cancer is the Gerson method. It involves following a strict diet, drinking lots of fresh fruit and vegetable juices, taking dietary supplements, and giving yourself coffee enemas.

Although some studies on the Gerson method have been published, none were the rigorous randomized clinical trials that are needed to determine if this home remedy actually helps.

Three people have also died as a result of giving themselves coffee enemas. They can throw off your normal blood chemistry if you do them too often.

There are many more home remedies for treating cancer, with side effects ranging from minor to severe.

But even natural therapies for cancer that don’t kill you directly can still kill you.

In a study published earlier this year, Yale researchers looked at the survival rates of 840 patients with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer.

People who chose to use only alternative medicine treatments had a higher risk of dying compared to those who used conventional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or hormone therapy.

There’s also the fact that people spend a lot of money on unproven treatments.

According to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 83 million adults spent almost $34 billion out-of-pocket on CAM therapies that year. This accounts for 1.5 percent of the total healthcare spending in the United States.

Why people turn to home remedies

One study found that people are more likely to use herbal supplements if they’re uninsured, use more prescription and over-the-counter medications, or have certain health conditions.

Other research has found higher herbal supplement use among women and people with a higher education.

Some of the most common conditions that people try to treat with herbs include colds, stomach or intestinal illnesses, and problems like rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis. These are all conditions that have few effective medical treatments available.

A person’s culture may also influence their use of CAM therapies. For example, botanical medicine is important to many indigenous cultures in Mexico and the Southwestern United States. Chinese herbal medicine has been for centuries by Chinese people and Chinese-Americans.

These studies try to explain why people turn to home remedies in the first place.

ONE SHOT FOR ALL VACCINES? STUDY SHOWS PROMISE

But a bigger question is why people use home remedies that don’t have any scientific evidence showing that they’re effective.

The Australian man who developed cyanide poisoning from taking apricot kernel extract — a mix of a supplement he purchased and a brew he made at home — apparently had a “scientific background,” according to an anesthetist at the hospital where he was treated.

His doctors also warned the man about the risks of the extract, saying the cyanide was blocking the cells in his body from getting the oxygen they needed to survive.

He still refused to give up his daily ritual.

Our Paleo brains drive us

In a post on Skeptic, Hall suggests that human evolution has made it easy for us to fall into the trap of thinking that an herb might cure our cancer, that burning a candle in our ear could improve our overall health, or that a homeopathic remedy diluted almost to nothingness might help us have better sex.

First, our brains are designed to look for patterns, even if they’re wrong.

In our distant past, we reacted quickly if we saw a shadow that looked like a lion in the bushes. It’s better to see a pattern that isn’t there than to miss seeing a real lion.

We also tend to listen to what others tell us. If your friend says there are lions on the other side of the hill, often you’ll listen rather than do your own research.

Our emotions — especially fear — can also motivate us to act, such as running away as fast as we can from a lion.

While these traits helped us survive in a world without technology, they can get us into trouble today.

If a friend has a cold, takes an herbal supplement, and gets better, we might think the pill cured her. But the cold could’ve just as likely gone away on its own. Without clinical studies, we’re just guessing.

Or if you have a headache and your friend says, “I put three drops of lemon oil on my wrists and my headache went away,” you might give it a try. What the heck, right?

Or if you have cancer and you’re afraid of dying, you might try anything to get better — even if it’s never been shown to be effective in a clinical trial, doesn’t make any sense how it might work in the first place, or you have to shell out thousands of dollars at a clinic in another country for treatment.

Choosing treatments for your illness is complicated by research that suggests many published studies — yes, scientific studies — are wrong.

ZIKA VACCINE SHOWS PROMISE IN EARLY HUMAN TRIAL

Science isn’t infallible. But it is methodical and self-correcting. Over time, new studies either confirm past results or weed out the mistakes.

Not everyone has a strong background in science or clinical trials, so how are we supposed to decide which treatments work?

Hall offers what she calls her SkepDoc’s Rule.

“Before you accept any claim, try to find out who disagrees with it and why. That can be very illuminating,” she said.

Also, you can always ask your doctor for advice. But even with that, Hall suggests some level of skepticism.

People should “ask their doctor to provide evidence to support his or her recommendations,” said Hall, “and then they should check to see what others have said about that evidence.”
