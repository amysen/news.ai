LONDON (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers on Tuesday gave broad support to a law that could end the City of London’s global dominance in clearing euro-denominated financial contracts after Brexit.

The plan has raised hackles in Britain, where it threatens both job losses and tax revenues.

The draft EU law proposes that a foreign clearing house -- which stands between two sides of a transaction to ensure its smooth completion -- must be subject to more intense supervision by the bloc’s regulators if it wants to serve customers in the EU.

But if a clearing house is systemically important to the euro zone, then euro-denominated business with EU based customers must move to the bloc.

The draft law is anathema to Britain, which voted to leave the EU in a referendum last year.

It is home to LCH, an arm of the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) that clears most euro-denominated swaps in Europe. Financial services represent Britain’s biggest tax earning sector and the LSE has warned that thousands of jobs could leave the UK if euro clearing was forced out.

In the first debate in the European Parliament on Tuesday, lawmakers from the two biggest parties, the centre right European People’s Party and the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, gave broad backing to the draft law, but called for some changes.

“It’s a good proposal from the European Commission,” Polish centre-right MEP Danuta Huebner told parliament’s economic affairs committee.

“In principle, I support the proposal, which I find necessary,” added Roberto Gualtieri, an Italian centre-left lawmaker who chairs the committee.

The European Parliament and EU states have final say on the reform, with changes expected during the approval process.

No timetable has been agreed for approving the law and, separately, there has been scant agreement on any new relationship between the EU and Britain.

That means LCH’s European customers don’t know at the moment if they can continue using the London clearer after Brexit.

Exploit this uncertainty, Frankfurt-based Eurex (DB1Gn.DE) unveiled a “Brexit-proof” package of sweeteners on Monday to woo LCH customers.

BREXIT PROTECTIONISM

Huebner said parts of the draft law were too complex, creating uncertainty over how exactly EU regulators and the European Central Bank would decide when euro clearing conducted outside the bloc must move to the EU.

“We have to do everything to avoid potential inconsistency in decision-making,” Huebner said. “We must not politicise the whole process.”

Gualtieri said there was a need to “upgrade” EU supervision of clearing, but lawmakers should be “very cautious, reflective and in a listening mood” given the potential consequences.

Others said there was need to avoid protectionism or using clearing as a stick to beat Britain given that the UK was already “fighting with itself”.

Kay Swinburne, a British centre-right lawmaker, a lone voice in outright opposition, said a regional restriction on a global currency is the wrong approach.

“There is a reason why we have done so much work at the global level, and I really hope that we are not going to throw all of that away to have some protectionism with regards to a Brexit decision,” Swinburne added.

Banks and the LSE have warned that forcing out some clearing would split markets and bump up costs for EU companies who use swaps to insure against adverse moves in borrowing costs, raw material prices, and currency swings.",EU lawmakers give tentative nod to Brexit clearing law that could clobber Britain,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-clearing/eu-lawmakers-give-tentative-nod-to-brexit-clearing-law-that-could-clobber-britain-idUKKBN1CF168

Frankfurt (Reuters) - An den europäischen Aktienmärkten haben sich die Anleger am Dienstag kaum aus der Deckung gewagt.

Der Dax notierte am frühen Nachmittag mit 12.957 Punkten 0,2 Prozent im Minus. Der EuroStoxx50 verlor 0,3 Prozent auf 3601 Zähler. Viele Investoren wollten Börsianern zufolge die Entwicklung in Katalonien abwarten. “Die Lage dort macht alle ziemlich nervös”, sagte ein Händler.

Zudem wollten sich die Anleger kurz vor Veröffentlichung der für Donnerstag erwarteten Quartalsbilanzen von US-Großbanken wie JP Morgan und Citigroup nicht zu weit aus dem Fenster lehnen. Für die Eröffnung der Wall Street signalisierten die US-Futures leicht steigende Kurse.

SPEKULATIONEN UM EZB-ANLEIHEKÄUFE TREIBEN EURO HOCH

In Madrid ging die Börse wieder in die Knie. Der Leitindex verlor rund ein Prozent. Banken-Titel gaben im Schnitt knapp zwei Prozent nach. Spanische Anleihen flogen erneut aus den Depots, was die Rendite der zehnjährigen Papiere auf ein Tageshoch von 1,70 Prozent von 1,68 Prozent am Montag trieb. Sollte es tatsächlich zur Ausrufung der Unabhängigkeit kommen, werde das die spanischen Anleihen weiter unter Druck setzen, sagte Analyst Dirk Gojny von der National-Bank in Essen voraus.

Relativ kalt ließ die Entwicklung in Spanien erneut den Euro. Die Gemeinschaftswährung kletterte um rund einen halben US-Cent auf ein Tageshoch von 1,1807 Dollar. EZB-Direktorin Sabine Lautenschläger hatte sich am Montagabend für ein Abschmelzen der umstrittenen Anleihenkäufe im kommenden Jahr ausgesprochen hatte. “Ihre Aussagen unterstützten den Euro, aber wegen der politischen Risiken in der Euro-Zone ist kurzfristig nicht mit einer Rally zu rechnen”, sagte Währungsspezialist Stephen Innes vom Handelshaus Oanda.

Der Kursanstieg könnte allerdings den Absatz europäischer Unternehmen auf dem Weltmarkt schmälern, da die Waren sich dadurch verteuern.

The defeat of ultra-nationalist parties in the Netherlands and in France earlier this year gave European leaders the sense that fear of a far-right surge had, after all, been misplaced. As it turns out, it was the relief that was misplaced.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the National Football League should not be given tax breaks, wading back into his criticism of the league over silent player protests during the national anthem.

“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.

It was not clear what exactly Trump was demanding, and representatives for the White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The NFL gave up its federal tax-exempt status in 2015, according to media reports, although U.S. states and localities still offer the multi-billion dollar league tax breaks in order to attract teams and to finance stadiums.

Trump has been on a tear for weeks against NFL players who kneel during the national anthem played before games, saying the gesture disrespects the country. His strongly worded call last month for players who did this to be fired touched off an initially sharp response, including from some team owners and coaches.

The players’ silent demonstration, which began last year in protest against police violence toward racial minorities, was embraced more widely in reaction to Trump’s more recent comments, with more players taking the knee while others chose to lock arms.

A number of Republican lawmakers suggested in September that tax sweeteners should end given the protests, the Washington Post reported.

On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence walked out of an NFL game after some players knelt. Separately, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he would bench players who disrespect the U.S. flag.

On Monday, cable sports network ESPN was drawn into the fray when it suspended one of its broadcasters after she posted a tweet about the protests and Jones’ comment. ESPN, which is owned by Walt Disney Co, said it was Jemele Hill’s second violation of its social media guidelines.

Hill, who had said that those who rejected Jones’ comment should look at the team’s advertisers, later tweeted that she was not urging an NFL boycott.

In a separate Twitter post on Tuesday, Trump excoriated Hill, saying that with her “at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!”

The NFL Players Association has defended players’ right to protest.

Trump’s former Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton, also backed the players, saying in a speech on Monday, “They are protesting racism and injustice, and they have every right to do so.”

Critics of Trump, a Republican, have said he is fanning a controversy over the national anthem at NFL games to distract from pressing issues his administration is dealing with, from a powerful hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico to tensions with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars the government from limiting free speech, including prohibiting protests around the national anthem or punishing people who choose not to stand.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

Regional leader Carles Puigdemont held a meeting of his cabinet to decide how to press an independence drive that has stirred powerful emotions across Spain and raised concern in European Union partner states.

Catalan police armed with automatic rifles stood guard at Barcelona’s Parc de la Ciutadella which houses the elegant 18th century building. Spanish national police, decried by separatists over their use of force to hinder an Oct. 1 referendum, were not to be seen.

A declaration of independence would deepen Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and would almost certainly draw tough counter-measures from Madrid, possibly including suspension of the regional government.

The parliament and other buildings, such as the regional high court building, could become a focus of contention between Spanish and Catalan authorities.

Thousands of national police reinforcements sent by Madrid for the referendum remain in the area, many of them in two cruise ships docked in Barcelona harbor.

Pro-independence demonstrators were due to gather before the parliament building under the slogan “Hello Republic” to mark Puigdemont’s speech at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).

Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Barcelona against independence at the weekend, waving red-yellow Spanish flags through the city center. That rally fell a week after some 900 people were injured when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt a referendum ruled illegal in Madrid.

Related Coverage Spain's creditors size up cost of Catalan independence bid

Puigdemont has said he is determined to apply a law passed by the Catalan assembly which called for a declaration of independence within days if Catalans voted ‘yes’ in the Oct. 1 referendum.

The government of Spain’s wealthiest region says 90 percent of those who voted backed independence, but turnout was only 43 percent as many opponents of independence stayed at home.

The Madrid government has said it will respond immediately to any unilateral declaration.

Puigdemont could ask the parliament to vote on a motion of independence, which lawmakers say would start a period of up to six months during which Catalonia would write a new constitution and negotiate a divorce with Spain; or he could make a statement of intent on a future independence declaration.

Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to disclose what Puigdemont would say but told a news conference after the cabinet meeting he would be “clear and explicit” and Tuesday would be an historic day.

Ruling party lawmakers say Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is considering taking the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering new regional elections, the so-called nuclear option.

The European Commission repeated its call for dialogue in Spain to end the crisis in Catalonia. Puigdemont has also called for talks and international mediation, but Rajoy has said he will not negotiate with the Catalan leaders unless they abandon plans to declare independence.

BUSINESS CLIMATE

Markets have been rattled by the Catalan crisis, raising Spain’s borrowing costs and pushing down shares.

Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond yields were a touch lower on Tuesday, but above lows hit the previous session as investors awaited Puigdemont’s speech. Spain’s benchmark Ibex share index was down nearly one percent.

The tension is taking its toll on the business climate. On Monday, three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business drift from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum.

Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial and infrastructure firm Abertis both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued.

Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence.

Spain’s finance minister said it was the Catalan government’s fault the companies were leaving.

The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

The crisis has reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, who died in 1975, is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.",Catalonia nears possible independence proclamation despite Madrid warnings,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/catalonia-nears-possible-independence-proclamation-despite-madrid-warnings-idUKKBN1CF13U

LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.

Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of hostile statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.

Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organization. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.

“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, said.

“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behavior. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”

Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.

“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.

Iran’s moderate president Hasan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticizing the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.

“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures,” he added.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”

The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.

But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s missile program and over allegations it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.

The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.

The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.

“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.

Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile program. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.

Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile program. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”. In an article published in the Atlantic on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles … unless it intends to attack our territory.”","Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-irgc/iran-hardliners-pragmatists-show-unity-in-response-to-trump-idUSKBN1CF0R0?il=0

Una spinta agli utili aziendali potrebbe arrivare anche dalla proposta di riforma fiscale del presidente Donald Trump, le cui speranze di successo sono accresciute la scorsa settimana dopo che Camera dei Rappresentanti ha approvato un progetto di spesa fiscale per il 2018 che potrebbe favorire il passaggio della più ampia legge di riforma. “E come se ci fossero alcuni investitori che accompagnano il mercato con ottimismo sui tagli fiscali in assenza di cattive notizie”, commenta Andre Bakhos, direttore generale di Janlyn Capital.

In un mercato azionario in rialzo per la gran parte dell‘anno, le valutazioni di molti titoli sono cresciute sopra la media di lungo termine e i forti risultati trimestrali potrebbero contribuire a giustificare i premi raggiunti.

Secondo i dati Thomson Reuters a livello aggregato gli utili delle società S&P 500 dovrebbero salire del 4,9% nel terzo trimestre, in calo dalla crescita a doppia cifra registrata nei primi due trimestri dell‘anno.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India wants to attract foreign investors to $300 billion worth of energy projects planned for the next decade, its oil minister said, as the world’s third biggest oil consumer aims to cut imports.

India ships in about 80 percent of its oil needs, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to reduce to 67 percent by 2020. The planned projects will include increasing the country’s refining capacity, oil and gas block exploration, and developing gas infrastructure, including for transporting LNG and regasification.

“In the next 10 years, India will offer projects worth $300 billion” to foreign companies keen to invest in the country, Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told an energy conference in New Delhi on Tuesday.

India’s oil and gas output has been stagnant for years while its fuel demand has risen with economic expansion, hitting federal finances with an import bill worth billions of dollars.

Modi’s government has been taking steps to unlock the country’s vast energy reserves and boost foreign investment in the sector and has relaxed rules, including on pricing and marketing.

LONDON (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers on Tuesday gave broad support to a law that could end the City of London’s global dominance in clearing euro-denominated financial contracts after Brexit.

The plan has raised hackles in Britain, where it threatens both job losses and tax revenues.

The draft EU law proposes that a foreign clearing house -- which stands between two sides of a transaction to ensure its smooth completion -- must be subject to more intense supervision by the bloc’s regulators if it wants to serve customers in the EU.

But if a clearing house is systemically important to the euro zone, then euro-denominated business with EU based customers must move to the bloc.

The draft law is anathema to Britain, which voted to leave the EU in a referendum last year.

It is home to LCH, an arm of the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) that clears most euro-denominated swaps in Europe. Financial services represent Britain’s biggest tax earning sector and the LSE has warned that thousands of jobs could leave the UK if euro clearing was forced out.

In the first debate in the European Parliament on Tuesday, lawmakers from the two biggest parties, the centre right European People’s Party and the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, gave broad backing to the draft law, but called for some changes.

“It’s a good proposal from the European Commission,” Polish centre-right MEP Danuta Huebner told parliament’s economic affairs committee.

“In principle, I support the proposal, which I find necessary,” added Roberto Gualtieri, an Italian centre-left lawmaker who chairs the committee.

The European Parliament and EU states have final say on the reform, with changes expected during the approval process.

No timetable has been agreed for approving the law and, separately, there has been scant agreement on any new relationship between the EU and Britain.

That means LCH’s European customers don’t know at the moment if they can continue using the London clearer after Brexit.

Exploit this uncertainty, Frankfurt-based Eurex (DB1Gn.DE) unveiled a “Brexit-proof” package of sweeteners on Monday to woo LCH customers.

BREXIT PROTECTIONISM

Huebner said parts of the draft law were too complex, creating uncertainty over how exactly EU regulators and the European Central Bank would decide when euro clearing conducted outside the bloc must move to the EU.

“We have to do everything to avoid potential inconsistency in decision-making,” Huebner said. “We must not politicise the whole process.”

Gualtieri said there was a need to “upgrade” EU supervision of clearing, but lawmakers should be “very cautious, reflective and in a listening mood” given the potential consequences.

Others said there was need to avoid protectionism or using clearing as a stick to beat Britain given that the UK was already “fighting with itself”.

Kay Swinburne, a British centre-right lawmaker, a lone voice in outright opposition, said a regional restriction on a global currency is the wrong approach.

“There is a reason why we have done so much work at the global level, and I really hope that we are not going to throw all of that away to have some protectionism with regards to a Brexit decision,” Swinburne added.

Banks and the LSE have warned that forcing out some clearing would split markets and bump up costs for EU companies who use swaps to insure against adverse moves in borrowing costs, raw material prices, and currency swings.",EU lawmakers give tentative nod to Brexit clearing law that could clobber Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-clearing/eu-lawmakers-give-tentative-nod-to-brexit-clearing-law-that-could-clobber-britain-idUKKBN1CF168

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s government sought on Tuesday to contain the fallout from the disclosure by the nation’s third-biggest steel maker, Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T), that it had fabricated data on components used in cars, aircraft and space rockets, sending shock waves through the Japanese manufacturing sector.

Faced with the latest in a series of missteps that have undermined Japan’s reputation for high-quality production, the industry ministry instructed Kobe Steel to assess the safety impact from the scandal.

The company said products used by about 200 companies were certified with falsified data. They included Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Central Japan Railway (9022.T), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T) and Subaru Corp (7270.T), the companies confirmed.

Analysts say the announcement further tarnishes the reputation of Japan’s globe-trotting manufacturers, long celebrated for their high-quality products. It could also undermine confidence in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s moves to improve corporate governance as part of his program of Abenomics.

The admission from the steel and aluminium maker follows scandals involving falsified data at household names such as Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata Corp., which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.

Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal involving reporting inflated profits.

“Looking back over several years, foreign investors have bought Japanese stocks on expectations for Abenomics, but among the ”three arrows,“ the growth strategy isn’t functioning,” said, Makoto Kikuchi, CEO of Myojo Asset Management.

“While they say they’re strengthening corporate governance, improprieties focused on manufacturing have been popping up. Going forward, this will be a body blow to Japanese shares.”

Toyota called the revelations a “grave issue,” and said it was making checks on where the components were used and what effect they have on products using them.

Kobe Steel shares closed at the limit low after being untraded for the whole session, diving 22 percent to 1068 yen.

IMPACT ON KOBE CUSTOMERS UNCLEAR

In a statement on Sunday Kobe Steel said some aluminium and copper products shipped from September 2016 to August 2017 were falsely labeled.

Kobe Steel said the misconduct involved dozens of staff and possibly stretched back 10 years. It apologized and said it had appointed lawyers to investigate.

Aluminium castings, forgings and flat-rolled items, along with copper strips and tubes were among the products affected, the company said in a statement.

“These are improper actions that could shake the foundation of fair trade,” Yasuji Komiyama, director of the industry ministry’s metal industries division, told reporters at a briefing on the revelations.

“We want Kobe Steel to make the utmost effort to restore trust from society”, he said.

A Kobe spokesman told Reuters the firm is working with customers to check for any issues. “To our knowledge it has not affected any customer’s products at this stage,” he said.

Boeing (BA.N) said in a statement it was working “with our suppliers since being notified of the issue.”

The logo of Kobe Steel is seen on the group's Tokyo headquarter building in Tokyo, Japan October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato

“Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern,” it said. Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) supply parts to Boeing including for its 777 Dreamliner.

MHI said Kobe Steel products were used on its Mitsubishi Regional Jet and rockets, including a H-2A rocket launched on Tuesday to put a navigation satellite into orbit. There were no technical problems with the components, MHI said.

Industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by Kawasaki Heavy, MHI, IHI Corp (7013.T) and Subaru and checks were being made for any safety issues.

EARNINGS FALLOUT?

Kobe Steel has said the impact of the data falsification on its earnings is still unknown.

“The impact on financials is unclear, but could be substantial depending on request(s) for replacement/recall,” Jefferies analyst Thanh Ha Pham said in a note. “Handling the situation is key to avoid long-term reputation damage.”

The steelmaker has reported losses in the last two full financial years but is expecting to return to profit in the current period.

Sales of Kobe Steel’s aluminium and copper division fell 6.4 percent year on year to 323.3 billion yen ($2.87 billion) in the financial year ending March 2017, with recurring profit falling 20.5 percent to 12 billion yen.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Bangladesh border guards reported more than 11,000 Rohingya refugees crossing into their country from Myanmar on Monday, in a sudden surge, the United Nations refugee agency said.

More than half a million Rohingya have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25 after insurgent attacks on security forces triggered a violent government crackdown, but the rate had slowed to about 2,000 refugees per day last week, aid agencies say.

“We’re back in a situation of full alert as far as influxes are concerned. It is a big increase to see 11,000,” Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a news briefing in Geneva on Tuesday.

“We have had big numbers coming across by the day over the six weeks of this emergency. So we are back up to approaching some of those peak arrivals. Clearly we have to be prepared for more arrivals,” he said.

Many of the refugees are reported to come from the Buthidaung area in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state, which is 20-25 kilometres east of Maungdaw.

“Some said they had fled torching and killings back home; one boy was seen with a big gash across his neck,” Edwards said.

“We don’t know at the moment what is driving this,” he added. “Some of these people have fled their homes several days ago and in some cases two weeks ago, so they moved towards the border before coming across.”

There are also indications of more recent problems.

“As you may have seen from media reports which I can’t verify, but there are reports about fires being seen close to the border (and) other problems there,” Edwards said.

Meanwhile, a massive cholera immunisation campaign began on Tuesday near Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, aimed at protecting newly-arrived Rohingya and host communities from the disease which can be deadly, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.

Some 900,000 oral vaccine doses will be distributed, including 650,000 in an initial 10-day campaign to be followed by a second round from Oct. 31 targeting 250,000 children between one and five years old, the agency said.

There is a “clear and present risk” of the spread of cholera among the population.

“Luckily, we don’t have any confirmed cases of cholera so far,” WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said.","UNHCR on 'full alert' as 11,000 Rohingya flee in a day",https://in.reuters.com/article/myanmar-refugees-un/unhcr-says-on-full-alert-as-11000-rohingya-flee-in-a-day-idINKBN1CF0YJ

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari has sought approval from lawmakers in the upper chamber of parliament for $5.5 billion of foreign borrowing, according to a letter read in the Senate on Tuesday.

Africa’s biggest economy grew in the second quarter, climbing out of its first recession in 25 years as oil revenues rose, but the pace of growth was slow, suggesting the recovery remains fragile.

Nigeria expects a shortfall of $7.5 billion (5.68 billion pounds) in its record 7.44 trillion naira ($24.33 billion) 2017 budget, which it plans to offset with foreign loans.

The letter requesting approval from lawmakers for offshore borrowing was read out on the floor of the upper house by Bukola Saraki, president of the upper chamber, the Senate said on its official Twitter feed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May pledged on Tuesday to “hold a mirror up to society” with a study showing sharp racial disparities in Britain, as she looks for a way to demonstrate her leadership is about more than just delivering Brexit.

Among the findings of the audit, the data showed Asian, black and other minority ethnic households were most likely to be in persistent poverty, that ethnic minorities have a lower employment rate than white people, and that they were under-represented in senior public sector jobs.

Bogged down by Brexit and losing her parliamentary majority in a snap election in June, May has struggled to deliver on social reforms to tackle what she has called “burning injustices” since taking control of the ruling Conservative party in July 2016.

Attempting to relaunch that agenda, she published the findings of a “Race Disparity Audit” which pulled together existing data from across sectors such as health, education, employment and the criminal justice system and analyzed it to discover how ethnicity affects people’s lives.

“This audit means that for society as a whole – for government, for our public services – there is nowhere to hide. These issues are now out in the open,” she told a private meeting to launch the report, according to her office.

“The message is very simple: if these disparities cannot be explained then they must be changed.”

May’s center-right Conservatives were blindsided in June’s election by a surge in support for the left-wing policies of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has presented higher state spending as part of the cure for voters he says have been let down years of cuts to public services.

“The prime minister has done nothing but exacerbate the problems. Far from tackling the burning injustices she has added fuel to the fire,” Labour’s equalities spokeswoman Dawn Butler said. She called for the government to start offering solutions to the problems the audit highlighted.

At last week’s Conservative conference, May was keen to show party members that she had a plan to counter Corbyn’s rise and allay fears that Brexit was squeezing out action on Britain’s social problems.

“It will hold a mirror up to society and allow us and wider society to see where action is needed,” May told a meeting of her senior ministers, according to a spokesman.

May’s deputy Damian Green said the audit’s findings were not “relentlessly negative”, but added in a forward to the document: “There is still a way to go before we have a country that works for everyone regardless of their ethnicity.”

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund cut its South African economic growth forecast for this year on Tuesday, saying rising political uncertainty has dented consumer and business confidence.

The IMF said it expected South Africa’s economy to grow by 0.7 percent this year, down from an earlier projection of 1 percent given in July.

“Growth is projected to remain subdued ... despite more favourable commodity export prices and strong agricultural production, as heightened political uncertainty saps consumer and business confidence,” the global lender said.

South African growth should tick up to 1.1 percent next year, slightly lower than an earlier forecast of 1.2 percent, the IMF added in its October world economic outlook.

South Africa’s Treasury said in February it expected the economy to grow 1.3 percent in 2017, but Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba is due to announce revised projections on Oct. 25 when he presents his medium term budget policy statement to parliament.

South Africa slipped into recession earlier this year as rising inflation and high unemployment hit consumer spending, but a rebound in agricultural output has since helped the economy to return to growth.

Investors’ nerves, however, have been tested by the sacking of respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in March, subsequent credit downgrades to sub-investment grade and allegations of corruption in state-owned firms.

A leadership contest in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party has also heightened political uncertainty.

In December the ANC will choose a new party leader to succeed President Jacob Zuma, whose tenure has been tainted by a series of corruption scandals. Zuma can remain as head of state until an election in 2019.

The IMF maintained its GDP growth projection for Nigeria at 0.8 percent this year, a performance underpinned by a recovery in oil production and farming after the economy contracted in 2016.

“However, concerns about policy implementation, market segmentation in a foreign exchange market that remains dependent on central bank interventions and banking-system fragilities are expected to weigh on activity in the medium term,” the IMF said.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

COX‘S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) began distributing 900,000 doses of cholera vaccine on Tuesday in Bangladesh’s camps for Rohingya refugees fleeing from Myanmar, as authorities rush to prevent a major outbreak of the deadly disease.

More than 10,000 cases of diarrhoea have been reported in the past week alone, the WHO said.

Doctors in two clinics have told Reuters that there have been several cases of patients with the symptoms of cholera, a virulent diarrhoea that kills within 36 hours if not treated.

Cholera has not been identified in testing of patient samples by Bangladesh’s health ministry, although clinics say they are waiting for results for some samples sent last week.

“There is a clear risk for cholera,” said Dr N. Paranietharan, the WHO’s representative in Bangladesh.

“Sporadic cases are inevitable (but) we are not expecting a major outbreak like Yemen,” he said.

War-torn Yemen is in the grip of a cholera crisis, with more than 750,000 sufferers afflicted by the bacteria, which is spread when contaminated faeces is ingested by humans, usually through the water supply.

The cholera vaccination campaign in Bangladesh, the second largest in history, will be crucial to containing any outbreak, said Paranietharan.

More than 1,000 people will fan out across the sprawling camps on the southern tip of Bangladesh that are home to more than 519,000 Rohingya Muslims.

The Rohingya fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar when government forces launched a ferocious offensive, denounced by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing, in response to a series of Rohingya militant attacks on security posts on Aug. 25.

In pounding heat and stifling humidity, traumatized and malnourished refugees are crammed into bamboo and canvas huts packed across muddy hillsides. Faeces lies in lanes that flood in the pouring rain.

More than 3,000 latrines have been installed but many overflow and sit above pools and creeks where refugees bathe.

Many new wells for drinking water are shallow and have become contaminated by sewage, said Paranietharan.

“While we are doing this vaccination, it is not an alternative to fixing the water, sanitation and hygiene intervention, it just buys us time,” he said.

“Sanitary facilities and hygiene promotion have still not met the standards. They need to be improved quickly.”

‘FACING A TSUNAMI’

In a dysentery clinic in Kutupalong camp run by the Medical Teams International group, patients with severe diarrhoea lie motionless, moaning as intravenous fluid flows into them.

“I believe we are facing a tsunami. We just don’t know if it’s going to be 10 feet or 50 feet,” said Bruce Murray, a physician at the clinic.

“Cholera is known to be endemic in Bangladesh and now we are bringing in half a million people in squalid conditions and it’s got to be inevitable. It’s a matter of when it hits, rather than if,” he said.

Murray said there could be “tens of thousands” of victims in an outbreak. Paranietharan said his organisation had the capacity to handle 70,000 cholera cases.

As well as a handful of clinics, mobile teams are ready to go to inaccessible parts of the camps with oral rehydration salts that can save cholera patients if they can’t get access to intravenous fluids.

Aid workers worry they lack the staff to get the vaccines out quickly, while the WHO says it urgently needs $10.2 million to do the job properly.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo is like a zombie feasting on Verizon’s brains. Marni Walden, a top executive at the $200 billion U.S. telecom group, is leaving just a day after the internet firm she helped to acquire tripled its tally of customer accounts exposed to a 2013 hack. While the company suggests the timing is a coincidence, it’s clear that Yahoo is a problem that continues to fester.

Verizon disclosed that Walden will exit at the end of the year in a two-sentence regulatory filing on Wednesday. The 50-year-old executive vice president was a rising star and a rare female in the upper ranks, who could have been a credible successor to Chief Executive Lowell McAdam. As the head of media, Walden also oversaw the creation of Oath, a combination of acquired 1990s internet brands Yahoo and AOL, to help shore up Verizon’s digital advertising offerings.

Even if buying Yahoo had a certain business rationale, it has proven to be a real pain in the side. Two hacking incidents revealed last year nearly scotched the deal. Verizon wrangled a $350 million price cut from Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, but that may have been too little. On Tuesday it emerged that all 3 billion of Yahoo’s user accounts were compromised.

Verizon said that Walden’s departure and the latest revelation were unrelated. She is pursuing outside opportunities because she was unlikely to be the next chief executive, the Wall Street Journal reported. Others now in the running to replace McAdam, 63, include John Stratton, head of global operations, and Hans Vestberg, who once led Ericsson and is now Verizon’s chief technology officer.

Either of those would suggest that Verizon is now more interested in building out a fiber network than reinventing the media landscape. At least it only plunked down $9 billion for Oath. Meanwhile, rival AT&T is still splashing out on satellite distribution and media, paying some $175 billion for DirecTV and Time Warner. It ought to learn from Verizon’s experience: risky deals may come back to haunt.

München (Reuters) - Der Münchner Industriegase-Konzern Linde kommt der Fusion mit Praxair näher.

Zwei Wochen vor dem Ablauf der Frist hat ein Drittel der Linde-Aktionäre seine Anteilsscheine in Papiere der fusionierten Linde plc getauscht, exakt 33,21 Prozent, wie das Unternehmen am Dienstag mitteilte. Bis zum 24. Oktober braucht Linde eine Umtauschquote von 75 Prozent, damit der fast 70 Milliarden Euro schwere Zusammensschluss zustande kommt. Dass institutionelle Aktionäre so früh ihre Papiere einreichen, ist ungewöhnlich. Meistens warten sie bis zur letzten Minute, um nicht eine mögliche bessere Alternative zu verpassen.

Linde-Chef Aldo Belloni bangt aber vor allem um die Aktien der Kleinaktionäre. Sie halten nach Unternehmensschätzungen rund 22 Prozent der Anteile. 10 bis 13 Prozent liegen in Indexfonds, die die Aktien meist erst dann abgeben dürfen, wenn die nötigen Hürden übersprungen sind.

Die Kleinaktionärsvereinigung DSW rät den Anteilseignern von einem Umtausch ihrer Papiere ab. “Wir sind der Meinung, dass das Angebot für die Linde-Anteilseigner nicht einmal attraktiv ist. Es fällt schlicht zu niedrig aus”, hatte Hauptgeschäftsführer Marc Tüngler am Montag erklärt. Die Linde-Aktionäre sollen für jeden ihrer Anteilsscheine 1,54 Aktien der Linde plc erhalten, in der die Linde AG und ihr US-Rivale Praxair aufgehen sollen. “Warum sollte ein Linde-Anteilseigner seine Papiere tauschen, wenn ihm dafür faktisch nur der aktuelle Börsenwert geboten wird?” erklärte DSW-Vizepräsidentin Daniela Bergdolt. Dabei sei die Praxair-Kursfantasie weitgehend ausgereizt. “Linde bringt so viel mehr an Werten in diese Fusion ein. Das müsste berücksichtigt werden.”

Die DSW hatte sich bereits daran gestoßen, dass bei Linde - anders als bei Praxair - nicht die Hauptversammlung über die Fusion entscheiden durfte. Sie will gerichtlich klären lassen, ob das rechtens war. Eine Feststellungsklage soll in den nächsten Tagen eingereicht werden. Ein Urteil dürfte allerdings zu spät kommen, um den Zusammenschluss von Linde und Praxair zu stoppen.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to block a Chinese-backed firm from buying a U.S.-based chipmaker this week is detrimental to America’s growth and the global economy, China’s state news agency Xinhua said in a commentary on Saturday.

Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ planned $1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp was one of the largest attempted by a Chinese-backed firm in the U.S. microchip sector and was the first announced deal for the buyout fund, which launched last year with a focus on technology investment.

U.S. regulatory scrutiny grew after Reuters reported in November that Canyon Bridge was funded partly by capital from China’s central government and had indirect links to its space program.

Trump said in an executive order on Wednesday that Lattice and Canyon Bridge “shall take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed transaction” within 30 days.

“The move, which is detrimental to both America’s growth and global economic recovery, also runs counter to the mutually-beneficial and win-win nature of China-U.S. relations,” the Xinhua commentary said.

Security reviews of investments in sensitive sectors “should not be used as a tool to implement protectionism”, it added, echoing comments by a Commerce Ministry spokesman last week.

Citing analysts who said Trump’s decision was made with an eye to the 2018 midterm election, Xinhua called it “penny wise and pound foolish ... It is a short-sighted move to take protectionist measures amid sluggish global growth.”

“Chinese investment is not ‘Trojan Horse’ with hidden purposes,” it said.

Trump is set to visit China in November.

“The two countries need to strengthen dialogue and communication, promote cooperation and exchanges in various fields and properly handle issues of common concerns. Only then can China and the United States push forward the world’s most important bilateral relationship,” Xinhua said.",Trump move to block chipmaker deal bad for America - Xinhua,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-trade-commentary/trump-move-to-block-chipmaker-deal-bad-for-america-xinhua-idUSKCN1BR062

Since P&G’s board before Peltz jolted it into action had no such representative, they consider his pitch favorably.
To beat back Peltz, P&G needs to make up the difference between the active and retail investors, of some 255 million shares.
To put it another way, Peltz just has to win one of the three.","NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Procter & Gamble is counting on a variation of America’s electoral arithmetic as its best hope for keeping Nelson Peltz off the board of directors. There’s no particularly good reason for shareholders to deny the pushy investor, whose hedge fund Trian Partners owns 1.5 percent of the $235 billion diapers-to-shampoo conglomerate, a seat at the table. Yet as at the ballot box, a combination of voter apathy and arcane rules is likely to leave three investors holding all the cards at next Tuesday’s annual meeting.

It is an irony of the way American public equity markets have developed that the most important deciders on the P&G saga – as in many other proxy battles involving the world’s most valuable companies – are so-called passive index-fund managers led by Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. To further the imperfect political analogy, they play roles similar to the ones Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania did in helping put Donald Trump into the Oval Office, even though his rival Hillary Clinton achieved more of the popular vote last November.

There are differences, of course. P&G shareholders are not being offered a choice between one chief executive or another. The question of whether to give Peltz, who comes armed with ideas about how P&G can improve its performance and more experience in the sector than most if not all of the company’s sitting directors, is far from existential. He would be one of about a dozen people helping set strategy, compensation and the like. Handing him a board seat is pretty much a no-lose option on bettering the maker of Tide and Pampers.

The insular, Cincinnati-based company thinks differently. P&G’s notorious allegiance to internal candidates for nearly every high-level position makes it vulnerable to criticism that it does not like outsiders telling it what to do. That’s a central theme to Peltz’s charges of P&G’s underperformance. For its part, the giant led by David Taylor says it’s already on track to create a “profoundly different, much stronger, and more profitable company” than just a few years ago.

As in previous engagements, Peltz is apt to have won over most of those P&G investors who spend their days thinking about whether to keep the investment in their portfolio. These so-called active managers, a group that in P&G’s case includes hedge funds, mutual funds and some pension funds, tend to agree that corporate boards benefit from having a voice from the investor community in their midst. Since P&G’s board before Peltz jolted it into action had no such representative, they consider his pitch favorably.

”Peltz’s experience in the consumer product space will add value to P&G’s board and his significant stake in the company will bring an owner’s perspective inside the boardroom,“ said Anne Sheehan, the director of corporate governance at CalSTRS, on Thursday. ”The addition of Mr. Peltz to the board is best for P&G, the CalSTRS fund and ultimately, the teachers of California.”

It’s here where the electoral math starts to matter. P&G has about 2.6 billion shares outstanding. Proxy advisers working either side of the tussle roughly estimate that investors like CalSTRS, Fidelity and Capital Group own about 41 percent of those shares. Assume 90 percent of the active managers live up to their billing and vote. If 80 percent of them tilt in favor of Peltz, that would give Trian about 770 million votes.

Retail investors own about the same amount of P&G, however. They tend to go along with what management has told them to do in the proxy cards that arrive in the post, as Trian learned the hard way when it failed to garner enough support to win seats on the board of DuPont two years ago. Like the American electorate, this group doesn’t tend to vote the way Fidelity and other institutions do. P&G may have an extra edge, though, in that many of its former workers still hold the stock, or received it as part of their retirement.

Yet there may also be folks who own the stock because, say, they love Dawn dishwashing liquid or live in the Cincinnati area and worry that Peltz would move its headquarters to the Bronx. So for arithmetic purposes, assume a slightly higher 60 percent of retail shareholders vote, and 80 percent of them cast their ballot against Peltz. That would give P&G 515 million votes.

That’s obviously not enough, and explains the significance of Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. They have been the biggest beneficiaries of a trend toward investing in funds that simply track benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 – and charge lower fees for doing so – at the expense of higher-cost managers. Together, the trio control more than 17 percent of P&G, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm that favors Peltz’s proposal.

To beat back Peltz, P&G needs to make up the difference between the active and retail investors, of some 255 million shares. In this scenario, P&G can only make that happen by bringing all three to its side. Vanguard, with 181 million shares, is the largest. State Street and BlackRock own 115 million and 156 million, respectively, according to ISS. To put it another way, Peltz just has to win one of the three.

Though that sounds like a tall order for P&G, past voting records give it a chance. In votes for directors proposed by shareholders, BlackRock only cast its ballot against management’s wishes 17 percent of the time at U.S. companies in the year to June 30. Nearly half the time, Vanguard sided with board-related proposals put forward by shareholders at U.S. companies. State Street says it cast its ballot in favor of any shareholder proposal, in defiance of management, only about 7 percent of the time in the first half of this year on a global basis.

These are not perfectly comparable statistics. They nevertheless suggest that P&G has a chance, just as Trump clearly did, if it can woo the investment world’s version of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin. That also means a weekend trip for Peltz to suburban Malvern in the Keystone State – where Vanguard calls home – is advisable.",Breakingviews - Cox: P&G counting on an investor electoral college,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-trian-breakingviews/breakingviews-cox-pg-counting-on-an-investor-electoral-college-idUSKBN1CB25W

Lo scenario della ripresa resta tuttavia decisamente un passo indietro rispetto alla media della zona euro.

Questa l‘opionione del Fondo monetario internazionale riassunta nel rapporto semetrale ‘World economic outlook’, dove la previsione sul prodotto interno lordo nazionale passa a 1,5% da 1,3% delle attese di luglio per il 2017, per poi decelerare a 1,1% (1,0% la proiezione di tre mesi fa nell‘aggiornamento Weo) il prossimo.

Per un‘idea dell‘ordine di grandezza assoluto, la scommessa Fmi sulla crescita della zona euro viene corretta al rialzo di due decimi sul biennio, portata rispettivamente a 2,1% sul 2017 e 1,9% sul 2018.

Quella sull‘Italia è comunque da parte degli economisti di Washington una promozione di 0,2% su quest‘anno e 0,1% sul prossimo, il cui valore si evidenzia anche perché il punto di partenza, ovvero la crescita 2016, è esattamente la metà - 0,9% contro l‘1,8% - della media euro.

Le nuove previsioni vanno comunque innanzi tutto confrontate con quelle della Nota di aggiornamento al Def di fine settembre, che scommette su una crescita di 1,5% sia quest‘anno sia il prossimo.

E’ dunque sul 2018 che emerge una netta divergenza: laddove il governo punta su una crescita stabile il Fondo ne vede una decelerazione, peraltro in linea alle attese su Germania e Spagna, mentre per la crescita francese l‘ipotesi è di un miglioramento l‘anno prossimo.

RIENTRO DEBITO/PIL SOLO DA 2018

Nessun riferimento specifico all‘Italia proprio sul punto dolente del debito.

“Nel medio termine le prospettive della zona euro restano sottotono: a frenare la crescita potenziale concorrono la debolezza della produttività, condizioni demografiche sfavorevoli e -- in alcuni Paesi -- il cumulo del debito pubblico e privato” si legge nel primo capitolo Weo dal titolo ‘Alla ricerca di una crescita sostenibile - ripresa nel breve termine, sfide nel lungo termine’.

Per l‘Italia dopo il 132,0% con cui si è chiuso l‘anno scorso - dato rivisto da Istat a fine settembre contro il precedente 132,6% - l‘attesa Fmi è di un rapporto a 133,0% nel 2017 e a 131,4% nel 2018, contro quella del governo pari rispettivamente a 131,6% e 130%.

Quanto al disavanzo, la traiettoria prefigurata dal Fondo indica 2,2% del Pil - da 2,5% dell‘anno scorso - sul 2017 e 1,3% sul 2018, contro rispettivi 2,1% e 1,6% dell‘aggiornamento al Def.

Le proiezioni Fmi -- avverte una nota all‘allegato delle tabelle -- sono basate sulla legge finanziaria 2017 e sul Def di aprile, dunque non tengono in considerazione l‘aggiornamento del quadro macro presentato il mese scorso dal governo di Paolo Gentiloni che incorpora la riduzione della correzione del deficit strutturale 2018 allo 0,3%.

A livello di deficit strutturale l‘attesa Fmi è di 1,4% quest‘anno e 0,8% il prossimo, mentre il quadro programmatico del governo indica rispettivamente 1,3% e 1,0%.

La ricetta Fmi sintetizzata ai massimi termini in una tabellina a a colori suggerisce per l‘Italia politica monetaria - su cui peraltro Roma non esercita alcun controllo - espansiva unitamente a una politica di bilancio invariata nel breve ma decisamente restrittiva nel lungo termine.

Non manca infine un riferimento al tema delle banche della zona euro, cui ampio spazio daranno comunque i rapporti ‘Global Financial Stability’ e ‘Fiscal Monitor’.

Il Fondo riconosce gli ulteriori progressi fatti dalla primavera nella pulizia dei bilanci e una dinamica positiva dei finanziamenti alle imprese in atto ormai da metà 2015.

“La percentuale dei crediti deteriorati è rimasta comunque elevata nel primo trimestre, intorno a 5,7% per la media euro ma superiore a 10% in sei Paesi, con le banche italiane che hanno in portafoglio circa il 30% dello stock complessivo. Rimane anche la sfida della redditività, con un rapporto tra costi e asset che stenta a calare, soprattutto per gli istituti di credito di medie e piccole dimensioni” scrive l‘analisi Fmi.

Chinamasa will be replaced at the treasury by Home Affairs Minister Ignatius Chombo in a cabinet reshuffle that also diminished the role of Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, seen as a potential successor to Mugabe.

Chombo’s move, announced in a government statement, comes against the backdrop of a severe hard currency shortage that has dealt a fresh blow to confidence and investment in the southern African economy, which uses the U.S dollar.

Chinamasa was appointed finance minister after Mugabe’s re-election in 2013 and his move to head the new Ministry of Cyber Security, Threat Detection and Mitigation was unexpected.

Its creation comes after Chinamasa said last month the government would now treat social media as a security threat after accusing users of spreading rumors about shortages of basic goods, which caused panic buying and price increases.

The government has been uneasy with social media after activists such as pastor Evan Mawararire and his #ThisFlag movement last year used social media to organize a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade.

Government critics took to Twitter deriding Chinamasa as new “minister of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp affairs”.

Chinamasa, a lawyer by training, will also be responsible for bringing to parliament a long awaited cyber crimes bill that criminalize false information posted on the internet, revenge porn, cyber-bullying and online activity against the government.

CASH CRUNCH

Meanwhile Chombo, who does not have a finance background and is a staunch Mugabe supporter who comes from the 93-year-old leader’s rural home district, was the surprise pick for minister of finance.

He will have to contend with a serious shortage of foreign currency that has seen U.S. dollar bank balances lose value against cash dollars, fanning a thriving black market.

The worthless Zimbabwe dollar was replaced by the U.S. dollar in 2009 but the economy has struggled over the past 18 months because of a massive domestic shortage of greenbacks.

As a result, cash, especially crisp, new, $100 bills, has enjoyed a steady 10 percent to 20 percent premium over dollars stored electronically in bank accounts - nicknamed “zollars” - meaning people have to transfer more than face value to the person selling the dollars on the black market.

When Mugabe said on Saturday he was going to review the performance of his ministers, speculation was rife that Mnangagwa, who said last week he had been poisoned in August, would be among the casualties.

Mnangagwa has come under attack from a ruling party faction that accuses him of seeking to force Mugabe to resign in his favor. The ZANU-PF is divided into two camps, one supporting Mnangagwa to succeed him and another rallying behind First Lady Grace Mugabe.

Mnangagwa, who denies the accusations, lost oversight of the Justice Ministry to the head of Zimbabwe’s spy agency Happyton Bonyongwe.

Bonyongwe, a retired army general who headed the national intelligence agency for 15 years, will be responsible for new legislation and will supervise the election due next year, including determining which foreign observers to invite.

Mugabe, who has ruled the former British colony since independence in 1980, has said he plans to run for another 5-year term next year, his last under the constitution, when he will be 94.

The suspects were part of a group of men who fled toward Kurdish-held lines when Iraqi forces captured the Islamic State base in Hawija, the Kurdish official told Reuters, asking not to be identified.

The report of militants fleeing, rather than fighting to the finish as in previous battles, suggested their morale may be fading, said Hisham al-Hashimi, a Baghdad-based expert on Islamic State affairs.

“They no longer seem to believe in the cause,” Hashimi told Reuters.

Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi released an audio recording two weeks ago that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. He urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks in Iraq and Syria.

“Approximately 1,000 men surrendered over the last week. Not all, however, are terrorists,” said the security official in Erbil, the northern Iraqi base of the Kurdistan Regional Government.

They handed themselves in to Peshmerga forces in the Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk, east of Hawija, he said. “It’s fair to say hundreds probably are ISIS (Islamic State) members, but that will be clear after the debriefs,” he said.

The town of Hawija and surrounding areas fell on Oct. 5 in an offensive by U.S.-backed Iraqi government troops and Iranian-trained and armed Shi‘ite paramilitary groups known as Popular Mobilisation.

Islamic State’s last territory in Iraq is now a stretch along the western border with Syria, including the border town of al-Qaim.

The militants also hold areas on the Syrian side of the border, but they are retreating there in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.

(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc unveiled a corporate makeover on Tuesday that will tie its growth more strongly to aerospace technology and spin off other businesses as two publicly-traded companies by the end of 2018.

The company also raised the low-end of its full-year 2017 earnings guidance by 5 cents to $7.05 - $7.10, and said it would spend the proceeds from the spin-offs on share buybacks, acquisitions and paying down debt.

Its shares fell 1 percent after Wall Street opened.

Honeywell Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk, like his peers at other industrial conglomerates, has been under pressure to pull apart a portfolio of disparate businesses that includes automotive turbo chargers, burglar alarms and the Xtratuf boots popular in Alaska’s fishing industry.

Honeywell had been under pressure from hedge fund Third Point to spin off the aerospace division, which accounted for about 36 percent of total revenue in 2016 and which Third Point said could generate $20 billion in shareholder value if sold.

The changes announced on Tuesday split off its home and ADI global distribution business - which deal with building systems running from air conditioning to smoke alarms - into one unit and transportation systems into a second.

They include the low-margin automotive turbocharger business, joining other companies, including auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, in shedding technology tied to the internal combustion engine as regulators around the world crack down on emissions and talk of mandating a switch to battery-electric vehicles over the next two decades.

Honeywell said the two spun-off business units together would generate annualized revenue of about $7.5 billion. It said it would gain $3 billion from the spin-offs.

Ahead of its quarterly earnings report, the company also said third quarter sales were expected to be $10.1 billion, up 5 percent in organic terms compared to an earlier forecast range of +/-1 percent.","Honeywell sticks with aerospace, spins off other units",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-honeywell-intl-aerospace/honeywell-sticks-with-aerospace-spins-off-other-units-idUKKBN1CF0CI?il=0

Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them.","In a flurry of confident pronouncements within an hour of the massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival, conservative commentators and activists linked the perpetrator, Stephen Paddock, to liberal or Islamist influences. Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them. Confusingly, these two publics are sometimes one.",Commentary: How hate speech can harm your brain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-speech-commentary/commentary-how-hate-speech-can-harm-your-brain-idUSKBN1CB1XD

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Yuriko Koike says she went into politics to be a player, not a bystander.

Now Tokyo’s first female governor is shaking things up as her new “Party of Hope” challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 poll, called by the Japanese leader to seek a fresh mandate after nearly five years in office.

When the Berlin Wall dividing East and West Germany was breached in 1989, Koike was a 37-year-old TV announcer. Three years later, she ran for parliament.

“The world was changing immensely, so I went from news presenter to newsmaker. I decided Japanese politics was moving too slowly and rather than be an outside critic, I should become ... a player on the inside,” Koike told Reuters in an interview.

Koike, who defied Abe’s party last year to run for governor, isn’t seeking a seat in parliament’s lower house herself, but is the driving force – and public face – of her upstart party.

In many ways, Koike is a paradox, interviews with people who know her and a review of her career show.

She’s a global thinker with a nationalist tinge; an entrepreneurial outsider who climbed the ladder with help from old-boy mentors, and a risk taker who has balked at perhaps her biggest gamble by declining to run in the national election now.

Koike has made no secret of her ambition to be Japan’s first woman prime minister – her pet female terrier is nicknamed “So-chan” – a diminutive for “sori” or “premier” in Japanese.

She has already cracked a few glass ceilings.

She became the country’s first female defence minister in 2007, although stepped down after 55 days after a tussle with a top bureaucrat. She was also the first woman to run for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s top leadership post in 2008, but came in a distant third.

Koike comes from a business family in western Japan, a background that sets her apart from many Japanese politicians, including Abe, who are scions of blue-blood political dynasties.

Her origins may account for a style that admirers say has more in common with venture capitalists than staid lawmakers.

“She’s not afraid to take initiatives, which in most of Japan is deeply frowned upon,” said a person who has known her for 25 years and advises on financial reforms. “In Japan, it’s subtlety within riddles, but she’s blunt.”

Koike has a talent for political marketing - critics call it populism - a skill she is using as she tries to differentiate her conservative party from Abe’s equally conservative LDP with promises to “break the fetters” of vested interest politics.

She calls her party’s economic policies “Yurinomics” in contrast to Abe’s “Abenomics, and its platform includes “12 Zeroes” it wants to achieve, including “zero hayfever”, and “zero euthanasia of unwanted pets”.

“DARK SIDE”

A graduate of Cairo University in 1976 who speaks Arabic and English, Koike in some ways has a global perspective and often sings the praises of diversity.

Like Abe, she advocates opening Japan to more highly skilled foreign workers. Also like Abe, she has visited Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism, but told Reuters she would not do so if she became premier.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Koike also espouses some causes dear to Japan’s rightwing, including revising the post-war, pacifist constitution.

In the past, she has even suggested Japan should consider acquiring nuclear weapons, breaking a taboo in the only country to suffer a nuclear attack. She also opposes local voting rights for foreign residents, many of whom are of Korean descent.

“There is a dark side that doesn’t jibe with a more open-minded, dare we say, liberal view,” said her long-time acquaintance.

Koike migrated through several parties before joining the LDP in 2002, only to abandon it after becoming governor.

She counts among her mentors Ichiro Ozawa, a one-time LDP heavyweight who helped engineer the long-ruling party’s ouster in 1993 and again in 2009, as well as popular ex-premier Junichiro Koizumi.

Critics say her career reflects an opportunist streak, while allies call it practical.

”She wants to make change, but she’s also pragmatic – she can make a deal with anyone – Communists or Abe or traditional stakeholders,” said another adviser. “It’s a kind of talent.”

Despite speculation that she would abandon her job as governor to return to parliament, Koike stuck to her decision not to run. Analysts say that’s likely because her party has little chance of defeating Abe’s ruling bloc, but may do well enough for her to take the leap in the next poll.

But those who know Koike say her desire for the nation’s top post remains. “Is she Machiavellian and strategic? The answer is yes. Is she prepared to think for the long run? The answer is yes,” said her long-time acquaintance.

“Is her over-riding ambition to be Japan’s first female prime minister? That is definitely a goal.”",Japan's Koike: a political paradox shakes things up ahead of poll,https://www.reuters.com/article/japan-election-koike/japans-koike-a-political-paradox-shakes-things-up-ahead-of-poll-idINKBN1CF1PT?il=0

Belief in witchcraft is widespread in rural Malawi, one of the world’s poorest countries, where many aid agencies and NGOs work. A spate of vigilante violence linked to a vampire rumors also erupted in Malawi in 2002.

“These districts have severely been affected by the ongoing stories of blood sucking and possible existence of vampires,” the UN Department on Safety and Security (UNDSS) said in a security report on the Phalombe and Mulanje districts that was seen by Reuters.

The Acting UN Resident Coordinator, Florence Rolle, said in an emailed response to questions that based on the report that “some UN staff have relocated while others are still in the districts depending on locations of their operations”.

“UNDSS is continuing to monitor the situation closely to ensure all affected UN staff are back in the field as soon as possible,” Rolle said.

Rolle did not say how many workers had been relocated.

The UNDSS report said at least five people had been killed in the area since mid-September by lynch mobs accusing them of vampirism. It said mobs searching for vampires have been mounting road blocks in the district, raising security concerns.

Malawian President Peter Mutharika said the reports were “distressing and agonizing”.

“This development has been of grave concern to the President and the entire Government,” his office said in a statement.

The UNDSS report said the vampirism rumors appear to have originated in neighboring Mozambique, although it was not clear what had sparked them. It recommended the “temporary suspension of U.N. activities in the area until the situation is normalized”.

Russian financial authorities initially treated any sort of money issued by non-state approved institutions as illegal, saying they could be used to launder money.

Later the authorities accepted the globally booming market of crypto-currencies but want to either control the turnover or to limit access to the market

“We cannot stand apart. We cannot give direct and easy access to such dubious instruments for retail (investors),” Shvetsov said, referring to households.

Speaking at a conference on financial market derivatives, Shvetsov said the central bank sees rising interest in crypto-currencies because of high returns from buying into such instruments.

He warned, however, that crypto-currencies gradually transform into high-yielding assets from being a mean of payment.

Bitcoin, the most well-known virtual currency that emerged in mid-2010, last traded at around $4,807, up from its initial price of less than $1.

“We think that for our citizens, for businesses the usage of such crypto-currencies as an investment object carries unreasonably high risks,” he said.

Russian authorities said earlier this year they would like to regulate the use of crypto-currencies by Russian citizens and companies.",Russian central bank to ban websites offering crypto-currencies,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cenbank-bitcoin/russian-central-bank-to-ban-websites-offering-crypto-currencies-idUSKBN1CF0RF

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The company, which counts Marks & Spencer (MKS.L), Waitrose and Tesco (TSCO.L) as major customers, said on Tuesday it aimed to raise around 100 million pounds from issuing new shares and would also sell part of the stakes held by U.S. hedge fund Baupost and Icelandic founders Agust and Lydur Gudmundsson.

London is seeing a pick up in listings, with this year’s total already far outpacing 2016 when volatility caused by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union caused a number of initial public offerings (IPO) to be postponed or canceled.

Over the past week, half a dozen companies have announced plans to list on London’s main market, between them aiming to raise as much as $3.7 billion, compared with around $4 billion in the third quarter.

These include Dutch business services firm TMF Group and Russia’s En+ Group, which is launching an IPO in London and Moscow, testing investors’ appetite for Russian assets three years after Western countries imposed sanctions on Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis. [nASM000ER2] [nL8N1MG0Q3]

Bakkavor, which is using the IPO to reduce its leverage and make more investments, generated revenues of almost 1.8 billion pounds and pretax profits of 63.1 million pounds last year.

It started as a cod roe manufacturer and exporter before the Gudmundsson brothers expanded the business with acquisitions financed with debt, borrowings that meant the company was swept up in Iceland’s financial crisis before it eventually restructured and attracted new investors. [nL8N1MD5FR]

The company has also appointed Simon Burke as its independent non-executive chairman, replacing Lydur Gudmundsson, who co-founded the business 31 years ago and will remain a non-executive director.

Burke, a former accountant, was previously the chairman and chief executive of Hamleys, the world’s oldest toy shop which under his leadership was sold to Icelandic firm Baugur in 2003. Baugur later collapsed and Hamleys is currently owned by Chinese retailer C. Banner.

Tens of thousands of soldiers are taking part in the massive four-yearly war games that are both a drill as well as a show of strength for the West. Next time around, in 2021, those troops might be sharing their battle space with a different type of force: self-driving drones, tanks, ships and submersibles.

Drone warfare is hardly new – the first lethal attack conducted by an American unmanned aerial vehicle took place in Afghanistan in October 2001. What is now changing fast, however, is the ability of such unmanned systems to operate without a guiding human hand.

That’s a truly revolutionary shift – and one every major nation wants to be lead. Critics have long feared countries might be more willing to go to war with unmanned systems. Now, some see a very real risk control might pass beyond human beings altogether.

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has long warned that humanity might be on the verge of some cataclysmic errors when it comes to artificial intelligence. Last month, he ramped that up with a warning that the development of autonomous weapons platforms might provoke a potentially devastating arms race.

As if to reinforce Musk’s point, Russian President Vladimir Putin told students shortly thereafter that he believed the technology would be a game changer, making it clear Russia would plow resources into it. “The one who becomes leader in this will become ruler of the world,” Putin was quoted as saying.

China too is pushing ahead, believed by some experts to now be the global leader when it comes to developing autonomous swarms of drones.

Already, drones are able to fly themselves independently so they can stay airborne if they lose touch with human pilots. Soon they may be able to make their own tactical decisions. At Georgia Tech in the United States this summer, researchers programmed swarms of light drones to fight their own aerial dogfights. The U.S. military is trying out similar products.

That means one operator could command many, many more drones – or that they might not need direct supervision at all.

Even more important than what is happening in robotics may be the wider developments in artificial intelligence. That won’t make warfare necessarily more deadly – a bomb dropped from a drone is not in itself less lethal than one from a manned aircraft. While it’s possible that greater accuracy might reduce casualties, some analysts fear that the changes brought by new unmanned systems might themselves fuel new conflicts.

“Radical technological change begets radical government policy ideas,” concluded a July report on the topic produced for the U.S. intelligence community by Harvard University’s Belfer Center. It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.

Artificial intelligence could dramatically increase the efficiency of surveillance technology, allowing a single system to monitor perhaps millions of digital conversations, hacked personal devices and other sources of information. The implications could be terrifying, particularly in the hands of a state with little or no democratic oversight.

At a recent UK panel discussion, Britain’s former Special Forces director Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb predicted that by 2030, technological breakthroughs – not just AI, but quantum computing and beyond – would produce entirely unpredictable changes. Special force teams, he suggested, might well have a robotic and artificial intelligence component deployed alongside them – the U.S. Army calls this “manned-unmanned teaming.”

That sounds like something out of science fiction – and it might well look like it. Last year, Russia unveiled its FEDOR humanoid military robot, which it demonstrated firing a gun.

Most countries deliberately keep their defense AI secret, ultimately fueling the arms race Musk was warning about. Some scientists already worry about a real-world version of the premise for the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring “Terminator” film franchise in which the United States, fearing cyber attack, hands control of key military systems to the artificial intelligence Skynet. (Skynet, fearing its human creators might choose to turn it off, immediately launches a full-scale nuclear attack on humanity.)

For now, Western nations at least look keen to keep a human in the “kill chain.” Not all countries may make that choice, however. Russia has long had a reputation for trusting machines more than people, at one stage considering – and, some evidence suggests, building – an automated system to launch its nuclear arsenal should its command structure be destroyed by a first strike.

Outside of the military, there is evidence AI algorithms have already alarmed their creators. In August, Facebook shut down an AI experiment after programs involved began communicating with each other in a language the humans monitoring them could not understand.

Is this the end for ordinary human soldiering? Almost certainly not. It’s even been argued that a more complex, high-tech battlefield might require more soldiers, not fewer.

Robotic systems may be vulnerable to hacking, jamming and simply rendered inoperable through electronic warfare. Such techniques allow U.S.-led forces in Iraq to largely negate the off-the-shelf drones being used by Islamic State. Russia used similar techniques against Western-made drones in Ukraine.

That’s a worry for armed forces betting – like many industries – on automation. Britain’s new aircraft carrier has only a fraction of the sailors on its only slightly larger U.S. carrier counterparts, relying heavily on automatic systems to manage weaponry and damage control. The latest Russian tank, the T-14 Armata, has an automated turret that will usually be out of reach to most of its crew. Such techniques have clear advantages – but also mean that interfering with electronics could leave them useless.

Such technology is coming whether it is a good idea or not. Indeed, even relatively old military equipment increasingly can be retrofitted. Russian engineers have already demonstrated that they can adapt the 20-year-old T-90 tank to be controlled remotely.

Ironically, the North Korean crisis reminds us that the most dangerous technologies may well remain those invented more than 70 years ago – atomic weapons and the missiles that carry them. Even if mankind can avoid a nuclear apocalypse, however, the coming AI and robotic revolution may prove an equal existential challenge.",Commentary: The coming robot arms race,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-robots-commentary/commentary-the-coming-robot-arms-race-idUSKCN1BT1XN

The world’s third largest defence contractor, whose products include the Typhoon Eurofighter jet and Astute-class nuclear-powered submarines, reported a better than expected 11 percent rise in half-year core profits to 945 million pounds ($1.25 billion) and said it was on track to meet its full-year target.

“It’s clear that we have the right strategy that harnesses our strengths, so we will continue to stay the course,” he said.

“It’s very much a case of evolution not revolution. It’s a good strategy bolstered by the macro environment we now operate in.”

Group sales were up 4 percent at 9.6 billion pounds on a constant currency basis in the first six months of 2017, while earnings per share were up 14 percent at 19.8 pence, beating analysts’ forecasts for sales of 9.1 billion pounds and earnings of 19 pence a share.

The interim dividend was increased to 8.8 pence a share, from 8.6 pence last time.

Woodburn, a former oil industry executive who spent 15 years at Schlumberger (SLB.N), said he had taken a “good hard look” at BAE in the 15 months he spent as chief operating officer before taking over from Ian King as CEO in July.

The Cambridge University electrical engineering graduate said BAE expected to benefit from governments spending more on defence in some of its biggest markets, but it could still do more to improve efficiency.

“We will do that by continuing to be focused on our costs as well as bringing together the power of the group more effectively, collaborating to the benefit of our customers,” he said.

He pointed to work by business units in Australia and the United States on the Land 400 combat vehicle project in Australia as an example of successful collaboration.

BAE’s largest markets are Britain and the United States, and it also has substantial operations in Saudi Arabia, India and Australia.

It has long been expecting a major follow-on Typhoon order from Saudi Arabia but Woodburn declined to comment on the prospects on Wednesday.

“I am certainly not going to speculate on Typhoon, other than to say we are confident we will get future Typhoon orders in the portfolio,” he told reporters.

BAE’s shares, which have risen 14.6 percent in the last year against a 11.5 percent rise for the FTSE 100 <0#.FTSE>, were down 1 percent at 600 pence at 1152 GMT.

The stock has been boosted by the prospect of an increase in the U.S. defence budget, although Woodburn cautioned that any benefit would not be felt for some time in BAE.

“It takes time for these things to filter through,” he said. “We are not expecting further uptick in the immediate future, but in the medium term I think it does look positive.”

As a result Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris, who has a ‘hold’ rating on the shares, said he remained cautious about the company’s current growth prospects.

“The key question is whether BAE is gaining momentum heading into FY18 – we are not sure of that,” he said in a note.

“While BAE’s outlook in the USA is probably positive, that in the UK and Saudi Arabia is arguably not, so we end up with a tie. Unless the world gets scarier still, BAE’s overall progress may remain sedate.”

The company confirmed its forecast for underlying earnings per share this year to be 5-10 percent higher than the 40.3 pence it made in 2016.

It said that although there had been no change to its earnings forecast for the overall group, it had seen a deterioration in the performance of its cyber security business.

As a result it said it was restructuring the Cyber & Intelligence unit, which accounts for 3 percent of group sales and made a loss of 27 million pounds in the first half, despite achieving double-digit sales growth.

“What is key for us is to make sure that we translate this double-digit growth into sustainable, profitable growth going forward,” Woodburn said.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) plans to reduce the size of its European dealer network and introduce online sales as it adjusts to changing buying habits, the German carmaker said on Tuesday.

VW is pushing to cut costs across all of its 12 brands in the wake of the emissions scandal as it faces having to invest heavily in the shift toward electric cars.

In the latest move it aims to increase profitability and efficiency at its 3,000-dealer European distribution network by an average of 10 percent and wants to trim the costs of the network to help double the average return per distributor to 2 percent from 1 percent.

“We have for years been in consolidation mode in all world markets,” VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann told reporters. “This will surely accelerate somewhat in the next one, two years, also in Germany.”

But the executive gave no detail on the size of planned cost reductions and the number of dealerships due to be axed under VW’s “future sales model.”

Customers of mass-market car brands like VW’s are already making greater use of online shopping, allowing them to better compare rival offerings.

VW and dealers are now developing a joint online portal, Stackmann said, without giving details.

Reduced costs will also come from greater use of new IT, enabling dealerships to cut the time needed for servicing cars by as much as 70 percent, according to VW.

A VW distributor in Europe on average employs 35 staff and that workforce can be cut by about four over time or the staff affected can be assigned elsewhere, Stackmann said.

Under the terms of the carmaker’s new contracts with dealers, to be concluded early next year, VW wants to forego its right to dictate workforce sizes, he said, allowing dealers to trim staff.","VW to reduce size of dealer network, launch online sales",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-volkswagen-dealers/vw-to-reduce-size-of-dealer-network-launch-online-sales-idUKKBN1CF13B?il=0

The poll, carried out the weekend following May’s speech to the Conservative Party’s annual conference, found that 57 percent of voters agreed that the prime minister should stay on at least until Brexit negotiations are completed in March 2019.

Only one in five, in a survey of more than 2,000 voters, thought that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson would make a better replacement to May.

May’s bid to reassert her dwindling authority seemed to be stymied last week when her speech was interrupted by repeated coughing fits, a prankster, and even letters of her slogan falling off the set behind her.

The speech comes just months after a June snap election saw her party lose its majority in parliament days before the opening of formal Brexit talks with the European Union.

Support for May’s Conservative Party is currently running at 40 percent in opinion polls, the newspaper said.

“Ironically last week may have actually won the PM some more support. Between pranksters, leadership challenges, set failures and a nasty cough it seems that comes the public have rallied somewhat to her deference,” Johnny Heald, spokesman for pollster ORB International, told the Telegraph.

A review of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data obtained through right-to-information requests shows banks’ total stressed loans - including non-performing and restructured or rolled over loans - rose 4.5 percent in the six months to end-June. In the previous six months they had risen 5.8 percent.

While banks remain the main source of funding for India’s companies, the stubborn bad debt problem has eaten into bank profits and choked off new lending, especially to smaller firms, at a time when an economy that depends on them is stalling.

India grew at its slowest pace in three years in April-June - a concern for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces elections in 2019 and has pledged to create millions of new jobs before then.

Banks are having to take higher provisions to account for more defaulters being pushed into bankruptcy. And margins are likely to be squeezed further by proposed new rules to encourage commercial banks to pass on central bank interest rate cuts.

To be sure, the bulk of India’s sour loans are in the state banks and stem from lending to large conglomerates, especially in steel and infrastructure. But analysts say the rise in bad loans among small firms, and even retail borrowing, is worrying and will do little to encourage new loans to help fuel growth.

“On the corporate side, we think it’s a recognition cycle which is nearing an end,” said Alka Anbarasu, senior analyst at Moody’s Investor Service, referring to more bad loans being recognized as such, as banks come under pressure from the RBI and other regulators. “But it’s really those data points beyond corporate that are causing some worry.”

Anbarasu forecast weak quarters ahead for banks before profitability picks up, and several senior bankers from public sector lenders - which account for more than two-thirds of Indian banking assets - agreed the months ahead would be strained.

Stressed loans as a percentage of total loans reached 12.6 percent at end-June, according to the RBI data, the highest level in at least 15 years.

HIGHER PROVISIONS, WEAKER LOANS

Part of the issue for banks and the government is a strict provisioning regime: the RBI wants banks to provide for at least 50 percent of the secured loans to companies taken to bankruptcy proceedings, and 100 percent for the unsecured part.

A dozen of the biggest such cases account for nearly 1.78 trillion rupees, or a quarter of total non-performing assets.

For those companies, banks will need to provide 180 billion rupees on top of existing provisions, according to July estimates from India Ratings and Research, the local affiliate of Fitch Ratings.

More than 20 other sizeable companies are at risk of being taken to bankruptcy court.

Bankers say these and other pressures - including rising government bond yields that forced banks to post mark-to-market losses - have added to the squeeze, and hit new loans.

According to RBI data, new loans grew at just about 5 percent in the year to March, the lowest growth rate in more than six decades. Several banks have already cut back their loan books to conserve capital.

“What are they (RBI) thinking while they’re taking these steps all at the same time?” said a treasurer at a state-run bank, who didn’t want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. “Do they want banks to wind up their businesses, or do they want to save the banks?”

Treasury income accounted for 22.7 percent of banks’ operating profits in the last financial year, doubling its share from a year earlier, India Ratings estimates.

“The almost zero treasury income will hit provisioning ability and, in turn, make it more difficult for weaker banks to give loans as capital becomes more scarce,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, an associate director at the rating agency.

A senior policymaker, who requested anonymity as the discussions are not public, said the government would have to help to sufficiently capitalize the banks.

Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks will need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules. Moody’s expects the top 11 state lenders alone will need nearly $15 billion. The government has just $3 billion left in its budget for bank recapitalization.

“We think capitalization is the biggest challenge for the banks at the moment, given that earnings will remain subdued and will not support any capital generation,” said Moody’s Anbarasu.",Exclusive: No respite for Indian banks as bad loans hit record $146 billion,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-banks/exclusive-no-respite-for-indian-banks-as-bad-loans-hit-record-146-billion-idINKBN1CF1NX

STATUS QUOIt does not seem there is any outcome that leaves Spain’s economy unscathed.
Tensions will only increase if Catalonia defies Madrid and declares independence over the coming days.","LONDON (Reuters) - Investors who lend billions of euros to Spain every year are struggling to sketch out the repercussions for the country’s finances of a possible independence proclamation by the wealthy region of Catalonia.

Regional leader Carles Puigdemont prepared to address on Tuesday a parliamentary session that may unilaterally declare independence from Spain following a banned referendum on Oct. 1.

Such a move would drive a wedge between escalate the Spanish government and a region that makes up a fifth of the country’s economic output and more than a quarter of its exports.

As one fund manager told Reuters, working out how all this will pan out for the euro zone’s fourth largest economy is “so complicated it makes Brexit look like a walk in the park,” but here are some of the best guesses so far:

1. INDEPENDENCE

This is the scenario - considered unlikely by many analysts -- that could prove most damaging to Spain’s overall financial position, its economy and government borrowing costs.

Secession would be also expected to harm Catalonia’s economy, while uncertainty is likely to push up bond yields in both a newly-independent state as well as for Spain.

According to ABN AMRO, Catalan independence could raise Spain’s government-debt ratio to as high as 115 percent of GDP from current levels around 99 percent - leapfrogging Cyprus and Belgium to have the fourth largest debt load in the euro area.

However, Catalonia has said it would take responsibility for its share of central government debt, reducing the burden on Spain.

But the real problem would be how Spain would balance its books without Catalonia’s contribution. At roughly 4.5 percent of GDP in 2016, Spain already has the highest budget deficit in the euro zone.

Fathom Consulting said if Catalonia leaves, the economic shock could see the budget deficit run to nearly 7 percent in a couple of years - back to levels seen in the wake of the euro zone debt crisis. ABN AMRO forecasts a deficit of 5.5-6 percent.

2. DEVOLUTION

Many analysts expect the likely outcome of Spain’s worst political crisis in decades will be greater devolution of powers to Catalonia like those enjoyed by the Basque country.

But generous fiscal autonomy from Madrid could come at considerable cost to the public purse.

According to a 2014 study by research house CSIC, the Spanish state could lose about 16 billion euros. That would equal about 13 percent of next year’s budget.

“It would be painful economically,” said Tim Davis, chief investment strategist at Fathom Consulting. “The budget deficit in Spain would increase and then you would need to see some kind of additional austerity to plug that gap or you would start to see bond yields rise.”

3. STATUS QUO

It does not seem there is any outcome that leaves Spain’s economy unscathed.

Rating agencies have already said the tensions alone could have negative consequences for Spain’s credit rank, deterring investment and weakening the ability of Spain’s minority Popular Party government to implement national policy.

The crisis already looks to have claimed its first victim: a delay in passing the 2018 budget.

Tensions will only increase if Catalonia defies Madrid and declares independence over the coming days. One of the tools at Spain’s disposal is to trigger Article 155 of the constitution, which would allows it to take control of devolved powers.",Spain's creditors size up cost of Catalan independence bid,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia-bonds/spains-creditors-size-up-cost-of-catalan-independence-bid-idUSKBN1CF1P7?il=0

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has been dogged by allegations of mismanagement for decades. The OPEC member country, Africa’s biggest economy, relies on oil for around two-thirds of government revenue.

The tension between the oil ministry and NNPC came into the public eye when a letter of complaint to the president from Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, Nigeria’s oil minister, dated Aug. 30 was made pubic and confirmed by the ministry.

Kachikwu’s letter alleged NNPC Group Managing Director (GMD) Maikanti Baru had bypassed the company board on key decisions, including the allocation of contracts, and did not follow due process.

The minister also said Baru’s recent appointments should be suspended pending a review. Nigerian lawmakers last week passed a motion to investigate the allegations.

“The allegations were baseless and due process has been followed in the various activities,” NNPC said in an emailed statement.

“It is important to note from the outset that the law and the rules do not require a review or discussion with the minister of state or the NNPC board on contractual matters,” the state oil company said.

The NNPC statement did not address Kachikwu’s allegations that Baru had made key appointments without the usual oversight of the minister or the board.

In a separate statement on Monday, NNPC said Nigeria’s two main oil worker trade unions had given their support to the state oil firm.

“We just want to tell the GMD from the bottom of our hearts that we are with him and the top management; that we are behind the GMD who has done very well in turning the fortunes of the corporation around,” said Mathew Duru, a Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria official, according to the statement.

NNPC, on its Twitter feed, said: “Following publication of alleged lack of due process in the award of contracts, Pres. @MBuhari ordered GMD @NNPCgroup @DrMKBaru to respond.”

Kachikwu met with President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday after the letter was leaked last week. It was the first time they had held private talks since Buhari returned to Nigeria on Aug. 19 from three months of medical leave in Britain.

Kachikwu is the minister of state for petroleum, technically a junior minister. Buhari kept the portfolio of petroleum minister for himself.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could join a formal trade alliance with the United States, Canada and Mexico if the European Union refuses to clinch a post-Brexit trade deal, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Tuesday without citing sources.

The newspaper said British ministers were looking at the idea of joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as part of planning for possibility of Britain leaving the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal.

Britain’s international trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

Britain is currently negotiating the terms of its divorce from the EU though Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing to move onto discussions about a major free trade deal with the world’s biggest trading bloc.

With the clock ticking down towards Brexit day in 2019, British ministers are exploring what they will do if the world’s fifth largest economy drops out of the EU without a clear trade deal.

Besides aiming to clinch a U.S. trade deal or forming some new trade grouping, some British supporters of Brexit have pondered joining an existing trade deal such as NAFTA.

But U.S. President Donald Trump has warned he may terminate the 1994 NAFTA deal because he says it does not serve U.S. economic interests.

If Britain did join NAFTA, manufacturers wanting to export to the EU and North America would have to produce goods in accordance with the two separate sets of rules, according to trade analysts.

Britain, whose regulation has been within the EU’s orbit for over 40 years, would also have to shift towards the North American model for services, goods, competition policy and data protection.

MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Two staff members of a Kenyan university were killed south of Mombasa on Tuesday when gunmen fired on vehicles carrying them and students to their campus, the area police chief said.

The identity of the gunmen was unclear. Police in the coastal county of Kwale, where the Technical University of Mombasa (TUM) has a campus, said they could be robbers or militants.

Security is poor in the area and the convoy had a police escort. Somali Islamist militants al Shabaab frequently carry out attacks along the Kenyan coast and have been recruiting new members there.

“A bus carrying students of TUM was ferrying them from their hostels to the campus in Ukunda for classes and was being escorted by a van that had some staff of the college and two escort police officers,” the policeman said.

“Armed men numbering about 10 emerged from the bushes and started firing at the van in front. As a result two ladies who are staff of TUM were killed in the van. The driver of the van and two police officers were injured,” he said.

(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc unveiled a corporate makeover on Tuesday that will tie its growth more strongly to aerospace technology and spin off other businesses as two publicly-traded companies by the end of 2018.

The company also raised the low-end of its full-year 2017 earnings guidance by 5 cents to $7.05 - $7.10, and said it would spend the proceeds from the spin-offs on share buybacks, acquisitions and paying down debt.

Its shares fell 1 percent after Wall Street opened.

Honeywell Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk, like his peers at other industrial conglomerates, has been under pressure to pull apart a portfolio of disparate businesses that includes automotive turbo chargers, burglar alarms and the Xtratuf boots popular in Alaska’s fishing industry.

Honeywell had been under pressure from hedge fund Third Point to spin off the aerospace division, which accounted for about 36 percent of total revenue in 2016 and which Third Point said could generate $20 billion in shareholder value if sold.

The changes announced on Tuesday split off its home and ADI global distribution business - which deal with building systems running from air conditioning to smoke alarms - into one unit and transportation systems into a second.

They include the low-margin automotive turbocharger business, joining other companies, including auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, in shedding technology tied to the internal combustion engine as regulators around the world crack down on emissions and talk of mandating a switch to battery-electric vehicles over the next two decades.

Honeywell said the two spun-off business units together would generate annualized revenue of about $7.5 billion. It said it would gain $3 billion from the spin-offs.

Ahead of its quarterly earnings report, the company also said third quarter sales were expected to be $10.1 billion, up 5 percent in organic terms compared to an earlier forecast range of +/-1 percent.","Honeywell sticks with aerospace, spins off other units",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honeywell-intl-aerospace/honeywell-sticks-with-aerospace-spins-off-other-units-idUSKBN1CF0CO

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares ground out a fresh record high on Tuesday, making it almost 50 for the year, although Europe traded cautiously as markets waited to see whether Spain’s Catalonia region would push for independence later in the day.

Japan and South Korea returned from extended breaks to give Asia a lift a Wall Street looked set to open higher, [.N] but the Catalan uncertainty meant the euro zone’s main bourses [.EU] and Spanish bond markets spent the day in the red.

Catalonia’s secessionist leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the region’s parliament in Barcelona around 1600 GMT and could ask the assembly to vote on a unilateral declaration of independence from Madrid.

It is Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and Madrid’s IBEX stocks index was 1 percent lower in early afternoon trade. It is now down almost 9 percent since May, though a sharp rise in the euro has also taken a toll.

“We have not witnessed any relevant statement or signal by the separatists that would hint at a change of strategy ahead of today’s discussion in the Catalonian parliament,” economists at Barclays wrote.

“Consequently, at this point, it seems likely that Catalan President Carles Puigdemont remains on track to announce a unilateral declaration of independence as early as today.”

The euro remained resilient. It hopped to a one-week high of almost $1.18 as data showed German exports surged in August. Traders were also still upbeat after one of the European Central Bank’s German policymakers called for an end to its stimulus.

There was also help from a weaker dollar which was down for a third straight day. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, dropped 0.3 percent to 93.366 and away from Friday’s almost 3-month peak.

It gave the Turkish lira a breather after it had been sent sprawling to a nine-month low on Monday after the United States and Turkey scaled back visa services.

Mexico’s peso hovered at its weakest in more than four months too, ahead of the latest round of talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Wednesday.

“Mexican asset prices have been very well supported this year so we think there needs to be a little bit of caution,” said UBP’s EM macro and FX strategist Koon Chow.

“There is not much of a cushion for bad news now and NAFTA talks are unlikely to bring any good news.”

KOREA PATH

Futures markets pointed to Wall Street breaking a two-day run of falls with the third quarter earning season now gathering steam. [.N]

Bond markets, meanwhile, were waiting to see if 10-year Treasuries would get above 2.4 percent ahead of another Fed rate hike that is now seen as almost nailed on for December.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari and his Dallas counterpart, Robert Kaplan, are due to make speeches later ahead of the minutes from the Fed’s September meeting, which will be published on Wednesday.

Overnight, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had climbed 0.6 percent, boosted by a 1.6 percent jump in Korea as shares of firms such as Samsung which have been closed for the past week, caught up with some of the global rally.

Japan’s Nikkei brushed off a weak start to finish 0.6 percent higher too, though China stocks dipped as investors cashed in some of the gains that took them to a 21-month high in the previous session. [.SS]

China’s Statistics Bureau on Tuesday said the country would have no problem meeting its economic growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, and might even beat it. Such an outcome had been widely expected after a robust start to the year.

The offshore Chinese yuan rate surged to its strongest level in more than two weeks. The central bank had also set a firmer-than-expected official rate, suggesting authorities are keen to keep the currency in check ahead of next week’s key national leadership meeting.

The stocks gains came in spite of tensions on the Korean peninsula. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Monday that any further escalation of the situation was unacceptable.

China had also called for restraint. U.S. President Donald Trump warned over the weekend that “only one thing will work” in dealing with Pyongyang, hinting that military action was on his mind.

In commodities, Brent oil prices pushed back above $56 a barrel after top producer Saudi Arabia signaled it would trim its exports and as OPEC flagged ongoing efforts to try to restore the longer-term “balance” of the market.

Brent jumped 50 cents to $56.31 a barrel, while a 54 cents rise took U.S. crude back to $50 a barrel.

“The kingdom expects all other participants in the (agreement) to follow suit and to maintain the high levels of overall conformity,” a Saudi oil Ministry spokesman said.

In a blunt and personal attack on outgoing ambassador John Bass, Erdogan suggested Bass acted unilaterally in suspending visa services in Turkey after the arrest of a U.S. consulate worker, and said “agents” had infiltrated U.S. missions.

The dispute has plunged already fragile relations between the two NATO allies to a new low after months of tension linked to the conflict in Syria, last year’s failed military coup in Turkey, and U.S. court cases against Turkish officials.

The U.S. embassy said on Sunday night it was suspending visa services while it assessed Turkey’s commitment to the safety of its missions and its staff, a message reiterated in a video released by Bass late on Monday.

“An ambassador in Ankara taking decisions and saying he is doing so in the name of his government is strange,” Erdogan said. “If our ambassador did this, we wouldn’t keep him there even a minute.”

The embassy said allegations that the arrested employee had links to Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the failed coup against Erdogan last year, were baseless.

But Erdogan said the arrest, and a police request to question a second consulate employee, showed “there is something cooking in the U.S. consulate in Istanbul... How did these agents infiltrate the U.S. consulate?”

He said Bass, who is due to leave the country within days to take up a posting in Afghanistan, had been making farewell visits to government offices.

“But our ministers, parliament speaker and myself did not accept and will not accept his request because we do not see him as a representative of the United States,” Erdogan told a televised news conference during a visit to Belgrade.

“NOT TRIBES”

Turkey’s currency and stock market were both hit on Monday by the dispute. On Tuesday, the main BIST 100 stock index rebounded, rising 1.94 percent by 1320 GMT, and the lira was also up 1 percent at 3.6675 to the dollar.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the visa suspension had punished citizens of both countries, and accused Washington of taking an emotional and inappropriate step against an ally.

“You are making your citizens and ours pay the price,” he said. “We call on the United States to be more reasonable. The issue must of course be resolved as soon as possible,” he said, describing U.S. behavior as “unbecoming” of an ally.

In a speech in Ankara to ruling AK Party parliamentarians, Yildirim also defended Turkey’s decision to retaliate with its own visa suspension after the U.S. embassy announcement.

“Turkey is not a tribal state, we will retaliate against what has been done in kind,” he said.

Relations between the countries have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and Turkey’s so far unsuccessful calls for Gulen’s extradition.

U.S. courts have also indicted a Turkish banker and a former minister for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran, as well as 15 of Erdogan’s security guards for attacking peaceful protesters during his visit to Washington in May.

“Did you ask permission from us when you dragged a general manager from our national bank into jail?” Yildirim said. “Why are you harboring Gulen? Does this fit our alliance or friendship?”

Yildirim said if the United States wanted to continue its alliance with Turkey it should stop support for YPG fighters battling Islamic State in Syria. Turkey says the YPG is an extension of the outlawed PKK which has fought a three-decade insurgency in southeast Turkey.

“We need, in a possible Jamaica coalition agreement, a significantly higher level of detail than was the case with the grand coalition,” he said.

Alexander Dobrindt, parliamentary floor leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), said a coalition agreement would have to be more detailed than the one that accompanied the Grand Coalition in the last parliament.

Merkel, humbled in last month’s national election by a surging far-right, is trying to broker a three-way coalition of her conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens - a combination previously untested at federal level.

The task is further complicated by the fact that Merkel’s conservative bloc compromises her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and CSU, whose alliance has been strained by her open-door migrants policy.

The conservative allies removed one obstacle to forming a new coalition on Sunday by agreeing a limit on the number of migrants arriving in Germany. But Dobrindt of the CSU said in an interview with Reuters television that securing a three-way alliance would be hard.

“As we know that the points that separate us outweigh those we have in common, one can have doubts about whether a coalition agreement is possible this year,” Dobrindt said.

“It is conceivable that we can’t complete in December and that final talks - if there even are any - will only possible next year,” he added.

The three-way tie-up - dubbed a “Jamaica” coalition after the black, green and yellow colours of the three party blocs, which match the Caribbean island’s flag - is Merkel’s only realistic option of forming a government.

The centre-left Social Democrats, her previous partners in a the Grand Coalition, insist they want to go into opposition.

A Jamaica coalition was formed in the tiny western state of Saarland in October 2009, but collapsed in January 2012. The same formation took power in the far northern region of Schleswig-Holstein after elections there in May this year.

BIG DIFFERENCES

At a national level, the three party groups have deep differences on issues ranging from migration to European Union reform, tax and the environment. Dobrindt said this meant they would have to nail down a detailed agreement.

“We need, in a possible Jamaica coalition agreement, a significantly higher level of detail than was the case with the grand coalition,” he said. “The differences between the parties are big, so the agreements need to go deeper.”

In their compromise struck on Sunday, the CDU and CSU agreed to limit to 200,000 the number of people Germany would accept per year on humanitarian grounds.

The FDP and Greens insist the conservatives’ agreement cannot simply be copied into a coalition deal.

But Dobrindt, whose CSU is worried about losing its regional dominance in a Bavarian state election next year, said the allies’ accord must be reflected in a coalition deal.

“The regulations we have made in our joint paper - ‘Rules on Migration’ - are of course an essential part of the negotiations and must also be found in a coalition agreement,” he said.

The intransigence of the CSU, the Greens and the FDP on the migrants issue points to difficult coalition talks that risk clouding the political outlook in Germany, which has been a source of stability in Europe during Merkel’s 12 years in power.

“We want Europe to concentrate more on the big tasks and less on the small tasks,” Dobrindt said. “That means we must talk about bringing back responsibilities from Brussels to Germany - and the details of that will no doubt be difficult.”",Germany may not agree new coalition until next year: Merkel ally,https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-politics/germany-may-not-agree-new-coalition-until-next-year-merkel-ally-idINKBN1CF1O3?il=0

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.
“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up.
“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper.","LONDON (Reuters) - Last week’s shocking British election result and the period of political uncertainty that looks set to follow may have come at the worst of times for the country’s economy and the value of the pound sterling.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly excited about the prospects for much faster growth in the solar power industry in Southeast Asia, which has until now been a backwater for renewable energy.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co and Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] have led a $100 million investment in Bill.com, a Palo Alto, California-based company that helps business digitize their payments.

The round, which included participation from existing investors, will be used by the company to expand its distribution, Bill.com said on Tuesday.

The investment comes after the company revealed last month that it had partnered with JPMorgan to help its business clients make and receive payments electronically.

Bill.com, which runs a large business payment network in the United States, is among the cohort of young technology companies that are seeking to help modernize financial services by making better use of technology.

Business-to-business payments in the United States have been particularly slow to adapt to new digital technologies.

Roughly 80 percent of all payments made by U.S. businesses still involve paper checks, according Bill.com. It estimates this is costing banks $180 billion annually.

Bill.com’s technology can be integrated into the websites of banks and accounting software providers to make it easier for businesses to send and receive payments digitally.

The company has 100,000 customers, which represent more than 1 percent of U.S. businesses, and is looking to expand its reach, René Lacerte, chief executive officer and founder of Bill.com said in an interview. It also plans to use the funding to enhance its product, he said. “Examples would be international payments,” Lacerte said.

He noted businesses should have access to the same digital payments experience as consumers who are now accustomed to popular applications such as PayPal Holdings Inc’s Venmo.

Bill.com currently process $50 billion in payments a year and also has partnerships with accounting software providers Intuit Inc and Xero.

JPMorgan’s investment underscores a growing interest by large financial institutions in backing and partnering with young financial technology companies.

Many have set up venture capital arms over the past few years to make strategic investments in startups in areas ranging from payments, to wealth management.

“They want to leverage the capabilities of fintech companies,” Lacerte said.

American Express Co and Silicon Valley Bank are also backers of Bill.com.","JPMorgan, Temasek lead $100 million investment in payments company Bill.com",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-payments-investment/jpmorgan-temasek-lead-100-million-investment-in-payments-company-bill-com-idUSKBN1CF1OF

The Syrians had battled the odds to even get into the playoff, having been forced to play all their “home” matches in Malaysia because of the civil war in their own nation.

Without five first-choice players through injury or suspension, they also had to play most of extra time with 10 men after midfielder Mahmoud Al Mawas was dismissed for two yellow cards.

“I think (it might have been different) if we had stayed with 11 players and hadn’t had that red card and not hit the post at the end,” Syria coach Ayman Hakeem told reporters.

“I am very proud of my boys with what they have achieved so far and that’s going to be continuing moving forward as well.”

Cahill scored Australia’s opener in the 13th minute but it was not until 96 minutes later that he notched up his 50th international goal to keep alive his country’s hopes of a fourth successive appearance at the World Cup finals.

It made for another nervous night for Australian fans as the Socceroos once again failed to find a way to get the scoreboard to reflect their dominance.

“We always find a difficult way to do things ... but we got through, I think we deserved to get through,” Australia coach Ange Postecoglou said.

“Timmy was Timmy, that’s why he’s the greatest ever.”

The Syrians made the perfect start in the sixth minute to cancel out Australia’s away goal advantage from the 1-1 first-leg draw.

Tamer Haj Mohamad dispossessed Mark Milligan in midfield and he fed Al Somah, who outpaced the Australian defence and planted the ball high into the net with his left foot.

DROPPED MIDFIELDER

The Asian champions were back on terms in 13th minute when Mathew Leckie broke down the right and delivered a pinpoint cross that 37-year-old Cahill headed home.

Australia dominated the remainder of the first half, with Syrian skipper Zaher Medani blocking a Cahill shot and goalkeeper Ibrahim Alma denying James Troisi and Leckie.

Alma again had to be at his best to stop a fierce Rogic strike from the edge of the box after 70 minutes and the Celtic midfielder curled a shot just wide of the far post from the ensuing corner.

Once Al Mawas was sent off for a second foul on Aaron Mooy four minutes into the first period of extra time, it appeared only a matter of time before the Australians would break down the already weary visitors.

Robbie Kruse finally carved out the decisive chance in the 109th minute when his perfectly weighted cross to the far post found Cahill, who headed the ball into the top left-hand corner of the net to the delight of the majority of the 42,000 crowd.",Cahill's extra-time winner dashes Syria dreams,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-worldcup-aus-syr/cahills-extra-time-winner-dashes-syria-dreams-idINKBN1CF1BF

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brookfield Asset Management’s (BAMa.TO) Public Securities Group (PSG) has agreed to buy Center Coast Capital Holdings (CCC), an energy infrastructure-focused investment firm, for an undisclosed amount, according to a statement on Tuesday.

Houston-based Center Coast Capital has over $4 billion of assets under management and will allow the Brookfield unit to bolster its product offering to include investments in energy assets such as tax-efficient master limited partnerships (MLPs).

MLPs are the structure used by most energy firms to house their midstream assets that ship and store oil and gas.

The investment comes amid renewed interest from large asset managers to buy into energy investment firms which focus on MLPs, after question marks were raised over the structure’s long-term viability.

Investors lost faith in them in the wake of the 2014 crude price slump as returns struggled to match previous performance and the construction of new pipelines, which these entities relied upon to generate higher profits, slowed.

Older MLPs also suffered from entering the “high splits,” where the percentage of returns going to ordinary investors was reduced over time in favor of the oil producer which originally owned the pipelines.

To help counter these issues, some MLPs restructured their payout ratios to help bolster returns to ordinary investors, while the revival in crude prices and drilling activity created the need for new pipelines which can be placed within MLPs.

“We knew it would be a good strategic fit, but it’s an interesting time too in terms of where valuations are,” Craig Noble, chief executive officer of Brookfield’s PSG, told Reuters in an interview.

He noted it was an attractive time to make such an investment, given the rebound in oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 and the benefits of having more infrastructure carrying natural gas, whose price NGc1 is more stable than that of crude.

In August, Blackstone Group (BX.N) said it had agreed to acquire Harvest Fund Advisors, an MLP-focused investment firm, for an undisclosed amount.

Brookfield PSG’s acquisition of CCC is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

O FMI projetou que o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) do país este ano deve avançar 0,7 por cento, bem menos do que o 1,2 por cento esperado para a América Latina toda, segundo o documento “Perspectiva Econômica Global”. Para 2018, a estimativa é de que o Brasil tenha expansão de 1,5 por cento e a região, de 1,9 por cento.

Na comparação com as contas feitas em julho, o FMI aumentou a expectativa para o PIB brasileiro em 0,4 e 0,2 ponto percentual para 2017 e 2018, respectivamente. Neste ano, a melhora veio pelo bom desempenho da safra agrícola recorde e pela melhora do consumo.

Quando comparado com os dados divulgados em abril, a projeção de agora do FMI para a expansão do PIB em 2017 foi 0,5 ponto percentual maior e, para 2018, 0,2 ponto menor.

“A gradual restauração da confiança, assim que as principais reformas que garantem a sustentabilidade fiscal forem implementadas ao longo do tempo, vão elevar o crescimento econômico a 2 por cento a médio prazo”, informou o FMI em relatório.

A previsão do FMI para o desempenho do PIB neste ano está bastante próxima da leitura feita por bancos e consultorias, mas a expectativa para o ano que vem é mais pessimista. No relatório Focus do Banco Central, que ouve uma centena de analistas todas as semanas, a projeção é de crescimento de 0,7 por cento para este ano e de 2,43 por cento em 2018.

Na comparação com o desempenho dos países emergentes, o resultado do Brasil será ainda mais pífio. O FMI projeta crescimento de 4,6 por cento em 2017 para esse grupo e de 4,9 por cento em 2018.

Já a economia global como um todo, ainda segundo as contas do FMI, deve crescer 3,6 e 3,7 por cento em 2017 e 2018, respectivamente. Em ambos os casos, as contas vieram agora 0,1 ponto percentual maiores do que o levantamento de julho passado.","Brasil crescerá menos do que os países da América Latina em 2017 e 2018, diz FMI",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CF1NW-OBRBS

(Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics.

In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running.

Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully.

It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump.

“It’s certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said ‘I‘m not a politician,” said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. “We’ve shown that you don’t really need that background.”

The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said.

Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons.

His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts.

Trump’s ascendance shows that candidates’ backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven.

“Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters,” he said, “but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people.”

It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates’ backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be.

“Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don’t think people say, ‘Wall Street financier – that’s someone I can vote for,” he said.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate.

His campaign has focused on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire’s tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents.

Murphy has won support from labor unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him.

FILE PHOTO: Phil Murphy, a candidate for governor of New Jersey, speaks during the First Stand Rally in Newark, N.J., U.S. January 15, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo

An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy’s ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll.

“Obviously Goldman was his career,” said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. “Everyone has a career.”

In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same.

The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut’s problems.

In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats.

Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a “progressive entrepreneur” on his website.

Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters’ concerns, political historians said.

For instance, while Mitt Romney’s private-equity career helped doom his 2012 presidential bid, Illinois voters elected private equity executive Bruce Rauner as governor in 2014.",New Wall Street candidates emerge to test Trump-era appeal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-bankers/new-wall-street-candidates-emerge-to-test-trump-era-appeal-idUSKBN1CE1BX

The industry says diamonds are the world’s most concentrated form of wealth, but investors have long viewed them as less useful as a store of value than gold because each stone is different, making its value subjective and trading difficult.

Alain Vandenborre, chairman and founder of SDIX, says technology has solved that problem and diamonds can now become “the new gold”.

Diamond Bullion, produced by the Singapore Diamond Mint, is a collection of investment grade diamonds whose value can be quickly checked. Denominations will initially range between $100,000 and $200,000, with higher and lower values possible in future.

The diamonds are stored in a credit card-sized device containing a chip that allows immediate valuation based on exchange trading and instant authentication, which is crucial as synthetic diamonds have no resale value.

A mark on the Diamond Bullion developed by the International Institute of Diamond Grading and Research (IIDGR), which is part of Anglo American’s De Beers Group, provides a further guarantee.

De Beers, the world’s biggest diamond producer by value and a leader in equipment that grades and authenticates diamonds, traditionally sold its gems to a limited group of trusted individuals called sightholders.

Diamond trading has gradually become more open.

In 2008, De Beers began selling rough diamonds through online auctions and in June this year began auctioning polished stones too.

SDIX, launched in 2016, says it is the world’s first and only electronic exchange for trading investment-grade diamonds.

Diamond miners in principle welcomed Diamond Bullion.

“Anything that can bring transparency to the diamond price is a good thing,” said Karl Smithson, CEO of Stellar Diamonds, which has a diamond-mining project in Sierra Leone.",Diamonds - the new gold for rich investors?,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-diamonds-investment/diamonds-the-new-gold-for-rich-investors-idUKKBN1CE2N9?il=0

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s moves to slash reliance on the internal combustion engine signal tough times for the country’s oil majors. A push into new energy vehicles (NEVs) – including battery-powered and hybrid cars – could curb demand for black gold. Sinopec and PetroChina will be hardest hit. The policy will also add to downward pressure on global crude prices.

The People’s Republic is ultimately hoping to outlaw traditional gasoline-fueled cars entirely, cleaning up the air and relieving it of dependence on oil imports. There is no official deadline for the move, but Wang Chuanfu, founder of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, reckons the ban could come as early as 2030.

As a battery maker poised to profit from the shift, Wang’s guesstimate is certainly self-interested, and probably wishful thinking. Electric cars accounted for less than 2 percent of China’s market share in 2016, and a bottleneck in battery production will hamper the transition.

But there is no doubting China’s determination to push the pace. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology says NEVS should account for a fifth of auto sales by 2025. As soon as 2019, regulators want automakers to make NEVs at least 10 percent of total sales. That means China’s $440 billion retail fuel market is in for a bumpy ride.

GIANT PROBLEM

Sinopec will be hit hardest. Gasoline sales made up around a quarter of total revenue at the group’s listed unit China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation in 2016, and the energy giant runs almost a third of the country’s 100,000 or so service stations. These hubs boast more than 23,000 convenience stores, a valuable sideline. Non-fuel sales could grow by as much as 25.5 percent a year in the period 2016 to 2019, according to research by brokerage CLSA. There are plans to launch a Hong Kong IPO for the group’s marketing unit, but the outlook has clouded of late. There is no public prospectus, and the offering – expected to raise around $12 billion – now looks unlikely to materialize this year.

PetroChina will feel the pinch too. It controls some 20,000 petrol stations, and sold more than 62 million tonnes of gasoline last year, worth about 357 billion yuan at 2016 prices. PetroChina is slightly less dependent on refining than Sinopec – gasoline sales made up roughly a fifth of revenues. However, investors appreciate the higher margins the company earns from refining and other downstream operations when oil prices are subdued, as they are now.

If one fifth of auto sales are absorbed by the NEV market in 2025 as planned - assuming China hits its target of 35 million units sold that year - that would rob gas stations of 7 million automobiles, enough cars to support the equivalent of 3,500 gas stations, according to a conservative Breakingviews calculation.

When combined with new environmental and industrial policies, a successful EV push could make a real dent in long-term global oil demand. Absent government intervention, S&P projects China’s oil consumption would probably balloon to 41 million barrels of oil a day by 2050, compared to 10.9 million barrels a day in 2015. On the other hand, if Beijing manages to meet all its ambitious published targets for electric vehicles, emissions reductions and industrial efficiency upgrades, oil demand would attain barely half those levels, the study shows. Sinopec, PetroChina, and even upstream operator CNOOC could be vulnerable.

TRICKY MANEUVER

There is time to plan. It might be decades before the fleet of combustion engines actually shrinks. Even so the big Chinese players are already looking to diversify. Downstream operators might recalibrate refineries to focus on petrochemical products like plastics, while pushing further into natural gas. Sinopec says it is exploring geothermal energy and biomass, too. Offshore markets could help as well; exports of gasoline and diesel from Chinese refineries have been rising for the past few years.

Another strategy might be restructuring the retail business to accommodate electric vehicles. Perhaps the gigantic network of service stations could be converted into charging stations; drivers waiting for cars to charge, or swapping batteries, might shop at the convenience stores too. Sinopec is working with State Grid to offer charging services, state-backed China Daily reported earlier this year. Unfortunately in these areas the oil incumbents have little or no advantage over other competitors. Gas stations aren’t particularly convenient places to recharge compared to, say, parking lots.

Whichever route they take, energy conglomerates will still enjoy massive financial scale and unparalleled influence in the halls of government. It seems unlikely Beijing will stand aside and let them collapse. Even so, investors will watch closely to see if the oil majors can shift gears before it’s too late.",Breakingviews - China’s oil giants brace for electric car crash,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-oil-giants-brace-for-electric-car-crash-idUSKBN1CE06W

LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) plans to reduce the size of its European dealer network and introduce online sales as it adjusts to changing buying habits, the German carmaker said on Tuesday.

VW is pushing to cut costs across all of its 12 brands in the wake of the emissions scandal as it faces having to invest heavily in the shift toward electric cars.

In the latest move it aims to increase profitability and efficiency at its 3,000-dealer European distribution network by an average of 10 percent and wants to trim the costs of the network to help double the average return per distributor to 2 percent from 1 percent.

“We have for years been in consolidation mode in all world markets,” VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann told reporters. “This will surely accelerate somewhat in the next one, two years, also in Germany.”

But the executive gave no detail on the size of planned cost reductions and the number of dealerships due to be axed under VW’s “future sales model.”

Customers of mass-market car brands like VW’s are already making greater use of online shopping, allowing them to better compare rival offerings.

VW and dealers are now developing a joint online portal, Stackmann said, without giving details.

Reduced costs will also come from greater use of new IT, enabling dealerships to cut the time needed for servicing cars by as much as 70 percent, according to VW.

A VW distributor in Europe on average employs 35 staff and that workforce can be cut by about four over time or the staff affected can be assigned elsewhere, Stackmann said.

Under the terms of the carmaker’s new contracts with dealers, to be concluded early next year, VW wants to forego its right to dictate workforce sizes, he said, allowing dealers to trim staff.","VW to reduce size of dealer network, launch online sales",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-dealers/vw-to-reduce-size-of-dealer-network-launch-online-sales-idUSKBN1CF13S?il=0

PARIS (Reuters) - Le travail comme “seule boussole”, le pouvoir d‘achat comme finalité, la poursuite des réformes comme horizon : tel est le message délivré par Emmanuel Macron à sa majorité pour expliquer ses choix, que l‘opposition accuse de favoriser les plus aisés.

Le président a réuni lundi soir à l‘Elysée des députés de La République en marche (LREM) chargés de préparer le projet de loi de financement de la Sécurité sociale 2018 (PLFSS), texte-clé de ce début de quinquennat, avant la journée d‘action des fonctionnaires mardi, qui coïncide avec le début du “marathon budgétaire” en commissions parlementaires.

L‘occasion de redonner un cap à une majorité confrontée aux accusations venues de droite comme de gauche sur le thème de l‘hyper-libéralisme et du mépris social, au coeur d‘une rentrée sociale agitée sur fond de divisions syndicales.

Dans son discours, le chef de l‘Etat a répondu en substance aux accusations faisant de lui un “président des riches”, notamment utilisées comme slogan dans les récentes manifestations contre la réforme du Code du travail.

“La stigmatisation des uns contre les autres est le meilleur moyen d‘échouer”, a dit Emmanuel Macron, selon un élu de la majorité.

Il s‘est défendu d‘opposer des catégories de Français, attaquant au passage le bilan de l‘ancien président François Hollande dont il fut le conseiller.

”Il y a cinq ans, on a décidé de faire très mal aux riches, les pauvres ne s‘en sont pas mieux portés“”, a-t-il dit, selon la même source, faisant notamment référence à la taxe de 75% visant les Français les plus riches envisagée puis abandonnée sous cette forme par l‘ex-gouvernement socialiste.

“RÉ-ARRIMER LA SOCIÉTÉ DU TRAVAIL”

Dans un pays plombé par le chômage de masse, Emmanuel Macron a placé l‘emploi au rang de priorité absolue, fixant comme but de “ré-arrimer la société au travail”, selon une expression rapportée par la députée LREM Olivia Grégoire.

“La seule boussole de mon action c‘est le travail”, a écrit sur Twitter, citant le président, l‘élu des Hauts-de-Seine Gabriel Attal.

Autres consignes présidentielles, selon ce dernier : “Garantir à ceux qui ne pourront pas en avoir en raison de leur état de santé, ou qui n‘en ont plus, un quotidien digne ; permettre à ceux qui n‘en ont pas d‘en avoir un durable ; permettre à ceux qui en ont un d‘être mieux rémunérés ; permettre à ceux qui en créent d‘être récompensés”.

Des instructions délivrées en présence de la ministre de la Santé, Agnès Buzyn, de son collègue de l‘Action et des Comptes publics, Gérald Darmanin, et du porte-parole du gouvernement, Christophe Castaner.

“Le président de la République est très attaché, et c‘est pour cela que j‘ai choisi de le suivre, à ce que le travail paie et que le budget soit celui de la feuille de paie et moi je suis très heureux de porter cette politique sociale”, a déclaré mardi sur CNEWS Gérald Darmanin, issu de la droite comme le Premier ministre, Edouard Philippe.

En complément de la feuille de route présidentielle, Agnès Buzyn s‘est s‘adressée aux députés LREM lors de leur réunion de groupe mardi matin à l‘Assemblée nationale, à la veille de la présentation du PLFSS en conseil des ministres.

Lundi à l‘Elysée, Emmanuel Macron a redit son souhait de lancer sans attendre les chantiers de l‘assurance chômage, des retraites, de la formation professionnelle, de l‘apprentissage, ainsi que celui de la révision des lois bioéthiques.

LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.

Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of hostile statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.

Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organization. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.

“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, said.

“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behavior. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”

Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.

“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.

Iran’s moderate president Hasan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticizing the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.

“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures,” he added.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”

The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.

But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s missile program and over allegations it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.

The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.

The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.

“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.

Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile program. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.

Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile program. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”. In an article published in the Atlantic on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles … unless it intends to attack our territory.”","Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-irgc/iran-has-all-options-on-table-if-u-s-blacklists-revolutionary-guards-idUSKBN1CF0R0

Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

Shoppers at the Grand Bazaar in the center of Tehran, Iran, August 2, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The arrest of Soro’s protocol chief Souleymane Kamarate Kone and other associates could deepen a rift between the powerful former rebel leader and President Alassane Ouattara.

Renegade soldiers in the second city Bouake used weapons taken from Kone’s home to halt the advance of loyalist troops sent to put down their four-day uprising in May.

Soon after the mutiny, prosecutors opened an investigation into the arms cache, which State Prosecutor Christophe Adou said contained six tonnes of weapons and ammunition.

“The possession and concealment of these weapons in an illegal manner and then their distribution aimed to destabilize the state,” Adou told reporters in the commercial capital Abidjan.

“An inquest with an arrest warrant was opened against him and all persons involved,” he added.

Around 15 people were questioned during the investigation, including Soro’s head of security and his deputy. It was unclear, however, who in addition to Kone was being targeted for arrest.

Kone was taken into custody after questioning on Monday and could not be reached for comment. Allies of Soro say the investigation is politically motivated.

“Kone ... has already served in prison in 2000 for the cause of President Alassane Ouattara. He is a strong man who will remain dignified,” a spokesman for Soro, who is out of the country, wrote in a statement.

The statement also called for supporters to remain calm and for the judicial process to remain independent.

Soro headed a northern rebellion between 2002 and 2011 that helped Ouattara to power after his predecessor Laurent Gbagbo refused to accept defeat in a 2010 election.

However, a split has opened between the president and his former ally this year. Soro is considered one of the main contenders to take over from Ouattara, who cannot run for re-election in 2020, but he faces stiff opposition with the ruling RDR party.

Diplomats and analysts worry that a series of army mutinies beginning in January may be a symptom of jockeying for position by political figures ahead of the 2020 vote.

The arrest of Kone and other Soro associates is likely to increase tensions, including within the army where the parliament speaker still commands the loyalty of many of the thousands of his former fighters now serving as soldiers.",Aide to Ivory Coast parliament speaker arrested over arms cache,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CF0L5-OZATP

BILBAO, Spain (Reuters) - As Spain and Catalonia head towards a constitutional collision over the region’s claim to independence, lawmakers on both sides of the crisis are pointing to a way out: north, to Basque Country.

Among the verdant mountains of Basque Country, which borders France, a once-violent campaign for independence has petered out, with generous fiscal autonomy from Madrid helping to keep popular agitation for independence in check.

“We don’t have that economic resentment,” Aitor Esteban, organizer for the Basque National Party in Spain’s parliament, told Reuters in an interview at party headquarters in Bilbao.

“People don’t feel that need to act upon a grievance about money; that makes a big difference.”

The Catalan government is not calling for a Basque-style deal, insisting instead on independence after declaring overwhelming support for secession in an Oct. 1 referendum banned by Madrid.

But the most moderate lawmakers in the region’s ruling coalition privately say they could drop independence claims if they were given the tax autonomy that Basque Country enjoys.

In Madrid, some socialists have suggested it could serve as a model for a compromise that would defuse Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed coup in 1981, although the cost to the central government would be significant.

Basque staged modest protests over Madrid’s violent crackdown on Catalonia’s referendum, but the crisis has failed to rekindle secessionist fervour on the streets of Bilbao, the Basque capital nestled on the banks of the Nervion.

Catalan flags hang from balconies alongside the Basque flag in a sign of solidarity, but Bilbao is prosperous and peaceful. Where once unionist politicians needed bodyguards and car bombings were a constant fear, tourists now crowd the taverns of the old town and the world-famous Guggenheim museum.

Just 17 percent of Basques want independence and less than half would like to hold a referendum on the issue, according to a poll carried out by the university of Deusto.

Basque militant group ETA, which killed more than 850 people in a decades-long campaign to carve out a separate state, effectively ended its armed resistance this year when it surrendered its weapons.

The region now has one of the highest economic outputs per capita and one of the lowest unemployment rates in Spain.

“The independence debate is on standby in Basque Country because of great fatigue after years of violence and uncertainty after the economic crisis,” said Xabier Barandiaran, professor of sociology at Deusto University.

CAN SPAIN AFFORD IT?

Basque’s fiscal autonomy is among the most generous of any region in Europe, dating back to the 19th century and enshrined in Spain’s 1978 constitution.

If it were to be extended to Catalonia, an economically more powerful region accounting for a fifth of national production, the Spanish state would lose about 16 billion euros, according to a 2014 study by research house CSIC.

That would equal about 13 percent of next year’s budget and affect Spain’s deficit and borrowing costs.

For that reason, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has ruled out such generous treatment for Catalonia.

Under Basque’s accord with Madrid, the region collects nearly all its own taxes, which are forecast to total 13 billion euros ($15 billion) this year.

It is due to return 800 million euros to Madrid in what is known as an annual quota to cover the costs of national expenses such as defence or infrastructure.

Rajoy has sweetened that arrangement since he regained power at the head of a minority government last year, as the price of securing Basque National Party support for his 2017 budget.

It has proved unpopular with other regions who would almost certainly oppose any similar deal for Catalonia, as it would mean cutting their share of state revenue.

Typically, regions pass taxes to Madrid which redistributes money back to them according to a formula that favours the poorer regions.

Former Catalan leader Artur Mas tried to hold talks with Rajoy in 2012 about granting Catalonia powers to raise and spend its own taxes, but the prospect of negotiations in the current climate look bleak.

Catalonia has long said it pays a disproportionate level of taxes to Madrid in relation to the central funding it receives.

A study backed by the Budget Ministry says Catalonia pays to the state 9.9 billion euros more than it receives. The Catalan economy ministry says this is even higher.

Economists say an overhaul of the fiscal relationship between Madrid and the regions is overdue because the current system has led to intense tax competition between regions. Some autonomous communities have become under-financed, resulting in cuts in public services.

Real Madrid forward and Welsh talisman Gareth Bale, missing the crunch clash through injury, could only watch on helplessly in his seat in the stands as Wales suffered their first defeat in 12 World Cup qualifiers.

Ireland finished the group as runners-up with 19 points, two ahead of Wales who paid the price for too many draws earlier in the campaign. Serbia beat Georgia 1-0 to win the group and qualify for the Russia finals automatically.

“So proud. The players were magnificent playing away from home at a very good Welsh side. To win on their territory was a great result for us,” O‘Neill said.

“That last half-hour seemed an eternity. We withstood pressure but we knew at some stage we would have to try to win the game and we did. The goal was worthy of winning any game.”

Wales dominated before halftime without ever really opening up a well-organised Ireland side and Ireland keeper Darren Randolph was rarely tested.

The hosts began the second half with a flourish and James Chester glanced a header into the side-netting.

Randolph then made a superb save to tip Hal Robson-Kanu’s powerful header over the crossbar in the 54th minute.

Three minutes later Robson-Kanu’s West Bromwich Albion team mate McClean decided the contest as Wales self-destructed.

Wales keeper Wayne Hennessey’s poor throw-out put Ashley Williams under pressure and the Everton defender was robbed of the ball by Jeff Kendrick on the right touchline.

Kendrick sprinted forward and crossed low, the ball being expertly dummied by Harry Arter before eventually reaching the unmarked McClean, who finished first time with an unstoppable right-foot drive.

With news of Croatia leading against Ukraine filtering through, it meant even a draw would not be sufficient for Wales to claim one of the eight playoff spots.

Ireland defended superbly for the remainder of the game although Wales were flat. A Welsh goal would have ended Ireland’s playoff hopes and their hearts were in their mouths in stoppage time when Aaron Ramsey fired straight at Randolph.

Ireland have not qualified for the World Cup since 2002 and have bitter playoff memories, having been knocked out by a controversial France goal in 2010.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will block access to websites of exchanges that offer crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Russian Central Bank First Deputy Governor Sergei Shvetsov said on Tuesday.

He called them “dubious”.

Russian financial authorities initially treated any sort of money issued by non-state approved institutions as illegal, saying they could be used to launder money.

Later the authorities accepted the globally booming market of crypto-currencies but want to either control the turnover or to limit access to the market

“We cannot stand apart. We cannot give direct and easy access to such dubious instruments for retail (investors),” Shvetsov said, referring to households.

Speaking at a conference on financial market derivatives, Shvetsov said the central bank sees rising interest in crypto-currencies because of high returns from buying into such instruments.

He warned, however, that crypto-currencies gradually transform into high-yielding assets from being a mean of payment.

Bitcoin, the most well-known virtual currency that emerged in mid-2010, last traded at around $4,807, up from its initial price of less than $1.

“We think that for our citizens, for businesses the usage of such crypto-currencies as an investment object carries unreasonably high risks,” he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the National Football League should not be given tax breaks, wading back into his criticism of the league over silent player protests during the national anthem.

“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.

It was not clear what exactly Trump was demanding, and representatives for the White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The NFL gave up its federal tax-exempt status in 2015, according to media reports, although U.S. states and localities still offer the multi-billion dollar league tax breaks in order to attract teams and to finance stadiums.

Trump has been on a tear for weeks against NFL players who kneel during the national anthem played before games, saying the gesture disrespects the country. His strongly worded call last month for players who did this to be fired touched off an initially sharp response, including from some team owners and coaches.

The players’ silent demonstration, which began last year in protest against police violence toward racial minorities, was embraced more widely in reaction to Trump’s more recent comments, with more players taking the knee while others chose to lock arms.

A number of Republican lawmakers suggested in September that tax sweeteners should end given the protests, the Washington Post reported.

On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence walked out of an NFL game after some players knelt. Separately, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he would bench players who disrespect the U.S. flag.

On Monday, cable sports network ESPN was drawn into the fray when it suspended one of its broadcasters after she posted a tweet about the protests and Jones’ comment. ESPN, which is owned by Walt Disney Co, said it was Jemele Hill’s second violation of its social media guidelines.

Hill, who had said that those who rejected Jones’ comment should look at the team’s advertisers, later tweeted that she was not urging an NFL boycott.

In a separate Twitter post on Tuesday, Trump excoriated Hill, saying that with her “at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!”

The NFL Players Association has defended players’ right to protest.

Trump’s former Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton, also backed the players, saying in a speech on Monday, “They are protesting racism and injustice, and they have every right to do so.”

Critics of Trump, a Republican, have said he is fanning a controversy over the national anthem at NFL games to distract from pressing issues his administration is dealing with, from a powerful hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico to tensions with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars the government from limiting free speech, including prohibiting protests around the national anthem or punishing people who choose not to stand.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could join a formal trade alliance with the United States, Canada and Mexico if the European Union refuses to clinch a post-Brexit trade deal, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Tuesday without citing sources.

The newspaper said British ministers were looking at the idea of joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as part of planning for possibility of Britain leaving the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal.

Britain’s international trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

Britain is currently negotiating the terms of its divorce from the EU though Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing to move onto discussions about a major free trade deal with the world’s biggest trading bloc.

With the clock ticking down toward Brexit day in 2019, British ministers are exploring what they will do if the world’s fifth largest economy drops out of the EU without a clear trade deal.

Besides aiming to clinch a U.S. trade deal or forming some new trade grouping, some British supporters of Brexit have pondered joining an existing trade deal such as NAFTA.

But U.S. President Donald Trump has warned he may terminate the 1994 NAFTA deal because he says it does not serve U.S. economic interests.

If Britain did join NAFTA, manufacturers wanting to export to the EU and North America would have to produce goods in accordance with the two separate sets of rules, according to trade analysts.

Britain, whose regulation has been within the EU’s orbit for over 40 years, would also have to shift toward the North American model for services, goods, competition policy and data protection.

The EU is Britain’s biggest single export market, accounting for about 50 percent of goods exports in August. The United States was the single biggest destination for British exports, accounting for 14 percent in August.",Britain could join NAFTA if it fails to get Brexit trade deal: Telegraph newspaper,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-nafta/britain-could-join-nafta-if-it-fails-to-get-brexit-trade-deal-telegraph-newspaper-idUKKBN1CF189?il=0

The Bank of England, which has signaled it is close to its first rate hike in a decade, is expecting a pick-up in spending.

The BRC said growth in total sales last month slowed slightly to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent in August but remained stronger than in most months so far this year.

However, consumers were not displaying much confidence in their shopping choices.

“Spending is still being focused towards essential purchases with consumers buying their winter coats and back-to-school items, but shying away from big-ticket items such as furniture and delaying the renewal of key household electrical goods,” BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said.

On a like-for-like basis, food sales were up 2.5 percent in the three months to September while non-food sales were up only 0.5 percent, the BRC data showed.

The Confederation of British Industry said last month its measure of retail sales showed unexpected growth in sales to a two-year high in early September, again helped by strong food and clothing sales.

Accountancy firm BDO said on Friday that British shops enjoyed their biggest jump in sales in more than three years in September.",UK consumers spend more to meet higher food and clothing prices,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy-retail/uk-consumers-spend-more-to-meet-higher-food-and-clothing-prices-idUKKBN1CE2MZ

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose to above $56 a barrel on Tuesday, supported by Saudi Arabian export cuts in November and comments from OPEC and trading companies that the market is rebalancing after years of oversupply.

Saudi Arabia has cut November allocations by 560,000 barrels per day (bpd), in line with its commitment to an OPEC-led supply reduction pact. In the United States, some production remains offline following Hurricane Nate, lending additional support.

“Prices have been boosted by news that Saudi Arabia is planning to reduce its oil shipments to customers in November,” said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

Brent crude LCOc1, the international price benchmark, was up 80 cents at $56.59 a barrel at 1326 GMT. U.S. crude gained 97 cents to $50.55.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-member producers are cutting output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until next March to get rid of a price-sapping supply glut.

OPEC is increasingly confident that the market is rebalancing fast, helped by the cutback as well as by stronger-than-expected growth in global demand.

The chief executive of trading firm Gunvor, Torbjorn Tornqvist, also said the market was rebalancing, citing falling product stocks and crude held in floating storage clearing up.

“We don’t see this market being out of balance one way or another,” he told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit taking place this week. Overall crude stocks “are still high,” he added, and OPEC needed to stick to its output curbs.

Short-term price support was coming from the United States, where 85 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production, or 1.49 million bpd, was offline following Hurricane Nate, according to official figures.

OPEC has managed record-high adherence to its supply cutting deal this year and is considering extending the deal beyond its March 2018 expiry. Some analysts have been concerned that a price recovery could tempt producers to open the taps again.

But analysts at JP Morgan said this was less of an issue, saying “concerns that OPEC compliance would fade into the fourth quarter now appear unfounded.”

“Stronger-than-assumed economic growth offers the potential for tight market conditions to continue if OPEC extends the current deal for another nine months,” the bank said.",Oil rises above $56 on Saudi export cut,https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil/oil-rises-above-56-on-saudi-export-cut-idINKBN1CF046?il=0

CHAMAN/QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Thousands of Pashtun tribal people who for decades ignored the invisible line that bisects their dusty villages and demarcates the Afghanistan-Pakistan frontier are bracing for a Berlin Wall-style divide of their neighborhoods.

Pakistan, worried by Islamist attacks, is building a fence to prevent militants criss-crossing the porous 2,500 km (1,500 mile) frontier along the disputed colonial-era Durand line drawn up by the British in 1893.

The fence, which Kabul opposes, will run down the middle of so-called “divided villages” where few people have passports and Pashtun tribal loyalty often trumps allegiance to the state.

Seven such villages are dotted around Chaman district, home to the bustling border-crossing town of Chaman in Pakistan’s southwestern province of Baluchistan. Other divided villages are believed to exist further north in the restive Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).

Pakistani officials in Baluchistan are now working on shifting Pakistani citizens in the divided villages to their side of the fence and say security worries override concerns that it will break up communities.

“(A border wall) was there in Germany, it is in Mexico. It is all over the world – why not in Afghanistan and Pakistan?” said Col. Muhammad Usman, commander of Pakistan’s Frontier Corps paramilitary force in Chaman.

“These tribals have to understand that this is Pakistan and that place is Afghanistan.”

Yet scepticism about the fence abounds. Pakistan’s previous attempts to build one failed about a decade ago and many doubt whether its possible to secure such a lengthy border.

THE TRUMP EFFECT

The appeal of erecting physical border barriers waned after the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989. But in recent years, several populist leaders have advocated building walls to curtail movement of foreigners, most notably U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants a wall along the entire border with Mexico.

Hungary’s right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban recently fenced the border with Serbia to prevent Syrian refugees and other Muslim migrants from entering the eastern European country that acts as a gateway to the European Union.

Pakistan, in anticipation of the fence, plans to build more than 100 new border posts and Islamabad is recruiting in excess of 30,000 soldiers to man them, according to a senior military source.

“Trump is doing as per requirements of America; we are doing as per requirements of Pakistan,” added Usman.

Tense relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan boiled over in two divided villages in May during Pakistan’s census survey. More than 10 people were killed when Afghan border troops, objecting to the census, clashed with the Frontier Corps in Killi Jahangir and Killi Luqman villages near Chaman.

Kabul and Islamabad accuse each other of sheltering militants and providing safe havens for Islamist groups who carry out cross-border attacks.

Many residents in Killi Jahangir and Killi Luqman welcome the fence in the hope it will prevent bloodshed. But others are concerned it will hurt business and separate them from friends and family.

“There will no infiltration of terrorists or suspects from Afghan areas... but my own small business, which I was doing with Afghan people, will be affected,” said Abdul Jabbar, a Pakistani owner of a small enterprise in Killi Jahangir.

Pakistani officials have long struggled to impose security in the Pashtun tribal heartland. The area stretches for hundreds of kilometers, including rugged mountainous terrain, and has been a hotbed of arms and heroin smuggling for decades. U.S drone strikes have also targeted militants from al Qaeda and other groups in the region.

For the likes of taxi driver Abdul Razzaq, 30, having peace of mind offsets the loss of business due to the fence.

For their leader Kim Jong Un, the resort is a summer retreat, a future temple to tourism, and a good place to test missiles.

He is rebuilding the city of 360,000 people and wants to turn it into a billion-dollar tourist hotspot. At the same time, he has launched nearly 40 missiles from the area, as part of his accelerated tests of North Korea’s nuclear deterrent.

“It may sound crazy to outsiders to fire missiles from a place he wants to develop economically, but that’s how Kim Jong Un runs his country,” said Lim Eul-chul, an expert on the North Korean economy at Kyungnam University in South Korea.

This combination of tourism and nuclear weapons is emblematic of Kim Jong Un’s strategy for survival, say researchers and people familiar with the project.

North Korea’s development plans for Wonsan have mushroomed since they were first announced in 2014. Examined here in detail for the first time, they run across 160 pages in nearly 30 brochures produced by the Wonsan Zone Development Corporation in Korean, Chinese, Russian and English in 2015 and 2016.

Tourism is one of a shrinking range of North Korean cash sources not targeted by United Nations sanctions, and the brochures advertise to foreign investors some $1.5 billion worth of potential ventures in the Wonsan Special Tourist Zone, an area covering more than 400 square km (150 square miles). Kim has already constructed a ski resort and a new airport there.

According to one brochure, the Zone includes approximately 140 historical relics, 10 sand beaches, 680 tourist attractions, four mineral springs, several bathing resorts and natural lakes and “more than 3.3 million tons of mud with therapeutic properties for neuralgia and colitis.”

The projects that Kim is inviting investors to help build include a $7.3 million department store, a $197 million city center development, and a $123 million golf course (including a $62.5 million fee to lease the land).

Earlier this year Kim sent 16 of his officials to Spain to get ideas for Wonsan. They visited Marina d‘Or, one of the Mediterranean country’s biggest holiday complexes, and the Terra Mitica (Mythical Land) theme park in Benidorm. Terra Mitica caters to fans “of extreme sensations,” according to its website.

“They saw such places with their own eyes and filmed some of them,” said a spokesman at the North Korean embassy in Madrid. Both parks confirmed the visits; a spokeswoman for Terra Mitica said the North Koreans were impressed by its themes including the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome.

No major foreign partner has said they will back Kim’s Wonsan projects. The new airport, completed in 2015, has yet to open to international flights. America recently banned its citizens from visiting North Korea. International sanctions now ban all joint ventures with the state.

Even so, the plan is strategically vital for Kim, say former North Korean diplomats. When he came to power in 2011, he inherited a society officially run by the military but whose people survived largely on black market dealings. On paper, North Korea is a state-run economy; but in fact, seven in 10 North Koreans depend on private trade to live, according to Thae Yong Ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London, who staged a high-profile defection with his family in 2016.

Kim is perceived by outsiders as all powerful, but North Korea’s free marketeers make him more vulnerable than he seems, Thae told Reuters. The leader is looking for a way to harness both military and market forces to survive.

Nuclear weapons are one part of his answer – because Kim hopes they will cost less to maintain than North Korea’s conventional heavy weapons. Projects like Wonsan are the other part. He wants to cut the share of funding he gives to the military and allocate more money to the civilian economy.

“Kim Jong Un knows that he can only control society and guarantee his long leadership if his role and influence in the economy is increased,” said Thae.

“FRIENDLY”

North Korea wants to attract more than 1 million tourists every year in the near term and around 5 million to 10 million tourists “in the foreseeable future,” the Wonsan brochures say. The Wonsan Zone Development Corporation, the North Korean state body which oversees the project, did not respond to requests for comment.

There are no up-to-date statistics on current visitors to North Korea. China said more than 237,000 Chinese visited in 2012 but it stopped publishing the statistics in 2013. For comparison, 8 million Chinese visited South Korea in 2016.

The Korea Maritime Institute, a think-tank in the South, estimates that tourism generates about $44 million in annual revenue for North Korea – about 0.8 percent of the country’s GDP. About 80 percent of all North Korea’s foreign tourists are Chinese, it says. Westerners and Russians make up the rest.

Related Coverage North Korea's unhappy mix of tourists and military

The Wonsan brochures are welcoming. “Officials and residents of this zone have a good understanding of tourism and are friendly toward tourists,” one says.

The brochures also disclose some unusual details about vacation habits in the totalitarian state.

Not far from the proposed $123 million golf course, the plans show an existing compound. It is labeled in the brochure as the summer retreat of the State Security Department or “Bowibu” – the entity which runs North Korea’s six prison camps and conducts nationwide surveillance of ordinary citizens.

Just next door to that beachfront property, the Daesong General Bureau – the body also known as “Office 39” that procures luxury goods for the Kim family – has its retreat.

A third compound is reserved for the Korean National Insurance Corporation, a state insurance company that the European Union says is involved in insurance fraud.

All three entities are subject to international sanctions because of their role in funneling cash into Kim’s nuclear and missile programs.

For Kim’s security forces, though, Wonsan is about more than fun in the sun.

Kim brought his top military brass to Wonsan in 2014. On the white sandy beach of his palace compound, he ordered his highest admirals to strip into bathing costumes and, as a test of their ability, swim 10 km around the bay, state TV showed. It filmed him at a desk on the sand, shaded by a white parasol.

In April this year, Kim used the beach near Wonsan’s new airport to unleash an artillery drill described by state media as the country’s largest ever. In it, “300 large-caliber self-propelled guns” opened fire at a white target painted on a small island 3 km away.

The bombardment, broadcast on state TV, turned that island into a dusty moonscape.

PLASTIC FLOWERS

Wonsan holds symbolic power for the Kim dynasty: It was there that Kim Jong Un’s grandfather Kim Il Sung, who helped found North Korea at the end of Japanese colonial rule in 1945, first landed with Soviet troops to take over the country.

Statues of North Korea’s two former leaders stand on the quayside, where tourists are expected to bow and buy plastic flowers to offer them. Next door to the Kim family palace, the Songdowon Children’s Camp has welcomed “Young Pioneers” from Soviet-backed countries for decades, according to state media.

When the young Kim was picked as heir to Kim Jong Il in 2009, he had few achievements to his name, noted Kim Young-Hui, who heads a team of North Korea researchers at Korea Development Bank in Seoul. If he can develop Wonsan – the place where his grandfather helped bring North Korea into existence – it will seal his image as a master builder.

“He has strong political reasons to develop Wonsan,” she said. She is a native of the city and defected to South Korea in 2002.

People from Wonsan, even those who have defected, say they have largely happy memories of the place. Wonsan’s karaoke bars and billiard clubs have a more reliable supply of electricity than much of North Korea, they say. They recall young couples roller skating in a big square near the Wonsan waterfront.

The city has a special place in Kim’s heart, says Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant who shared Long Island Iced Teas with Kim on board one of his private boats in 2013, after they had been jet-skiing in the bay.

“He told me about ... redeveloping and improving the whole city for the people and ... attracting international tourists and businessmen to the area,” said Spavor, who runs the Paektu Cultural Exchange, which conducts economic research in North Korea.

“NO BELT-TIGHTENING”

Official history has not disclosed Kim’s birthplace, but many people from Wonsan believe he was born there, partly because he spent his early years at the palace.

An anecdote from that time gives a flavor of life inside the Kim family residence. One day, the Japanese family chef, Kenji Fujimoto, recounted in his memoirs, the future leader made an unusual remark.

“Hey, Fujimoto!” a young Kim said to the chef. “We ride horses every day, go rollerblading, play basketball, and in the summer we jet ski or play in the pool. But how do ordinary people live?” Fujimoto, who published the book in 2010, now runs a sushi restaurant in Pyongyang and could not be reached.

For years under Kim Jong Il, North Korea, backed by the Soviet Union and China, had officially provided everything for its people.

The political model then was known as “songun” – military first, which held that the Korean People’s Army was the first in line for resources and the infallible provider to fix the country’s economic problems. The “million-man army” would swap Kalashnikovs for shovels and set to work building roads, dams and housing.

After the Soviet Union collapsed in the 1990s, the entire nation, then 21 million people, suffered a famine that Kim Jong Il was eventually to call the “Arduous March.” The state was no longer able to provide food, or work. Between 200,000 and three million people died.

To survive, ordinary people were forced to look beyond the marshaled ranks on display at parades, and hustle for scraps on private markets, bribing officials to turn a blind eye to any illegality. For most people – including the military – it was hunger or trade.

When Kim the younger came to power, he said the time had come to “enable our people... to live without tightening their belts any longer.”

In 2013, he shifted the political rhetoric. His policy line, called “byungjin” or parallel development, harked back to his grandfather’s era. It also signaled the side-by-side advance of North Korea’s nuclear deterrent and a strong economy.

MAKE MONEY IN WONSAN

The latest available figures say North Korea spends a bigger share of its GDP on the military than any country in the world – an average of 23 percent between 2004 and 2014, according to the U.S. State Department.

The Wonsan brochures promise healthy profits, including internal rates of return of between 14 percent and 43 percent. The $7.3 million Wonsan Department Store, for example, allows for foreign investors to hold a stake of up to 61.3 percent. In return, it says, investors can expect to make $1.3 million net annual profit.

The brochures offer preferential conditions for foreign investors, saying their rights are protected by the state and they can remit funds abroad without any limitations. Land is available to them to lease, not to own, for 50 years, but investors can trade the leases.

Some of the projects are less generous. One offers the opportunity to cash in on the popularity of North Korean beer with an initial $2.4 million investment in a new Wonsan Brewery. The proposal says foreign investors will be subject to a 15 percent transaction tax, a city management tax, an auto tax, plus other deductions. Then there is income tax at 14 percent. These deductions will nearly halve the projected annual profit, to $154,711.

For domestic investors North Korea officially has no tax, but experts say the state raises funds by collecting about 70 percent of the profits of state enterprises.

A few of the proposals stretch the idea of tourism. They include an Offshore Farm to produce seafoods “of great economic value on an industrial basis, so as to satisfy the demands of tourists and export the products to the foreign market,” a lighting factory, a furniture factory, and a renovated Wonsan Fishing Tackle factory. Its output will include 10,000 deep sea floats, 750 tonnes of ropes and 2,500 “lifesaving jackets for swimming.”

Since the plans were drawn up, the United Nations has tightened sanctions on North Korea to include a ban on seafood exports and curbs on joint ventures.

According to a brochure from 2015, foreign investor interest in the Wonsan project was “growing day by day.”

But a Westerner who attended an investment conference in Wonsan in 2015 said North Korean officials showed little understanding of investors’ needs. About 200 people, Chinese and Westerners, heard about investment prospects in the zone and were taken on a tour of the area.

“I thought I might be a witness to some actual pragmatism,” said Simon Cockerell of Beijing-based Koryo Tours. “But they simply went on about how amazing the opportunities were and couldn’t admit any weaknesses or that there may be any issues at all with the area or any of their plans.”

Han Jin-myung, a North Korean diplomat who was stationed in Vietnam until 2015 before defecting to South Korea, said he had been tasked with promoting the Wonsan scheme abroad and had little success: “We just ended up selling North Korean herbs and medicines instead.”","Special Report: In Kim Jong Un's summer palace, fun meets guns",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-tourism-wonsan-specialrepo/special-report-in-kim-jong-uns-summer-palace-fun-meets-guns-idUSKBN1CF16E

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - British tech firm Micro Focus International Plc (MCRO.L), the new owner of ArcSight security software, said it would restrict reviews of the core operating instructions in its products by “high-risk” governments, after Reuters reported that the application had been scrutinized by Russia.

Micro Focus did not respond to questions seeking to clarify whether the countries included Russia or how it would determine which reviews were likely to be shared with governments. But a company spokeswoman said future reviews would require approval from Micro Focus’s chief executive.

And a Micro Focus blog posted on Monday by ArcSight head Jason Schmitt defended the reviews of core software operating instructions, known as source code, as common. He said “that dozens of brand-name products have undergone the same type of certification testing.”

“Micro Focus will not allow any source code reviews if we reasonably believe the governments of high risk countries will have access to that review,” the Micro Focus spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters.

Micro Focus purchased the ArcSight product line from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N) in a sale completed last month. Reuters reported last week that HPE allowed a Moscow defense agency to review the inner workings of ArcSight, a cyber defense software used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks.

Cyber security experts, former U.S. intelligence officials and former ArcSight employees said the practice could help Moscow discover weaknesses in the software, potentially helping attackers to blind the U.S. military to a cyber attack.

Russia’s evaluation of ArcSight concluded last year, at a time when Washington was accusing Moscow of an increasing number of cyber attacks against American companies, U.S. politicians and government agencies, including the Pentagon. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations.

Russia in recent years has stepped up demands for source code reviews as a requirement for doing business in the country, Reuters reported in June, and many companies have complied.

ArcSight, and other HPE security products, were sold to Micro Focus in a transaction completed in September.

Micro Focus also said it would notify the U.S. government and seek feedback before allowing source code reviews “where applicable.” The company spokeswoman did not respond to questions requesting clarification of when such notifications would apply.

Some companies have decided to stop allowing source code reviews as a condition to do business in a foreign market. For example, Symantec decided in 2016 that they would no longer allow such reviews because of security concerns.

HPE did not alert the Defense Information Systems Agency, which purchases ArcSight for the military, that it had allowed the Russian review, a DISA spokeswoman told Reuters.

The DISA spokeswoman said the agency has no immediate plans to pullback on its use of ArcSight or reconsider its procurement rules in light of the Reuters report. The Pentagon continually evaluates software for security risks, the DISA spokeswoman said.

According to Russian regulatory records and interviews with people with direct knowledge of the issue, the review of ArcSight’s code was conducted by Echelon, a company with close ties to the Russian military. The review was done on behalf of Russia’s Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC), a defense agency that counters cyber espionage.

HPE said code reviews have taken place for years and are conducted by Russian-government accredited testing companies at an HPE research and development center outside of Russia, where the software maker closely supervises the process.

No code is allowed to leave the premises ensuring “our source code and products were in no way compromised,” an HPE spokeswoman said in an email last week. She said in a phone call on Monday that no current HPE products had gone through the Russian review process.

ArcSight source code was tested in August 2015, the Micro Focus spokeswoman said, several months before HPE was spun off from Hewlett-Packard Inc. The Russian certification process for ArcSight was completed in August 2016, according to Russian regulatory records.

HPE has said the inspection process was necessary to obtain certification from Russia’s FSTEC in order to sell software to the public sector in Russia.",UK tech firm Micro Focus to curb code reviews by 'high risk' governments,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-russia-microfocus/uk-tech-firm-micro-focus-to-curb-code-reviews-by-high-risk-governments-idUSKBN1CE2M6

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will meet Myanmar’s top Buddhist monks, its military generals and civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in November when he visits that country and Bangladesh, both caught up in a crisis over the Rohingya Muslim minority.

According to a full programme of the Nov. 26-Dec. 2 trip released by the Vatican on Tuesday, the pope will say two Masses in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and one in Bangladesh, which is predominantly Muslim.

Francis will be the first pope to visit Myanmar and the second to visit Bangladesh, where Pope John Paul visited in 1986.

The pope arrives in Yangon, the country’s largest city, on Nov. 27 after a flight of more than 10 hours and is scheduled to rest for about 24 hours before heading to the country’s capital Naypyitaw for a day.

There, he will have separate private talks with President Htin Kyaw and Suu Kyi, who is both State Counsellor and Foreign Minister, making her effectively the country’s civilian leader.

A senior Vatican official said military leaders are expected to attend a separate, public meeting where the pope will address politicians and diplomats. This is where he is expected to give the keynote speech of the trip.

Myanmar is facing international scrutiny over the plight of its Rohingya community. In February, Francis said they had been tortured and killed simply because they wanted to live their culture and Muslim faith.

Last August, some hard-line Buddhists were riled with the pope spoke about “the persecution of our Rohingya brothers and sisters” and asked Catholics to pray for them, adding that they should be given “their full rights”.

On Nov. 29, the pope will address the Sangha Maha Nayaka, the country’s highest Buddhist authority, which is a government-backed panel of senior monks responsible for regulating the Buddhist clergy.

The United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday that Bangladesh border guards reported more than 11,000 Rohingya refugees crossing into their country from Myanmar on Monday alone..

The government offensive has drawn international condemnation and U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing, which the government denies.

There are about 700,000 Roman Catholics in Myanmar according to the country’s cardinal, Charles Maung Bo, out of a population of about 51.4 million.

Catholics make up a tiny minority in Bangladesh. Francis will be the second pope to visit that country, after Pope John Paul in 1986.","Pope to meet top Buddhist monks in Myanmar, address military",https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-pope/pope-to-meet-top-buddhist-monks-in-myanmar-address-military-idINKBN1CF1A6

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Yuriko Koike says she went into politics to be a player, not a bystander.

Now Tokyo’s first female governor is shaking things up as her new “Party of Hope” challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 poll, called by the Japanese leader to seek a fresh mandate after nearly five years in office.

When the Berlin Wall dividing East and West Germany was breached in 1989, Koike was a 37-year-old TV announcer. Three years later, she ran for parliament.

“The world was changing immensely, so I went from news presenter to newsmaker. I decided Japanese politics was moving too slowly and rather than be an outside critic, I should become ... a player on the inside,” Koike told Reuters in an interview.

Koike, who defied Abe’s party last year to run for governor, isn’t seeking a seat in parliament’s lower house herself, but is the driving force – and public face – of her upstart party.

In many ways, Koike is a paradox, interviews with people who know her and a review of her career show.

She’s a global thinker with a nationalist tinge; an entrepreneurial outsider who climbed the ladder with help from old-boy mentors, and a risk taker who has balked at perhaps her biggest gamble by declining to run in the national election now.

Koike has made no secret of her ambition to be Japan’s first woman prime minister – her pet female terrier is nicknamed “So-chan” – a diminutive for “sori” or “premier” in Japanese.

She has already cracked a few glass ceilings.

She became the country’s first female defense minister in 2007, although stepped down after 55 days after a tussle with a top bureaucrat. She was also the first woman to run for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s top leadership post in 2008, but came in a distant third.

Koike comes from a business family in western Japan, a background that sets her apart from many Japanese politicians, including Abe, who are scions of blue-blood political dynasties.

Her origins may account for a style that admirers say has more in common with venture capitalists than staid lawmakers.

“She’s not afraid to take initiatives, which in most of Japan is deeply frowned upon,” said a person who has known her for 25 years and advises on financial reforms. “In Japan, it’s subtlety within riddles, but she’s blunt.”

Koike has a talent for political marketing - critics call it populism - a skill she is using as she tries to differentiate her conservative party from Abe’s equally conservative LDP with promises to “break the fetters” of vested interest politics.

She calls her party’s economic policies “Yurinomics” in contrast to Abe’s “Abenomics, and its platform includes “12 Zeroes” it wants to achieve, including “zero hayfever”, and “zero euthanasia of unwanted pets”.

“DARK SIDE”

A graduate of Cairo University in 1976 who speaks Arabic and English, Koike in some ways has a global perspective and often sings the praises of diversity.

Like Abe, she advocates opening Japan to more highly skilled foreign workers. Also like Abe, she has visited Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism, but told Reuters she would not do so if she became premier.

Koike also espouses some causes dear to Japan’s rightwing, including revising the post-war, pacifist constitution.

In the past, she has even suggested Japan should consider acquiring nuclear weapons, breaking a taboo in the only country to suffer a nuclear attack. She also opposes local voting rights for foreign residents, many of whom are of Korean descent.

“There is a dark side that doesn’t jibe with a more open-minded, dare we say, liberal view,” said her long-time acquaintance.

Koike migrated through several parties before joining the LDP in 2002, only to abandon it after becoming governor.

She counts among her mentors Ichiro Ozawa, a one-time LDP heavyweight who helped engineer the long-ruling party’s ouster in 1993 and again in 2009, as well as popular ex-premier Junichiro Koizumi.

Critics say her career reflects an opportunist streak, while allies call it practical.

”She wants to make change, but she’s also pragmatic – she can make a deal with anyone – Communists or Abe or traditional stakeholders,” said another adviser. “It’s a kind of talent.”

Despite speculation that she would abandon her job as governor to return to parliament, Koike stuck to her decision not to run. Analysts say that’s likely because her party has little chance of defeating Abe’s ruling bloc, but may do well enough for her to take the leap in the next poll.

But those who know Koike say her desire for the nation’s top post remains. “Is she Machiavellian and strategic? The answer is yes. Is she prepared to think for the long run? The answer is yes,” said her long-time acquaintance.

“Is her over-riding ambition to be Japan’s first female prime minister? That is definitely a goal.”",Japan's Koike: a political paradox shakes things up ahead of poll,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-japan-election-koike/japans-koike-a-political-paradox-shakes-things-up-ahead-of-poll-idUKKBN1CF1QF

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber said on Tuesday that paying National Insurance contributions for its British drivers would add tens of millions of pounds to the taxi app’s costs were they to be deemed employees.

Uber currently classifies its around 50,000 drivers in Britain as self-employed, affording them only basic entitlements, whilst employees also receive rights such as sick pay and the minimum wage.

Asked about how much it would cost in National Insurance payments if self-employed drivers were directly employed, the firm’s UK Head of Policy Andrew Byrne told parliament’s business committee:

“I don’t have the precise figures ... but I‘m certain it would be the tens of millions certainly.”

Also appearing before lawmakers, Deliveroo’s UK and Ireland Managing Director Dan Warne said additional costs including National Insurance contributions, would add around 1 pound ($1.32) to the cost of each hour.

National Insurance is collected by the government and helps pay for the state health service, pensions and certain other benefits.

Firms operating in the so-called gig economy - whereby people tend to work for different companies without a fixed contract - have been criticized by unions and some lawmakers for what they call exploitative practices.

Uber and Deliveroo both say their drivers enjoy the flexibility they offer but last year two drivers won a tribunal hearing against Uber and were granted worker rights, in a decision which the Silicon Valley firm appealed last month.

Uber’s Byrne said on Tuesday he expected the judge to make a ruling by around Christmas.

Uber is also battling to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the smartphone app of its license in the British capital. It has until Friday to lodge an appeal.

Byrne said he could hopefully see a way to address concerns by London’s transport regulator, which cited the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

In a presentation to investors in New York, Spain’s biggest bank increased its return on tangible equity (ROTE) target for 2018 to over 11.5 percent from a prior estimate of 11 percent set out in its previous strategy plan last year.

Santander’s update was in part overshadowed by Catalonia’s independence drive and its potential effects on financial markets after Catalan lenders Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC) and Caixabank (CABK.MC) decided to move their legal headquarters out of the region.

Santander’s shares were down around 2.5 percent by 1320 GMT against a 0.34 percent drop on the European STOXX banking index .SX7P.

Like its European rivals, Santander is struggling to lift earnings from loans in Spain as interest rates hover at historic lows while increasing competition erodes margins.

But the lender managed to partially offset the financial margin squeeze in the second quarter though a buoyant Brazilian business, which accounts for 26 percent of its earnings, and a revenue boost from Banco Popular.

European authorities stepped in to avert a collapse of Banco Popular in June following a run on the bank, orchestrating a last-minute rescue by Santander, which bought it for a nominal one euro.

Banco Santander’s chairwoman Ana Botin said on Tuesday the bank continued to see excellent growth in Latin America as well as positive trends across both Europe and the United States.

“In the UK, while GDP growth has slowed, performance has been better than we had expected,” she said in a statement.

Santander also reiterated its remaining goals for 2018, including a target to reach double digit growth in earnings per share (EPS) and also kept its plans to pay 30 to 40 percent of its recurring profits in cash dividends.

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp abandoned its C$15.7 billion ($12.52 billion) cross-country Energy East pipeline on Thursday amid mounting regulatory hurdles, dealing a blow to the country’s oil export ambitions.

The demise of the pipeline comes less than a year after the Canadian government rejected another export pipeline, Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway, and is a further setback for Canada’s oil industry which is already hurting from low global crude prices.

The vast majority of Canadian crude exports go to the United States, and Energy East would have shipped 1.1 million barrels a day to east coast ports for loading onto tankers destined for higher-priced markets in Europe and Asia.

Concern about limited market access is one of the reasons foreign oil companies have sold off $23 billion in Canadian assets this year, along with high production costs that have made the country’s oil sands unattractive.

“It means reduced (options) for Canada and Canadian oil producers to access global markets and to receive fair pricing for one of our country’s most important export products,” said Brett Harris, spokesman for Canada’s No. 3 oil sands producer Cenovus Energy.

The cancellation heads off a broader political row over the project for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government, however, which is trying to balance diversifying Canada’s oil export markets with a commitment to tackling climate change.

TransCanada said last month it could abandon the project, weeks after Canada’s National Energy Board (NEB) announced a tougher review process that would take into account indirect greenhouse gas contributions among other factors.

On Thursday TransCanada canceled the plan, citing its review of “changed circumstances” and said it would take a fourth-quarter C$1 billion after-tax non-cash charge.

‘JOB LOSSES’

When it was announced in 2013, Energy East was hailed as a nation-building project that would unlock Canadian exports and boost economic growth along its route.

“The loss of this major project means the loss of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars for Canada, and will significantly impact our country’s ability to access markets for our oil and gas,” the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) said in a statement.

Pipeline supporters and the Alberta government have criticized the NEB for changing its review scope and provincial Premier Rachel Notley urged the regulator to give more clarity on its process.

While Energy East’s collapse may cost Trudeau support in the traditionally conservative oil heartland of Alberta it is likely to prove popular in the eastern province of Quebec, which has far more parliamentary seats and where pipeline opposition from politicians and environmental groups had been stiff.

Canada’s Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said the cancellation was a business decision and oil markets had changed since the pipeline was first proposed.

Oil prices have roughly halved since 2014.

TransCanada’s decision is also a blow to the ailing economy of New Brunswick province, where the pipeline would have terminated. Premier Brian Gallant said he believed low crude prices had killed the project.

Environmental groups welcomed the decision to scrap a pipeline they said was at odds with Canada’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Analysts said the decision to abandon it was already priced into the stock. Shares were last up 0.7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$61.29. They had fallen 3.2 percent since Aug. 23 - when the NEB expanded the scope of its assessment.

If Spanish authorities hoped strong-arm tactics against the referendum independence for Catalonia would nip nationalist feeling in the bud, they will almost certainly be proved badly wrong. Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

PARIS (Reuters) - The spent-fuel pools of French utility EDF’s nuclear reactors are highly vulnerable to attacks, Greenpeace said in a report published on Tuesday.

Written by a group of nuclear experts and delivered to French authorities, the report says that spent-fuel pools, which typically contain the equivalent of one to three nuclear reactor cores, have not been designed to withstand external aggression.

An attack leading to a loss of cooling water could spark a spent-fuel fire that could contaminate areas as far as 250 kilometres away, Greenpeace’s Yannick Rousselet said.

“EDF must address this issue and reinforce its spent-fuel pools,” he said.

EDF, which operates 58 reactors, denied its spent-fuel pools are at risk and said they have been designed to withstand earthquakes and flooding as well as terror attacks.

“Our nuclear fleet is safe and EDF, in close cooperation with the authorities, permanently evaluates the risk of terror attacks,” and EDF spokeswoman said.

Once uranium fuel is burned, the waste - which remains radioactive and very hot for years - typically is cooled in pools 2-3 years before being shipped to processing plants.

Greenpeace experts estimate the cost of upgrading the pools’ safety at about one billion euros (893.69 million pounds) per reactor.

The group said that since France has built many nuclear plants right by its borders, citizens of Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Germany and Luxembourg are at risk.

“Nuclear facilities could be an attractive target for a terror organisation,” said German nuclear expert Oda Becker.

Becker said the biggest risk is a complete loss of cooling water, which could happen if the building’s walls are hit by an airplane, a helicopter loaded with explosives or wall-penetrating rocket-propelled grenades.

Areva’s La Hague plant is seen as particularly vulnerable.

“With the equivalent of about 114 reactor cores in its pools ... La Hague is the nuclear facility that presents the highest risk in Europe,” said Yves Marignac, one of the experts.

Areva said that since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, Areva and French authorities have been vigilant about terrorism risk.

Much of the fuel at La Hague has largely cooled after years in storage and the site is highly secured, Areva said.

It has permanent radar coverage in cooperation with the air force and no planes are allowed to fly over it at altitudes of less than 2,000 metres in a 3 kilometre radius. La Hague’s pools are also surrounded by large buildings that protect from airplane attacks, Areva said.

State secretary for the environment Sébastien Lecornu said the government would study the Greenpeace report.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police fired teargas and shots in the air on Monday as hundreds of demonstrators marched through the capital Nairobi to protest against proposed legal changes that would make it harder for the Supreme Court to annul an election.

Reuters television footage showed a sport utility vehicle ploughing into some of the protesters, severely injuring three, but it was not immediately clear who was responsible and the police made no immediate comment on the incident.

Kenya is due on Oct. 26 to repeat a presidential election after the Supreme Court nullified an Aug. 8 vote due to procedural irregularities. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who won the August election, will face opposition leader Raila Odinga.

Uncertainty over the coming election has created turmoil in the East African nation, which is a regional trade hub and staunch Western ally.

As the demonstrators marched toward the election board in Nairobi, a Reuters journalist saw men in plain clothes near security forces fire shots in the air. Police on horseback set up blockades to prevent protesters from accessing some roads.

Police also used teargas in the western city of Kisumu, Odinga’s stronghold, to disperse protesters, though another demonstration in the coastal city of Mombasa passed peacefully.

Odinga’s opposition alliance is threatening to boycott the October vote unless the electoral board changes some personnel - a stance he declined on Monday to clarify, in comments that suggested he was keeping his options open for now.

“This is a democratic society we live in. If I choose not to participate in the pre-rigged election process, it is my democratic right. No court can order me to do so,” Odinga said in comments broadcast on Kenyan TV stations, without elaborating further.

“DECLARING WAR”

The protesters want to warn ruling party lawmakers not to pass an amendment to the election law that would limit the circumstances in which the Supreme Court could void an election on procedural grounds, opposition lawmaker James Orengo said.

“If parliament passes the law tomorrow, it will be like declaring war on the Kenyan people,” he said.

REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya

Justin Muturi, speaker of the National Assembly, said the amendment could be debated when parliament reconvenes on Tuesday if lawmakers were keen to push it forward.

He said the key part of the proposed law stipulates that if a candidate boycotts an election whose date has already been set, the remaining candidate would win the contest without formal polls being held.

The government is keen to avoid a constitutional crisis if Odinga pulls out at the last minute, frustrating the court’s order to hold elections within 60 days, Muturi said.

“We are trying to prevent a crisis should there be no elections,” he told Reuters by phone.

The government-backed Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said on Monday in a report that at least 37 people had been killed in a police crackdown on protests that immediately followed the August vote - the highest death toll given so far.

The report attributed some deaths to “police using live bullets and a few from police bludgeoning using clubs”. It named a 6-month-old baby girl, a 7-year-old boy, and an 8-year-old girl as being among the victims.","Kenya police use teargas, shoot in air during opposition march",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CE1GW-OZATP

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the National Football League should not be given tax breaks, wading back into his criticism of the league over silent player protests during the national anthem.

“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.

It was not clear what exactly Trump was demanding, and representatives for the White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The NFL gave up its federal tax-exempt status in 2015, according to media reports, although U.S. states and localities still offer the multi-billion dollar league tax breaks in order to attract teams and to finance stadiums.

Trump has been on a tear for weeks against NFL players who kneel during the national anthem played before games, saying the gesture disrespects the country. His strongly worded call last month for players who did this to be fired touched off an initially sharp response, including from some team owners and coaches.

The players’ silent demonstration, which began last year in protest against police violence toward racial minorities, was embraced more widely in reaction to Trump’s more recent comments, with more players taking the knee while others chose to lock arms.

A number of Republican lawmakers suggested in September that tax sweeteners should end given the protests, the Washington Post reported.

On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence walked out of an NFL game after some players knelt. Separately, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he would bench players who disrespect the U.S. flag.

On Monday, cable sports network ESPN was drawn into the fray when it suspended one of its broadcasters after she posted a tweet about the protests and Jones’ comment. ESPN, which is owned by Walt Disney Co, said it was Jemele Hill’s second violation of its social media guidelines.

Hill, who had said that those who rejected Jones’ comment should look at the team’s advertisers, later tweeted that she was not urging an NFL boycott.

In a separate Twitter post on Tuesday, Trump excoriated Hill, saying that with her “at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!”

The NFL Players Association has defended players’ right to protest.

Trump’s former Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton, also backed the players, saying in a speech on Monday, “They are protesting racism and injustice, and they have every right to do so.”

Critics of Trump, a Republican, have said he is fanning a controversy over the national anthem at NFL games to distract from pressing issues his administration is dealing with, from a powerful hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico to tensions with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars the government from limiting free speech, including prohibiting protests around the national anthem or punishing people who choose not to stand.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Yuriko Koike says she went into politics to be a player, not a bystander.

Now Tokyo’s first female governor is shaking things up as her new “Party of Hope” challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 poll, called by the Japanese leader to seek a fresh mandate after nearly five years in office.

When the Berlin Wall dividing East and West Germany was breached in 1989, Koike was a 37-year-old TV announcer. Three years later, she ran for parliament.

“The world was changing immensely, so I went from news presenter to newsmaker. I decided Japanese politics was moving too slowly and rather than be an outside critic, I should become ... a player on the inside,” Koike told Reuters in an interview.

Koike, who defied Abe’s party last year to run for governor, isn’t seeking a seat in parliament’s lower house herself, but is the driving force – and public face – of her upstart party.

In many ways, Koike is a paradox, interviews with people who know her and a review of her career show.

She’s a global thinker with a nationalist tinge; an entrepreneurial outsider who climbed the ladder with help from old-boy mentors, and a risk taker who has balked at perhaps her biggest gamble by declining to run in the national election now.

Koike has made no secret of her ambition to be Japan’s first woman prime minister – her pet female terrier is nicknamed “So-chan” – a diminutive for “sori” or “premier” in Japanese.

She has already cracked a few glass ceilings.

She became the country’s first female defense minister in 2007, although stepped down after 55 days after a tussle with a top bureaucrat. She was also the first woman to run for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s top leadership post in 2008, but came in a distant third.

Koike comes from a business family in western Japan, a background that sets her apart from many Japanese politicians, including Abe, who are scions of blue-blood political dynasties.

Her origins may account for a style that admirers say has more in common with venture capitalists than staid lawmakers.

“She’s not afraid to take initiatives, which in most of Japan is deeply frowned upon,” said a person who has known her for 25 years and advises on financial reforms. “In Japan, it’s subtlety within riddles, but she’s blunt.”

Koike has a talent for political marketing - critics call it populism - a skill she is using as she tries to differentiate her conservative party from Abe’s equally conservative LDP with promises to “break the fetters” of vested interest politics.

She calls her party’s economic policies “Yurinomics” in contrast to Abe’s “Abenomics, and its platform includes “12 Zeroes” it wants to achieve, including “zero hayfever”, and “zero euthanasia of unwanted pets”.

“DARK SIDE”

A graduate of Cairo University in 1976 who speaks Arabic and English, Koike in some ways has a global perspective and often sings the praises of diversity.

Like Abe, she advocates opening Japan to more highly skilled foreign workers. Also like Abe, she has visited Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism, but told Reuters she would not do so if she became premier.

Slideshow (7 Images)

Koike also espouses some causes dear to Japan’s rightwing, including revising the post-war, pacifist constitution.

In the past, she has even suggested Japan should consider acquiring nuclear weapons, breaking a taboo in the only country to suffer a nuclear attack. She also opposes local voting rights for foreign residents, many of whom are of Korean descent.

“There is a dark side that doesn’t jibe with a more open-minded, dare we say, liberal view,” said her long-time acquaintance.

Koike migrated through several parties before joining the LDP in 2002, only to abandon it after becoming governor.

She counts among her mentors Ichiro Ozawa, a one-time LDP heavyweight who helped engineer the long-ruling party’s ouster in 1993 and again in 2009, as well as popular ex-premier Junichiro Koizumi.

Critics say her career reflects an opportunist streak, while allies call it practical.

”She wants to make change, but she’s also pragmatic – she can make a deal with anyone – Communists or Abe or traditional stakeholders,” said another adviser. “It’s a kind of talent.”

Despite speculation that she would abandon her job as governor to return to parliament, Koike stuck to her decision not to run. Analysts say that’s likely because her party has little chance of defeating Abe’s ruling bloc, but may do well enough for her to take the leap in the next poll.

But those who know Koike say her desire for the nation’s top post remains. “Is she Machiavellian and strategic? The answer is yes. Is she prepared to think for the long run? The answer is yes,” said her long-time acquaintance.

“Is her over-riding ambition to be Japan’s first female prime minister? That is definitely a goal.”",Japan's Koike: a political paradox shakes things up ahead of poll,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CF1QF

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shania Twain’s first studio album in 15 years debuted at the top of the Billboard album charts, while rocker Tom Petty’s death sent his music soaring back onto the U.S. charts.

Twain’s album “Now” sold more than 137,000 copies in its first week, according to data on Monday from Nielsen SoundScan, almost double new releases by pop singers Demi Lovato and Miley Cyrus.

Petty’s “Greatest Hits” album with his band The Heartbreakers, first released in 1993, sold some 83,000 units to take the No. 2 spot on the Billboard 200 a week after the “American Girl” singer died at age 66.

The Billboard 200 chart tallies units from album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album).

Canadian country-pop crosssover Twain, 52, released “Now” after several years away from the studio following a struggle with Lyme disease and a tough divorce.

Lovato’s “Tell Me You Love Me” bowed at No. 3 with 73,000 in sales, while Cyrus’s change of direction to a more folksy style with “Younger” debuted in fifth place with some 45,000 units sold.

It was also a good week for Beyonce and fundraising for hurricane and earthquake disasters. The R&B singer’s remix of Spanish-language hit “Mi Gente” took the top spot on the digital songs chart, which measures online single sales.

“Mi Gente,” in which Beyonce joined forces with Latin singer J.Balvin and Willy William, sold some 79,000 units, and rose 25 places on the charts.

Beyonce, whose hometown Houston in Texas was badly hit by Hurricane Harvey in September, said she would donate her proceeds from the song and a new video to relief charities in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Caribbean islands after they were hit with three successive hurricanes, and an earthquake.","Shania Twain back on top, Tom Petty re-enters U.S. charts",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CE28B-OCAEN

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged the Trump administration on Tuesday to moderate its stance in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, describing some of Washington’s demands as “poison pill proposals” that could doom the talks.

Thomas Donohue, the chamber’s president and chief executive, will raise a red flag about the progress of the negotiations, according to advance excerpts of a speech he was due to make in Mexico City on Tuesday morning.

The group has argued repeatedly in recent weeks that NAFTA is critical to U.S. industries such as agriculture and manufacturing.

“There are several poison pill proposals still on the table that could doom the entire deal,” Donohue said in remarks to be delivered at an event hosted by AmCham Mexico. “All of these proposals are unnecessary and unacceptable.”

The U.S. Chamber did not specify what the most contentious proposals were in the excerpts of the speech, but a number of thorny issues have been highlighted by the Mexican and Canadian governments and the U.S. private sector in recent weeks.

These include U.S. exploration of imposing national content requirements for some products, not just regional thresholds, within certain sectors of industry, such as carmaking.

Auto makers in Mexico say excessive content requirements could do serious damage to the industry’s competitiveness.

In addition, U.S. officials have mooted incorporating a sunset clause in NAFTA that would kill it unless it was renegotiated every five years, as well as eliminating a key dispute resolution mechanism, much to the dismay of Canada.

The U.S., Mexico and Canada began renegotiating the 23-year-old trade pact this summer, with a fourth round of talks kicking off this week in Washington.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if he does not win concessions to reduce a U.S. trade deficit of around $64 billion with Mexico.

But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has consistently stressed the pact’s importance.

“The existential threat to the North American Free Trade Agreement is a threat to our partnership, our shared economic vibrancy, and clearly the security and safety of all three nations,” Donohue said.

In recent months, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has shown a willingness to stand up to the Trump administration’s more extreme proposals, often echoing Mexico’s positions.

“I also want it to be clear that the U.S. business community is committed to Mexico, and no matter what happens, we’re not going anywhere,” Donohue said.",U.S. Chamber warns U.S. demands could torpedo NAFTA talks,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta/u-s-chamber-warns-u-s-demands-could-torpedo-nafta-talks-idUSKBN1CF0WV?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

A review of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data obtained through right-to-information requests shows banks’ total stressed loans - including non-performing and restructured or rolled over loans - rose 4.5 percent in the six months to end-June. In the previous six months they had risen 5.8 percent.

While banks remain the main source of funding for India’s companies, the stubborn bad debt problem has eaten into bank profits and choked off new lending, especially to smaller firms, at a time when an economy that depends on them is stalling.

India grew at its slowest pace in three years in April-June - a concern for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces elections in 2019 and has pledged to create millions of new jobs before then.

Banks are having to take higher provisions to account for more defaulters being pushed into bankruptcy. And margins are likely to be squeezed further by proposed new rules to encourage commercial banks to pass on central bank interest rate cuts.

To be sure, the bulk of India’s sour loans are in the state banks and stem from lending to large conglomerates, especially in steel and infrastructure. But analysts say the rise in bad loans among small firms, and even retail borrowing, is worrying and will do little to encourage new loans to help fuel growth.

“On the corporate side, we think it’s a recognition cycle which is nearing an end,” said Alka Anbarasu, senior analyst at Moody’s Investor Service, referring to more bad loans being recognized as such, as banks come under pressure from the RBI and other regulators. “But it’s really those data points beyond corporate that are causing some worry.”

Anbarasu forecast weak quarters ahead for banks before profitability picks up, and several senior bankers from public sector lenders - which account for more than two-thirds of Indian banking assets - agreed the months ahead would be strained.

Stressed loans as a percentage of total loans reached 12.6 percent at end-June, according to the RBI data, the highest level in at least 15 years.

HIGHER PROVISIONS, WEAKER LOANS

Part of the issue for banks and the government is a strict provisioning regime: the RBI wants banks to provide for at least 50 percent of the secured loans to companies taken to bankruptcy proceedings, and 100 percent for the unsecured part.

A dozen of the biggest such cases account for nearly 1.78 trillion rupees, or a quarter of total non-performing assets.

For those companies, banks will need to provide 180 billion rupees on top of existing provisions, according to July estimates from India Ratings and Research, the local affiliate of Fitch Ratings.

More than 20 other sizeable companies are at risk of being taken to bankruptcy court.

Bankers say these and other pressures - including rising government bond yields that forced banks to post mark-to-market losses - have added to the squeeze, and hit new loans.

According to RBI data, new loans grew at just about 5 percent in the year to March, the lowest growth rate in more than six decades. Several banks have already cut back their loan books to conserve capital.

“What are they (RBI) thinking while they’re taking these steps all at the same time?” said a treasurer at a state-run bank, who didn’t want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. “Do they want banks to wind up their businesses, or do they want to save the banks?”

Treasury income accounted for 22.7 percent of banks’ operating profits in the last financial year, doubling its share from a year earlier, India Ratings estimates.

“The almost zero treasury income will hit provisioning ability and, in turn, make it more difficult for weaker banks to give loans as capital becomes more scarce,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, an associate director at the rating agency.

A senior policymaker, who requested anonymity as the discussions are not public, said the government would have to help to sufficiently capitalize the banks.

Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks will need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules. Moody’s expects the top 11 state lenders alone will need nearly $15 billion. The government has just $3 billion left in its budget for bank recapitalization.

“We think capitalization is the biggest challenge for the banks at the moment, given that earnings will remain subdued and will not support any capital generation,” said Moody’s Anbarasu.",Exclusive: No respite for Indian banks as bad loans hit record $146 billion,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-banks-exclusive/exclusive-no-respite-for-indian-banks-as-bad-loans-hit-record-146-billion-idINKBN1CF1NT

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian wage growth accelerated at its fastest pace in over a year in September, keeping alive the possibility that the Bank of Canada could hike interest rates for a third time by the end of the year.

Average hourly wages for permanent employees rose 2.2 percent last month from a year ago, Statistics Canada said in its jobs report on Friday.

The acceleration, which was the fastest annual pace since June 2016, suggested there may be a recovery in wage growth, which has been weak despite strong labor market gains over the past year and is being closely watched by the Bank of Canada.

Analysts said the growth in wages was more encouraging than September’s increase of 10,000 jobs, which was below forecasts and pointed to a cooling economy over the second half of the year.

The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates twice this year, spurred by strong economic growth that has put Canada at the top of the Group of Seven nations.

While expectations for a third rate hike later this month have dwindled following cautious comments from policymakers, markets placed the odds of an increase at 18 percent after the jobs report, compared to 12.2 percent before.

“I think this is going to reinforce the Bank of Canada’s expectations that we’re spiraling upward on wage and price pressures in the Canadian economy,” said Derek Holt, vice president of economics at Scotiabank.

Although Holt continues to expect a hike at the central bank’s meeting in December, he said the possibility of an October increase was still in play.

Markets put the odds of a December hike at 64.3 percent.

The Canadian dollar touched a five-week low against its U.S. counterpart immediately after the Canadian jobs report before recovering some losses to trade little changed.

Jimmy Jean, senior economist at Desjardins Capital Markets, said the wage growth was “a pretty rapid improvement,” though he did not expect it to move the needle on the October rate decision.

“It is a sign that the job market is tightening,” Jean said.

September’s job gains were driven by the public sector, which added 26,200 positions, while the private sector shed 15,500 jobs. The unemployment rate held steady at 6.2 percent as the number of people looking for work edged down.

The education sector led the way up, adding 20,000 positions, while the public administration field added 4,500 jobs. Elsewhere, the wholesale and retail trade sector added 16,600 jobs.",Canadian wage growth accelerates even as job growth slows,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CB1KS-OCADN

California

Firefighters battled overnight to contain wildfires in Northern California, evacuating residents in the path of 15 separate blazes that have killed at least 10 people and destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses. Efforts to control the fires, which swept through the state’s world-famous wine country, were being helped by more favorable weather conditions, a spokesman for the governor’s Office of Emergency Services said. However, the death toll could still rise.

After the two sides collectively spent more than an estimated $100 million on mailings, phone calls and advertisements to woo investors, the outcome as of late Monday was too close to call, according to sources who had estimates of a preliminary voting tally.

Peltz has called for P&G to reorganize into three business units: beauty, grooming and healthcare; fabric and home care and baby, feminine and family care.

P&G, led by chief executive David Taylor, has countered that management is already working on several operational changes, and that Peltz does not have the relevant experience to be helpful in the process.

“Win or lose, Nelson Peltz has taken the activist campaign to the largest companies, which have previously been able to inoculate themselves from these kind of experiences by spending enough money to keep activists at bay,” said Bruce Goldfarb, founder of Okapi Partners, which advises on proxy contests.

Trian, a $14 billion New York-based hedge fund, owns a $3.5 billion stake in the maker of Tide laundry detergent, Crest toothpaste and Charmin toilet paper. Three top proxy advisory firms, which influence the stance of many mutual funds, have recommended P&G shareholders vote to give Peltz a board seat.

Vanguard Group Inc, State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock Inc are P&G’s top three shareholders. Individual stock owners, such as retirees and amateur stock pickers, collectively hold about 40 percent of the company’s stock, a much higher proportion than at most big companies.

P&G’s large retail base is due, in part, to long-running stock-based incentive plans for employees and the attraction of its well-known brand names for “mom and pop” investors.

This is only the third time Trian has waged a proxy contest in its 12-year history. Two years ago it narrowly lost a fight with DuPont, although within a year the company’s CEO was out a job and a faster cost cutting was underway.

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber said on Tuesday that paying National Insurance contributions for its British drivers would add tens of millions of pounds to the taxi app’s costs were they to be deemed employees.

Uber currently classifies its around 50,000 drivers in Britain as self-employed, affording them only basic entitlements, whilst employees also receive rights such as sick pay and the minimum wage.

Asked about how much it would cost in National Insurance payments if self-employed drivers were directly employed, the firm’s UK Head of Policy Andrew Byrne told parliament’s business committee:

“I don’t have the precise figures ... but I‘m certain it would be the tens of millions certainly.”

Also appearing before lawmakers, Deliveroo’s UK and Ireland Managing Director Dan Warne said additional costs including National Insurance contributions, would add around 1 pound ($1.32) to the cost of each hour.

National Insurance is collected by the government and helps pay for the state health service, pensions and certain other benefits.

Firms operating in the so-called gig economy - whereby people tend to work for different companies without a fixed contract - have been criticized by unions and some lawmakers for what they call exploitative practices.

Uber and Deliveroo both say their drivers enjoy the flexibility they offer but last year two drivers won a tribunal hearing against Uber and were granted worker rights, in a decision which the Silicon Valley firm appealed last month.

Uber’s Byrne said on Tuesday he expected the judge to make a ruling by around Christmas.

Uber is also battling to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the smartphone app of its license in the British capital. It has until Friday to lodge an appeal.

Byrne said he could hopefully see a way to address concerns by London’s transport regulator, which cited the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

“Hopefully we can see a path forward now with TfL (Transport for London) where we can address their concerns and continue to operate,” he said.",Uber says UK National Insurance contributions would cost tens of millions of pounds,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-uber-britain-workers/uber-says-uk-national-insurance-contributions-would-cost-tens-of-millions-of-pounds-idUKKBN1CF15U

Berlin (Reuters) - Führende FDP- und Grünen-Politiker haben scharfe Kritik an dem Unionskompromiss zum Flüchtlingszuzug geübt.

Die Vereinbarung von CDU und CSU wird nach den Worten des FDP-Vizevorsitzenden Wolfgang Kubicki nicht Grundlage einer Koalitionsvereinbarung werden. “Das wird nicht passieren”, sagte Kubicki am Dienstag im Deutschlandfunk.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While Democrats and immigration advocates recoiled at hard-line immigration proposals unveiled this week by the White House, they see a chance to force Republicans’ hand on legislation to help young “Dreamers” brought to the country illegally as children.

Their focus? A spending bill that Congress will need to pass in December in order to keep the U.S. government open.

Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, may need Democratic votes to approve the legislation because of divisions within their party over fiscal restraint.

Democrats are considering insisting on help for the Dreamers as their price for providing the votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown. Republican President Donald Trump ended the Obama-era DACA program last month that protected the Dreamers, and gave Congress six months to find a solution.

“This is all heading towards a December deal on Dreamers as part of an omnibus or spending package,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a liberal-leaning immigration advocacy group.

“If Trump embraces the nativists in his base and says: ‘No deal unless I get everything,’ there won’t be many if any Democratic votes for a spending package that excludes Dreamers.”

House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told the Washington Post on Monday she did not rule out withholding Democratic support for the spending bill if needed to obtain a deal to protect the nearly 800,000 Dreamers in the United States.

Asked about the possibility of including action on Dreamers in the spending measure, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the administration was not focused on the implementation process at the moment but would get into that at meetings this week after releasing the president’s priorities on Sunday night.

In December, Trump and Congress face the expiration of a three-month deal struck on Sept. 8 to prevent a government shutdown.

That surprise deal between Trump and congressional Democrats maintained federal government funding at levels then in place until Dec. 8. Another stopgap bill will likely be needed to replace that, setting up further fiscal and legislative drama in Washington.

Republican leaders in the House have struggled in recent years to get a consensus within their party on budget deals. Members of the conservative Freedom Caucus have often demanded deep budget cuts unpalatable to more moderate Republicans.

If enough Republican lawmakers break ranks on the budget, House leaders would need Democratic votes to help make up the difference and avoid a government shutdown.

DEAL-MAKING

Trump as a businessman had a reputation for working to get deals by opening with an aggressive list of demands and later leaving the door open to compromise.

Administration officials want his immigration priorities implemented in conjunction with a plan to give Dreamers legal status. The wish list includes funding for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the United States from Central America.

Pro-immigration advocates dismissed those demands as non-starters and largely brushed off their release as immaterial to the debate because they were unacceptable to Democrats and many Republicans.

“I don’t think that the ideas that were presented on Sunday really change the discussion or complicate things at all,” said Tom Jawetz, vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress.

Advocates say there is bipartisan support for measures to prevent Dreamers from facing deportation and allow them to secure work permits after Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program enacted under former Democratic President Barack Obama.

The White House and many Trump supporters are eager, however, to see key campaign promises on border security enacted in exchange for any such fix.

That has advocates focused on the spending, or omnibus bill, as an avenue for Dreamer legislation that could pass both chambers unencumbered by demands related to immigration enforcement.

“It’s highly unlikely that a stand-alone bill could ever reach the president’s desk,” said Tyler Moran, managing director of the DC Immigration Hub, a strategy organization for pro-immigration groups. “The only vehicle is the omnibus bill.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could join a formal trade alliance with the United States, Canada and Mexico if the European Union refuses to clinch a post-Brexit trade deal, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Tuesday without citing sources.

The newspaper said British ministers were looking at the idea of joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as part of planning for possibility of Britain leaving the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal.

Britain’s international trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

Britain is currently negotiating the terms of its divorce from the EU though Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing to move onto discussions about a major free trade deal with the world’s biggest trading bloc.

With the clock ticking down toward Brexit day in 2019, British ministers are exploring what they will do if the world’s fifth largest economy drops out of the EU without a clear trade deal.

Besides aiming to clinch a U.S. trade deal or forming some new trade grouping, some British supporters of Brexit have pondered joining an existing trade deal such as NAFTA.

But U.S. President Donald Trump has warned he may terminate the 1994 NAFTA deal because he says it does not serve U.S. economic interests.

If Britain did join NAFTA, manufacturers wanting to export to the EU and North America would have to produce goods in accordance with the two separate sets of rules, according to trade analysts.

Britain, whose regulation has been within the EU’s orbit for over 40 years, would also have to shift toward the North American model for services, goods, competition policy and data protection.

Groundbreaking on homes edged slightly lower in September to 217,118 units from August’s upwardly revised 225,918 as a 10.7 percent drop in multiple starts, typically condos, outweighed an 8.2 percent climb in single starts, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation said.

Analysts had expected starts to cool to a 210,000 annual rate but construction continued to defy expectations for a pullback after a near decade-long boom.

“Canadian homebuilding activity remains robust, with the best population growth in 25 years proving fundamental support. And, after declining modestly in the second quarter, residential investment looks to have added to growth again in the third quarter,” BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic wrote in a client note.

Canada’s long housing boom has shown signs of cooling, particularly in the nation’s largest city, Toronto, where the introduction in April of a foreign buyers tax has doused sales and ended many of the bidding wars that had become a hallmark of the city’s overheated market.

A separate report from Statistics Canada showed the value of Canadian building permits fell more than expected in August, the second straight monthly decrease, on lower construction intentions for multifamily homes as well as industrial facilities.

The 5.5 percent decrease in total building permits surpassed forecasts for a decline of 1.0 percent and suggested that the building boom will slow in the months ahead. July figures were revised to show a decrease of 2.8 percent from the previously reported 3.5 percent fall.

“Despite the drop (in housing starts) in September, Canadian residential construction remains at a level that is higher than demographic needs,” said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial, estimating that a 190,000 pace of starts would meet demographic needs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares ground out a fresh record high on Tuesday, making it almost 50 for the year, although Europe traded cautiously as markets waited to see whether Spain’s Catalonia region would push for independence later in the day.

Japan and South Korea returned from extended breaks to give Asia a lift a Wall Street looked set to open higher, [.N] but the Catalan uncertainty meant the euro zone’s main bourses [.EU] and Spanish bond markets spent the day in the red.

Catalonia’s secessionist leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the region’s parliament in Barcelona around 1600 GMT and could ask the assembly to vote on a unilateral declaration of independence from Madrid.

It is Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and Madrid’s IBEX stocks index was 1 percent lower in early afternoon trade. It is now down almost 9 percent since May, though a sharp rise in the euro has also taken a toll.

“We have not witnessed any relevant statement or signal by the separatists that would hint at a change of strategy ahead of today’s discussion in the Catalonian parliament,” economists at Barclays wrote.

“Consequently, at this point, it seems likely that Catalan President Carles Puigdemont remains on track to announce a unilateral declaration of independence as early as today.”

The euro remained resilient. It hopped to a one-week high of almost $1.18 as data showed German exports surged in August. Traders were also still upbeat after one of the European Central Bank’s German policymakers called for an end to its stimulus.

There was also help from a weaker dollar which was down for a third straight day. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, dropped 0.3 percent to 93.366 and away from Friday’s almost 3-month peak.

It gave the Turkish lira a breather after it had been sent sprawling to a nine-month low on Monday after the United States and Turkey scaled back visa services.

Mexico’s peso hovered at its weakest in more than four months too, ahead of the latest round of talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Wednesday.

“Mexican asset prices have been very well supported this year so we think there needs to be a little bit of caution,” said UBP’s EM macro and FX strategist Koon Chow.

“There is not much of a cushion for bad news now and NAFTA talks are unlikely to bring any good news.”

Bond markets, meanwhile, were waiting to see if 10-year Treasuries would get above 2.4 percent ahead of another Fed rate hike that is now seen as almost nailed on for December.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari and his Dallas counterpart, Robert Kaplan, are due to make speeches later ahead of the minutes from the Fed’s September meeting, which will be published on Wednesday.

Overnight, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had climbed 0.6 percent, boosted by a 1.6 percent jump in Korea as shares of firms such as Samsung which have been closed for the past week, caught up with some of the global rally.

Japan’s Nikkei brushed off a weak start to finish 0.6 percent higher too, though China stocks dipped as investors cashed in some of the gains that took them to a 21-month high in the previous session. [.SS]

China’s Statistics Bureau on Tuesday said the country would have no problem meeting its economic growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, and might even beat it. Such an outcome had been widely expected after a robust start to the year.

The offshore Chinese yuan rate surged to its strongest level in more than two weeks. The central bank had also set a firmer-than-expected official rate, suggesting authorities are keen to keep the currency in check ahead of next week’s key national leadership meeting.

The stocks gains came in spite of tensions on the Korean peninsula. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Monday that any further escalation of the situation was unacceptable.

China had also called for restraint. U.S. President Donald Trump warned over the weekend that “only one thing will work” in dealing with Pyongyang, hinting that military action was on his mind.

In commodities, Brent oil prices pushed back above $56 a barrel after top producer Saudi Arabia signaled it would trim its exports and as OPEC flagged ongoing efforts to try to restore the longer-term “balance” of the market.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Regional leader Carles Puigdemont held a meeting of his cabinet to decide how to press an independence drive that has stirred powerful emotions across Spain and raised concern in European Union partner states.

Catalan police armed with automatic rifles stood guard at Barcelona’s Parc de la Ciutadella which houses the elegant 18th century building. Spanish national police, decried by separatists over their use of force to hinder an Oct. 1 referendum, were not to be seen.

A declaration of independence would deepen Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and would almost certainly draw tough counter-measures from Madrid, possibly including suspension of the regional government.

The parliament and other buildings, such as the regional high court building, could become a focus of contention between Spanish and Catalan authorities.

Thousands of national police reinforcements sent by Madrid for the referendum remain in the area, many of them in two cruise ships docked in Barcelona harbor.

Pro-independence demonstrators were due to gather before the parliament building under the slogan “Hello Republic” to mark Puigdemont’s speech at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).

Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Barcelona against independence at the weekend, waving red-yellow Spanish flags through the city center. That rally fell a week after some 900 people were injured when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt a referendum ruled illegal in Madrid.

Related Coverage Spain's creditors size up cost of Catalan independence bid

Puigdemont has said he is determined to apply a law passed by the Catalan assembly which called for a declaration of independence within days if Catalans voted ‘yes’ in the Oct. 1 referendum.

The government of Spain’s wealthiest region says 90 percent of those who voted backed independence, but turnout was only 43 percent as many opponents of independence stayed at home.

The Madrid government has said it will respond immediately to any unilateral declaration.

Puigdemont could ask the parliament to vote on a motion of independence, which lawmakers say would start a period of up to six months during which Catalonia would write a new constitution and negotiate a divorce with Spain; or he could make a statement of intent on a future independence declaration.

Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to disclose what Puigdemont would say but told a news conference after the cabinet meeting he would be “clear and explicit” and Tuesday would be an historic day.

Ruling party lawmakers say Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is considering taking the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering new regional elections, the so-called nuclear option.

The European Commission repeated its call for dialogue in Spain to end the crisis in Catalonia. Puigdemont has also called for talks and international mediation, but Rajoy has said he will not negotiate with the Catalan leaders unless they abandon plans to declare independence.

BUSINESS CLIMATE

Markets have been rattled by the Catalan crisis, raising Spain’s borrowing costs and pushing down shares.

Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond yields were a touch lower on Tuesday, but above lows hit the previous session as investors awaited Puigdemont’s speech. Spain’s benchmark Ibex share index was down nearly one percent.

The tension is taking its toll on the business climate. On Monday, three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business drift from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum.

Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial and infrastructure firm Abertis both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued.

Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence.

Spain’s finance minister said it was the Catalan government’s fault the companies were leaving.

The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

Republicans in Congress and the White House haven’t been able to get any major legislation passed yet. But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

Separately on Tuesday, Britain’s budget forecasters gave a gloomier medium-term outlook for the economy, potentially leaving finance minister Philip Hammond with less room to offset any big hit from Britain’s departure from the European Union.

The somewhat downbeat picture for the world’s fifth-biggest economy from a raft of data - including a record goods trade deficit - contrasted with the situation in some of Britain’s closest trading partners in the European Union.

German exports outpaced imports in August, adding to signs it performed strongly in the third quarter, and Italian industrial output was much stronger than expected.

But there were some signs of encouragement for Britain.

The country’s factories had their strongest two months of 2017 in July and August, and the construction sector grew for the first time in three months.

In year-on-year terms, factory output was 2.8 percent higher, its fastest growth in six months.

Revisions to past data showed Britain’s economy had been a bit less weak earlier this year than previously thought.

“They’re not storming figures but I think they’re good enough to keep the Bank of England on track for a November rate hike,” said Victoria Clarke, an economist with Investec.

Britain’s economy has slowed sharply this year as consumers felt the pinch from rising inflation, caused largely by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote, and by weak wage growth.

BOE ANNOUNCEMENT

Nonetheless, the BoE said last month that most of its policymakers thought it was likely that they would need to raise rates for the first time in a decade in the coming months.

The BoE believes last year’s Brexit vote will create more inflation pressure by dampening business investment and slowing migration to Britain.

Figures for the much bigger services sector are due to be released on Oct. 25, along with a preliminary first estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product growth, little more than a week before the BoE’s Nov. 2 announcement.

Many economists say only a shock weakening in those figures is likely to cause the BoE to delay raising rates.

In a reminder of the long-standing problems that have held back Britain’s economy, Tuesday’s data showed the country’s deficit in its trade in goods hit an all-time high in cash terms.

That was despite the slump in the value of the pound which some supporters of Brexit have predicted will deliver an export boom. Export volumes in the three months to August were 3.2 percent lower than the previous three months, though they are 8.9 percent higher than a year before.

And there was bad news regarding the Achilles heel of the British economy - the long-standing weak record of its companies and workers to squeeze more output from their work.

Britain’s official budget watchdog said it expected to “significantly” downgrade its forecasts for productivity growth in the next five years.

Finance minister Hammond is due to present an annual budget on Nov. 22. Although he is under pressure to increase public spending and eliminate a pay cap on public sector pay, any cut in productivity forecasts would substantially limit his room for maneuver by reducing future tax revenues.","UK stuck in slow growth gear, BoE on course to raise rates",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy/uk-stuck-in-slow-growth-gear-boe-on-course-to-raise-rates-idUKKBN1CF0TY?il=0

(Reuters) - Honeywell International a dévoilé mardi une refonte de sa structure passant par un recentrage sur l‘aéronautique et l‘espace, ce qui est exactement à l‘opposé de ce que réclamait le fonds activiste Third Point Capital depuis avril.

Le conglomérat industriel diversifié, qui a annoncé avant l‘ouverture de Wall Street les conclusions d‘un réexamen de ses activités, opèrera d‘ici la fin de 2018 la scission de ses pôles transports et systèmes de protection et de sécurité, logés dans deux entités cotées distinctes.

Honeywell précise que ces deux segments représentent un chiffre d‘affaires annualisé de 7,5 milliards de dollars (6,4 milliards d‘euros).

Le groupe industriel a également relevé de cinq cents le bas de son objectif de bénéfice annuel 2017 à 7,05-7,10 dollars par action, hors revalorisation éventuelle des retraites au prix du marché. Le consensus Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S donne un BPA de 7,09 dollars.

Honeywell anticipe également un BPA de 1,75 dollar au troisième trimestre, supérieur de deux cents au consensus.

L‘action gagnait 1% environ dans des échanges d‘avant-Bourse peu fournis à Wall Street.

Le directeur général Darius Adamczyk, à l‘exemple des autres dirigeants de conglomérats industriels, est pressé par certains actionnaires de rationaliser un portefeuille d‘activités disparate qui varie dans son cas des turbocompresseurs aux alarmes antivol en passant par les bottes Xtratuf, très prisées par l‘industrie de la pêche d‘Alaska.

En conservant son pôle aéronautique et espace, Honeywell oppose une fin de non recevoir aux exigences de Third Point qui réclamait la scission d‘activités représentant 36% environ du chiffre d‘affaires total de 2016.

Le scission des turbocompresseurs est symptomatique d‘une tendance de l‘industrie, automobile en particulier, à s‘éloigner des technologies adaptées aux moteurs à explosion, jugés trop polluants, alors que les technologies électriques ont au contraire le vent en poupe.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the National Football League should not be given tax breaks, wading back into his criticism of the league over silent player protests during the national anthem.

“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.

It was not clear what exactly Trump was demanding, and representatives for the White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The NFL gave up its federal tax-exempt status in 2015, according to media reports, although U.S. states and localities still offer the multi-billion dollar league tax breaks in order to attract teams and to finance stadiums.

Trump has been on a tear for weeks against NFL players who kneel during the national anthem played before games, saying the gesture disrespects the country. His strongly worded call last month for players who did this to be fired touched off an initially sharp response, including from some team owners and coaches.

The players’ silent demonstration, which began last year in protest against police violence toward racial minorities, was embraced more widely in reaction to Trump’s more recent comments, with more players taking the knee while others chose to lock arms.

A number of Republican lawmakers suggested in September that tax sweeteners should end given the protests, the Washington Post reported.

On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence walked out of an NFL game after some players knelt. Separately, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he would bench players who disrespect the U.S. flag.

On Monday, cable sports network ESPN was drawn into the fray when it suspended one of its broadcasters after she posted a tweet about the protests and Jones’ comment. ESPN, which is owned by Walt Disney Co, said it was Jemele Hill’s second violation of its social media guidelines.

Hill, who had said that those who rejected Jones’ comment should look at the team’s advertisers, later tweeted that she was not urging an NFL boycott.

In a separate Twitter post on Tuesday, Trump excoriated Hill, saying that with her “at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!”

The NFL Players Association has defended players’ right to protest.

Trump’s former Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton, also backed the players, saying in a speech on Monday, “They are protesting racism and injustice, and they have every right to do so.”

Critics of Trump, a Republican, have said he is fanning a controversy over the national anthem at NFL games to distract from pressing issues his administration is dealing with, from a powerful hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico to tensions with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars the government from limiting free speech, including prohibiting protests around the national anthem or punishing people who choose not to stand.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will meet Myanmar’s top Buddhist monks, its military generals and civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in November when he visits that country and Bangladesh, both caught up in a crisis over the Rohingya Muslim minority.

According to a full program of the Nov. 26-Dec. 2 trip released by the Vatican on Tuesday, the pope will say two Masses in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and one in Bangladesh, which is predominantly Muslim.

Francis will be the first pope to visit Myanmar and the second to visit Bangladesh, where Pope John Paul visited in 1986.

The pope arrives in Yangon, the country’s largest city, on Nov. 27 after a flight of more than 10 hours and is scheduled to rest for about 24 hours before heading to the country’s capital Naypyitaw for a day.

There, he will have separate private talks with President Htin Kyaw and Suu Kyi, who is both State Counsellor and Foreign Minister, making her effectively the country’s civilian leader.

A senior Vatican official said military leaders are expected to attend a separate, public meeting where the pope will address politicians and diplomats. This is where he is expected to give the keynote speech of the trip.

Myanmar is facing international scrutiny over the plight of its Rohingya community. In February, Francis said they had been tortured and killed simply because they wanted to live their culture and Muslim faith.

Last August, some hard-line Buddhists were riled with the pope spoke about “the persecution of our Rohingya brothers and sisters” and asked Catholics to pray for them, adding that they should be given “their full rights”.

On Nov. 29, the pope will address the Sangha Maha Nayaka, the country’s highest Buddhist authority, which is a government-backed panel of senior monks responsible for regulating the Buddhist clergy.

The United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday that Bangladesh border guards reported more than 11,000 Rohingya refugees crossing into their country from Myanmar on Monday alone..

The government offensive has drawn international condemnation and U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing, which the government denies.

There are about 700,000 Roman Catholics in Myanmar according to the country’s cardinal, Charles Maung Bo, out of a population of about 51.4 million.

Catholics make up a tiny minority in Bangladesh. Francis will be the second pope to visit that country, after Pope John Paul in 1986.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose to above $56 a barrel on Tuesday, supported by Saudi Arabian export cuts in November and comments from OPEC and trading companies that the market is rebalancing after years of oversupply.

Saudi Arabia has cut November allocations by 560,000 barrels per day (bpd), in line with its commitment to an OPEC-led supply reduction pact. In the United States, some production remains offline following Hurricane Nate, lending additional support.

“Prices have been boosted by news that Saudi Arabia is planning to reduce its oil shipments to customers in November,” said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

Brent crude LCOc1, the international price benchmark, was up 80 cents at $56.59 a barrel at 1326 GMT. U.S. crude gained 97 cents to $50.55.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-member producers are cutting output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until next March to get rid of a price-sapping supply glut.

OPEC is increasingly confident that the market is rebalancing fast, helped by the cutback as well as by stronger-than-expected growth in global demand.

The chief executive of trading firm Gunvor, Torbjorn Tornqvist, also said the market was rebalancing, citing falling product stocks and crude held in floating storage clearing up.

“We don’t see this market being out of balance one way or another,” he told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit taking place this week. Overall crude stocks “are still high,” he added, and OPEC needed to stick to its output curbs.

Short-term price support was coming from the United States, where 85 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production, or 1.49 million bpd, was offline following Hurricane Nate, according to official figures.

OPEC has managed record-high adherence to its supply cutting deal this year and is considering extending the deal beyond its March 2018 expiry. Some analysts have been concerned that a price recovery could tempt producers to open the taps again.

But analysts at JP Morgan said this was less of an issue, saying “concerns that OPEC compliance would fade into the fourth quarter now appear unfounded.”

“Stronger-than-assumed economic growth offers the potential for tight market conditions to continue if OPEC extends the current deal for another nine months,” the bank said.",Oil rises above $56 on Saudi export cut,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-rises-above-56-on-saudi-export-cut-idUSKBN1CF043?il=0

(This article has been corrected to remove a reference to Advent and Apax steering clear of Japan.","HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Japan is finally warming up to buyouts. The world’s third-biggest economy should be a prime hunting ground for private equity: Japanese firms make great products and are often parochial, poorly run, and undervalued, offering lots of room for improvement. Yet the country has long frustrated foreign PE shops. This year offers proof things are improving.

A few early triumphs, like the 2000 takeover of what became Shinsei Bank, sparked a backlash against “vultures”. And bosses have tended to mistrust leveraged buyout specialists. So some big private equity names, like Permira, have done just a few deals. Others, including Advent and TPG, have left or scaled back.

Now Bain Capital is leading an $18 billion takeover of Toshiba’s memory unit. That will be a record-breaking LBO for Japan, and an unorthodox one, given the involvement of Apple, Dell and others. Thanks largely to this single deal, buyout volumes have already topped $20 billion this year, Preqin data shows. That is a massive uptick on recent years.

Those statistics maybe skewed, but last year was also busy, and it is revealing that private equity’s involvement with Toshiba was not politically controversial. Meanwhile, Bain is simultaneously bidding for local advertising agency Asatsu-DK, and Blackstone is expanding in Tokyo.

Elsewhere, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s drive for better returns is weakening the corporate taboo against shedding non-core businesses. Buyers have also adapted, becoming better at convincing blue-chip sellers they will be responsible stewards of unwanted units, helping them grow rather than relying on cuts to generate profits. Hitachi, Nissan and Panasonic have all done deals with KKR, for example. These tie-ups can be a long process and favour the few firms with deep roots in Tokyo.

The next question for buyout firms is how to snag more deals. Shareholder pressure means there are likely to be many more corporate cast-offs. So buyout firms need to be better at spotting upfront how they can make businesses more valuable, says Jim Verbeeten of Bain & Co, the consulting firm, or they will be routinely outbid by corporate rivals. Still, all the signs suggest that private equity has broken through the ice in Japan.

The 70-year-old retired banker said he is unhappy with infighting and turnover in the White House. He does not like Trump’s penchant for traveling to his personal golf resorts. He wishes the president would do more to fix the healthcare system, and he worries that Trump might back down from his promise to force illegal immigrants out of the country.

“Every president makes mistakes,” Wilson said. “But if you add one on top of one, on top of another one, on top of another, there’s just a limit.”

Trump, who inspired millions of supporters last year in places like Morgan County, has been losing his grip on rural America.

According to the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll, the Republican president’s popularity is eroding in small towns and rural communities where 15 percent of the country’s population lives. The poll of more than 15,000 adults in “non-metro” areas shows that they are now as likely to disapprove of Trump as they are to approve of him.

In September, 47 percent of people in non-metro areas approved of Trump while 47 percent disapproved. That is down from Trump’s first four weeks in office, when 55 percent said they approved of the president while 39 percent disapproved.

The poll found that Trump has lost support in rural areas among men, whites and people who never went to college. He lost support with rural Republicans and rural voters who supported him on Election Day.

And while Trump still gets relatively high marks in the poll for his handling of the economy and national security, rural Americans are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s record on immigration, a central part of his presidential campaign.

Forty-seven percent of rural Americans said in September they approved of the president’s handling of immigration, down from 56 percent during his first month in office.

Poll respondents who were interviewed by Reuters gave different reasons for their dissatisfaction with the president on immigration.

A few said they are tired of waiting for Trump to make good on his promise to build a wall along America’s southern border, while others said they were uncomfortable with his administration’s efforts to restrict travel into the United States.

“There should be some sort of compromise between a free flow of people over the border and something that’s more controlled,” said Drew Carlson, 19, of Warrensburg, Missouri, who took the poll.

But Trump’s “constant fixation on deportation is a little bit unsettling to me.”

The Trump administration would not comment about the Reuters/Ipsos poll.

To be sure, Trump is still much more popular in rural America than he is elsewhere.

Since he took office, “I like him less, but I support him more,” said Robert Cody, 87, a retired chemical engineer from Bartlesville, Oklahoma who took the poll.

Cody said that Trump may rankle some people with the way he talks and tweets, but it is a small price to pay for a president who will fight to strip away government regulations and strengthen the border.

DROPPING OFF THE SCREEN

When Trump called the election a ”last shot“ for the struggling coal industry and when he called for protecting the nation’s southern border with a “big, fat, beautiful wall”, he was speaking directly to rural America, said David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University.

“Feelings of resentment and deprivation have pervaded a lot of these places,” Swenson said. “And here comes a candidate (Trump) who’s offering simplistic answers” to issues that concern them.

Rural Americans responded by supporting Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 26 percentage points during the election, an advantage that helped tip the balance in battleground states, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won by less than 1 percentage point.

But after 10 months, many are still waiting to see concrete changes that could make life easier in rural America, said Karl Stauber, who runs a private economic development agency serving a patchwork of manufacturing communities in south central Virginia.

“Rural people are more cynical about the federal government than people in general are,” Stauber said. “They’ve heard so many promises, and they’ve not seen much done.”

Despite all the talk of bringing manufacturing jobs back, Stauber said he has not seen any companies which have relocated to his region, or anyone expand their workforce, due to new federal policies.

“It just seems like we’ve dropped off the screen,” he said.

According to the poll, Trump’s overall popularity has dropped gradually, and for different reasons, this year.

Rural Americans were increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of healthcare in March and April after he lobbied for a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare and cut coverage for millions of Americans.

In May and June, they were more critical of Trump’s ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy, and they gave him lower marks for “the way he treats people like me.”

In August, they were increasingly unhappy with “the effort he’s making to unify the country” after he blamed “both sides” for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It asked people to rate the president’s performance and the results were filtered for people who lived in zip codes that fell within counties designated as “non-metro” by the federal government.

LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.

Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of hostile statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.

Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organization. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.

“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, said.

“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behavior. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”

Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.

“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.

Iran’s moderate president Hasan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticizing the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.

“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures,” he added.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”

The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.

But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s missile program and over allegations it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.

The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.

The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.

“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.

Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile program. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.

Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile program. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”. In an article published in the Atlantic on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles … unless it intends to attack our territory.”","Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-nuclear-usa-irgc/iran-hardliners-pragmatists-show-unity-in-response-to-trump-idUKKBN1CF0R1?il=0

(Reuters) - Firefighters battled 15 wildfires on Tuesday that have killed at least 11 people and destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses in Northern California while raging through the state’s world-famous wine country.

Efforts to control the fires were helped by the wind dying down on Monday, Brad Alexander, a spokesman for the governor’s Office of Emergency Services, said.

However, the death toll could still rise, he said.

Schools and colleges near the wildfires canceled Tuesday’s classes and two hospitals in Sonoma County were forced to evacuate, state officials said.

Related Coverage Ten people confirmed dead from northern California wildfires

About 1,500 homes and commercial buildings had been destroyed, Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said on Monday.

Much of the damage was in California’s wine country north of San Francisco. Sonoma County bore the brunt of the fatalities, with seven fire-related deaths confirmed there, according to the sheriff’s department. Two people died in Napa County and one in Mendocino County, officials said. An 11th death was reported in Yuba County, NBC News reported.

Some 20,000 people had been evacuated from their homes since Sunday, officials said, while CNN said more than 100 had been treated for fire-related injuries, including burns and smoke inhalation.

The 15 fires broke out during the weekend and were fanned by high temperatures and dry conditions. They spread across some 73,000 acres (29,542 hectares), fire officials said.

The largest fire, covering 42 square miles (109 square km) and 39 square miles (101 square km) respectively, struck in Napa and Sonoma counties. The status of the grape crop currently being harvested there was unclear.

In addition to potential damage to vineyards from fire itself, experts say sustained exposure to heavy smoke can taint unpicked grapes.

Fred Oliai, 47, owner of the Alta Napa Valley Winery, said winemakers were nervous.

“You can’t see anything,” he said in a telephone interview. “The smoke is very dense.” Oliai had not been able to get close enough to his vineyards to see if flames reached his 90-acre property. “We got our grapes in last week but others still have grapes hanging,” he said.

The move follows a similar one-year suspension in Finland in July to allow a new taxi law to come into effect, however there is no set date for when UberPOP will be reintroduced in Norway.

The U.S. ride-hailing company has come under fierce pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules.

UberPOP has already been suspended in several European capitals, including Paris and Brussels, and Uber was recently humbled when it lost its license to operate in London.

“We’ve learned the hard way that we must change as a company in order to serve the millions of riders and drivers who rely on us. With our new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi onboard, it’s a new era for Uber,” the company said in a statement.

“That’s why it’s now time to pause UberPOP in Norway, in order to relaunch under new regulations.”

UberPOP will be suspended on Oct. 30, while Uber’s licensed services UberBLACK and UberXXL will continue to operate as normal.

The Norwegian transport minister said Uber was being treated as any other market participant would be. “All actors offering taxi services must conform to rules and regulation at any time,” Ketil Solvik-Olsen told Reuters.

The suspension of UberPOP in Norway comes as the non-EU country must answer by Oct. 27 a query on its transport regulations by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA), the body that ensures EU regulations are enforced in countries that have access to the European common market.

Uber will suspend UberPOP three days after that deadline.

In February, ESA said Norway was setting “disproportionately high barriers to enter the taxi market” that led to inefficient use of resources and higher prices for consumers.

Khosrowshahi took the helm of Uber in August, replacing co-founder and former boss Travis Kalanick and has promised change at the $70 billion dollar firm.

The company said it was encouraged by developments in Norway such as the government’s sharing economy committee which recommended repealing certain provisions related to taxis and an opinion from the EFTA surveillance authority which said Norway’s restrictions on taxi licenses were illegal.

“Norway deserves modernized laws that encourage innovation and competition without sacrificing what makes the Norwegian model special,” Uber said. “We hope the government will implement these recommendations soon, so that we can relaunch a new and improved version of the product loved by so many.”

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - A produção de grãos e oleaginosas pelo Brasil na safra 2017/18 poderá cair até 6 por cento ante o ciclo anterior, refletindo a perspectiva de condições climáticas não tão favoráveis como aquelas da temporada 2016/17, projetou nesta terça-feira a Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (Conab).

Em seu primeiro levantamento para a nova safra, o órgão estimou que a produção varie de 224,17 milhões a 228,20 milhões de toneladas, queda de 6 a 4,3 por cento ante as 238,50 milhões de toneladas registradas em 2016/17.

“Condições climáticas altamente favoráveis contribuíram para a safra passada alcançar recorde histórico. Tais condições dificilmente se repetirão, por isso a expectativa de redução produtiva”, resumiu a Conab.

Com efeito, a companhia projeta uma queda de produtividade média de 4 por cento para as culturas de verão e de inverno, atenuando as projeções para a área plantada, que deve se manter em 60,88 milhões de hectares ou aumentar em 1,8 por cento, para 62 milhões de hectares, graças ao incremento no plantio de algodão e, sobretudo, de soja.

“A produtividade deve sofrer redução para praticamente todas as culturas”, disse a Conab.

SOJA E MILHO

Conforme a Conab, soja e milho continuam como as principais culturas e devem responder por cerca de 89 por cento do total produzido no país.

A expectativa é de que a produção de soja alcance entre 106 milhões e 108 milhões de toneladas, queda de 7,1 por cento ou de 5,1 por cento em relação a 2016/17, quando o Brasil colheu um recorde de 114,07 milhões de toneladas.

A área plantada com a oleaginosa deve alcançar um novo recorde e deve variar de 34,46 milhões a 35,20 milhões de hectares, avanço de 1,6 ou de 3,8 por cento sobre 2016/17.

Os números de produção de soja informados pela Conab são inferiores ante a média de uma pesquisa da Reuters com consultorias e instituições do mercado, mas as projeções para a área acompanham o levantamento realizado na semana passada.

Quanto ao milho, a Conab prevê uma produção total de até 93,60 milhões de toneladas, queda de 4,3 por cento, sendo 26,43 milhões de toneladas para a primeira safra, colhida no verão, e as outras 67,17 milhões de toneladas para a “safrinha”, cuja colheita se dá no inverno.

Já a área total com milho deve alcançar até 17,25 milhões de hectares, recuo de 1,9 por cento, dos quais 5,14 milhões de hectares na primeira safra e 12,10 milhões de hectares na “safrinha”.

Na pesquisa da Reuters, os especialistas projetaram, em média, uma produção de 26,66 milhões de toneladas de milho na primeira safra, com área de 5,27 milhões de hectares.

“A área para milho primeira safra, que sofre a concorrência do cultivo de soja, deve ser reduzida entre 10,1 por cento a 6,1 por cento em relação a 2016/2017...Já a soja, que vem oferecendo maior liquidez e possibilidade de melhor rentabilidade frente a outras culturas, deve alcançar maior área para produção, com um incremento médio de cerca de 2,7 por cento comparado à safra passada”, destacou a Conab.","Safra 2017/18 do Brasil deve cair com clima menos favorável, diz Conab",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CF1I9-OBRBS

(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

London (Reuters) - Als Alternative zu einem Freihandelsabkommen mit der Europäischen Union nach dem Brexit erwägt die britische Regierung einem Zeitungsbericht zufolge den Beitritt zum Nafta-Handelsvertrag.

Minister der Regierung würden die Möglichkeit prüfen, sich dem Abkommen der USA, Kanadas und Mexikos anzuschließen, berichtete der “Daily Telegraph” am Dienstag. Die Erwägung gelte für den Fall, dass die Gespräche über ein Freihandelsabkommen mit der EU scheitern sollten. Die britische Regierung peilt das Abkommen im Anschluss an den Brexit an, um die heimische Wirtschaft nach dem EU-Austritt 2019 nicht vom Rest der EU abzuschneiden.

Das Freihandelsabkommen Nafta wurde 1994 zwischen den USA, Kanada und Mexiko geschlossen. Der Vertrag wird derzeit überarbeitet. US-Präsident Donald Trump hat mit dem Austritt aus der Vereinbarung gedroht, weil er darin Nachteile für sein Land sieht. Der kanadische Ministerpräsident Justin Trudeau berät mit Trump am Mittwoch in Washington über das Abkommen. In der Nähe der US-Hauptstadt soll zugleich die vierte Verhandlungsrunde zwischen den drei Nafta-Staaten beginnen.

Auch diesseits des Atlantiks sind künftige Handelsbeziehungen ein Streitthema. Die EU will über das von der britischen Regierung angestrebte Freihandelsabkommen erst dann verhandeln, wenn bei den Brexit-Scheidungsgesprächen ausreichend Fortschritte erzielt wurden. Beim EU-Gipfel kommende Woche soll darüber beraten werden, ob dies der Fall ist. Zuletzt äußerten sich EU-Unterhändler skeptisch, da mehrere Verhandlungsrunden in Brüssel bisher nur wenig greifbare Ergebnisse hervorgebracht haben. Die britische Premierministerin Theresa May erwartet einen Abschluss der Brexit-Gespräche erst kurz vor dem EU-Austritt ihres Landes im März 2019. Dem Vertrag müssen vor dem Inkrafttreten alle 28 beteiligten Staaten sowie das EU-Parlament zustimmen.

Trotz der unsicheren Lage will die Mehrheit der Briten einer Umfrage zufolge, dass May zumindest bis zum Abschluss der Austritts-Verhandlungen im Amt bleibt. 57 Prozent der Befragten sind dieser Ansicht, wie aus einer Erhebung des ORB-Instituts für den “Telegraph” hervorgeht. Nur jeder fünfte Befragte hielt demnach Außenminister Boris Johnson für besser geeignet. Das Institut befragte mehr als 2000 Wähler am vergangenen Wochenende.

The animals are fitted with infrared bio-sensors which monitor their heartbeat and movement. Data is analyzed by a computer, and any changes in the animals’ body or behavior flags a change in the purity levels of the water in its tank.

“When three or more crayfish are moving or change their pulse activity, we know that the water parameters have changed. We can react quickly because we have the result within three minutes,” head brewer Michal Voldrich told Reuters.

The water system was developed and patented by scientists at the Faculty of Fisheries and Protection of Water at South Bohemia University at Vodnany.

“We are using crayfish like a living chemical laboratory – like a bio indicator and bio sensor together,” said Pavel Kozak, Director of the university’s Research Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology.

“The crayfish react very fast on any non-specific change, which is different than any other detectors, which react fast on a very low concentration (of pollution) but only on one specific agent.”

Researchers aim to upgrade the technology used in the scheme, and plan to use special cameras to monitor the animals’ hearts.

Barcelona/Madrid (Reuters) - Countdown in Katalonien: In Europa steigt wegen der möglichen Unabhängigkeitserklärung der spanischen Provinz die Nervosität.

Die EU-Kommission rief am Dienstag kurz vor der angekündigten Erklärung des Chefs der katalanischen Regionalregierung, Carles Puigdemont, beide Seiten zu Gesprächen auf. “Wir appellieren an alle Beteiligten, die Konfrontation so schnell wie möglich zu beenden und einen Dialog zu starten”, sagte ein Kommissionssprecher in Brüssel. In Madrid ließ Regierungschef Mariano Rajoy ankündigen, er werde am Mittwoch vor dem spanischen Parlament seine Entgegnung auf Puigdemont geben.

Der katalanische Regierungschef wollte am Dienstagabend das weitere Vorgehen nach dem Unabhängigkeitsreferendum am 1. Oktober darlegen. Dabei könnte es im Regionalparlament in Barcelona zur Proklamation der Unabhängigkeit Kataloniens kommen. Rajoy hat mehrmals betont, eine Loslösung der wohlhabenden Region im Nordosten Spaniens nicht zu akzeptieren.

“Gewalt kann (...) niemals ein Mittel der Politik sein”, sagte der EU-Sprecher. Er bekräftigte, die EU vertraue voll und ganz in die Fähigkeiten von Rajoy, die Krise im Einklang mit der spanischen Verfassung und den Bürgerrechten zu lösen. Bereits am Montagabend hatte auch die Bürgermeisterin von Barcelona, Ada Colau, an Puigdemont appelliert, nicht die Unabhängigkeit auszurufen. Gleichzeitig forderte sie Rajoy auf, nicht unter Berufung auf den Verfassungsartikel 155 die Regionalregierung zu entmachten. Es müsse Zeit für Verhandlungen gewonnen werden.

REGIONALREGIERUNG WIRFT MADRID KAMPAGNE VOR

Die Regierungen in Madrid und Barcelona standen sich trotz der Gesprächs-Appelle weiter unversöhnlich gegenüber. Der spanische Wirtschaftsminister Luis de Guindos erklärte, alle konservativen Regierungen in Europa hätten sich hinter Rajoy gestellt. Er sei sicher, dass auch Sozialisten und Liberale in der EU eine Abspaltung Kataloniens ablehnten. Dagegen warf der Sprecher der Regionalregierung der Zentralregierung vor, Druck auf Unternehmen auszuüben, damit diese Standorte aus Katalonien in andere Teile Spaniens verlegten. Zudem hielt er dem Kabinett Rajoy vor, eine Kampagne gegen die katalanische Polizei zu betreiben. Deren Chef wird Beteiligung an einer Revolte vorgeworfen, weil er Maßnahmen gegen die Beteiligten am Unabhängigkeitsreferendum nicht unterstützt habe. Das spanische Verfassungsgericht hatte die Abstimmung für illegal erklärt.

STARKE EINSATZKRÄFTE SICHERN KATALANISCHES PARLAMENT

In Barcelona wurden am Dienstag vor Beginn der Sitzung des Regionalparlaments starke Sicherheitskräfte zusammengezogen. Die Umgebung wurde für den Verkehr gesperrt. In Medien wurde spekuliert, Puigdemont werde eine Art aufgeschobene Unabhängigkeit verkünden, um Spielraum für Verhandlungen zu gewinnen. Der Chef der Regionalregierung hatte sich in den vergangenen Tagen intensiv um eine internationale Vermittlung bemüht, sich aber nur Absagen eingehandelt. So erklärte die EU mehrmals, der Streit sei eine innerspanische Angelegenheit und müsse auch dort gelöst werden.

Puigdemont beruft sich auf den Ausgang des Referendums vor gut einer Woche. Etwa 90 Prozent hatten für die Unabhängigkeit gestimmt. Allerdings lag die Wahlbeteiligung nur bei 43 Prozent. Viele Unabhängigkeitsgegner blieben den Wahlurnen fern. Zudem hatten zuletzt die Gegner der Unabhängigkeit mobilisiert. Am Wochenende demonstrierten Hunderttausende Menschen gegen eine Loslösung Kataloniens von Spanien.

RAJOY STELLT VORBEDINGUNGEN FÜR GESPRÄCHE

Rajoy hat bislang eine internationale Vermittlung, zu der beispielsweise die Schweiz bereit wäre, abgelehnt. Er fordert als Vorbedingung für Gespräche den Verzicht auf die Ausrufung der Unabhängigkeit. Erst dann könne etwa über eine Besserstellung Kataloniens im Interessensausgleich zwischen den spanischen Regionen und der Zentralregierung gesprochen werden.

Im Ausland wird die Entwicklung aufmerksam beobachtet. Spanien ist die viertstärkste Wirtschaft der Euro-Zone.

LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.

Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of hostile statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.

Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organization. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.

“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, said.

“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behavior. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”

Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.

“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.

Iran’s moderate president Hasan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticizing the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.

“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures,” he added.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”

The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.

But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s missile program and over allegations it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.

The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.

The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.

“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.

Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile program. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.

Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile program. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”. In an article published in the Atlantic on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles … unless it intends to attack our territory.”","Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump",https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-usa-irgc/iran-hardliners-pragmatists-show-unity-in-response-to-trump-idINKBN1CF0QV?il=0

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares ground out a fresh record high on Tuesday, making it almost 50 for the year, although Europe traded cautiously as markets waited to see whether Spain’s Catalonia region would push for independence later in the day.

Japan and South Korea returned from extended breaks to give Asia a lift a Wall Street looked set to open higher, [.N] but the Catalan uncertainty meant the euro zone’s main bourses [.EU] and Spanish bond markets spent the day in the red.

Catalonia’s secessionist leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the region’s parliament in Barcelona around 1600 GMT and could ask the assembly to vote on a unilateral declaration of independence from Madrid.

It is Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and Madrid’s IBEX stocks index was 1 percent lower in early afternoon trade. It is now down almost 9 percent since May, though a sharp rise in the euro has also taken a toll.

“We have not witnessed any relevant statement or signal by the separatists that would hint at a change of strategy ahead of today’s discussion in the Catalonian parliament,” economists at Barclays wrote.

“Consequently, at this point, it seems likely that Catalan President Carles Puigdemont remains on track to announce a unilateral declaration of independence as early as today.”

The euro remained resilient. It hopped to a one-week high of almost $1.18 as data showed German exports surged in August. Traders were also still upbeat after one of the European Central Bank’s German policymakers called for an end to its stimulus.

There was also help from a weaker dollar which was down for a third straight day. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, dropped 0.3 percent to 93.366 and away from Friday’s almost 3-month peak.

It gave the Turkish lira a breather after it had been sent sprawling to a nine-month low on Monday after the United States and Turkey scaled back visa services.

Mexico’s peso hovered at its weakest in more than four months too, ahead of the latest round of talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Wednesday.

“Mexican asset prices have been very well supported this year so we think there needs to be a little bit of caution,” said UBP’s EM macro and FX strategist Koon Chow.

“There is not much of a cushion for bad news now and NAFTA talks are unlikely to bring any good news.”

KOREA PATH

Futures markets pointed to Wall Street breaking a two-day run of falls with the third quarter earning season now gathering steam. [.N]

Bond markets, meanwhile, were waiting to see if 10-year Treasuries would get above 2.4 percent ahead of another Fed rate hike that is now seen as almost nailed on for December.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari and his Dallas counterpart, Robert Kaplan, are due to make speeches later ahead of the minutes from the Fed’s September meeting, which will be published on Wednesday.

Overnight, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had climbed 0.6 percent, boosted by a 1.6 percent jump in Korea as shares of firms such as Samsung which have been closed for the past week, caught up with some of the global rally.

Japan’s Nikkei brushed off a weak start to finish 0.6 percent higher too, though China stocks dipped as investors cashed in some of the gains that took them to a 21-month high in the previous session. [.SS]

China’s Statistics Bureau on Tuesday said the country would have no problem meeting its economic growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, and might even beat it. Such an outcome had been widely expected after a robust start to the year.

The offshore Chinese yuan rate surged to its strongest level in more than two weeks. The central bank had also set a firmer-than-expected official rate, suggesting authorities are keen to keep the currency in check ahead of next week’s key national leadership meeting.

The stocks gains came in spite of tensions on the Korean peninsula. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Monday that any further escalation of the situation was unacceptable.

China had also called for restraint. U.S. President Donald Trump warned over the weekend that “only one thing will work” in dealing with Pyongyang, hinting that military action was on his mind.

In commodities, Brent oil prices pushed back above $56 a barrel after top producer Saudi Arabia signaled it would trim its exports and as OPEC flagged ongoing efforts to try to restore the longer-term “balance” of the market.

Brent jumped 50 cents to $56.31 a barrel, while a 54 cents rise took U.S. crude back to $50 a barrel.

“The kingdom expects all other participants in the (agreement) to follow suit and to maintain the high levels of overall conformity,” a Saudi oil Ministry spokesman said.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Tuesday it had received formal approval to start a C$500 million production unit in Canada and sought to quell talk that it had asked for special tax benefits for investing in its first such unit outside the United States.

The maker of Emmy-winning shows such as The Crown and Black Mirror said last month it was in talks with the Canadian government for an investment over a minimum of five years.

That decision was part of a broad review under Canadian Heritage Minister Melanie Joly, which included plans to modernize funding programs and review copyright, broadcasting and telecommunications legislation.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany may need to wait until next year for a new government as the three blocs trying to form an alliance are so far apart they need a detailed coalition deal, a senior Bavarian ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel has told Reuters.

Alexander Dobrindt, parliamentary floor leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), said a coalition agreement would have to be more detailed than the one that accompanied the Grand Coalition in the last parliament.

Merkel, humbled in last month’s national election by a surging far-right, is trying to broker a three-way coalition of her conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens - a combination previously untested at federal level.

The task is further complicated by the fact that Merkel’s conservative bloc compromises her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and CSU, whose alliance has been strained by her open-door migrants policy.

The conservative allies removed one obstacle to forming a new coalition on Sunday by agreeing a limit on the number of migrants arriving in Germany. But Dobrindt of the CSU said in an interview with Reuters television that securing a three-way alliance would be hard.

“As we know that the points that separate us outweigh those we have in common, one can have doubts about whether a coalition agreement is possible this year,” Dobrindt said.

“It is conceivable that we can’t complete in December and that final talks - if there even are any - will only possible next year,” he added.

The three-way tie-up - dubbed a “Jamaica” coalition after the black, green and yellow colors of the three party blocs, which match the Caribbean island’s flag - is Merkel’s only realistic option of forming a government.

The center-left Social Democrats, her previous partners in a the Grand Coalition, insist they want to go into opposition.

A Jamaica coalition was formed in the tiny western state of Saarland in October 2009, but collapsed in January 2012. The same formation took power in the far northern region of Schleswig-Holstein after elections there in May this year.

BIG DIFFERENCES

At a national level, the three party groups have deep differences on issues ranging from migration to European Union reform, tax and the environment. Dobrindt said this meant they would have to nail down a detailed agreement.

Slideshow (4 Images)

“We need, in a possible Jamaica coalition agreement, a significantly higher level of detail than was the case with the grand coalition,” he said. “The differences between the parties are big, so the agreements need to go deeper.”

In their compromise struck on Sunday, the CDU and CSU agreed to limit to 200,000 the number of people Germany would accept per year on humanitarian grounds.

The FDP and Greens insist the conservatives’ agreement cannot simply be copied into a coalition deal.

But Dobrindt, whose CSU is worried about losing its regional dominance in a Bavarian state election next year, said the allies’ accord must be reflected in a coalition deal.

“The regulations we have made in our joint paper - ‘Rules on Migration’ - are of course an essential part of the negotiations and must also be found in a coalition agreement,” he said.

The intransigence of the CSU, the Greens and the FDP on the migrants issue points to difficult coalition talks that risk clouding the political outlook in Germany, which has been a source of stability in Europe during Merkel’s 12 years in power.

“We want Europe to concentrate more on the big tasks and less on the small tasks,” Dobrindt said. “That means we must talk about bringing back responsibilities from Brussels to Germany - and the details of that will no doubt be difficult.”",Germany may not agree new coalition until next year: Merkel ally,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics/germany-may-not-agree-new-coalition-until-next-year-merkel-ally-idUSKBN1CF1NP?il=0

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The IMF upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage points to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

Forecasts for euro zone, Japan, China, emerging market Europe and Russia were all revised upwards.

The growth outlook in the United States was unchanged from the Fund’s July report at 2.2 percent for this year and 2.3 percent in 2018, as expected tax cuts under President Trump’s administration have not yet materialized.

The U.S. outlook for 2017 had been cut by 0.1 percentage points, and its 2018 forecast had been cut by 0.2 percentage points in the Fund’s April report, but then revised upwards in July by the same amounts.

“Given the significant policy uncertainty, IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecast now uses a baseline assumption of unchanged policies, whereas the April 2017 WEO (World Economic Outlook) built in a fiscal stimulus from anticipated tax cuts,” the Fund said in its revisions to its U.S. economic forecasts.

The U.S. Republican party has presented three tax proposals since Trump took office in January and the latest effort by the Trump administration is already mired in political disagreements in Congress.

The Fund said that over the longer term, U.S. economic growth would moderate due to sluggish productivity growth and changing demographics. It said the economy’s potential growth rate was just 1.8 percent, far lower than the 3.0 percent or more being targeted by Trump and his administration.

EURO ZONE RECOVERY

Economic growth in the euro zone was revised upwards from the July forecast by 0.2 percentage points for both 2017 and 2018 to 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent respectively, reflecting an export revival, stronger domestic demand due to accommodative financial conditions and a lowering of political risk.

The report pre-dated unrest in the Catalonia region of Spain.

The Fund cautioned that euro zone growth would remain under pressure due to weak productivity, an ageing population and, in some countries, high debt.

Economic growth in Britain for 2017 had already been revised sharply lower by the Fund to 1.7 percent in the wake of the country’s vote to leave the European Union and so-far inconclusive talks on Brexit.

The Fund had already cut its 2017 forecast by 0.3 percentage points in July from April and left its latest forecast unchanged.

Since its 2016 Brexit vote, Britain has gone from being one of the fastest growing economies in the Group of Seven rich nations to one of the slowest, with only Japan and Italy forecast to grow more slowly than the 1.5 percent forecast for Britain in 2018.

The Fund upgraded its growth rates for China all the way through 2022, on the assumption that authorities in Beijing will maintain expansionary policies. The Fund forecast 6.8 percent growth for this year and 6.5 percent for next, both upward revisions of 0.1 percentage points from July.

Looking forward, the Fund warned that potential major disruptions to its global outlook could come from “difficult-to-predict” U.S. regulatory, trade and fiscal policies, and from disruptions relating to Britain’s exit from the European Union, as well from central banks raising interest rates too quickly.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is now well into a cycle of interest rate rises that began in late 2015, although the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have yet to move away from negative rates and bond buying.

“In advanced economies, monetary policy settings should remain accommodative until there are firm signs of inflation returning to targets...(as) still-subdued wage pressures mostly reflect remaining slack, not fully captured by headline unemployment rates,” the Fund said.","World economic growth improving, even as U.S., UK potential slows: IMF",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-imf-g20-outlook/world-economic-growth-improving-even-as-u-s-uk-potential-slows-imf-idUKKBN1CF1OR

PARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics. Several firms have cut back space and host planemaker Airbus is halving staff attendance and slashing catering, insiders said.",Jetmakers hunt for new growth as order binge fizzles out,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airshow-paris/jetmakers-hunt-for-new-growth-as-order-binge-fizzles-out-idUSKBN1961WV

LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.

Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of hostile statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.

Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organization. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.

“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, said.

“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behavior. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”

Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.

“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.

Iran’s moderate president Hasan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticizing the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.

“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures,” he added.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”

The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.

But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s missile program and over allegations it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.

The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.

The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.

“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.

Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile program. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.

Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile program. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”. In an article published in the Atlantic on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles … unless it intends to attack our territory.”","Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CF0R1

(Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N) said on Tuesday it was considering the sale or spin-off of its consumer healthcare business, shaking up the industry and potentially putting a headache pill to lip balm operation worth as much as $14 billion up for grabs.

The move comes as Germany’s Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) is also looking to divest its non-prescription products, including brands such as Seven Seas vitamins, which could be worth around $4.5 billion.

As ageing populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication, the fragmented consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal-making in recent years.

Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very long-lasting brands with loyal customers.

Pfizer’s consumer healthcare business, whose brands include painkiller Advil and lip balm Chapstick, had revenue of about $3.4 billion in 2016. Industry experts said it could fetch around four times sales, implying a potential value of up $14 billion.

Pfizer, which saw its shares rise about 1 percent at $36.50 in premarket trading, said it would decide on the future of its consumer unit during 2018.

Reuters first reported last November that a divestment of the Pfizer consumer business was under consideration.

Established consumer health companies that might be interested in the Pfizer assets include Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Abbott (ABT.N).

They could be potentially be joined by non-traditional players such as Nestle (NESN.S), which is exploring the boundaries of food and healthcare. One person familiar with the matter said Pfizer expected a “broadening” of buyer interest.

Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Sanofi (SASY.PA) may be less likely to bid, despite their consumer health presence, given they are busy absorbing Monsanto (MON.N) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s consumer business respectively.

In explaining the thinking behind the review, Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said consumer healthcare was connected but not integral to its core prescription drug business.

“Although there is a strong connection between consumer healthcare and elements of our core biopharmaceutical businesses, it is also distinct enough from our core business that there is potential for its value to be more fully realized outside the company,” he said.

Options to be considered include a full or partial separation of the unit through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. Pfizer may also ultimately decide to keep the business.

The Pfizer business includes two of the 10 top-selling consumer healthcare brands globally in Advil and the multivitamin line Centrum. It also has 10 brands that each exceeded $100 million in 2016 sales.

A Pfizer exit from the consumer health business would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a $160 billion deal to buy Allergan (AGN.N) last year.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York’s Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

The IMF upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage points to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

Forecasts for euro zone, Japan, China, emerging market Europe and Russia were all revised upwards.

The growth outlook in the United States was unchanged from the Fund’s July report at 2.2 percent for this year and 2.3 percent in 2018, as expected tax cuts under President Trump’s administration have not yet materialized.

The U.S. outlook for 2017 had been cut by 0.1 percentage points, and its 2018 forecast had been cut by 0.2 percentage points in the Fund’s April report, but then revised upwards in July by the same amounts.

“Given the significant policy uncertainty, IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecast now uses a baseline assumption of unchanged policies, whereas the April 2017 WEO (World Economic Outlook) built in a fiscal stimulus from anticipated tax cuts,” the Fund said in its revisions to its U.S. economic forecasts.

The U.S. Republican party has presented three tax proposals since Trump took office in January and the latest effort by the Trump administration is already mired in political disagreements in Congress.

The Fund said that over the longer term, U.S. economic growth would moderate due to sluggish productivity growth and changing demographics. It said the economy’s potential growth rate was just 1.8 percent, far lower than the 3.0 percent or more being targeted by Trump and his administration.

EURO ZONE RECOVERY

Economic growth in the euro zone was revised upwards from the July forecast by 0.2 percentage points for both 2017 and 2018 to 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent respectively, reflecting an export revival, stronger domestic demand due to accommodative financial conditions and a lowering of political risk.

The report pre-dated unrest in the Catalonia region of Spain.

The Fund cautioned that euro zone growth would remain under pressure due to weak productivity, an ageing population and, in some countries, high debt.

Economic growth in Britain for 2017 had already been revised sharply lower by the Fund to 1.7 percent in the wake of the country’s vote to leave the European Union and so-far inconclusive talks on Brexit.

The Fund had already cut its 2017 forecast by 0.3 percentage points in July from April and left its latest forecast unchanged.

Since its 2016 Brexit vote, Britain has gone from being one of the fastest growing economies in the Group of Seven rich nations to one of the slowest, with only Japan and Italy forecast to grow more slowly than the 1.5 percent forecast for Britain in 2018.

The Fund upgraded its growth rates for China all the way through 2022, on the assumption that authorities in Beijing will maintain expansionary policies. The Fund forecast 6.8 percent growth for this year and 6.5 percent for next, both upward revisions of 0.1 percentage points from July.

Looking forward, the Fund warned that potential major disruptions to its global outlook could come from “difficult-to-predict” U.S. regulatory, trade and fiscal policies, and from disruptions relating to Britain’s exit from the European Union, as well from central banks raising interest rates too quickly.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is now well into a cycle of interest rate rises that began in late 2015, although the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have yet to move away from negative rates and bond buying.

“In advanced economies, monetary policy settings should remain accommodative until there are firm signs of inflation returning to targets...(as) still-subdued wage pressures mostly reflect remaining slack, not fully captured by headline unemployment rates,” the Fund said.","World economic growth improving, even as U.S., UK potential slows: IMF",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-g20-outlook/world-economic-growth-improving-even-as-u-s-uk-potential-slows-imf-idINKBN1CF1OV?il=0

Na comparação com as contas feitas em julho, o FMI aumentou a expectativa para o PIB brasileiro em 0,4 e 0,2 ponto percentual para 2017 e 2018, respectivamente. Neste ano, a melhora veio pelo bom desempenho da safra agrícola recorde e pela melhora do consumo.

“A gradual restauração da confiança, assim que as principais reformas que garantem a sustentabilidade fiscal forem implementadas ao longo do tempo, vão elevar o crescimento econômico a 2 por cento a médio prazo”, informou o FMI em relatório.

A previsão do FMI para o desempenho do PIB neste ano está bastante próxima da leitura feita por bancos e consultorias, mas a expectativa para o ano que vem é mais pessimista. No relatório Focus do Banco Central, que ouve uma centena de analistas todas as semanas, a projeção é de crescimento de 0,7 por cento para este ano e de 2,43 por cento em 2018.

Na comparação com o desempenho dos países emergentes, o resultado do Brasil será ainda mais pífio. O FMI projeta crescimento de 4,6 por cento em 2017 para esse grupo e de 4,9 por cento em 2018.

Já a economia global como um todo, ainda segundo as contas do FMI, deve crescer 3,6 e 3,7 por cento em 2017 e 2018, respectivamente. Em ambos os casos, as contas vieram agora 0,1 ponto percentual maiores do que o levantamento de julho passado.","Brasil crescerá menos do que os países da América Latina em 2017 e 2018, diz FMI",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CF1NW-OBRTP

OTTAWA (Reuters) - When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets President Donald Trump on Wednesday, he will try to persuade the U.S. leader to focus on Mexico as a source of potential problems at talks to update NAFTA.

Although Trudeau officials were confident Trump would mostly target Mexico as the three nations started to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, Washington has slapped duties on Canadian Bombardier airliners and lumber exports in recent months and talked tough on dairy and wine.

Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Trudeau would “explain really clearly to the President ... that Canada is not America’s problem”.

Freeland, who says Canada buys more from the United States than China, Britain and Japan combined, told CTV television on Sunday that Trudeau’s message to Trump at their White House meeting would be “We are your biggest client.”

Trump has threatened to scrap the 1994 pact unless changes are made to address issues such as a $64 billion deficit with Mexico. Negotiators start the fourth of seven planned rounds of talks near Washington on Wednesday.

Freeland describes the U.S. administration as the most protectionist since the 1930s while noting the United States runs a surplus in the trade of goods and services with Canada.

Canada has so far shunned confrontation with Washington, stressing instead the merits of NAFTA and free trade. By no means everyone south of the border is convinced.

Chris Sands, a professor at the Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said Canada’s problems marked “a new era of tough love” with Washington.

“It turns out Trump is an economic nationalist ... and it’s come as a bit of a surprise to the Canadians that they have been so much on the hot seat,” he said.

Donald Trump mentioned Afghanistan just once in his speech to the United Nations Tuesday. His “new strategy for victory” there, he said, would help “crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.”

Trump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.

That was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.

Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.

“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”

Iran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.

In a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi's foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.

Perhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.

Intriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.

The catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.

Trump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.

Sixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.",Commentary: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afghanistan-commentary/commentary-the-real-deal-trump-has-to-make-on-afghanistan-idUSKCN1BV28K

Groundbreaking on homes edged slightly lower in September to 217,118 units from August’s upwardly revised 225,918 as a 10.7 percent drop in multiple starts, typically condos, outweighed an 8.2 percent climb in single starts, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation said.

Analysts had expected starts to cool to a 210,000 annual rate but construction continued to defy expectations for a pullback after a near decade-long boom.

“Canadian homebuilding activity remains robust, with the best population growth in 25 years proving fundamental support. And, after declining modestly in the second quarter, residential investment looks to have added to growth again in the third quarter,” BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic wrote in a client note.

Canada’s long housing boom has shown signs of cooling, particularly in the nation’s largest city, Toronto, where the introduction in April of a foreign buyers tax has doused sales and ended many of the bidding wars that had become a hallmark of the city’s overheated market.

A separate report from Statistics Canada showed the value of Canadian building permits fell more than expected in August, the second straight monthly decrease, on lower construction intentions for multifamily homes as well as industrial facilities.

The 5.5 percent decrease in total building permits surpassed forecasts for a decline of 1.0 percent and suggested that the building boom will slow in the months ahead. July figures were revised to show a decrease of 2.8 percent from the previously reported 3.5 percent fall.

“Despite the drop (in housing starts) in September, Canadian residential construction remains at a level that is higher than demographic needs,” said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial, estimating that a 190,000 pace of starts would meet demographic needs.

“Based on declining permit applications, a moderation is in the cards for residential construction in the last quarter of 2017,” he added in a research note.

Nonresidential building permits fell 10.0 percent in August as construction intentions for industrial, commercial and institutional buildings all declined.

As Hollywood moved to distance itself from Weinstein, Streep said she had been appalled by the claims made against the film studio executive she once likened to “God” in a 2012 awards speech.

His “behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,” Streep said a statement.

Britain’s Dench, who won a supporting actress Oscar in 1999 for the Weinstein-produced film “Shakespeare in Love,” said in a statement she was “completely unaware of these offences, which are of course horrifying.”

Stars like Streep and Dench, whose movies had been championed by Weinstein, have been under pressure to speak out after a New York Times investigation last week detailed claims by multiple women of unwanted physical contact by Weinstein over three decades.

Weinstein, 65, initially apologized but later threatened to sue over the allegations uncovered by the newspaper. He has not been charged with any crimes but was fired on Sunday as co-chairman of the Weinstein amid fallout from the Times story.

In a statement to the Huffington Post, Streep said she had been unaware of claims that Weinstein undressed in front of actresses and assistants and asked young women to give him massages.

“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed,” Streep said.

Producer and director Kevin Smith said on Monday he regretted taking money from Weinstein’s production company.

“He financed the first 14 years of my career - and now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed,” Smith, known for the comedies “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back” and “Clerks,” wrote on Twitter.

Actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan have said Weinstein sexually harassed them and movie director Judd Apatow and producer Megan Ellison are among those have spoken out in support of them.

Weinstein is the latest U.S. media or entertainment industry titan to face sexual harassment accusations. At Fox News, late Chief Executive Officer Roger Ailes was forced out in 2016 and anchor Bill O‘Reilly resigned in April after similar claims.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose to above $56 a barrel on Tuesday, supported by Saudi Arabian export cuts in November and comments from OPEC and trading companies that the market is rebalancing after years of oversupply.

Saudi Arabia has cut November allocations by 560,000 barrels per day (bpd), in line with its commitment to an OPEC-led supply reduction pact. In the United States, some production remains offline following Hurricane Nate, lending additional support.

“Prices have been boosted by news that Saudi Arabia is planning to reduce its oil shipments to customers in November,” said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

Brent crude LCOc1, the international price benchmark, was up 80 cents at $56.59 a barrel at 1326 GMT. U.S. crude gained 97 cents to $50.55.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-member producers are cutting output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until next March to get rid of a price-sapping supply glut.

OPEC is increasingly confident that the market is rebalancing fast, helped by the cutback as well as by stronger-than-expected growth in global demand.

The chief executive of trading firm Gunvor, Torbjorn Tornqvist, also said the market was rebalancing, citing falling product stocks and crude held in floating storage clearing up.

“We don’t see this market being out of balance one way or another,” he told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit taking place this week. Overall crude stocks “are still high,” he added, and OPEC needed to stick to its output curbs.

Short-term price support was coming from the United States, where 85 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production, or 1.49 million bpd, was offline following Hurricane Nate, according to official figures.

OPEC has managed record-high adherence to its supply cutting deal this year and is considering extending the deal beyond its March 2018 expiry. Some analysts have been concerned that a price recovery could tempt producers to open the taps again.

But analysts at JP Morgan said this was less of an issue, saying “concerns that OPEC compliance would fade into the fourth quarter now appear unfounded.”

“Stronger-than-assumed economic growth offers the potential for tight market conditions to continue if OPEC extends the current deal for another nine months,” the bank said.",Oil rises above $56 on Saudi export cut,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-oil/oil-rises-above-56-on-saudi-export-cut-idUKKBN1CF044?il=0

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia plans to reduce up to 310 jobs from its Nokia Technologies unit and halt development of its virtual reality camera “OZO” and hardware, the Finnish company said on Tuesday.

The unit has about 1,090 employees and the potential cuts are expected to affect staff in Finland, the United States and Britain. Nokia employed about 102,000 employees as of end-June.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Tuesday it had received formal approval to start a C$500 million production unit in Canada and sought to quell talk that it had asked for special tax benefits for investing in its first such unit outside the United States.

The maker of Emmy-winning shows such as The Crown and Black Mirror said last month it was in talks with the Canadian government for an investment over a minimum of five years.

That decision was part of a broad review under Canadian Heritage Minister Melanie Joly, which included plans to modernize funding programs and review copyright, broadcasting and telecommunications legislation.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will meet Myanmar’s top Buddhist monks, its military generals and civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in November when he visits that country and Bangladesh, both caught up in a crisis over the Rohingya Muslim minority.

According to a full program of the Nov. 26-Dec. 2 trip released by the Vatican on Tuesday, the pope will say two Masses in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and one in Bangladesh, which is predominantly Muslim.

Francis will be the first pope to visit Myanmar and the second to visit Bangladesh, where Pope John Paul visited in 1986.

The pope arrives in Yangon, the country’s largest city, on Nov. 27 after a flight of more than 10 hours and is scheduled to rest for about 24 hours before heading to the country’s capital Naypyitaw for a day.

There, he will have separate private talks with President Htin Kyaw and Suu Kyi, who is both State Counsellor and Foreign Minister, making her effectively the country’s civilian leader.

A senior Vatican official said military leaders are expected to attend a separate, public meeting where the pope will address politicians and diplomats. This is where he is expected to give the keynote speech of the trip.

Myanmar is facing international scrutiny over the plight of its Rohingya community. In February, Francis said they had been tortured and killed simply because they wanted to live their culture and Muslim faith.

Last August, some hard-line Buddhists were riled with the pope spoke about “the persecution of our Rohingya brothers and sisters” and asked Catholics to pray for them, adding that they should be given “their full rights”.

On Nov. 29, the pope will address the Sangha Maha Nayaka, the country’s highest Buddhist authority, which is a government-backed panel of senior monks responsible for regulating the Buddhist clergy.

The United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday that Bangladesh border guards reported more than 11,000 Rohingya refugees crossing into their country from Myanmar on Monday alone..

The government offensive has drawn international condemnation and U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing, which the government denies.

There are about 700,000 Roman Catholics in Myanmar according to the country’s cardinal, Charles Maung Bo, out of a population of about 51.4 million.

Catholics make up a tiny minority in Bangladesh. Francis will be the second pope to visit that country, after Pope John Paul in 1986.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co and Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] have led a $100 million investment in Bill.com, a Palo Alto, California-based company that helps business digitize their payments.

The round, which included participation from existing investors, will be used by the company to expand its distribution, Bill.com said on Tuesday.

The investment comes after the company revealed last month that it had partnered with JPMorgan to help its business clients make and receive payments electronically.

Bill.com, which runs a large business payment network in the United States, is among the cohort of young technology companies that are seeking to help modernize financial services by making better use of technology.

Business-to-business payments in the United States have been particularly slow to adapt to new digital technologies.

Roughly 80 percent of all payments made by U.S. businesses still involve paper checks, according Bill.com. It estimates this is costing banks $180 billion annually.

Bill.com’s technology can be integrated into the websites of banks and accounting software providers to make it easier for businesses to send and receive payments digitally.

The company has 100,000 customers, which represent more than 1 percent of U.S. businesses, and is looking to expand its reach, René Lacerte, chief executive officer and founder of Bill.com said in an interview. It also plans to use the funding to enhance its product, he said. “Examples would be international payments,” Lacerte said.

He noted businesses should have access to the same digital payments experience as consumers who are now accustomed to popular applications such as PayPal Holdings Inc’s Venmo.

Bill.com currently process $50 billion in payments a year and also has partnerships with accounting software providers Intuit Inc and Xero.

JPMorgan’s investment underscores a growing interest by large financial institutions in backing and partnering with young financial technology companies.

Many have set up venture capital arms over the past few years to make strategic investments in startups in areas ranging from payments, to wealth management.

“They want to leverage the capabilities of fintech companies,” Lacerte said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber said on Tuesday that paying National Insurance contributions for its British drivers would add tens of millions of pounds to the taxi app’s costs were they to be deemed employees.

Uber currently classifies its around 50,000 drivers in Britain as self-employed, affording them only basic entitlements, whilst employees also receive rights such as sick pay and the minimum wage.

Asked about how much it would cost in National Insurance payments if self-employed drivers were directly employed, the firm’s UK Head of Policy Andrew Byrne told parliament’s business committee:

“I don’t have the precise figures ... but I‘m certain it would be the tens of millions certainly.”

Also appearing before lawmakers, Deliveroo’s UK and Ireland Managing Director Dan Warne said additional costs including National Insurance contributions, would add around 1 pound ($1.32) to the cost of each hour.

National Insurance is collected by the government and helps pay for the state health service, pensions and certain other benefits.

Firms operating in the so-called gig economy - whereby people tend to work for different companies without a fixed contract - have been criticized by unions and some lawmakers for what they call exploitative practices.

Uber and Deliveroo both say their drivers enjoy the flexibility they offer but last year two drivers won a tribunal hearing against Uber and were granted worker rights, in a decision which the Silicon Valley firm appealed last month.

Uber’s Byrne said on Tuesday he expected the judge to make a ruling by around Christmas.

Uber is also battling to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the smartphone app of its license in the British capital. It has until Friday to lodge an appeal.

Byrne said he could hopefully see a way to address concerns by London’s transport regulator, which cited the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

Groundbreaking on homes edged slightly lower in September to 217,118 units from August’s upwardly revised 225,918 as a 10.7 percent drop in multiple starts, typically condos, outweighed an 8.2 percent climb in single starts, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation said.

Analysts had expected starts to cool to a 210,000 annual rate but construction continued to defy expectations for a pullback after a near decade-long boom.

“Canadian homebuilding activity remains robust, with the best population growth in 25 years proving fundamental support. And, after declining modestly in the second quarter, residential investment looks to have added to growth again in the third quarter,” BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic wrote in a client note.

Canada’s long housing boom has shown signs of cooling, particularly in the nation’s largest city, Toronto, where the introduction in April of a foreign buyers tax has doused sales and ended many of the bidding wars that had become a hallmark of the city’s overheated market.

A separate report from Statistics Canada showed the value of Canadian building permits fell more than expected in August, the second straight monthly decrease, on lower construction intentions for multifamily homes as well as industrial facilities.

The 5.5 percent decrease in total building permits surpassed forecasts for a decline of 1.0 percent and suggested that the building boom will slow in the months ahead. July figures were revised to show a decrease of 2.8 percent from the previously reported 3.5 percent fall.

“Despite the drop (in housing starts) in September, Canadian residential construction remains at a level that is higher than demographic needs,” said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial, estimating that a 190,000 pace of starts would meet demographic needs.

“Based on declining permit applications, a moderation is in the cards for residential construction in the last quarter of 2017,” he added in a research note.

Nonresidential building permits fell 10.0 percent in August as construction intentions for industrial, commercial and institutional buildings all declined.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could join a formal trade alliance with the United States, Canada and Mexico if the European Union refuses to clinch a post-Brexit trade deal, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Tuesday without citing sources.

The newspaper said British ministers were looking at the idea of joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as part of planning for possibility of Britain leaving the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal.

Britain’s international trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

Britain is currently negotiating the terms of its divorce from the EU though Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing to move onto discussions about a major free trade deal with the world’s biggest trading bloc.

With the clock ticking down toward Brexit day in 2019, British ministers are exploring what they will do if the world’s fifth largest economy drops out of the EU without a clear trade deal.

Besides aiming to clinch a U.S. trade deal or forming some new trade grouping, some British supporters of Brexit have pondered joining an existing trade deal such as NAFTA.

But U.S. President Donald Trump has warned he may terminate the 1994 NAFTA deal because he says it does not serve U.S. economic interests.

If Britain did join NAFTA, manufacturers wanting to export to the EU and North America would have to produce goods in accordance with the two separate sets of rules, according to trade analysts.

Britain, whose regulation has been within the EU’s orbit for over 40 years, would also have to shift toward the North American model for services, goods, competition policy and data protection.

The EU is Britain’s biggest single export market, accounting for about 50 percent of goods exports in August.

(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc unveiled a corporate makeover on Tuesday that will tie its growth more strongly to aerospace technology and spin off other businesses as two publicly-traded companies by the end of 2018.

The company also raised the low-end of its full-year 2017 earnings guidance by 5 cents to $7.05 - $7.10, and said it would spend the proceeds from the spin-offs on share buybacks, acquisitions and paying down debt.

Its shares fell 1 percent after Wall Street opened.

Honeywell Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk, like his peers at other industrial conglomerates, has been under pressure to pull apart a portfolio of disparate businesses that includes automotive turbo chargers, burglar alarms and the Xtratuf boots popular in Alaska’s fishing industry.

Honeywell had been under pressure from hedge fund Third Point to spin off the aerospace division, which accounted for about 36 percent of total revenue in 2016 and which Third Point said could generate $20 billion in shareholder value if sold.

The changes announced on Tuesday split off its home and ADI global distribution business - which deal with building systems running from air conditioning to smoke alarms - into one unit and transportation systems into a second.

They include the low-margin automotive turbocharger business, joining other companies, including auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, in shedding technology tied to the internal combustion engine as regulators around the world crack down on emissions and talk of mandating a switch to battery-electric vehicles over the next two decades.

Honeywell said the two spun-off business units together would generate annualized revenue of about $7.5 billion. It said it would gain $3 billion from the spin-offs.

Ahead of its quarterly earnings report, the company also said third quarter sales were expected to be $10.1 billion, up 5 percent in organic terms compared to an earlier forecast range of +/-1 percent.","Honeywell sticks with aerospace, spins off other units",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CF0CO-OCATP

(Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N) said on Tuesday it was considering the sale or spin-off of its consumer healthcare business, shaking up the industry and potentially putting a headache pill to lip balm operation worth as much as $14 billion up for grabs.

The move comes as Germany’s Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) is also looking to divest its non-prescription products, including brands such as Seven Seas vitamins, which could be worth around $4.5 billion.

As ageing populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication, the fragmented consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal-making in recent years.

Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very long-lasting brands with loyal customers.

Pfizer’s consumer healthcare business, whose brands include painkiller Advil and lip balm Chapstick, had revenue of about $3.4 billion in 2016. Industry experts said it could fetch around four times sales, implying a potential value of up $14 billion.

Pfizer, which saw its shares rise about 1 percent at $36.50 in premarket trading, said it would decide on the future of its consumer unit during 2018.

Reuters first reported last November that a divestment of the Pfizer consumer business was under consideration.

Established consumer health companies that might be interested in the Pfizer assets include Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Abbott (ABT.N).

They could be potentially be joined by non-traditional players such as Nestle (NESN.S), which is exploring the boundaries of food and healthcare. One person familiar with the matter said Pfizer expected a “broadening” of buyer interest.

Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Sanofi (SASY.PA) may be less likely to bid, despite their consumer health presence, given they are busy absorbing Monsanto (MON.N) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s consumer business respectively.

In explaining the thinking behind the review, Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said consumer healthcare was connected but not integral to its core prescription drug business.

“Although there is a strong connection between consumer healthcare and elements of our core biopharmaceutical businesses, it is also distinct enough from our core business that there is potential for its value to be more fully realized outside the company,” he said.

Options to be considered include a full or partial separation of the unit through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. Pfizer may also ultimately decide to keep the business.

The Pfizer business includes two of the 10 top-selling consumer healthcare brands globally in Advil and the multivitamin line Centrum. It also has 10 brands that each exceeded $100 million in 2016 sales.

A Pfizer exit from the consumer health business would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a $160 billion deal to buy Allergan (AGN.N) last year.

Returning to the franchise are John Boyega as Finn, the late Carrie Fisher as Leia, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, Andy Serkis as the menacing Snoke and Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron alongside some of the more quirky characters in the franchise, C-3PO, R2-D2, BB8 and Chewbacca. Three major characters have been added to the franchise, including Kelly Marie Tran as Rose, Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo and Benicio Del Toro as an unknown character called DJ. 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' has been written and directed by Rian Johnson.

Düsseldorf (Reuters) - Die defizitäre Warenhauskette Galeria Kaufhof will bei den Löhnen und Gehältern ihrer Mitarbeiter sparen.

Kaufhof wolle in Gesprächen mit der Gewerkschaft Verdi einen neuen Tarifvertrag durchsetzen, der für die Beschäftigten Einschnitte mit sich bringen werde, sagte Arbeitsdirektor Peter Herlitzius am Dienstag. Kaufhof brauche eine “wettbewerbsfähige Kostenstruktur”, forderte der Chef des Europa-Geschäfts des nordamerikanischen Kaufhof-Eigners HBC, Wolfgang Link. Das Unternehmen müsse wieder nachhaltig Gewinne erzielen. Verdi prüft nun den Antrag des Konzerns, in Verhandlungen einzusteigen. Die Gewerkschaft setze alles daran, dass den Beschäftigten nicht in die Tasche gegriffen werde, sagte der Gesamtbetriebsratsvorsitzender Uwe Hoepfel.

Ziel sei eine “Atempause”, bis der Umbau der Kette vollständig greife, erklärte Kaufhof weiter. Ein neuer Tarifvertrag sei notwendig, um wettbewerbsfähig zu sein und damit die rund 21.500 Arbeitsplätze zu erhalten, sagte Arbeitsdirektor Herlitzius. Kaufhof könnte sich bei einem Sonder-Tarifvertrag etwa Lohnerhöhungen aus den Tarifverträgen für den Einzelhandel sparen sowie Urlaubs- oder Weihnachtsgeld antasten. Auch Konkurrent Karstadt hatte am Personal gespart. Die Kette hatte den Einzelhandelstarifvertrag gekündigt, ist aber inzwischen in die Tarifbindung zurückgekehrt.

Verdi stimmt Tarifverträgen zur Beschäftigungssicherung aber nur in Einzelfällen zu. Voraussetzung ist etwa die wirtschaftliche Schieflage eines Unternehmens. Unter anderem ein unabhängiger, von der Gewerkschaft benannter Gutachter soll nun die Kaufhof-Zahlen prüfen. Erst danach kann es Verhandlungen geben.

INSIDER - BENKO STRECKT FÜHLER NACH KAUFHOF AUS

Kaufhof kommt nicht zur Ruhe. Die Kette kämpft mit Umsatzrückgängen und Verlusten, viele Kunden kehren Innenstädten und Warenhäusern den Rücken und bestellen ihre Einkäufe im Internet. Ein US-Investor hat die Kaufhof-Mutter HBC bereits aufgefordert, sich vom Europa-Geschäft rund um Kaufhof zu trennen. Ein möglicher Käufer stünde bereit: Insidern zufolge hat der österreichische Karstadt-Eigner Rene Benko seine Fühler nach dem Konkurrenten ausgestreckt. Die Nordamerikaner hatten Kaufhof 2015 vom Handelsriesen Metro übernommen, damals hatte Benko das Nachsehen. Benko habe weiter Interesse am Kaufhof, hatten Insider Reuters jüngst gesagt. Eine konkrete Offerte hat er aber noch nicht vorgelegt. Benkos Gesellschaft Signa hatte aber bereits verkündet, eine Milliarde Euro eingesammelt zu haben, das Eigenkapital bei Signa Prime summiere sich auf über vier Milliarden Euro.

HBC hat indes immer wieder betont, sich nicht von der Kette trennen zu wollen. Dabei läuft es bei Kaufhof nicht rund - der Kreditversicherer Euler Hermes hatte jüngst Insidern zufolge Garantiezusagen für Lieferungen an die Warenhauskette gekürzt. Zudem muss Kaufhof nach der Übernahme höhere Mieten zahlen.

Rohingya Muslims are still fleeing, more than six weeks after Rohingya insurgents attacked security forces in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state.

The United Nations has denounced a ferocious military crackdown in response to the attacks as ethnic cleansing aimed at driving out Rohingya.

A new surge of refugees has entered Bangladesh in recent days, including about 11,000 on Monday. Some have told of increasing hunger in Rakhine as well as of more mob attacks on Muslim villagers.

Despite growing international condemnation of the refugee crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged in recent years.

The party of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi took the first step toward trying to ease animosity with inter-faith prayers at a stadium in the biggest city of Yangon, with Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Christians and others.

Thousands of people packed the stands of the stadium, with Buddhist monks, Hindus, Christian nuns and Muslim men with beards and caps listening to religious leaders who took turns to appeal for friendship.

”Be free from killing one another, be free from torturing one another, be free from destroying or demolishing one another,” the chief Buddhist monk of Yangon, Iddhibala, told the crowd.

Stepping off the podium, he shook hands with Muslim leader Hafiz Mufti Ali.

”Citizens should collaborate in friendship and work for the country,“ Ali said, adding: ”Freedom of life, freedom of education, freedom of religion, it is absolutely necessary for the country to fulfill all these rights.”

The Rohingya had pinned hopes for change on Suu Kyi’s party but it has been wary of Buddhist nationalist pressure. Her party did not field a single Muslim candidate in the 2015 election that it swept.

Rohingya are not classified as an indigenous minority in Myanmar and so are denied citizenship under a law that links nationality to ethnicity.

Regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, they face restrictions and discrimination and are derided by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists in Rakhine, and by much of the wider population.

The militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) who launched the Aug. 25 attacks that triggered the latest spasm of violence are demanding full citizenship rights and recognition as an indigenous community.

CEASEFIRE ENDS

A one-month ceasefire the insurgents called in September in order, they said, to ease aid deliveries to Rakhine, expired at midnight on Monday, but authorities said there was no sign of any new attacks.

The government rebuffed the ceasefire, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing. It says more than 500 people have been killed in the violence since late August, most of them ARSA “terrorists”.

Even before the government offensive, the small, lightly armed ARSA appeared only capable of hit-and-run raids and unable to mount any sort of sustained challenge to the army.

The insurgents said on Saturday they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government, even though their ceasefire was ending.

Reports of food shortages in Rakhine will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

Villagers said food was running out because rice crops were not ready for harvest and authorities had shut village markets and limited food transport, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

The government has cited worry about food as a main reason people have cited for leaving, but a senior state government official dismissed any suggestion of starvation.

Among those fleeing were more than 30 people on a boat that capsized off Bangladesh on Sunday. Twenty-five people drowned, 13 of them children, police said.",Myanmar takes first step to ease Buddhist-Muslim tension,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-takes-first-step-to-ease-buddhist-muslim-tension-idUKKBN1CF08D

Regional leader Carles Puigdemont held a meeting of his cabinet to decide how to press an independence drive that has stirred powerful emotions across Spain and raised concern in European Union partner states.

Catalan police armed with automatic rifles stood guard at Barcelona’s Parc de la Ciutadella which houses the elegant 18th century building. Spanish national police, decried by separatists over their use of force to hinder an Oct. 1 referendum, were not to be seen.

A declaration of independence would deepen Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and would almost certainly draw tough counter-measures from Madrid, possibly including suspension of the regional government.

The parliament and other buildings, such as the regional high court building, could become a focus of contention between Spanish and Catalan authorities.

Thousands of national police reinforcements sent by Madrid for the referendum remain in the area, many of them in two cruise ships docked in Barcelona harbor.

Pro-independence demonstrators were due to gather before the parliament building under the slogan “Hello Republic” to mark Puigdemont’s speech at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).

Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Barcelona against independence at the weekend, waving red-yellow Spanish flags through the city center. That rally fell a week after some 900 people were injured when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt a referendum ruled illegal in Madrid.

Related Coverage Spain's creditors size up cost of Catalan independence bid

Puigdemont has said he is determined to apply a law passed by the Catalan assembly which called for a declaration of independence within days if Catalans voted ‘yes’ in the Oct. 1 referendum.

The government of Spain’s wealthiest region says 90 percent of those who voted backed independence, but turnout was only 43 percent as many opponents of independence stayed at home.

The Madrid government has said it will respond immediately to any unilateral declaration.

Puigdemont could ask the parliament to vote on a motion of independence, which lawmakers say would start a period of up to six months during which Catalonia would write a new constitution and negotiate a divorce with Spain; or he could make a statement of intent on a future independence declaration.

Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to disclose what Puigdemont would say but told a news conference after the cabinet meeting he would be “clear and explicit” and Tuesday would be an historic day.

Ruling party lawmakers say Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is considering taking the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering new regional elections, the so-called nuclear option.

The European Commission repeated its call for dialogue in Spain to end the crisis in Catalonia. Puigdemont has also called for talks and international mediation, but Rajoy has said he will not negotiate with the Catalan leaders unless they abandon plans to declare independence.

BUSINESS CLIMATE

Markets have been rattled by the Catalan crisis, raising Spain’s borrowing costs and pushing down shares.

Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond yields were a touch lower on Tuesday, but above lows hit the previous session as investors awaited Puigdemont’s speech. Spain’s benchmark Ibex share index was down nearly one percent.

The tension is taking its toll on the business climate. On Monday, three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business drift from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum.

Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial and infrastructure firm Abertis both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued.

Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence.

Spain’s finance minister said it was the Catalan government’s fault the companies were leaving.

The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

The crisis has reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, who died in 1975, is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.",Catalonia nears possible independence proclamation despite Madrid warnings,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/catalonia-nears-possible-independence-proclamation-despite-madrid-warnings-idUSKBN1CF13W

LONDON (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar after Arab countries imposed restrictions on trade with the tiny Gulf state and the company is looking at alternative shipping routes.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When reporters descended on upstate New York to ask about a stunning prison break in 2015, state police spokesman Major Charles Guess took their questions.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

But strange synergies also can signal hope.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May pledged on Tuesday to “hold a mirror up to society” with a study showing sharp racial disparities in Britain, as she looks for a way to demonstrate her leadership is about more than just delivering Brexit.

Among the findings of the audit, the data showed Asian, black and other minority ethnic households were most likely to be in persistent poverty, that ethnic minorities have a lower employment rate than white people, and that they were under-represented in senior public sector jobs.

Bogged down by Brexit and losing her parliamentary majority in a snap election in June, May has struggled to deliver on social reforms to tackle what she has called “burning injustices” since taking control of the ruling Conservative party in July 2016.

Attempting to relaunch that agenda, she published the findings of a “Race Disparity Audit” which pulled together existing data from across sectors such as health, education, employment and the criminal justice system and analyzed it to discover how ethnicity affects people’s lives.

“This audit means that for society as a whole – for government, for our public services – there is nowhere to hide. These issues are now out in the open,” she told a private meeting to launch the report, according to her office.

“The message is very simple: if these disparities cannot be explained then they must be changed.”

May’s center-right Conservatives were blindsided in June’s election by a surge in support for the left-wing policies of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has presented higher state spending as part of the cure for voters he says have been let down years of cuts to public services.

“The prime minister has done nothing but exacerbate the problems. Far from tackling the burning injustices she has added fuel to the fire,” Labour’s equalities spokeswoman Dawn Butler said. She called for the government to start offering solutions to the problems the audit highlighted.

At last week’s Conservative conference, May was keen to show party members that she had a plan to counter Corbyn’s rise and allay fears that Brexit was squeezing out action on Britain’s social problems.

“It will hold a mirror up to society and allow us and wider society to see where action is needed,” May told a meeting of her senior ministers, according to a spokesman.

O FMI projetou que o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) do país este ano deve avançar 0,7 por cento, bem menos do que o 1,2 por cento esperado para a América Latina toda, segundo o documento “Perspectiva Econômica Global”. Para 2018, a estimativa é de que o Brasil tenha expansão de 1,5 por cento e a região, de 1,9 por cento.

Na comparação com as contas feitas em julho, o FMI aumentou a expectativa para o PIB brasileiro em 0,4 e 0,2 ponto percentual para 2017 e 2018, respectivamente. Neste ano, a melhora veio pelo bom desempenho da safra agrícola recorde e pela melhora do consumo.

A previsão do FMI para o desempenho do PIB neste ano está bastante próxima da leitura feita por bancos e consultorias, mas a expectativa para o ano que vem é mais pessimista.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do “whatever it takes” to defend world oil prices, it didn’t expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

Alexander Dobrindt, parliamentary floor leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), said a coalition agreement would have to be more detailed than the one that accompanied the Grand Coalition in the last parliament.

Merkel, humbled in last month’s national election by a surging far-right, is trying to broker a three-way coalition of her conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens - a combination previously untested at federal level.

The task is further complicated by the fact that Merkel’s conservative bloc compromises her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and CSU, whose alliance has been strained by her open-door migrants policy.

The conservative allies removed one obstacle to forming a new coalition on Sunday by agreeing a limit on the number of migrants arriving in Germany.[nL8N1MJ0EG] But Dobrindt of the CSU said in an interview with Reuters television that securing a three-way alliance would be hard.

“As we know that the points that separate us outweigh those we have in common, one can have doubts about whether a coalition agreement is possible this year,” Dobrindt said.

“It is conceivable that we can’t complete in December and that final talks - if there even are any - will only possible next year,” he added.

The three-way tie-up - dubbed a “Jamaica” coalition after the black, green and yellow colours of the three party blocs, which match the Caribbean island’s flag - is Merkel’s only realistic option of forming a government.

The centre-left Social Democrats, her previous partners in a the Grand Coalition, insist they want to go into opposition.

A Jamaica coalition was formed in the tiny western state of Saarland in October 2009, but collapsed in January 2012. The same formation took power in the far northern region of Schleswig-Holstein after elections there in May this year.

BIG DIFFERENCES

At a national level, the three party groups have deep differences on issues ranging from migration to European Union reform, tax and the environment. Dobrindt said this meant they would have to nail down a detailed agreement.

“We need, in a possible Jamaica coalition agreement, a significantly higher level of detail than was the case with the grand coalition,” he said. “The differences between the parties are big, so the agreements need to go deeper.”

In their compromise struck on Sunday, the CDU and CSU agreed to limit to 200,000 the number of people Germany would accept per year on humanitarian grounds.

The FDP and Greens insist the conservatives’ agreement cannot simply be copied into a coalition deal. [nL8N1MH43P]

But Dobrindt, whose CSU is worried about losing its regional dominance in a Bavarian state election next year, said the allies’ accord must be reflected in a coalition deal.

“The regulations we have made in our joint paper - ‘Rules on Migration’ - are of course an essential part of the negotiations and must also be found in a coalition agreement,” he said.

The intransigence of the CSU, the Greens and the FDP on the migrants issue points to difficult coalition talks that risk clouding the political outlook in Germany, which has been a source of stability in Europe during Merkel’s 12 years in power.

“We want Europe to concentrate more on the big tasks and less on the small tasks,” Dobrindt said. “That means we must talk about bringing back responsibilities from Brussels to Germany - and the details of that will no doubt be difficult.”",Germany may not agree new coalition until next year - Merkel ally,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-politics/germany-may-not-agree-new-coalition-until-next-year-merkel-ally-idUKKBN1CF1PL

Frankfurt (Reuters) - In der anstehenden Tarifrunde wird die IG Metall voraussichtlich sechs Prozent mehr Lohn verlangen und zugleich ein individuelles Recht auf Arbeitszeitverkürzung.

Für diese Forderungen sprach sich am Dienstag der Gewerkschaftsvorstand in Frankfurt aus. Nun müssen am 24. Oktober die Tarifbezirke darüber entscheiden. Angesichts des ungebrochenen Wachstums der Branche und einer schwungvollen Konjunktur sei ein Lohnplus in der angestrebten Höhe und für eine Laufzeit von zwölf Monaten mehr als angemessen, sagte Gewerkschaftschef Jörg Hofmann. Für die 3,9 Millionen Beschäftigten gebe es “keinen Grund zu Zurückhaltung”. Der Arbeitgeberverband Gesamtmetall wies die Lohnforderung zurück. In den vergangenen fünf Jahren seien die Tarifgehälter bereits um fast 20 Prozent gestiegen. “Es wird von Jahr zu Jahr schwieriger, das zu erwirtschaften”, erklärte Gesamtmetall-Präsident Rainer Dulger.

Hofmann erklärte, die Gewerkschaft wolle einen “Paradigmenwechsel” in der Arbeitszeit erreichen. Bisher habe sie sich nach den Wünschen der Betriebe und deren Kunden gerichtet. “Künftig sollen auch die Wünsche der Beschäftigten Platz finden”, forderte er. Die in der Branche seit 1995 geltende 35-Stunden-Woche hat mittlerweile nur noch knapp die Hälfte der Beschäftigten in ihren Verträgen stehen. Viele von ihnen arbeiten nach Ausnahmeregeln mehr. Die tatsächliche Wochenarbeitszeit liegt fast bei jedem Vierten über 40 Stunden. Viele arbeiten auch am Wochenende. In einer Umfrage der IG Metall hatten 80 Prozent der Beschäftigten für die Möglichkeit einer vorübergehenden Senkung der Arbeitszeit plädiert. Die IG Metall fordert deshalb ein individuelles Recht für die Arbeitnehmer in ganz Deutschland, die Wochenarbeitszeit befristet auf bis zu 28 Stunden verkürzen zu können.

ARBEITGEBER BEFÜRCHTEN FACHKRÄFTEMANGEL

Damit Beschäftigte wegen kürzerer Arbeitszeiten nicht mehr in eine “Teilzeitfalle” geraten, solle es einen Anspruch auf Rückkehr in Vollzeit geben, erklärte Hofmann. Arbeitnehmer, die zur Pflege von Angehörigen oder Betreuung von Kindern zeitweise kürzer treten wollen, sollen einen Entgeltzuschuss bekommen. Diesen müssten nach Vorstellung der Gewerkschaft die Arbeitgeber finanzieren. Die IG Metall will außerdem Regelungen zu einem Personalausgleich aushandeln, damit nicht andere Beschäftigte die Arbeit der Teilzeiter erledigen müssen und belastet werden.

Die Arbeitgeber lehnen die schon länger diskutierten Arbeitszeitideen ab. Ein Anspruch auf Arbeitszeitverkürzung verschärfe den Fachkräftemangel, warnte Dulger. “Die Forderungen gehen an dem Alltag in unseren Betrieben vorbei”, ergänzte er. Für die meisten Arbeitszeitwünsche der Beschäftigten fänden sich schon heute Lösungen. Gesprächsbereit sei Gesamtmetall über Arbeitszeitregeln, die Betrieben und Beschäftigten gerecht würden. Aber die Arbeit müsse immer erledigt werden - und sie dürfe nicht noch teurer werden.

Die Tarifverhandlungen in den Bezirken sollen Mitte November starten. Die Gewerkschaft rechnet nach Worten Hofmanns mit einer schwierigen Runde und einem “Verhandlungsmarathon”. Protestaktionen der Beschäftigten wären nach dem Ende der Friedenspflicht Anfang Januar möglich.

On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blanc-iran-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-threats-risk-a-u-s-break-with-europe-idUSKCN1C32E3

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged the Trump administration on Tuesday to moderate its stance in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, describing some of Washington’s demands as “poison pill proposals” that could doom the talks.

Thomas Donohue, the chamber’s president and chief executive, will raise a red flag about the progress of the negotiations, according to advance excerpts of a speech he was due to make in Mexico City on Tuesday morning.

The group has argued repeatedly in recent weeks that NAFTA is critical to U.S. industries such as agriculture and manufacturing.

“There are several poison pill proposals still on the table that could doom the entire deal,” Donohue said in remarks to be delivered at an event hosted by AmCham Mexico. “All of these proposals are unnecessary and unacceptable.”

The U.S. Chamber did not specify what the most contentious proposals were in the excerpts of the speech, but a number of thorny issues have been highlighted by the Mexican and Canadian governments and the U.S. private sector in recent weeks.

These include U.S. exploration of imposing national content requirements for some products, not just regional thresholds, within certain sectors of industry, such as carmaking.

Auto makers in Mexico say excessive content requirements could do serious damage to the industry’s competitiveness.

In addition, U.S. officials have mooted incorporating a sunset clause in NAFTA that would kill it unless it was renegotiated every five years, as well as eliminating a key dispute resolution mechanism, much to the dismay of Canada.

The U.S., Mexico and Canada began renegotiating the 23-year-old trade pact this summer, with a fourth round of talks kicking off this week in Washington.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if he does not win concessions to reduce a U.S. trade deficit of around $64 billion with Mexico.

But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has consistently stressed the pact’s importance.

“The existential threat to the North American Free Trade Agreement is a threat to our partnership, our shared economic vibrancy, and clearly the security and safety of all three nations,” Donohue said.

In recent months, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has shown a willingness to stand up to the Trump administration’s more extreme proposals, often echoing Mexico’s positions.

“I also want it to be clear that the U.S. business community is committed to Mexico, and no matter what happens, we’re not going anywhere,” Donohue said.",U.S. Chamber warns U.S. demands could torpedo NAFTA talks,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta/u-s-chamber-warns-u-s-demands-could-torpedo-nafta-talks-idUSKBN1CF0WV

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will block access to websites of exchanges that offer crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Russian Central Bank First Deputy Governor Sergei Shvetsov said on Tuesday.

He called them “dubious”.

Russian financial authorities initially treated any sort of money issued by non-state approved institutions as illegal, saying they could be used to launder money.

Later the authorities accepted the globally booming market of crypto-currencies but want to either control the turnover or to limit access to the market

“We cannot stand apart. We cannot give direct and easy access to such dubious instruments for retail (investors),” Shvetsov said, referring to households.

Speaking at a conference on financial market derivatives, Shvetsov said the central bank sees rising interest in crypto-currencies because of high returns from buying into such instruments.

He warned, however, that crypto-currencies gradually transform into high-yielding assets from being a mean of payment.

Bitcoin, the most well-known virtual currency that emerged in mid-2010, last traded at around $4,807, up from its initial price of less than $1.

“We think that for our citizens, for businesses the usage of such crypto-currencies as an investment object carries unreasonably high risks,” he said.

Regional leader Carles Puigdemont held a meeting of his cabinet to decide how to press an independence drive that has stirred powerful emotions across Spain and raised concern in European Union partner states.

Catalan police armed with automatic rifles stood guard at Barcelona’s Parc de la Ciutadella which houses the elegant 18th century building. Spanish national police, decried by separatists over their use of force to hinder an Oct. 1 referendum, were not to be seen.

A declaration of independence would deepen Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and would almost certainly draw tough counter-measures from Madrid, possibly including suspension of the regional government.

The parliament and other buildings, such as the regional high court building, could become a focus of contention between Spanish and Catalan authorities.

Thousands of national police reinforcements sent by Madrid for the referendum remain in the area, many of them in two cruise ships docked in Barcelona harbor.

Pro-independence demonstrators were due to gather before the parliament building under the slogan “Hello Republic” to mark Puigdemont’s speech at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).

Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Barcelona against independence at the weekend, waving red-yellow Spanish flags through the city center. That rally fell a week after some 900 people were injured when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt a referendum ruled illegal in Madrid.

Related Coverage Spain's creditors size up cost of Catalan independence bid

Puigdemont has said he is determined to apply a law passed by the Catalan assembly which called for a declaration of independence within days if Catalans voted ‘yes’ in the Oct. 1 referendum.

The government of Spain’s wealthiest region says 90 percent of those who voted backed independence, but turnout was only 43 percent as many opponents of independence stayed at home.

The Madrid government has said it will respond immediately to any unilateral declaration.

Puigdemont could ask the parliament to vote on a motion of independence, which lawmakers say would start a period of up to six months during which Catalonia would write a new constitution and negotiate a divorce with Spain; or he could make a statement of intent on a future independence declaration.

Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to disclose what Puigdemont would say but told a news conference after the cabinet meeting he would be “clear and explicit” and Tuesday would be an historic day.

Ruling party lawmakers say Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is considering taking the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering new regional elections, the so-called nuclear option.

The European Commission repeated its call for dialogue in Spain to end the crisis in Catalonia. Puigdemont has also called for talks and international mediation, but Rajoy has said he will not negotiate with the Catalan leaders unless they abandon plans to declare independence.

BUSINESS CLIMATE

Slideshow (14 Images)

Markets have been rattled by the Catalan crisis, raising Spain’s borrowing costs and pushing down shares.

Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond yields were a touch lower on Tuesday, but above lows hit the previous session as investors awaited Puigdemont’s speech. Spain’s benchmark Ibex share index was down nearly one percent.

The tension is taking its toll on the business climate. On Monday, three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business drift from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum.

Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial and infrastructure firm Abertis both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued.

Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence.

Spain’s finance minister said it was the Catalan government’s fault the companies were leaving.

The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

The crisis has reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, who died in 1975, is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.",Catalonia nears possible independence proclamation despite Madrid warnings,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/catalonia-nears-possible-independence-proclamation-despite-madrid-warnings-idUKKBN1CF13U?il=0

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber said on Tuesday that paying National Insurance contributions for its British drivers would add tens of millions of pounds to the taxi app’s costs were they to be deemed employees.

Uber currently classifies its around 50,000 drivers in Britain as self-employed, affording them only basic entitlements, whilst employees also receive rights such as sick pay and the minimum wage.

Asked about how much it would cost in National Insurance payments if self-employed drivers were directly employed, the firm’s UK Head of Policy Andrew Byrne told parliament’s business committee:

“I don’t have the precise figures ... but I‘m certain it would be the tens of millions certainly.”

Also appearing before lawmakers, Deliveroo’s UK and Ireland Managing Director Dan Warne said additional costs including National Insurance contributions, would add around 1 pound ($1.32) to the cost of each hour.

National Insurance is collected by the government and helps pay for the state health service, pensions and certain other benefits.

Firms operating in the so-called gig economy - whereby people tend to work for different companies without a fixed contract - have been criticized by unions and some lawmakers for what they call exploitative practices.

Uber and Deliveroo both say their drivers enjoy the flexibility they offer but last year two drivers won a tribunal hearing against Uber and were granted worker rights, in a decision which the Silicon Valley firm appealed last month.

Uber’s Byrne said on Tuesday he expected the judge to make a ruling by around Christmas.

Uber is also battling to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the smartphone app of its license in the British capital. It has until Friday to lodge an appeal.

Byrne said he could hopefully see a way to address concerns by London’s transport regulator, which cited the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

In the 1960’s and 1970’s, the central goal was preventing North Korean founder Kim Il Sung from redeploying his army south of the 38th parallel. For the last 25 years, however, the focus of U.S. policymakers has been something even more difficult: the denuclearization of the Kim dynasty.

Pyongyang’s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July, its testing of a Hwasong-12 missile over Japan in August and the September 3 test of what Pyongyang claimed was a hydrogen bomb have only accelerated the sense of urgency in Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo about the need for a strong collective response.

The U.S. foreign policy community has many recommendations on the table but few easy answers. A preventive military strike is not plausible given its devastating cost - Brigadier General Rob Givens (retired) estimates that 20,000 people would perish in Seoul in the first day of a conflict. Even though the U.N. Security Council voted Monday to step up sanctions against Pyongyang, economic restrictions have limited impact. Pyongyang is a master of sanctions evasion, devising ever new and effective ways to keep their weapons programs funded.

John Mecklin: The North Korea nuclear 'crisis' is an illusion

Adele M. Stan: How Trump mainstreamed hate

What may work, however, is a new U.S. approach that learns from its failures - as well as its successes during the Cold War - while tempering expectations on what can be achieved.

The Kim dynasty has long sought recognition as a nuclear weapons state, a demand that would be a political minefield for even the most popular U.S. president to meet. But North Korea is a nuclear state whether Washington offers formal recognition or not. The only way for the U.S. to improve its North Korea policy is by acknowledging that Pyongyang will be nuclear-capable for many years to come and is highly unlikely to eliminate its nuclear weapons program regardless of what Washington offers. This isn’t about what Kim Jong Un wants, but rather what is most likely to serve U.S. national security.

While openly recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power would cause tremors throughout Asia, Trump ought to do it anyway. As soon as he does, the U.S. can re-focus attention from a denuclearization objective that is increasingly impossible to imagine toward an old-fashioned strategy of deterrence and containment. “We know how to contain and degrade enemies who want to do us harm,” Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest told me. “We just need to open a history book and reread what works and apply it for the 21st century.”

For Washington, deterrence and containment would mean building an anti-North Korea alliance of diverse states in and outside the region with the common objective of minimizing Pyongyang’s ability to threaten its neighbors. As former State Department official Richard Sokolsky told me in an email: “If we could deter the likes of Stalin and Mao, we can do the same with Kim.”

As politically risky as this decision would be, effective deterrence would require Trump to establish a reliable channel of communication with the North - similar to the U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-China hotlines during the Cold War - in order to clear up misunderstandings that will inevitably arise and to deliver a unified message of what Washington will tolerate. The signal to the leadership in Pyongyang should be as unambiguous as possible: while Washington does not seek an armed conflict with the North, the U.S. military will respond to any provocation that dangerously impacts the interests of the U.S. or its allies. The message would aim to trade coexistence between the U.S. and North Korea for as long as Kim Jong Un refrains from launching an attack against his neighbors. Given Kim’s preoccupation with self-preservation - there is no evidence to date he is bent on suicidal self-destruction - this arrangement may be pragmatic enough for the young dictator to explore.

Because the Kim dynasty has been accused of exporting and cooperating with countries like Iran and Syria on nuclear designs, missile technology, and possibly chemical weapons development, the Security Council ought to deliver a similar message to Pyongyang that a continuation of this behavior would be grounds for an even tougher and more comprehensive boycott of what it can import and export.

While China remains resistant to cutting off all oil imports to the North or squeezing its economy to the point of collapse, Washington may be willing to enlist Beijing’s help in areas where Beijing is more likely to agree, such as preventing the proliferation of dual use nuclear and missile technology transiting North Korean territory. Stemming the flow of these materials would minimize the spread of weapons of dangerous items to other proliferators, an objective that the Chinese appear to share.

Washington also needs to encourage a stronger South Korea-Japan relationship. Historical rivalries between these two states cannot obstruct the regional intelligence sharing essential to promoting a unity of purpose in East Asia. The Trump administration needs to spend far more diplomatic capital on alliance-building than it has to date. Open talk about scrapping the free trade agreement only destabilizes the kinds of partnerships that form the bedrock of an anti-Pyongyang alliance. Washington can and should allow the South Koreans to take more responsibility for its external defense, but it can do so without giving Pyongyang a reason to believe that its nuclear development is causing divisions among its adversaries.

The 70-year-old retired banker said he is unhappy with infighting and turnover in the White House. He does not like Trump’s penchant for traveling to his personal golf resorts. He wishes the president would do more to fix the healthcare system, and he worries that Trump might back down from his promise to force illegal immigrants out of the country.

“Every president makes mistakes,” Wilson said. “But if you add one on top of one, on top of another one, on top of another, there’s just a limit.”

Trump, who inspired millions of supporters last year in places like Morgan County, has been losing his grip on rural America.

According to the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll, the Republican president’s popularity is eroding in small towns and rural communities where 15 percent of the country’s population lives. The poll of more than 15,000 adults in “non-metro” areas shows that they are now as likely to disapprove of Trump as they are to approve of him.

In September, 47 percent of people in non-metro areas approved of Trump while 47 percent disapproved. That is down from Trump’s first four weeks in office, when 55 percent said they approved of the president while 39 percent disapproved.

The poll found that Trump has lost support in rural areas among men, whites and people who never went to college. He lost support with rural Republicans and rural voters who supported him on Election Day.

And while Trump still gets relatively high marks in the poll for his handling of the economy and national security, rural Americans are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s record on immigration, a central part of his presidential campaign.

Forty-seven percent of rural Americans said in September they approved of the president’s handling of immigration, down from 56 percent during his first month in office.

Poll respondents who were interviewed by Reuters gave different reasons for their dissatisfaction with the president on immigration.

A few said they are tired of waiting for Trump to make good on his promise to build a wall along America’s southern border, while others said they were uncomfortable with his administration’s efforts to restrict travel into the United States.

“There should be some sort of compromise between a free flow of people over the border and something that’s more controlled,” said Drew Carlson, 19, of Warrensburg, Missouri, who took the poll.

But Trump’s “constant fixation on deportation is a little bit unsettling to me.”

The Trump administration would not comment about the Reuters/Ipsos poll.

To be sure, Trump is still much more popular in rural America than he is elsewhere.

Since he took office, “I like him less, but I support him more,” said Robert Cody, 87, a retired chemical engineer from Bartlesville, Oklahoma who took the poll.

Cody said that Trump may rankle some people with the way he talks and tweets, but it is a small price to pay for a president who will fight to strip away government regulations and strengthen the border.

DROPPING OFF THE SCREEN

When Trump called the election a ”last shot“ for the struggling coal industry and when he called for protecting the nation’s southern border with a “big, fat, beautiful wall”, he was speaking directly to rural America, said David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University.

“Feelings of resentment and deprivation have pervaded a lot of these places,” Swenson said. “And here comes a candidate (Trump) who’s offering simplistic answers” to issues that concern them.

Rural Americans responded by supporting Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 26 percentage points during the election, an advantage that helped tip the balance in battleground states, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won by less than 1 percentage point.

But after 10 months, many are still waiting to see concrete changes that could make life easier in rural America, said Karl Stauber, who runs a private economic development agency serving a patchwork of manufacturing communities in south central Virginia.

“Rural people are more cynical about the federal government than people in general are,” Stauber said. “They’ve heard so many promises, and they’ve not seen much done.”

Despite all the talk of bringing manufacturing jobs back, Stauber said he has not seen any companies which have relocated to his region, or anyone expand their workforce, due to new federal policies.

“It just seems like we’ve dropped off the screen,” he said.

According to the poll, Trump’s overall popularity has dropped gradually, and for different reasons, this year.

Rural Americans were increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of healthcare in March and April after he lobbied for a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare and cut coverage for millions of Americans.

In May and June, they were more critical of Trump’s ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy, and they gave him lower marks for “the way he treats people like me.”

In August, they were increasingly unhappy with “the effort he’s making to unify the country” after he blamed “both sides” for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It asked people to rate the president’s performance and the results were filtered for people who lived in zip codes that fell within counties designated as “non-metro” by the federal government.

The poll combined the results of “non-metro” respondents into nine, four-week periods. Each period included between 1,300 and 2,000 responses and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.",Trump's popularity is slipping in rural America: poll,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ruralamerica-poll/trumps-popularity-is-slipping-in-rural-america-poll-idUSKBN1CE162?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

PARIS (Reuters) - French public sector workers went on strike on Tuesday against President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to cull jobs and toughen pay conditions, forcing airlines to cancel hundreds of flights and disrupting school activities.

Civil servants, teachers and nurses marched through cities across France, from Toulouse in the south to Strasbourg in the east, before the day’s biggest rally in Paris.

It is the first time in a decade that all unions representing more than 5 million public workers have rallied behind a protest call.

But as the Paris rally got underway, the number of protesters appeared low. Turnout will be an important indicator of public appetite for protest against Macron’s social and economic reforms, which the former investment banker says are needed to unlock economic growth and put public finances on a more sustainable footing.

Protests last month against labor law reform that were led by private sector unions failed to persuade Macron to change policy course, but the French labor movement has traditionally been more muscular in the public sector.

“We want to make our voices heard after months and months of attacks against the public sector and its workers,” said Mylene Jacquot, head of the civil servants’ federation at the moderate CFDT, France’s biggest trade union.

“In particular, we want to force the government to make good on its promise regarding our spending power.”

Strike notices were lodged in schools, hospitals, airports and government ministries over plans to ax 120,000 jobs, freeze pay and reduce sick leave compensation.

The civil aviation authority said 30 percent of flights at airports nationwide had been canceled but there was no disruption on the rail network. The Ministry of Education said fewer than one in five teachers were on strike.

“BLOODY MESS”

Slideshow (13 Images)

Macron, 39, has come under fire in recent days from political opponents and the unions for treating workers with contempt after he was recorded describing a group of workers at a struggling factory as “kicking up a bloody mess”.

That misstep came weeks after he called those who resisted reform “slackers”.

As crowds gathered near Paris’s Place de la Republique, protesters held aloft a placard with portraits of Macron, his prime minister and finance minister reading: “The ones kicking up the bloody mess.”

Unions have been divided over Macron’s reforms so far, with only the Communist Party-rooted CGT spearheading street demonstrations against the loosening of employment laws.

In Lyon, Force Ouvriere union boss Jean-Claude Mailly said he would not support the CGT’s call for the labor law decrees to be scrapped after weeks of negotiations between government and unions. But he said there would be other battles to fight with a united front.

“There are other issues ahead: unemployment insurance, pension reform, the matter of public services,” Mailly said.","Striking French workers disrupt flights, schools",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CF1OL

According to RBI data, new loans grew at just about 5 percent in the year to March, the lowest growth rate in more than six decades.
Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks will need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules.","MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian banks’ sour loans hit a record 9.5 trillion rupees ($145.56 billion) at the end of June, unpublished data shows, suggesting Asia’s third-largest economy is no nearer to bringing its bad debt problems under control.

A review of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data obtained through right-to-information requests shows banks’ total stressed loans - including non-performing and restructured or rolled over loans - rose 4.5 percent in the six months to end-June. In the previous six months they had risen 5.8 percent.

While banks remain the main source of funding for India’s companies, the stubborn bad debt problem has eaten into bank profits and choked off new lending, especially to smaller firms, at a time when an economy that depends on them is stalling.

India grew at its slowest pace in three years in April-June - a concern for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces elections in 2019 and has pledged to create millions of new jobs before then.

Banks are having to take higher provisions to account for more defaulters being pushed into bankruptcy. And margins are likely to be squeezed further by proposed new rules to encourage commercial banks to pass on central bank interest rate cuts.

To be sure, the bulk of India’s sour loans are in the state banks and stem from lending to large conglomerates, especially in steel and infrastructure. But analysts say the rise in bad loans among small firms, and even retail borrowing, is worrying and will do little to encourage new loans to help fuel growth.

“On the corporate side, we think it’s a recognition cycle which is nearing an end,” said Alka Anbarasu, senior analyst at Moody’s Investor Service, referring to more bad loans being recognized as such, as banks come under pressure from the RBI and other regulators. “But it’s really those data points beyond corporate that are causing some worry.”

Anbarasu forecast weak quarters ahead for banks before profitability picks up, and several senior bankers from public sector lenders - which account for more than two-thirds of Indian banking assets - agreed the months ahead would be strained.

Stressed loans as a percentage of total loans reached 12.6 percent at end-June, according to the RBI data, the highest level in at least 15 years.

HIGHER PROVISIONS, WEAKER LOANS

Part of the issue for banks and the government is a strict provisioning regime: the RBI wants banks to provide for at least 50 percent of the secured loans to companies taken to bankruptcy proceedings, and 100 percent for the unsecured part.

A dozen of the biggest such cases account for nearly 1.78 trillion rupees, or a quarter of total non-performing assets.

For those companies, banks will need to provide 180 billion rupees on top of existing provisions, according to July estimates from India Ratings and Research, the local affiliate of Fitch Ratings.

More than 20 other sizeable companies are at risk of being taken to bankruptcy court.

Bankers say these and other pressures - including rising government bond yields that forced banks to post mark-to-market losses - have added to the squeeze, and hit new loans.

According to RBI data, new loans grew at just about 5 percent in the year to March, the lowest growth rate in more than six decades. Several banks have already cut back their loan books to conserve capital.

“What are they (RBI) thinking while they’re taking these steps all at the same time?” said a treasurer at a state-run bank, who didn’t want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. “Do they want banks to wind up their businesses, or do they want to save the banks?”

Treasury income accounted for 22.7 percent of banks’ operating profits in the last financial year, doubling its share from a year earlier, India Ratings estimates.

“The almost zero treasury income will hit provisioning ability and, in turn, make it more difficult for weaker banks to give loans as capital becomes more scarce,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, an associate director at the rating agency.

A senior policymaker, who requested anonymity as the discussions are not public, said the government would have to help to sufficiently capitalize the banks.

Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks will need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules. Moody’s expects the top 11 state lenders alone will need nearly $15 billion. The government has just $3 billion left in its budget for bank recapitalization.

“We think capitalization is the biggest challenge for the banks at the moment, given that earnings will remain subdued and will not support any capital generation,” said Moody’s Anbarasu.",Exclusive: No respite for Indian banks as bad loans hit record $146 billion,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-banks-exclusive/exclusive-no-respite-for-indian-banks-as-bad-loans-hit-record-146-billion-idINKBN1CF1NT?il=0

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber said on Tuesday that paying National Insurance contributions for its British drivers would add tens of millions of pounds to the taxi app’s costs were they to be deemed employees.

Uber currently classifies its around 50,000 drivers in Britain as self-employed, affording them only basic entitlements, whilst employees also receive rights such as sick pay and the minimum wage.

Asked about how much it would cost in National Insurance payments if self-employed drivers were directly employed, the firm’s UK Head of Policy Andrew Byrne told parliament’s business committee:

“I don’t have the precise figures ... but I‘m certain it would be the tens of millions certainly.”

Also appearing before lawmakers, Deliveroo’s UK and Ireland Managing Director Dan Warne said additional costs including National Insurance contributions, would add around 1 pound ($1.32) to the cost of each hour.

National Insurance is collected by the government and helps pay for the state health service, pensions and certain other benefits.

Firms operating in the so-called gig economy - whereby people tend to work for different companies without a fixed contract - have been criticized by unions and some lawmakers for what they call exploitative practices.

Uber and Deliveroo both say their drivers enjoy the flexibility they offer but last year two drivers won a tribunal hearing against Uber and were granted worker rights, in a decision which the Silicon Valley firm appealed last month.

Uber’s Byrne said on Tuesday he expected the judge to make a ruling by around Christmas.

Uber is also battling to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the smartphone app of its license in the British capital. It has until Friday to lodge an appeal.

Byrne said he could hopefully see a way to address concerns by London’s transport regulator, which cited the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

“Hopefully we can see a path forward now with TfL (Transport for London) where we can address their concerns and continue to operate,” he said.",Uber says UK National Insurance contributions would cost tens of millions of pounds,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-britain-workers/uber-says-uk-national-insurance-contributions-would-cost-tens-of-millions-of-pounds-idUSKBN1CF15S?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

(Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics.

In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running.

Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully.

It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump.

“It’s certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said ‘I‘m not a politician,” said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. “We’ve shown that you don’t really need that background.”

The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said.

Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons.

His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts.

Trump’s ascendance shows that candidates’ backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven.

“Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters,” he said, “but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people.”

It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates’ backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be.

“Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don’t think people say, ‘Wall Street financier – that’s someone I can vote for,” he said.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate.

His campaign has focused on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire’s tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents.

Murphy has won support from labor unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him.

FILE PHOTO: Phil Murphy, a candidate for governor of New Jersey, speaks during the First Stand Rally in Newark, N.J., U.S. January 15, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo

An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy’s ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll.

“Obviously Goldman was his career,” said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. “Everyone has a career.”

In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same.

The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut’s problems.

In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats.

Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a “progressive entrepreneur” on his website.

Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters’ concerns, political historians said.

For instance, while Mitt Romney’s private-equity career helped doom his 2012 presidential bid, Illinois voters elected private equity executive Bruce Rauner as governor in 2014.",New Wall Street candidates emerge to test Trump-era appeal,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-bankers/new-wall-street-candidates-emerge-to-test-trump-era-appeal-idUSKBN1CE1BX?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The move follows a similar one-year suspension in Finland in July to allow a new taxi law to come into effect, however there is no set date for when UberPOP will be reintroduced in Norway.

The U.S. ride-hailing company has come under fierce pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules.

UberPOP has already been suspended in several European capitals, including Paris and Brussels, and Uber was recently humbled when it lost its license to operate in London.

“We’ve learned the hard way that we must change as a company in order to serve the millions of riders and drivers who rely on us. With our new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi onboard, it’s a new era for Uber,” the company said in a statement.

“That’s why it’s now time to pause UberPOP in Norway, in order to relaunch under new regulations.”

UberPOP will be suspended on Oct. 30, while Uber’s licensed services UberBLACK and UberXXL will continue to operate as normal.

The Uber logo is seen on mobile telephone in London, Britain, September 25, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay

The Norwegian transport minister said Uber was being treated as any other market participant would be. “All actors offering taxi services must conform to rules and regulation at any time,” Ketil Solvik-Olsen told Reuters.

The suspension of UberPOP in Norway comes as the non-EU country must answer by Oct. 27 a query on its transport regulations by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA), the body that ensures EU regulations are enforced in countries that have access to the European common market.

Uber will suspend UberPOP three days after that deadline.

In February, ESA said Norway was setting “disproportionately high barriers to enter the taxi market” that led to inefficient use of resources and higher prices for consumers.

Khosrowshahi took the helm of Uber in August, replacing co-founder and former boss Travis Kalanick and has promised change at the $70 billion dollar firm.

The company said it was encouraged by developments in Norway such as the government’s sharing economy committee which recommended repealing certain provisions related to taxis and an opinion from the EFTA surveillance authority which said Norway’s restrictions on taxi licenses were illegal.

“Norway deserves modernized laws that encourage innovation and competition without sacrificing what makes the Norwegian model special,” Uber said. “We hope the government will implement these recommendations soon, so that we can relaunch a new and improved version of the product loved by so many.”

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014.","The Trump administration is on the precipice of making a major – and little-noticed – mistake in its foreign policy. As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will pay up to C$750 million ($598 million) in compensation to thousands of aboriginals who were removed as children from their families decades ago, a top official said on Friday, promising to end “a terrible legacy.”

The move is the latest bid by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to repair ties with Canada’s often-marginalized indigenous population, which says it has been the victim of systemic racism for centuries.

In the so-called “Sixties Scoop,” welfare authorities took around 20,000 aboriginal children from their homes between the 1960s and 1980s and placed them in foster care or allowed them to be adopted by non-indigenous families.

The compensation package is designed to settle many of the lawsuits launched by survivors, who say the forced removal deprived them of their heritage and led to mental disorders, substance abuse and suicide.

“Language and culture, apology, healing -- these are essential elements to begin to right the wrong of this dark and painful chapter,” said Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister in charge of relations with the indigenous population.

Canada’s 1.4 million aboriginals, who make up about 4 percent of the population, experience higher levels of poverty and incarceration and have a lower life expectancy than other Canadians. They are often victims of violent crime and addiction.

Indigenous activists complain Trudeau has broken repeated promises to improve their lives since taking office in late 2015. He reshuffled his cabinet in August to put more emphasis on helping aboriginal people.

Bennett, at times fighting back tears, told a news conference she had heard “truly heartbreaking stories” about loss of identity and alienation.

Marcia Brown Martel, an aboriginal chief who led the campaign for compensation, lamented the “stealing of children” and noted some of those involved lived as far away as New Zealand.

“Think of it as a puzzle, a great big puzzle. Pieces, people are missing,” she told reporters.

Ottawa agreed the settlement after a Canadian court ruled earlier this year that the government breached its duty of care to the children.

One week after suffering a staggering collision with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is in the throes of an agonizing humanitarian disaster.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

Workers repair electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Debris and destruction left by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of cinema stocks dropped on Monday after domestic opening weekend ticket sales for science fiction sequel “Blade Runner 2049” fell short of expectations, the latest disappointment following an underwhelming U.S. summer movie season.

AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, Regal Entertainment Group and Cinemark Holdings Inc were all down, with price target cuts by Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also weighing on the shares.

Third-quarter domestic box office sales would be lower than previously expected, Pachter said in a report, “as several titles in the summer release slate failed to resonate with moviegoers.”

AMC fell 7.7 percent to $14.02, Regal Entertainment was down 4.4 percent at $16.04 and Cinemark lost 3.53 percent to $36.35.

“Blade Runner 2049” starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford pulled in $33 million in North America, according to Warner Bros.

That compared to an expected range of $45 million to $50 million, despite positive reviews and the popularity of the original 1982 “Blade Runner,” according to a report by Variety.com.

Other recent movies have fallen short of expectations, including “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” and “Baywatch,” in a slow U.S. summer movie season that underscored the trend of more consumers watching entertainment online.

Wedbush’s Pachter cut his price target on AMC to $20.50 from 22.75 and lowered his target for Regal Entertainment to $19 from $23.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could join a formal trade alliance with the United States, Canada and Mexico if the European Union refuses to clinch a post-Brexit trade deal, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Tuesday without citing sources.

The newspaper said British ministers were looking at the idea of joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as part of planning for possibility of Britain leaving the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal.

Britain’s international trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

Britain is currently negotiating the terms of its divorce from the EU though Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing to move onto discussions about a major free trade deal with the world’s biggest trading bloc.

With the clock ticking down toward Brexit day in 2019, British ministers are exploring what they will do if the world’s fifth largest economy drops out of the EU without a clear trade deal.

Besides aiming to clinch a U.S. trade deal or forming some new trade grouping, some British supporters of Brexit have pondered joining an existing trade deal such as NAFTA.

But U.S. President Donald Trump has warned he may terminate the 1994 NAFTA deal because he says it does not serve U.S. economic interests.

If Britain did join NAFTA, manufacturers wanting to export to the EU and North America would have to produce goods in accordance with the two separate sets of rules, according to trade analysts.

Britain, whose regulation has been within the EU’s orbit for over 40 years, would also have to shift toward the North American model for services, goods, competition policy and data protection.

The EU is Britain’s biggest single export market, accounting for about 50 percent of goods exports in August. The United States was the single biggest destination for British exports, accounting for 14 percent in August.",Britain could join NAFTA if it fails to get Brexit trade deal: Telegraph newspaper,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-nafta/britain-could-join-nafta-if-it-fails-to-get-brexit-trade-deal-telegraph-newspaper-idINKBN1CF18K?il=0

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - There’s no such thing as a founder who goes quietly. Weinstein Co, the film studio that ousted one of its two eponymous brothers amid sexual-harassment allegations, now joins other companies like Fox News and Uber that parted company with influential bosses who misbehaved, or stood idly by while others did. There’s dual risk, both from what the departing founder takes away and what they leave behind.

Harvey Weinstein’s exit followed charges that the executive producer of “The King’s Speech” and “Django Unchained” settled with women who claimed he sexually harassed them over three decades. Weinstein initially responded with a statement pledging to conquer his demons, and flagging up the culture of the 60s and 70s when rules were “different”. His private production company’s board pushed him out anyway.

After the purge comes the refurb. This is always more intricate when the departing boss is a founder. Think about Uber, whose prime mover Travis Kalanick was pushed out by investors concerned by the frat-boy behaviour of company managers. The ride-hailing app has now limited Kalanick’s remaining shareholder powers, appointed a clean-cut new chief, and brought in a new investor, SoftBank.

A deep clean is also still under way at Twenty-First Century Fox, where the controlling Murdoch family had to step in and fix its TV station’s culture after late founder Roger Ailes was purged amid a sexual-harassment scandal.

Weinstein Co will face two familiar problems. Influential industry figures perpetuate internal ways of operating that tend to outlive them. Like Uber’s Kalanick or Dov Charney, the ousted founder of failed fashion chain American Apparel, Weinstein grew out of an industry with a reputation for poor treatment of women. Things may change – and scandals help – but only glacially.

The other problem is that founders can take away the spark or contacts that helped their firms in the first place. Weinstein Co will be run by the other brother, Bob, and Chief Operating Officer David Glasser while an internal investigation proceeds. But will it be as effective without its formative double act? Such uncertainties may explain why boards often miss the moment when a founders’ comportment goes from a foible to a liability. Once they do, the grubby handprints are hard to scrub away.",Breakingviews - Harvey Weinstein saga will leave filthy handprints,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-harvey-weinstein-breakingviews/breakingviews-harvey-weinstein-saga-will-leave-filthy-handprints-idUSKBN1CE1ZR

A growing technology company would move fewer jobs overseas. And a regional bank would boost its spending on cybersecurity.

These are some of the uses of the tax savings that small and medium-sized U.S. companies say they would pursue if the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress slashed corporate taxes as promised.

Small companies pay the highest taxes and they would be the main beneficiaries of such a Trump windfall. Reuters contacted the 100 largest companies by market value in the benchmark Russell 2000 index of U.S. small and mid-cap stocks as well as another 50 in the Russell 2000 with no analyst coverage. None of the 17 companies that responded to Reuters queries mentioned boosting their headcount.

The administration has said the tax cuts would largely pay for themselves by spurring more investment and creating jobs.

But companies say they look to spend on technology that will allow them to improve productivity or make acquisitions rather than hire more workers.

“We want to be a company of the future, and technology is one of the key ingredients,” said Keith Cargill, chief executive at Dallas-based Texas Capital Bankshares Inc (TCBI.O), a bank with a market value of $4.2 billion. The tax cut would be a “huge plus” for earnings, Cargill said, but with little impact on the bank’s workforce.

The Russell 2000 companies tend to pay the highest effective tax rates now - an average of 31.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data - and would stand to gain the most if corporate taxes are cut to 20 percent from 35 percent as the Trump administration has proposed.

For large companies in the S&P 500, the average effective tax rate is 28 percent, a reflection of a greater share of overseas business and more leeway in reducing their tax rates.

While few companies would discuss any details in public before outlining them to their shareholders, executives, chief financial officers and treasures say they are already starting to formulate plans for a tax windfall even if they are not certain whether and in what form it will pass.

Neil Hennessy, the chief executive of Novato, California-based Hennessy Advisors Inc (HNNA.O), a mutual fund company, told Reuters he was in “acquisition mode” and would keep looking for targets in the event of a tax cut passing.

STRIP CLUBS AND SHARE BUYBACKS

One of the first firms to publicly discuss a potential tax windfall is RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc (RICK.O), a chain of 40 strip clubs headquartered in Houston, Texas. Its chief executive Eric Scott Langan told analysts on Aug. 9 that a tax cut would allow him to buy more clubs and boost the share price, which he complained failed to reflect the firm’s organic growth.

""I think that's going to change and I think that's when you're going to see the multiple expansion come into play,"" he said during an earnings call.

The tax cut would also affect companies which do not pay taxes now either because they are not yet profitable or are using past losses to offset their tax bills.

Paul Auvil, the chief financial officer at cybersecurity company Proofpoint Inc (PFPT.O), said that the $4 billion market-cap company expects to start paying taxes in 2021 when it no longer be able to offset past losses.

By then the corporate tax rate would need to sink at least below 27 percent, Auvil told Reuters. Otherwise Proofpoint would move its intellectual property to an offshore company in Europe, where corporate taxes are lower, which would mean hiring up to 100 back office staff there, said.

“These are jobs that have every reason to be in the U.S. but it will require tax reform.”

The prospects of a tax cut have helped push the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM.P) up about 10 percent over the last six weeks, compared with a 3.7 percent gain in the fund which tracks S&P 500 .SPX.

If the tax package does pass, large companies will be more likely to buy back their own stock, while smaller firms will probably reinvest in their businesses, said Tom Forte, an analyst at New York based D.A. Davidson.

“These companies are going to take every incremental cost savings from a tax cut and invest it to keep up with the Amazons (AMZN.O) and Ubers,” Forte said.

For instance, Forte expects EBay Inc (EBAY.O) to spend most of the possible windfall on increasing its stock buyback program. A smaller company like Yelp Inc (YELP.N) would probably invest in artificial intelligence technology to better harness its website’s advertising potential, he said.

GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N), meanwhile, would spend more on its service that delivers from restaurants that do not have their own delivery staff, Forte said, while Groupon Inc (GRPN.O) would invest more in marketing and advertising.

Some smaller companies are also considering share buybacks rather any significant changes to their capital allocation.

Thomas Castellano, treasurer at drug delivery company Catalent Inc (CTLT.N), told Reuters that the $5.2 billion company would keep spending on maintaining its 35 locations around the globe and look for possible acquisitions. Any extra money would go to share buybacks and Catalent was unlikely to increase its hiring rate if a tax cut passes, Castellano said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May pledged on Tuesday to “hold a mirror up to society” with a study showing sharp racial disparities in Britain, as she looks for a way to demonstrate her leadership is about more than just delivering Brexit.

Among the findings of the audit, the data showed Asian, black and other minority ethnic households were most likely to be in persistent poverty, that ethnic minorities have a lower employment rate than white people, and that they were under-represented in senior public sector jobs.

Bogged down by Brexit and losing her parliamentary majority in a snap election in June, May has struggled to deliver on social reforms to tackle what she has called “burning injustices” since taking control of the ruling Conservative party in July 2016.

Attempting to relaunch that agenda, she published the findings of a “Race Disparity Audit” which pulled together existing data from across sectors such as health, education, employment and the criminal justice system and analyzed it to discover how ethnicity affects people’s lives.

“This audit means that for society as a whole – for government, for our public services – there is nowhere to hide. These issues are now out in the open,” she told a private meeting to launch the report, according to her office.

“The message is very simple: if these disparities cannot be explained then they must be changed.”

May’s center-right Conservatives were blindsided in June’s election by a surge in support for the left-wing policies of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has presented higher state spending as part of the cure for voters he says have been let down years of cuts to public services.

“The prime minister has done nothing but exacerbate the problems. Far from tackling the burning injustices she has added fuel to the fire,” Labour’s equalities spokeswoman Dawn Butler said. She called for the government to start offering solutions to the problems the audit highlighted.

At last week’s Conservative conference, May was keen to show party members that she had a plan to counter Corbyn’s rise and allay fears that Brexit was squeezing out action on Britain’s social problems.

“It will hold a mirror up to society and allow us and wider society to see where action is needed,” May told a meeting of her senior ministers, according to a spokesman.

May’s deputy Damian Green said the audit’s findings were not “relentlessly negative”, but added in a forward to the document: “There is still a way to go before we have a country that works for everyone regardless of their ethnicity.”

BRUXELLES, 5 ottobre (Reuters) - Uno schema di garanzia europeo per i depositi bancari dovrebbe essere introdotto nella Ue più gradualmente di quanto programmato nel tentativo di ottenere il sostegno della Germania.

In una bozza, vista da Reuters, del documento che la Commissione europea presenterà la prossima settimana, si legge che lo schema di garanzia, conosciuto come Edis, potrebbe inizialmente dare sostegno solo per i depositi di banche fallite.

Il piano della Commissione, teso ad aumentare la stabilità finanziaria della zona euro, prevede che in un secondo tempo lo schema possa coprire le perdite.

Questa fase partirebbe solo dopo una sufficiente riduzione delle sofferenze da parte delle banche.

La Germania si sta opponendo da tempo a questo piano, temendo gli eccessivi costi per le banche tedesche.

Berlino si è sinora detta d‘accordo solo a uno schema sui depositi che li garantisca sino a 100.000 euro in tutta la zona euro, a condizione di una preliminare riduzione dei rischi di fallimento bancari.

Per questo è necessaria in alcuni paesi una significativa riduzione delle sofferenze del settore bancario, attualmente elevate. La Commissione ha dichiarato che la prossima primavera presenterà proposte per rendere più facile il recupero dei debiti.

La Commissione proporrà anche lo sviluppo del mercato secondario degli Npl, facilitandone la vendita.

Bruxelles sta anche considerando “livelli minimi di accantonamento che le banche dovranno fare per gli Npl”, misura che ridurrebbe i rischi da Npl ma aumenterebbe gli oneri delle banche.

Nel documento di 17 pagine la Commissione propone poi che la Bce, attualmente supervisore di 130 banche della zona euro, estenda i suoi poteri di vigilanza alle maggiori banche d‘affari e ai più grandi fondi.

Per ridurre i rischi legati ai fallimenti bancari la migliore opzione, per Bruxelles, continua a essere rappresentata dal Meccanismo europeo di stabilità (Esm) come paracadute per il Fondo di risoluzione unica che finanzia le risoluzioni bancarie.

La Commissione sta considerando di introdurre nel 2018 il quadro legale per abs con al loro interno titoli di Stato, proposta tesa a ridurre i rischi legati all‘eccessiva esposizione bancaria al debito sovrano stesso.

(Reuters) - Hackers are joining forces with U.S. governors and academics in a new group aimed at preventing the manipulation of voter machines and computer systems to sway the outcome of future U.S. elections, a source familiar with the project said on Monday.

The anti-hacking coalition’s members include organizers of last summer’s Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas, the National Governors Association and the Center for Internet Security, said the source, who asked not to be identified ahead of a formal announcement due to be made on Tuesday.

The Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank and several universities are also part of the project, the source said.

The coalition will be unveiled as Def Con organizers release a report describing vulnerabilities in voting machines and related technology that were uncovered in July.

Hackers pulled apart voting machines and election computers at the three-day event, uncovering security bugs that organizers said could be exploited by people trying to manipulate election results.

People at the Las Vegas conference learned to hack voting machines within minutes or just a few hours, according to a copy of the organizers’ report due for release on Tuesday and seen ahead of time by Reuters.

Concerns about election hacking have surged in the United States since late last year, when news surfaced that top U.S. intelligence agencies had determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered computer hacks of Democratic Party emails to help Republican Donald Trump win the Nov. 8 election.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said that Russian hackers targeted 21 U.S. state election systems in the 2016 presidential race and a small number were breached, although some states have disputed they were hacked. There was no evidence that any votes had been manipulated.

Several congressional committees are investigating and special counsel Robert Mueller is leading a separate probe into the Russia matter, including whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow.

Russia has denied the accusations.

As one possible counter-measure, organizers of the Def Con hacking conference have recommended that U.S. states reduce the amount of non-American parts and software used in their voting machines, according to the group’s report.

“Via a supply chain originating overseas, voting equipment and software can be compromised at the earliest of stages in manufacturing process,” the report says.

Further details on the members of the anti-hacking coalition were not immediately available.","U.S. governors, hackers, academics team up to secure elections",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-election-coalition/u-s-governors-hackers-academics-team-up-to-secure-elections-idUSKBN1CE2I2

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm has offered concessions in an attempt to allay EU antitrust concerns over its $38-billion bid for NXP Semiconductors, the largest ever in the semiconductor industry.

(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc unveiled a corporate makeover on Tuesday that will tie its growth more strongly to aerospace technology and spin off other businesses as two publicly-traded companies by the end of 2018.

The company also raised the low-end of its full-year 2017 earnings guidance by 5 cents to $7.05 - $7.10, and said it would spend the proceeds from the spin-offs on share buybacks, acquisitions and paying down debt.

Its shares fell 1 percent after Wall Street opened.

Honeywell Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk, like his peers at other industrial conglomerates, has been under pressure to pull apart a portfolio of disparate businesses that includes automotive turbo chargers, burglar alarms and the Xtratuf boots popular in Alaska’s fishing industry.

Honeywell had been under pressure from hedge fund Third Point to spin off the aerospace division, which accounted for about 36 percent of total revenue in 2016 and which Third Point said could generate $20 billion in shareholder value if sold.

The changes announced on Tuesday split off its home and ADI global distribution business - which deal with building systems running from air conditioning to smoke alarms - into one unit and transportation systems into a second.

They include the low-margin automotive turbocharger business, joining other companies, including auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, in shedding technology tied to the internal combustion engine as regulators around the world crack down on emissions and talk of mandating a switch to battery-electric vehicles over the next two decades.

Honeywell said the two spun-off business units together would generate annualized revenue of about $7.5 billion. It said it would gain $3 billion from the spin-offs.

Ahead of its quarterly earnings report, the company also said third quarter sales were expected to be $10.1 billion, up 5 percent in organic terms compared to an earlier forecast range of +/-1 percent.","Honeywell sticks with aerospace, spins off other units",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honeywell-intl-aerospace/honeywell-sticks-with-aerospace-spins-off-other-units-idUSKBN1CF0CO?il=0

The United States, Panama and Honduras, the three teamns who could provide the opposition, play their final qualifiers later on Tuesday.

The Syrians had battled the odds to even get into the playoff, having been forced to play all their “home” matches in Malaysia because of the civil war in their own nation.

Without five first-choice players through injury or suspension, they also had to play most of extra time with 10 men after midfielder Mahmoud Al Mawas was dismissed for two yellow cards.

“I think (it might have been different) if we had stayed with 11 players and hadn’t had that red card and not hit the post at the end,” Syria coach Ayman Hakeem told reporters.

“I am very proud of my boys with what they have achieved so far and that’s going to be continuing moving forward as well.”

Cahill scored Australia’s opener in the 13th minute but it was not until 96 minutes later that he notched up his 50th international goal to keep alive his country’s hopes of a fourth successive appearance at the World Cup finals.

It made for another nervous night for Australian fans as the Socceroos once again failed to find a way to get the scoreboard to reflect their dominance.

“We always find a difficult way to do things ... but we got through, I think we deserved to get through,” Australia coach Ange Postecoglou said.

“Timmy was Timmy, that’s why he’s the greatest ever.”

The Syrians made the perfect start in the sixth minute to cancel out Australia’s away goal advantage from the 1-1 first-leg draw.

Tamer Haj Mohamad dispossessed Mark Milligan in midfield and he fed Al Somah, who outpaced the Australian defence and planted the ball high into the net with his left foot.

DROPPED MIDFIELDER

The Asian champions were back on terms in 13th minute when Mathew Leckie broke down the right and delivered a pinpoint cross that 37-year-old Cahill headed home.

Australia dominated the remainder of the first half, with Syrian skipper Zaher Medani blocking a Cahill shot and goalkeeper Ibrahim Alma denying James Troisi and Leckie.

Alma again had to be at his best to stop a fierce Rogic strike from the edge of the box after 70 minutes and the Celtic midfielder curled a shot just wide of the far post from the ensuing corner.

Once Al Mawas was sent off for a second foul on Aaron Mooy four minutes into the first period of extra time, it appeared only a matter of time before the Australians would break down the already weary visitors.

Robbie Kruse finally carved out the decisive chance in the 109th minute when his perfectly weighted cross to the far post found Cahill, who headed the ball into the top left-hand corner of the net to the delight of the majority of the 42,000 crowd.",Cahill's extra-time winner dashes Syria dreams,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-worldcup-aus-syr/cahills-extra-time-winner-dashes-syria-dreams-idINKBN1CF1BF?il=0

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.",Born-again BlackBerry: Canadian icon hopes to ride trucks to growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-recovery/born-again-blackberry-canadian-icon-hopes-to-ride-trucks-to-growth-idUSKBN1901P1

HSBC will have demonstrated the same values if John Flint, head of retail banking and wealth management, replaces Stuart Gulliver when he steps down as chief executive next year. The consummate company man, who has spent nearly three decades at the sprawling Asia-focused lender, is awaiting approval from regulators, according to the Sunday Times. Installing Flint would continue the bank’s tradition of appointing insiders as CEO.

Such lack of radical change is hardly galling. HSBC has already broken with convention by installing Mark Tucker, an outsider, as chairman. The bank’s shareholders want a low-risk, diversified bank that produces steady payouts. After nearly seven years of restructuring and selling assets, Gulliver has largely achieved this. HSBC had a solid capital ratio of 14.7 percent at the end of June, well in excess of its 13 percent target, underpinning dividends. HSBC shares have outperformed the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index by a whopping 45 percent over the past two years and trade at a relatively healthy 1.2 times book value.

The bank’s net operating income – which deducts bad debt provisions but not expenses – has fallen by an average of 5.8 percent a year since 2011 as Gulliver sold businesses and shed low-returning assets. Tucker, newly recruited from AIA, could be forgiven for plotting a change of tack. Under his watch assets at the Asian insurer grew by 38 percent to $185 billion over the past five financial years, according to Eikon data. HSBC’s balance sheet shrank by 11 percent over the same period.

The bank is placing some bets: for example, it is redeploying $100 billion in risk-weighted assets to Asia, specifically the Pearl River Delta region in Southern China, in a quest to sign up middle-class customers. Investors who recall HSBC’s disastrous 2003 purchase of Household International – a bid to capture a bigger piece of the then-booming U.S. property market – might point to the perils of chasing debt-fuelled growth.

There is also more cleaning up to do. The bank has yet to make a compelling case for keeping a foothold in Mexico. Its 19 percent stake in China’s Bank of Communications also looks increasingly superfluous. Further disposals may disappoint those questing for headline-grabbing enlargement. Those who applaud HSBC’s conservative focus would be cheered.",Breakingviews - HSBC’s next challenge is how to grow responsibly,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hsbc-ceo-breakingviews/breakingviews-hsbcs-next-challenge-is-how-to-grow-responsibly-idUSKBN1CE1CX

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Fostering monetary conditions conducive to economic growth were a constant consideration for Indian policymakers, but would not take priority over achieving the central bank’s inflation target, Governor Urjit Patel told a newspaper on Monday.

Patel told the Mint newspaper that the economy was recovering, after growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter.

The slowdown had sparked some calls for lower interest rates, but with inflation rising the RBI left rates unchanged at a review by the monetary policy committee (MPC) last week.

“Growth is always there in the MPC’s scheme of things; we don’t lose sight of that, but not at the cost of inflation,” Patel was quoted as saying in the interview.

“However, we have to be careful — we should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.”

Consumer inflation accelerated to 3.36 percent in August. India’s central bank has a medium-term target for annual inflation of 4 percent with the flexibility of plus/minus 2 percent on either side to make room for food price volatility.

The (MPC) will strive to achieve its 4 percent inflation target on a “durable basis”, Patel said.

Last week, the RBI kept its repo rate unchanged at 6.00 percent as expected last week, and raised inflation projections, cooling hopes for future rate cuts.

However, Patel said growth was already starting to recover. The RBI last week cut its projection for gross value added - an indicator of growth it prefers to 6.7 percent from 7.3 percent for the year ending in March - higher than some analyst forecasts.

“Our projections based on high frequency real economy indicators suggest that growth will pick up in the third and fourth quarters (of the current fiscal year) to above 7 percent,” he told Mint.

“We have started seeing the upturn.”

Patel has given only a handful of interviews since taking over as RBI Governor late last year.

Or, as some conservatives fear, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be prime minister.","British politics are a terrible mess. But don’t blame populism, however that’s defined. If anything, blame democracy – however that’s organized.

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one. They have given their country’s leadership one monster of a job: to reconcile what is a still globalizing world with their need for esteem and a restored sense that their country is recognizable, and that it is theirs.

Chicago (1-4) dropped its second consecutive game.

Keenum rejuvenated the Vikings’ offense. He opened the second half with a 13-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with a 13-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph. The play extended the Vikings’ lead to 10-2.

A fake punt pulled the Bears within 10-9. Punter Pat O‘Donnell caught a long snap and calmly lobbed a pass to Benny Cunningham, who spun off a tackle and raced 38 yards to the end zone.

Minnesota made it 17-9 on a 58-yard touchdown run by Jerick McKinnon late in the third quarter. McKinnon burst through the right side of the offensive line for his first touchdown of the season.

Chicago evened the score at 17 on a touchdown and a two-point conversion with 12:24 to go in the fourth quarter. Trubisky spotted tight end Zach Miller in the end zone and fired a 20-yard pass that deflected off the outstretched hand of Vikings safety Andrew Sendejo and landed in Miller’s hands.

Moments later, Trubisky ran for a two-point conversion on a trick play that fooled the Vikings’ defense.

The Bears’ defense recorded a safety to open the scoring with 1:31 remaining in the first quarter. Defensive end Leonard Floyd sacked Bradford in the end zone to give Chicago a 2-0 advantage.

Minnesota grabbed a 3-2 lead on a 26-yard field goal by Forbath with 1:02 remaining in the first half. Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen set up the score with a strip-sack in the red zone.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Yuriko Koike says she went into politics to be a player, not a bystander.

Now Tokyo’s first female governor is shaking things up as her new “Party of Hope” challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 poll, called by the Japanese leader to seek a fresh mandate after nearly five years in office.

When the Berlin Wall dividing East and West Germany was breached in 1989, Koike was a 37-year-old TV announcer. Three years later, she ran for parliament.

“The world was changing immensely, so I went from news presenter to newsmaker. I decided Japanese politics was moving too slowly and rather than be an outside critic, I should become ... a player on the inside,” Koike told Reuters in an interview.

Koike, who defied Abe’s party last year to run for governor, isn’t seeking a seat in parliament’s lower house herself, but is the driving force – and public face – of her upstart party.

In many ways, Koike is a paradox, interviews with people who know her and a review of her career show.

She’s a global thinker with a nationalist tinge; an entrepreneurial outsider who climbed the ladder with help from old-boy mentors, and a risk taker who has balked at perhaps her biggest gamble by declining to run in the national election now.

Koike has made no secret of her ambition to be Japan’s first woman prime minister – her pet female terrier is nicknamed “So-chan” – a diminutive for “sori” or “premier” in Japanese.

She has already cracked a few glass ceilings.

She became the country’s first female defense minister in 2007, although stepped down after 55 days after a tussle with a top bureaucrat. She was also the first woman to run for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s top leadership post in 2008, but came in a distant third.

Koike comes from a business family in western Japan, a background that sets her apart from many Japanese politicians, including Abe, who are scions of blue-blood political dynasties.

Her origins may account for a style that admirers say has more in common with venture capitalists than staid lawmakers.

“She’s not afraid to take initiatives, which in most of Japan is deeply frowned upon,” said a person who has known her for 25 years and advises on financial reforms. “In Japan, it’s subtlety within riddles, but she’s blunt.”

Koike has a talent for political marketing - critics call it populism - a skill she is using as she tries to differentiate her conservative party from Abe’s equally conservative LDP with promises to “break the fetters” of vested interest politics.

She calls her party’s economic policies “Yurinomics” in contrast to Abe’s “Abenomics, and its platform includes “12 Zeroes” it wants to achieve, including “zero hayfever”, and “zero euthanasia of unwanted pets”.

“DARK SIDE”

A graduate of Cairo University in 1976 who speaks Arabic and English, Koike in some ways has a global perspective and often sings the praises of diversity.

Like Abe, she advocates opening Japan to more highly skilled foreign workers. Also like Abe, she has visited Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism, but told Reuters she would not do so if she became premier.

Koike also espouses some causes dear to Japan’s rightwing, including revising the post-war, pacifist constitution.

In the past, she has even suggested Japan should consider acquiring nuclear weapons, breaking a taboo in the only country to suffer a nuclear attack. She also opposes local voting rights for foreign residents, many of whom are of Korean descent.

“There is a dark side that doesn’t jibe with a more open-minded, dare we say, liberal view,” said her long-time acquaintance.

Koike migrated through several parties before joining the LDP in 2002, only to abandon it after becoming governor.

She counts among her mentors Ichiro Ozawa, a one-time LDP heavyweight who helped engineer the long-ruling party’s ouster in 1993 and again in 2009, as well as popular ex-premier Junichiro Koizumi.

Critics say her career reflects an opportunist streak, while allies call it practical.

”She wants to make change, but she’s also pragmatic – she can make a deal with anyone – Communists or Abe or traditional stakeholders,” said another adviser. “It’s a kind of talent.”

Despite speculation that she would abandon her job as governor to return to parliament, Koike stuck to her decision not to run. Analysts say that’s likely because her party has little chance of defeating Abe’s ruling bloc, but may do well enough for her to take the leap in the next poll.

But those who know Koike say her desire for the nation’s top post remains. “Is she Machiavellian and strategic? The answer is yes. Is she prepared to think for the long run? The answer is yes,” said her long-time acquaintance.

“Is her over-riding ambition to be Japan’s first female prime minister? That is definitely a goal.”",Japan's Koike: a political paradox shakes things up ahead of poll,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-japan-election-koike/japans-koike-a-political-paradox-shakes-things-up-ahead-of-poll-idUKKBN1CF1QF?il=0

Rohingya Muslims are still fleeing, more than six weeks after Rohingya insurgents attacked security forces in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state.

The United Nations has denounced a ferocious military crackdown in response to the attacks as ethnic cleansing aimed at driving out Rohingya.

A new surge of refugees has entered Bangladesh in recent days, including about 11,000 on Monday. Some have told of increasing hunger in Rakhine as well as of more mob attacks on Muslim villagers.

Despite growing international condemnation of the refugee crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged in recent years.

The party of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi took the first step toward trying to ease animosity with inter-faith prayers at a stadium in the biggest city of Yangon, with Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Christians and others.

Thousands of people packed the stands of the stadium, with Buddhist monks, Hindus, Christian nuns and Muslim men with beards and caps listening to religious leaders who took turns to appeal for friendship.

”Be free from killing one another, be free from torturing one another, be free from destroying or demolishing one another,” the chief Buddhist monk of Yangon, Iddhibala, told the crowd.

Stepping off the podium, he shook hands with Muslim leader Hafiz Mufti Ali.

”Citizens should collaborate in friendship and work for the country,“ Ali said, adding: ”Freedom of life, freedom of education, freedom of religion, it is absolutely necessary for the country to fulfill all these rights.”

The Rohingya had pinned hopes for change on Suu Kyi’s party but it has been wary of Buddhist nationalist pressure. Her party did not field a single Muslim candidate in the 2015 election that it swept.

Rohingya are not classified as an indigenous minority in Myanmar and so are denied citizenship under a law that links nationality to ethnicity.

Regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, they face restrictions and discrimination and are derided by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists in Rakhine, and by much of the wider population.

The militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) who launched the Aug. 25 attacks that triggered the latest spasm of violence are demanding full citizenship rights and recognition as an indigenous community.

CEASEFIRE ENDS

A one-month ceasefire the insurgents called in September in order, they said, to ease aid deliveries to Rakhine, expired at midnight on Monday, but authorities said there was no sign of any new attacks.

The government rebuffed the ceasefire, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing. It says more than 500 people have been killed in the violence since late August, most of them ARSA “terrorists”.

Even before the government offensive, the small, lightly armed ARSA appeared only capable of hit-and-run raids and unable to mount any sort of sustained challenge to the army.

The insurgents said on Saturday they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government, even though their ceasefire was ending.

Reports of food shortages in Rakhine will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

Villagers said food was running out because rice crops were not ready for harvest and authorities had shut village markets and limited food transport, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

The government has cited worry about food as a main reason people have cited for leaving, but a senior state government official dismissed any suggestion of starvation.

Among those fleeing were more than 30 people on a boat that capsized off Bangladesh on Sunday. Twenty-five people drowned, 13 of them children, police said.",Myanmar takes first step to ease Buddhist-Muslim tension,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CF08D

LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.

Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of hostile statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.

Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organization. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.

“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, said.

“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behavior. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”

Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.

“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.

Iran’s moderate president Hasan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticizing the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.

“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures,” he added.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”

The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.

But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s missile program and over allegations it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.

The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.

The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.

“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.

Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile program. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.

Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile program. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”. In an article published in the Atlantic on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles … unless it intends to attack our territory.”","Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-irgc/iran-hardliners-pragmatists-show-unity-in-response-to-trump-idUSKBN1CF0R0

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Friday its general counsel, Bruce Sewell, will retire and be succeeded by former Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) executive Katherine Adams, who will take over Apple’s multinational legal battle against Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).

Adams, who will also be senior vice president of legal and global security, will report to Chief Executive Tim Cook, the company said.

Before joining Honeywell in 2003, Adams was an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP in New York. Earlier, she had served as a clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and for Stephen Breyer, who was then an appeals court judge but later was appointed to the Supreme Court.

Sewell, who has been Apple’s general counsel since 2009, will retire at the end of the year, the company said. Sewell, who came to Apple from Intel Corp (INTC.O), guided Apple through its massive patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) over design patents for the original iPhone, a case that is still simmering nearly six years after it was filed and eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. A U.S. appeals court is currently working to decide the final amount of damages Samsung owes Apple.

In taking the legal reins at Apple, Adams will take over a wide-ranging dispute with Qualcomm over how that chipmaker licenses its technology to Apple. At the heart of the dispute is Qualcomm’s long-held practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iPhones and other Apple devices as a licensing fee for its mobile connectivity patent portfolio.

Apple has sued Qualcomm over that practice in U.S. civil courts as well as 11 foreign jurisdictions. Qualcomm has brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones. Qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action.

Qualcomm also faces an antitrust complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In addition, four of Apple’s contract manufacturers have sued Qualcomm on antitrust allegations, and Apple has joined that lawsuit.",Apple names former Honeywell executive as new general counsel,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-moves/apple-names-former-honeywell-executive-as-new-general-counsel-idUSKBN1CB211

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber said on Tuesday that paying National Insurance contributions for its British drivers would add tens of millions of pounds to the taxi app’s costs were they to be deemed employees.

Uber currently classifies its around 50,000 drivers in Britain as self-employed, affording them only basic entitlements, whilst employees also receive rights such as sick pay and the minimum wage.

Asked about how much it would cost in National Insurance payments if self-employed drivers were directly employed, the firm’s UK Head of Policy Andrew Byrne told parliament’s business committee:

“I don’t have the precise figures ... but I‘m certain it would be the tens of millions certainly.”

Also appearing before lawmakers, Deliveroo’s UK and Ireland Managing Director Dan Warne said additional costs including National Insurance contributions, would add around 1 pound ($1.32) to the cost of each hour.

National Insurance is collected by the government and helps pay for the state health service, pensions and certain other benefits.

Firms operating in the so-called gig economy - whereby people tend to work for different companies without a fixed contract - have been criticized by unions and some lawmakers for what they call exploitative practices.

Uber and Deliveroo both say their drivers enjoy the flexibility they offer but last year two drivers won a tribunal hearing against Uber and were granted worker rights, in a decision which the Silicon Valley firm appealed last month.

Uber’s Byrne said on Tuesday he expected the judge to make a ruling by around Christmas.

Uber is also battling to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the smartphone app of its license in the British capital. It has until Friday to lodge an appeal.

Byrne said he could hopefully see a way to address concerns by London’s transport regulator, which cited the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.

Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of hostile statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.

Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organization. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.

“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, said.

“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behavior. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”

Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.

“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.

Iran’s moderate president Hasan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticizing the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.

“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures,” he added.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”

The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.

But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s missile program and over allegations it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.

The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.

The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.

“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.

Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile program. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.

Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile program. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”. In an article published in the Atlantic on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles … unless it intends to attack our territory.”","Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump",https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-usa-irgc/iran-hardliners-pragmatists-show-unity-in-response-to-trump-idINKBN1CF0QV

(Reuters) - Hackers are joining forces with U.S. governors and academics in a new group aimed at preventing the manipulation of voter machines and computer systems to sway the outcome of future U.S. elections, a source familiar with the project said on Monday.

The anti-hacking coalition’s members include organizers of last summer’s Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas, the National Governors Association and the Center for Internet Security, said the source, who asked not to be identified ahead of a formal announcement due to be made on Tuesday.

The Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank and several universities are also part of the project, the source said.

The coalition will be unveiled as Def Con organizers release a report describing vulnerabilities in voting machines and related technology that were uncovered in July.

Hackers pulled apart voting machines and election computers at the three-day event, uncovering security bugs that organizers said could be exploited by people trying to manipulate election results.

People at the Las Vegas conference learned to hack voting machines within minutes or just a few hours, according to a copy of the organizers’ report due for release on Tuesday and seen ahead of time by Reuters.

Concerns about election hacking have surged in the United States since late last year, when news surfaced that top U.S. intelligence agencies had determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered computer hacks of Democratic Party emails to help Republican Donald Trump win the Nov. 8 election.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said that Russian hackers targeted 21 U.S. state election systems in the 2016 presidential race and a small number were breached, although some states have disputed they were hacked. There was no evidence that any votes had been manipulated.

Several congressional committees are investigating and special counsel Robert Mueller is leading a separate probe into the Russia matter, including whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow.

Russia has denied the accusations.

As one possible counter-measure, organizers of the Def Con hacking conference have recommended that U.S. states reduce the amount of non-American parts and software used in their voting machines, according to the group’s report.

“Via a supply chain originating overseas, voting equipment and software can be compromised at the earliest of stages in manufacturing process,” the report says.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - On paper, Catalonia looks viable as an independent state. The region which accounts for around a fifth of Spain’s economy has gross domestic product roughly comparable to Finland’s. Its residents are on average richer and more likely to have a job than other Spaniards. Nevertheless, the economic odds are stacked against the secessionists.

First, Catalonia may become much less wealthy if it breaks away. Some large companies are taking steps to transfer their registered headquarters out of the region following the Oct. 1 independence referendum that was branded unconstitutional by the central government. They include Banco Sabadell, Spain’s fifth-largest lender, which decided on Thursday to move its legal base to Alicante. The more likely independence becomes, the greater the chances that jobs and actual activity shift elsewhere.

Second, breaking away would trigger harmful disputes over tax and debt with Madrid, which trenchantly opposes a divorce. Granted, Catalonia pays more in taxes to the central government than it receives in spending. But unilaterally declaring independence would not necessarily allow the region to stand on its own. Citizens and businesses might face duplicate tax demands from Barcelona and Madrid. In the event of a standoff, companies with branch offices in Spain could be presented with bills for the whole business.

There’s also the thorny issue of how to smooth out Catalan debt obligations, which it currently does with the help of state liquidity. Net borrowing from the central government surpassed 50 billion euros at the end of 2016, equivalent to three-quarters of Catalonia’s total debt, according to Fitch. The credit rating firm also points out that more than a quarter of debt outstanding at the end of 2016 comes due over the next three years. And that’s assuming Catalonia can escape without taking on any of Spain’s sovereign debt, currently equivalent to around 100 percent of national GDP.

A final problem is what currency Catalonia would use. Even if independence were recognised by other countries, the region is unlikely to remain a part of the euro zone. Granted, it could always create a currency that is pegged to the euro. But a newly-created Catalan central bank would need access to foreign exchange reserves that the central government has no interest in handing over. Politics are not the only bar to independence.",Breakingviews - Economic odds stacked against Catalonia breakaway,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-catalonia-breakingviews/breakingviews-economic-odds-stacked-against-catalonia-breakaway-idUSKBN1CB1DY

In a blunt and personal attack on outgoing ambassador John Bass, Erdogan suggested Bass acted unilaterally in suspending visa services in Turkey after the arrest of a U.S. consulate worker, and said “agents” had infiltrated U.S. missions.

The dispute has plunged already fragile relations between the two NATO allies to a new low after months of tension linked to the conflict in Syria, last year’s failed military coup in Turkey, and U.S. court cases against Turkish officials.

The U.S. embassy said on Sunday night it was suspending visa services while it assessed Turkey’s commitment to the safety of its missions and its staff, a message reiterated in a video released by Bass late on Monday.

“An ambassador in Ankara taking decisions and saying he is doing so in the name of his government is strange,” Erdogan said. “If our ambassador did this, we wouldn’t keep him there even a minute.”

The embassy said allegations that the arrested employee had links to Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the failed coup against Erdogan last year, were baseless.

But Erdogan said the arrest, and a police request to question a second consulate employee, showed “there is something cooking in the U.S. consulate in Istanbul... How did these agents infiltrate the U.S. consulate?”

He said Bass, who is due to leave the country within days to take up a posting in Afghanistan, had been making farewell visits to government offices.

“But our ministers, parliament speaker and myself did not accept and will not accept his request because we do not see him as a representative of the United States,” Erdogan told a televised news conference during a visit to Belgrade.

“NOT TRIBES”

Turkey’s currency and stock market were both hit on Monday by the dispute. On Tuesday, the main BIST 100 stock index rebounded, rising 1.94 percent by 1320 GMT, and the lira was also up 1 percent at 3.6675 to the dollar.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the visa suspension had punished citizens of both countries, and accused Washington of taking an emotional and inappropriate step against an ally.

“You are making your citizens and ours pay the price,” he said. “We call on the United States to be more reasonable. The issue must of course be resolved as soon as possible,” he said, describing U.S. behavior as “unbecoming” of an ally.

In a speech in Ankara to ruling AK Party parliamentarians, Yildirim also defended Turkey’s decision to retaliate with its own visa suspension after the U.S. embassy announcement.

“Turkey is not a tribal state, we will retaliate against what has been done in kind,” he said.

Relations between the countries have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and Turkey’s so far unsuccessful calls for Gulen’s extradition.

U.S. courts have also indicted a Turkish banker and a former minister for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran, as well as 15 of Erdogan’s security guards for attacking peaceful protesters during his visit to Washington in May.

“Did you ask permission from us when you dragged a general manager from our national bank into jail?” Yildirim said. “Why are you harboring Gulen? Does this fit our alliance or friendship?”

Yildirim said if the United States wanted to continue its alliance with Turkey it should stop support for YPG fighters battling Islamic State in Syria. Turkey says the YPG is an extension of the outlawed PKK which has fought a three-decade insurgency in southeast Turkey.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A public feud between President Donald Trump and influential fellow Republican Bob Corker could narrow the path for a tax overhaul in the U.S. Senate, where a Republican go-it-alone effort is already showing signs of disunity.

Days after the Republican-controlled Congress took important steps toward advancing tax legislation, Trump’s Twitter attacks on Senator Corker over the weekend threatened to further alienate the president from other key Republicans such as Senator John McCain, whose “No” vote was pivotal in the party’s failure to repeal Obamacare in July.

Although a foreign policy specialist, Corker is also a key player in the tax debate.

He helped the Senate move closer to legislation by agreeing to a budget resolution that would allow tax reforms to reduce government revenue by up to $1.5 trillion over a decade, but he wants savings elsewhere and has vowed not to vote for a tax package that adds to the federal deficit.

Republicans hope Corker will ultimately vote for tax reform in hopes of boosting economic growth. But Trump’s tweets do not help, especially now that Corker has decided against seeking re-election next year and is free to vote whichever way he wants without having to face voters again.

Republicans are desperate to push through tax reform, seeing it as their last good chance to get a major legislative victory in the first year since 2006 that the party has controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress.

Trump and top Republican lawmakers have unveiled a plan to slash taxes for businesses and individuals, the first comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax code since 1986. They hope to get it done by January.

The tax push has been dogged by delays and distractions such as Trump’s criticisms of his own party’s leaders, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan.

The latest incident erupted on Sunday when Trump lashed out at Corker in a series of derisive tweets saying the lawmaker had “begged” him for his endorsement ahead of the midterm election next year and announced his retirement after being turned down.

Corker replied by describing the White House as an adult day care center, and told the New York Times that Trump risks setting the country on the path to “World War Three”.

The spat complicates things for Republicans as they try to move tax legislation through the Senate, which they control by a slim 52-48 margin. Most Democrats oppose the plan, and Republicans cannot pass it if they lose support from more than two lawmakers of their own party.

“This is a delicate balance,” said Stephen Moore, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who helped write Trump’s campaign tax plan. “It all comes down to whether you can get 50 votes in the Senate. Right now, by my count, they’re at about 48. A few votes short.”

Divisions have emerged over proposals to repeal the federal inheritance tax and a popular deduction for state and local taxes. Senate Republican Rand Paul has expressed unhappiness over reports that Trump’s tax plan could raise taxes on some middle-class Americans.

Republicans need to keep Corker on board and prevent him from becoming a maverick like McCain, known for his sharply independent streak.

“Bob Corker, at this point, is as free as John McCain is to do what he thinks is right,” said William Galston, who was a domestic policy adviser to former President Bill Clinton.

Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist with close ties to Congress and the White House, said he thinks most Republican senators will get in line despite their concerns over Trump’s treatment of their colleagues.

“While it may really bother other Senate Republicans and it’s unnerving that one of their own is being attacked, most aren’t retiring and know they must still work with the White House or answer to frustrated voters,” Bonjean said.",Trump-Corker spat complicates drive for tax reform in U.S. Senate,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/trump-corker-spat-complicates-drive-for-tax-reform-in-u-s-senate-idUSKBN1CE29Y?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

A wrap-up of the week in sports news:

It ain’t your grandpa’s Nintendo: As e-sports become increasingly popular, the high-tech tournaments are grappling with some age-old problems: match-fixing and doping.

Penguins hope to glide toward a three-peat: The National Hockey League kicked off a new season this week, with the Pittsburgh Penguins hoping for a rare three-peat as Stanley Cup Champions. Of course, they lost their first two games – including a Thursday night 10-1 drubbing at the hands of the Chicago Blackhawks – so they’ll need to waddle those losses off first.

While the referendum is non-binding and the final vote tally may not be known for several days (though it will certainly be “yes” to independence), the true results of America’s decades of war in Iraq are already clear.

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice ""Iraq"" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

Tania Karas: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.",Commentary: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-kurds-commentary/commentary-why-the-kurdish-referendum-means-the-end-of-iraq-idUSKCN1C125Q

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he has prepared an “economic-development” measure that would punish companies that globally outsource jobs.

The bill would provide economic incentives for companies, Trump said in an interview with Forbes magazine published on Tuesday, and reward firms that maintain jobs in the United States, and deliver punitive measures against those that move operations offshore.

“It’s both a carrot and a stick,” Trump said. “It is an incentive to stay. But it is perhaps even more so - if you leave, it’s going to be very tough for you to think that you’re going to be able to sell your product back into our country.”

He did not specify what the rewards or punishments would be. The White House was not immediately available to comment.

(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) on Tuesday unveiled a $20 billion share buyback plan and forecast U.S. online sales to increase by about 40 percent in the fiscal year ending January 2019.

Wal-Mart’s shares were up 1.6 percent at $81.80 in premarket trading after the company also forecast overall net sales to increase by at least 3 percent in the same period.

The company, locked in a battle for market share with ecommerce giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), has been doubling down on its online business and is leveraging its 4,700 plus stores to create a more hassle-free experience for its online shoppers.

Wal-Mart reported a 60 percent jump in online sales in the United States in its latest quarter ended July.

“It is clear that Wal-Mart intends to continue to turn up the heat online, with 40 percent annual growth an impressive goal, especially on the heels of the 30 percent outlined at the 2016 investor meeting, which at the time seemed aspirational in our view,” Moody’s Lead Retail Analyst Charlie O‘Shea said.

The largest U.S. grocery retailer also said it expects to add 1,000 locations for shipping online grocery orders in fiscal year 2019. It currently ships online orders from more than 900 U.S. locations.

Competition in the grocery space has increased since Amazon bought Whole Foods and cut prices at the upmarket grocer in August.

The company forecast profit for fiscal year 2019 to increase about 5 percent over the expected adjusted earnings of $4.30 to $4.40 per share for the year ending January 2018.

The company also raised the low-end of its full-year 2017 earnings guidance by 5 cents to $7.05 - $7.10, and said it would spend the proceeds from the spin-offs on share buybacks, acquisitions and paying down debt.

Its shares fell 1 percent after Wall Street opened.

Honeywell Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk, like his peers at other industrial conglomerates, has been under pressure to pull apart a portfolio of disparate businesses that includes automotive turbo chargers, burglar alarms and the Xtratuf boots popular in Alaska’s fishing industry.

Honeywell had been under pressure from hedge fund Third Point to spin off the aerospace division, which accounted for about 36 percent of total revenue in 2016 and which Third Point said could generate $20 billion in shareholder value if sold.

The changes announced on Tuesday split off its home and ADI global distribution business - which deal with building systems running from air conditioning to smoke alarms - into one unit and transportation systems into a second.

They include the low-margin automotive turbocharger business, joining other companies, including auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, in shedding technology tied to the internal combustion engine as regulators around the world crack down on emissions and talk of mandating a switch to battery-electric vehicles over the next two decades.

Honeywell said the two spun-off business units together would generate annualized revenue of about $7.5 billion. It said it would gain $3 billion from the spin-offs.

Ahead of its quarterly earnings report, the company also said third quarter sales were expected to be $10.1 billion, up 5 percent in organic terms compared to an earlier forecast range of +/-1 percent.","Honeywell sticks with aerospace, spins off other units",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-honeywell-intl-aerospace/honeywell-sticks-with-aerospace-spins-off-other-units-idUSKBN1CF0CO?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Rohingya Muslims are still fleeing, more than six weeks after Rohingya insurgents attacked security forces in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state.

The United Nations has denounced a ferocious military crackdown in response to the attacks as ethnic cleansing aimed at driving out Rohingya.

A new surge of refugees has entered Bangladesh in recent days, including about 11,000 on Monday. Some have told of increasing hunger in Rakhine as well as of more mob attacks on Muslim villagers.

Despite growing international condemnation of the refugee crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged in recent years.

The party of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi took the first step toward trying to ease animosity with inter-faith prayers at a stadium in the biggest city of Yangon, with Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Christians and others.

Thousands of people packed the stands of the stadium, with Buddhist monks, Hindus, Christian nuns and Muslim men with beards and caps listening to religious leaders who took turns to appeal for friendship.

”Be free from killing one another, be free from torturing one another, be free from destroying or demolishing one another,” the chief Buddhist monk of Yangon, Iddhibala, told the crowd.

Stepping off the podium, he shook hands with Muslim leader Hafiz Mufti Ali.

”Citizens should collaborate in friendship and work for the country,“ Ali said, adding: ”Freedom of life, freedom of education, freedom of religion, it is absolutely necessary for the country to fulfill all these rights.”

The Rohingya had pinned hopes for change on Suu Kyi’s party but it has been wary of Buddhist nationalist pressure. Her party did not field a single Muslim candidate in the 2015 election that it swept.

Rohingya are not classified as an indigenous minority in Myanmar and so are denied citizenship under a law that links nationality to ethnicity.

Regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, they face restrictions and discrimination and are derided by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists in Rakhine, and by much of the wider population.

The militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) who launched the Aug. 25 attacks that triggered the latest spasm of violence are demanding full citizenship rights and recognition as an indigenous community.

CEASEFIRE ENDS

A one-month ceasefire the insurgents called in September in order, they said, to ease aid deliveries to Rakhine, expired at midnight on Monday, but authorities said there was no sign of any new attacks.

The government rebuffed the ceasefire, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing. It says more than 500 people have been killed in the violence since late August, most of them ARSA “terrorists”.

Even before the government offensive, the small, lightly armed ARSA appeared only capable of hit-and-run raids and unable to mount any sort of sustained challenge to the army.

The insurgents said on Saturday they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government, even though their ceasefire was ending.

Reports of food shortages in Rakhine will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

Villagers said food was running out because rice crops were not ready for harvest and authorities had shut village markets and limited food transport, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

The government has cited worry about food as a main reason people have cited for leaving, but a senior state government official dismissed any suggestion of starvation.

Among those fleeing were more than 30 people on a boat that capsized off Bangladesh on Sunday. Twenty-five people drowned, 13 of them children, police said.",Myanmar takes first step to ease Buddhist-Muslim tension,https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-takes-first-step-to-ease-buddhist-muslim-tension-idINKBN1CF089

GENEVA (Reuters) - Geneva prosecutors are investigating after toilets in a bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination euro banknotes, they said on Monday.

“We are not so interested in the motive but we want to be sure of the origin of the money,” spokesman Vincent Derouand said, adding that neither throwing money away nor blocking a toilet was a crime.

The Tribune de Geneve newspaper, which first reported the unusual deposit, said the first blockage occurred in the toilet serving the vault at UBS bank (UBSG.S) in Geneva’s financial district, and three nearby bistros found their facilities bunged up with 500-euro notes a few days later.

Derouand said two people had agreed to compensate the restaurants for the costs of the blockage, and the restaurants had withdrawn a complaint that they made when the incident happened in May.

The cash was confiscated during the investigation and it was unclear who would get it if it was found to be lawful. There was no immediate reason to think it was dirty money, Derouand said.

The European Central Bank said last year it had decided to discontinue the 500-euro note because of concerns that it was being used too often for illicit activities including money laundering.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s gold imports in September rose 31 percent from a year ago as jewellers increased their purchases ahead of a festival at the end of the month, provisional data from GFMS showed.

Higher purchases by India, the world’s second-biggest consumer, could lend support to global prices that are trading near their highest level in a week. The higher imports may also widen the South Asian country’s trade deficit.

The country’s imports were 48 tonnes in September, Sudheesh Nambiath, a senior analyst with GFMS, a division of Thomson Reuters, said on Tuesday.

Much of the gain last month was simply due to the Indian holiday of Dussehra being celebrated on Sept. 30, rather than in October last year, as the holiday shifts since it is based on a lunar calendar.

Gold buying during Dussehra is considered auspicious.

“This year since Dussehra was advanced by a fortnight, import numbers for September are looking better than last year,” said a Mumbai-based bullion dealer with a private bank.

However, the September figure was lower than the monthly average for 2017 of 75 tonnes, because buyers were wary of purchasing gold since purchases were counted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) beginning in August.

“Dussehra demand was weak due to the PMLA,” said the Mumbai dealer.

Indian jewellers thought the PMLA required them to keep records of customers’ personal identification number or tax code for transactions above 50,000 rupees ($765.58), which limited gold sales by buyers hesitant to give the information.

Indian authorities on Friday withdrew the amendment that made jewellers subject to anti-money laundering legislation.

Excluding the jewellery industry from the PMLA will help in reviving demand, but still sentiment is weak, said Ashok Jain, proprietor of Mumbai-based wholesaler Chenaji Narsinghji.

Gold demand usually strengthens in the final quarter as Indians gears up for the wedding season as well as festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra.

The country’s imports in October could rise above 70 tonnes as banks and other importers are increasing overseas purchases for the Diwali festival, said Nambiath of GFMS. The festival falls in the middle of October this year.

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Some of China’s top oil refineries are having to take the highly unusual step of cutting operations during what is typically the peak demand summer season when hot weather drives up power usage and families take to the road during school holidays.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

The German’s success over seven years at Borussia Dortmund, where he challenged the dominance of Bayern Munich, prompted Liverpool’s American owners Fenway Sports Group to hire him to spearhead their project.

Twice a Bundesliga champion with Borussia Dortmund, who he also guided to the 2013 Champions League final, Klopp is yet to win a major trophy at the Anfield club but Purslow said he was under no pressure from the hierarchy.

“He’s two years into this job that looked to be perfect for Juergen Klopp,” Purslow told Sky Sports.

”There are great similarities between what he achieved at Dortmund, what he was expected to achieve -- which was to compete with an absolute behemoth in Bayern Munich, while spending less money, both on wages and in the transfer market.

“That is the job description at Liverpool.”

Purslow said Liverpool’s bitter Premier League rivals Manchester United, who visit Anfield on Saturday, earn far more revenue than the Merseyside club, adding that Klopp would need time to repeat his Bundesliga success in England.

“There are revenue differences between Manchester United and Liverpool. Liverpool’s are still superb but they are a fraction of Manchester United,” he added.

”And yet the Liverpool manager is expected to compete with United and beat them, exactly as Klopp did -- winning two league titles in Germany against Bayern Munich with a fraction of their spending.

“He is perfect for Liverpool. It is an innately difficult project, to compete with less money.”

Liverpool, seventh on 12 points, have struggled to convert their goal-scoring opportunities this season but will be fired up for Saturday’s fixture against a free-scoring United side, who have won six of seven and drawn just once this campaign.","Klopp perfect for Liverpool, says former CEO",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-liv-mun-purslow/klopp-perfect-for-liverpool-says-former-ceo-idUKKBN1CF124

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Tuesday it had received formal approval to start a C$500 million production unit in Canada and sought to quell talk that it had asked for special tax benefits for investing in its first such unit outside the United States.

The maker of Emmy-winning shows such as The Crown and Black Mirror said last month it was in talks with the Canadian government for an investment over a minimum of five years.

That decision was part of a broad review under Canadian Heritage Minister Melanie Joly, which included plans to modernize funding programs and review copyright, broadcasting and telecommunications legislation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While Democrats and immigration advocates recoiled at hard-line immigration proposals unveiled this week by the White House, they see a chance to force Republicans’ hand on legislation to help young “Dreamers” brought to the country illegally as children.

Their focus? A spending bill that Congress will need to pass in December in order to keep the U.S. government open.

Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, may need Democratic votes to approve the legislation because of divisions within their party over fiscal restraint.

Democrats are considering insisting on help for the Dreamers as their price for providing the votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown. Republican President Donald Trump ended the Obama-era DACA program last month that protected the Dreamers, and gave Congress six months to find a solution.

“This is all heading towards a December deal on Dreamers as part of an omnibus or spending package,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a liberal-leaning immigration advocacy group.

“If Trump embraces the nativists in his base and says: ‘No deal unless I get everything,’ there won’t be many if any Democratic votes for a spending package that excludes Dreamers.”

House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told the Washington Post on Monday she did not rule out withholding Democratic support for the spending bill if needed to obtain a deal to protect the nearly 800,000 Dreamers in the United States.

Asked about the possibility of including action on Dreamers in the spending measure, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the administration was not focused on the implementation process at the moment but would get into that at meetings this week after releasing the president’s priorities on Sunday night.

In December, Trump and Congress face the expiration of a three-month deal struck on Sept. 8 to prevent a government shutdown.

That surprise deal between Trump and congressional Democrats maintained federal government funding at levels then in place until Dec. 8. Another stopgap bill will likely be needed to replace that, setting up further fiscal and legislative drama in Washington.

Republican leaders in the House have struggled in recent years to get a consensus within their party on budget deals. Members of the conservative Freedom Caucus have often demanded deep budget cuts unpalatable to more moderate Republicans.

If enough Republican lawmakers break ranks on the budget, House leaders would need Democratic votes to help make up the difference and avoid a government shutdown.

DEAL-MAKING

Trump as a businessman had a reputation for working to get deals by opening with an aggressive list of demands and later leaving the door open to compromise.

Administration officials want his immigration priorities implemented in conjunction with a plan to give Dreamers legal status. The wish list includes funding for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the United States from Central America.

Pro-immigration advocates dismissed those demands as non-starters and largely brushed off their release as immaterial to the debate because they were unacceptable to Democrats and many Republicans.

“I don’t think that the ideas that were presented on Sunday really change the discussion or complicate things at all,” said Tom Jawetz, vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress.

Advocates say there is bipartisan support for measures to prevent Dreamers from facing deportation and allow them to secure work permits after Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program enacted under former Democratic President Barack Obama.

The White House and many Trump supporters are eager, however, to see key campaign promises on border security enacted in exchange for any such fix.

That has advocates focused on the spending, or omnibus bill, as an avenue for Dreamer legislation that could pass both chambers unencumbered by demands related to immigration enforcement.

“It’s highly unlikely that a stand-alone bill could ever reach the president’s desk,” said Tyler Moran, managing director of the DC Immigration Hub, a strategy organization for pro-immigration groups. “The only vehicle is the omnibus bill.”

Les grévistes entendent également protester contre les suppressions de postes et le rétablissement d‘un jour de carence en cas d‘arrêt-maladie, et globalement contre le manque de personnel et “l‘austérité” à laquelle ils estiment être soumis depuis plus de dix ans, selon Jean-Claude Mailly, secrétaire général de Force ouvrière, premier syndicat de la fonction publique d‘Etat.

“Il est temps que le gouvernement prenne conscience que dans les services publics, ça craque. Dans les hôpitaux et ailleurs, ils sont à l‘os, les directions le disent”

Dans l‘enseignement, la grève semblait un peu plus suivie dans les écoles primaires que dans les lycées et collèges au niveau national. Selon un pointage du ministère de l‘Éducation nationale en fin de matinée, près de 20% des enseignants du premier degré étaient en grève en “moyenne pondérée” dans toutes les académies, et près de 16% des professeurs du second degré.

Au total, tous personnels confondus, le taux de grévistes était de 15,53%, indique le ministère.

Dans les transports, l‘aérien semblait le secteur le plus touché. Selon un porte-parole de la direction générale de l‘aviation civile (DGAC), 30% des vols ont dû être annulés dans les aéroports de Roissy, Orly, Beauvais, d‘où partent les vols low-cost, Lyon, Nice, Toulouse, Marseille Bordeaux et Nantes.

LONDON (Reuters) - Silicon Valley graphics chipmaker NVIDIA unveiled on Tuesday the first computer chips for developing fully autonomous vehicles and said it had more than 25 customers working to build a new class of driverless cars, robotaxis and long-haul trucks.

Deutsche Post DHL Group, the world’s largest mail and logistics company, and ZF [ZFF.UL], a top automotive parts supplier, plan to deploy a fleet of autonomous delivery trucks based on the new chips, starting in 2019, NVIDIA said.

The third generation of NVIDIA’s Drive PX automotive line, code-named Pegasus, is a multi-chip platform the size of car license plates with datacenter-class processing power.

Pegasus can handle 320 trillion operations per second, representing roughly a 13-fold increase over the calculating power of the current PX 2 line.

A single NVIDIA Xavier-class processor can be used for level 3 semi-autonomous driving, while a combination of multiple mobile and graphics processors would run level 5 full-scale driverless cars, the company said.

A level 5 vehicle is capable of navigating roads without any driver input and in its purest form would have no steering wheel or brakes. A level 3 car still needs a steering wheel and a driver who can take over if the car encounters a problem, while level 4 promises driverless features in dedicated lanes.

This dramatic improvement is a pre-condition for developing and testing future autonomous cars, experts said.

Shares of Nvidia were indicated 3.8 percent higher in pre-market U.S. trading at $192.37. The high-flying stock has gained 80 percent this year.

“NVIDIA is one step ahead. But you can be sure you can expect (rival chipmakers) Intel, NXP and Renesas not to be too far behind,” said Luca De Ambroggi, principal automotive electronics analyst with industry market research firm IHS Markit.

U.S. computer chip giant Intel and its Mobileye automotive unit are working with German carmaker BMW and U.S. auto supplier Delphi on their own autonomous driving platform due out in 2021.

NXP has agreed to be acquired by Qualcomm to form the world’s largest auto electronics supplier. Japanese chipmaker Renesas is a has a strong presence in microcontrollers used to run key car functions.

NVIDIA’s automotive director Danny Shapiro said in an interview that many of the first 25 customers using the Pegasus platform would focus on robotaxis, which will be built without steering wheels or brakes and used only on dedicated routes. Bigger name automakers will announce vehicles running on Pegasus at their own product launches in coming months, he said.

MISSING PIECE IN DRIVERLESS PUZZLE

The Pegasus line will be available by the middle of 2018 for automakers to begin developing vehicles and testing software algorithms needed to control future driverless cars, NVIDIA executives told a developers’ conference in Munich on Tuesday.

The deal between Deutsche Post, ZF and NVIDIA will include future Deutsche Post StreetScooter delivery trucks. In Munich, the three partners are showcasing a prototype StreetScooter running NVIDIA Drive PX chips used to control sensors including six cameras, one radar and one lidar, or 3D laser camera.

Initial use cases will be for logistics vehicles on private roads within freight centers or for long-haul trucking in dedicated lanes, Shapiro said: “They are not replacing the drivers, but making the drivers more efficient and safer”.

For its current generation Drive PX2, NVIDIA has said it has 225 customers, including car and truck makers, Tier 1 auto suppliers, high-definition mapping companies, start-ups and research institutions. These customers can make use of PX2-class software when they upgrade to Pegasus chips, NVIDIA said.

These could encompass existing customers Tesla, including its latest Model 3. Others include Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi A8, the first car to use Level 3 semi-autonomous driving features, Toyota Motor’s next-generation autonomous cars and Geely’s Volvo business.

De Ambroggi said NVIDIA’s Pegasus automotive platform was the first with the processing power for automakers to begin developing truly autonomous vehicles, which could be upgraded with software improvements ahead of actual roadway deployments.

But the analyst stressed that while Pegasus could find its way into mass-produced robotaxis running in defined lanes, these early fully-autonomous chips would likely only allow carmakers to develop prototypes ready for the driverless era.

Regulations, road-testing, nagging safety concerns - and questions about how power-intensive the new data-hungry chip platform will be - are likely to mean truly driverless cars for personal use won’t arrive until at least 2025, he said.",NVIDIA unveils next-generation platform for fully autonomous cars,https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-autonomous-nvidia/nvidia-unveils-next-generation-platform-for-fully-autonomous-cars-idINKBN1CF14M

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A public feud between President Donald Trump and influential fellow Republican Bob Corker could narrow the path for a tax overhaul in the U.S. Senate, where a Republican go-it-alone effort is already showing signs of disunity.

Days after the Republican-controlled Congress took important steps toward advancing tax legislation, Trump’s Twitter attacks on Senator Corker over the weekend threatened to further alienate the president from other key Republicans such as Senator John McCain, whose “No” vote was pivotal in the party’s failure to repeal Obamacare in July.

Although a foreign policy specialist, Corker is also a key player in the tax debate.

He helped the Senate move closer to legislation by agreeing to a budget resolution that would allow tax reforms to reduce government revenue by up to $1.5 trillion over a decade, but he wants savings elsewhere and has vowed not to vote for a tax package that adds to the federal deficit.

Republicans hope Corker will ultimately vote for tax reform in hopes of boosting economic growth. But Trump’s tweets do not help, especially now that Corker has decided against seeking re-election next year and is free to vote whichever way he wants without having to face voters again.

Republicans are desperate to push through tax reform, seeing it as their last good chance to get a major legislative victory in the first year since 2006 that the party has controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress.

Trump and top Republican lawmakers have unveiled a plan to slash taxes for businesses and individuals, the first comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax code since 1986. They hope to get it done by January.

The tax push has been dogged by delays and distractions such as Trump’s criticisms of his own party’s leaders, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to the media on South Lawn of the White House in Washington before his departure to Greensboro, North Carolina, U.S., October 7, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

The latest incident erupted on Sunday when Trump lashed out at Corker in a series of derisive tweets saying the lawmaker had “begged” him for his endorsement ahead of the midterm election next year and announced his retirement after being turned down.

Corker replied by describing the White House as an adult day care center, and told the New York Times that Trump risks setting the country on the path to “World War Three”.

The spat complicates things for Republicans as they try to move tax legislation through the Senate, which they control by a slim 52-48 margin. Most Democrats oppose the plan, and Republicans cannot pass it if they lose support from more than two lawmakers of their own party.

“This is a delicate balance,” said Stephen Moore, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who helped write Trump’s campaign tax plan. “It all comes down to whether you can get 50 votes in the Senate. Right now, by my count, they’re at about 48. A few votes short.”

Divisions have emerged over proposals to repeal the federal inheritance tax and a popular deduction for state and local taxes. Senate Republican Rand Paul has expressed unhappiness over reports that Trump’s tax plan could raise taxes on some middle-class Americans.

Republicans need to keep Corker on board and prevent him from becoming a maverick like McCain, known for his sharply independent streak.

“Bob Corker, at this point, is as free as John McCain is to do what he thinks is right,” said William Galston, who was a domestic policy adviser to former President Bill Clinton.

Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist with close ties to Congress and the White House, said he thinks most Republican senators will get in line despite their concerns over Trump’s treatment of their colleagues.

“While it may really bother other Senate Republicans and it’s unnerving that one of their own is being attacked, most aren’t retiring and know they must still work with the White House or answer to frustrated voters,” Bonjean said.",Trump-Corker spat complicates drive for tax reform in U.S. Senate,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/trump-corker-spat-complicates-drive-for-tax-reform-in-u-s-senate-idUSKBN1CE29Y

Regional leader Carles Puigdemont prepared to address on Tuesday a parliamentary session that may unilaterally declare independence from Spain following a banned referendum on Oct. 1.

Such a move would drive a wedge between escalate the Spanish government and a region that makes up a fifth of the country’s economic output and more than a quarter of its exports.

As one fund manager told Reuters, working out how all this will pan out for the euro zone’s fourth largest economy is “so complicated it makes Brexit look like a walk in the park,” but here are some of the best guesses so far:

1. INDEPENDENCE

This is the scenario - considered unlikely by many analysts -- that could prove most damaging to Spain’s overall financial position, its economy and government borrowing costs.

Secession would be also expected to harm Catalonia’s economy, while uncertainty is likely to push up bond yields in both a newly-independent state as well as for Spain.

According to ABN AMRO, Catalan independence could raise Spain’s government-debt ratio to as high as 115 percent of GDP from current levels around 99 percent - leapfrogging Cyprus and Belgium to have the fourth largest debt load in the euro area.

However, Catalonia has said it would take responsibility for its share of central government debt, reducing the burden on Spain.

But the real problem would be how Spain would balance its books without Catalonia’s contribution. At roughly 4.5 percent of GDP in 2016, Spain already has the highest budget deficit in the euro zone.

Fathom Consulting said if Catalonia leaves, the economic shock could see the budget deficit run to nearly 7 percent in a couple of years - back to levels seen in the wake of the euro zone debt crisis. ABN AMRO forecasts a deficit of 5.5-6 percent.

2. DEVOLUTION

Many analysts expect the likely outcome of Spain’s worst political crisis in decades will be greater devolution of powers to Catalonia like those enjoyed by the Basque country.

But generous fiscal autonomy from Madrid could come at considerable cost to the public purse.

According to a 2014 study by research house CSIC, the Spanish state could lose about 16 billion euros. That would equal about 13 percent of next year’s budget.

“It would be painful economically,” said Tim Davis, chief investment strategist at Fathom Consulting. “The budget deficit in Spain would increase and then you would need to see some kind of additional austerity to plug that gap or you would start to see bond yields rise.”

3. STATUS QUO

It does not seem there is any outcome that leaves Spain’s economy unscathed.

Rating agencies have already said the tensions alone could have negative consequences for Spain’s credit rank, deterring investment and weakening the ability of Spain’s minority Popular Party government to implement national policy.

The crisis already looks to have claimed its first victim: a delay in passing the 2018 budget.

Tensions will only increase if Catalonia defies Madrid and declares independence over the coming days. One of the tools at Spain’s disposal is to trigger Article 155 of the constitution, which would allows it to take control of devolved powers.",Spain's creditors size up cost of Catalan independence bid,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia-bonds/spains-creditors-size-up-cost-of-catalan-independence-bid-idUKKBN1CF1RW?il=0

Separately on Tuesday, Britain’s budget forecasters gave a gloomier medium-term outlook for the economy, potentially leaving finance minister Philip Hammond with less room to offset any big hit from Britain’s departure from the European Union.

The somewhat downbeat picture for the world’s fifth-biggest economy from a raft of data - including a record goods trade deficit - contrasted with the situation in some of Britain’s closest trading partners in the European Union.

German exports outpaced imports in August, adding to signs it performed strongly in the third quarter, and Italian industrial output was much stronger than expected.

But there were some signs of encouragement for Britain.

The country’s factories had their strongest two months of 2017 in July and August, and the construction sector grew for the first time in three months.

In year-on-year terms, factory output was 2.8 percent higher, its fastest growth in six months.

Revisions to past data showed Britain’s economy had been a bit less weak earlier this year than previously thought.

“They’re not storming figures but I think they’re good enough to keep the Bank of England on track for a November rate hike,” said Victoria Clarke, an economist with Investec.

Britain’s economy has slowed sharply this year as consumers felt the pinch from rising inflation, caused largely by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote, and by weak wage growth.

BOE ANNOUNCEMENT

Nonetheless, the BoE said last month that most of its policymakers thought it was likely that they would need to raise rates for the first time in a decade in the coming months.

The BoE believes last year’s Brexit vote will create more inflation pressure by dampening business investment and slowing migration to Britain.

Sterling rose after Tuesday’s official data and British government bond prices edged down. [GBP/]

Figures for the much bigger services sector are due to be released on Oct. 25, along with a preliminary first estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product growth, little more than a week before the BoE’s Nov. 2 announcement.

Many economists say only a shock weakening in those figures is likely to cause the BoE to delay raising rates.

In a reminder of the long-standing problems that have held back Britain’s economy, Tuesday’s data showed the country’s deficit in its trade in goods hit an all-time high in cash terms.

That was despite the slump in the value of the pound which some supporters of Brexit have predicted will deliver an export boom. Export volumes in the three months to August were 3.2 percent lower than the previous three months, though they are 8.9 percent higher than a year before.

And there was bad news regarding the Achilles heel of the British economy - the long-standing weak record of its companies and workers to squeeze more output from their work.

Britain’s official budget watchdog said it expected to “significantly” downgrade its forecasts for productivity growth in the next five years.

Finance minister Hammond is due to present an annual budget on Nov. 22. Although he is under pressure to increase public spending and eliminate a pay cap on public sector pay, any cut in productivity forecasts would substantially limit his room for maneuver by reducing future tax revenues.","UK stuck in slow growth gear, BoE on course to raise rates",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/uk-stuck-in-slow-growth-gear-boe-on-course-to-raise-rates-idUSKBN1CF1F1?il=0

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

The leadership reshuffle at the Chinese Communist Party Congress, a meeting held once every five years set to kick off on October 18, will see most of the country’s top officials step down. All eyes will be on President Xi Jinping, who could upend decades of party tradition by seizing more power. Some hope a stronger Xi will put China back on the liberalization path. The fear is he will dismantle the consensus-based checks and balances put in place to prevent a return to the excesses of the Mao era.

The president’s boosters think that if Xi can put more trusted lieutenants into position, he will finally overpower so-called vested interests and deliver more aggressive reforms in financial markets and the state-owned sector. Skeptics question how market-oriented Xi is, and suspect he is angling to stay on after his term is due to end in 2022.

The debate will be settled at the end of the conference, when members of the next Politburo Standing Committee walk out on stage in a prearranged order. These individuals will in turn help pick new leaders of key financial and economic regulatory institutions.

There are four key measurements of how much power Xi accrues at the congress.

CAN XI PERSUADE THE POLITBURO TO IGNORE THE AGE LIMIT RULE?

Since the early 2000s, Politburo members have adhered to a “seven up, eight down” rule: officials aged 67 or younger at the time of the congress are eligible for promotion, while those 68 or over step down.

Proponents say this mechanism ensures peaceful transitions of institutional power in China; a tacit agreement among the elite to restrain the executive.

However, the limit is informal, and critics note it originated in gutter politics. Former President Jiang Zemin used the rule to knock opponents out of position. An official from a party think tank said last year the age limit is “folklore” and traditions could be “adjusted.”

At this congress, this question boils down to whether Wang Qishan, the country’s anti-corruption czar, stays or goes. Wang is competent, but he’s 69. The president might use Wang’s extension as a stalking horse, as Xi himself will approach the age limit in 2022. If Wang walks out on stage, it will be an unambiguous sign of Xi’s authority.

CAN HE INSERT “XI JINPING THOUGHT” INTO THE PARTY CONSTITUTION?

While less debated than the age limit, amendments to the party constitution are important; it’s the party’s way of saying how its leaders stack up.

The latest version says the party is committed to “Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development.” What’s missing from this turgid phrase: any mention of former presidents Jiang and Hu Jintao. Their slogans – “Three Represents” and “Scientific Development,” respectively – are given pride of place, but Hu and Jiang’s names only appear later. The implication is that collective ideas are more important than individuals.

If one of Xi’s signature ideas is included in the amended party constitution without his name, that would be a sign of either institutional restraint on his authority or his own unwillingness to challenge orthodoxy. However, if the party constitution is revised to include something along the lines of “Xi Jinping Thought,” the message would be clear: the era of collective leadership is winding down, and Xi is now China’s most important leader since Mao.

WILL XI REPLACE PREMIER LI KEQIANG?

The Li Keqiang question has consumed Beijing’s rumor mill since around 2015, when whispers surfaced of a falling out with Xi. Li is a veteran of the Communist Youth League, a political faction that the president has cut down to size in recent years.

The odds currently look in favor of Li staying put. The relationship between president and premier now seems less fractious than the rumor mill initially suggested, and Xi has already sidelined Li on economic policy anyway. Plus a scapegoat might be useful if the economy falters. If Xi were to replace the premier, however, it would suggest the president is unwilling to tolerate all but the most loyal lieutenants in positions of power.

DO ANY SUCCESSORS FOR XI LAND IN PUBLIC VIEW?

The Politburo age limits usually means two relatively young leaders are “helicoptered” into the Politburo Standing Committee at the halfway mark of an administration. One is meant to replace the president, and another to take over from the premier.

The running bet is that Chongqing Party Secretary Chen Miner will land the successor spot for president, and perhaps Guangdong Party Secretary Hu Chunhua as the next premier. But if no young faces emerge in the Politburo Standing Committee at the end of the congress, it would suggest Xi plans to stay for another term.",Breakingviews - Breakdown: Xi and China’s leadership reshuffle,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-breakingviews/breakingviews-breakdown-xi-and-chinas-leadership-reshuffle-idUSKBN1CF0A1

COX‘S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) began distributing 900,000 doses of cholera vaccine on Tuesday in Bangladesh’s camps for Rohingya refugees fleeing from Myanmar, as authorities rush to prevent a major outbreak of the deadly disease.

More than 10,000 cases of diarrhoea have been reported in the past week alone, the WHO said.

Doctors in two clinics have told Reuters that there have been several cases of patients with the symptoms of cholera, a virulent diarrhoea that kills within 36 hours if not treated.

Cholera has not been identified in testing of patient samples by Bangladesh’s health ministry, although clinics say they are waiting for results for some samples sent last week.

“There is a clear risk for cholera,” said Dr N. Paranietharan, the WHO’s representative in Bangladesh.

“Sporadic cases are inevitable (but) we are not expecting a major outbreak like Yemen,” he said.

War-torn Yemen is in the grip of a cholera crisis, with more than 750,000 sufferers afflicted by the bacteria, which is spread when contaminated faeces is ingested by humans, usually through the water supply.

The cholera vaccination campaign in Bangladesh, the second largest in history, will be crucial to containing any outbreak, said Paranietharan.

More than 1,000 people will fan out across the sprawling camps on the southern tip of Bangladesh that are home to more than 519,000 Rohingya Muslims.

The Rohingya fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar when government forces launched a ferocious offensive, denounced by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing, in response to a series of Rohingya militant attacks on security posts on Aug. 25.

In pounding heat and stifling humidity, traumatized and malnourished refugees are crammed into bamboo and canvas huts packed across muddy hillsides. Faeces lies in lanes that flood in the pouring rain.

More than 3,000 latrines have been installed but many overflow and sit above pools and creeks where refugees bathe.

Many new wells for drinking water are shallow and have become contaminated by sewage, said Paranietharan.

“While we are doing this vaccination, it is not an alternative to fixing the water, sanitation and hygiene intervention, it just buys us time,” he said.

“Sanitary facilities and hygiene promotion have still not met the standards. They need to be improved quickly.”

‘FACING A TSUNAMI’

In a dysentery clinic in Kutupalong camp run by the Medical Teams International group, patients with severe diarrhoea lie motionless, moaning as intravenous fluid flows into them.

“I believe we are facing a tsunami. We just don’t know if it’s going to be 10 feet or 50 feet,” said Bruce Murray, a physician at the clinic.

“Cholera is known to be endemic in Bangladesh and now we are bringing in half a million people in squalid conditions and it’s got to be inevitable. It’s a matter of when it hits, rather than if,” he said.

Murray said there could be “tens of thousands” of victims in an outbreak. Paranietharan said his organisation had the capacity to handle 70,000 cholera cases.

As well as a handful of clinics, mobile teams are ready to go to inaccessible parts of the camps with oral rehydration salts that can save cholera patients if they can’t get access to intravenous fluids.

Aid workers worry they lack the staff to get the vaccines out quickly, while the WHO says it urgently needs $10.2 million to do the job properly.

The first round of the vaccination campaign will cover 650,000 people aged one year and older. A second round will target 250,000 children aged between one and five with an additional dose for extra protection.",Vaccination begins in Bangladesh camps to head off cholera outbreak,https://in.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-bangladesh-vaccination/vaccination-begins-in-bangladesh-camps-to-head-off-cholera-outbreak-idINKBN1CF0IX

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Thousands lined up at polling booths in Liberia’s capital on Tuesday for their first democratic transfer of power in 73 years in a vote haunted by a savage civil war that ended in 2003.

Many Liberians on Tuesday praised 78-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for keeping peace since the dark days of the 14-year conflict when gangs of drugged child soldiers wearing ammunition belts marauded through the streets.

Yet, while preparations have been peaceful, a former rebel leader Prince Johnson is one of the 20 candidates and an ex-wife of warlord Charles Taylor, now in a British jail, is the running mate of one of the favorites, former soccer player George Weah.

Unlike neighboring Sierra Leone which had a U.N.-backed court for civil war crimes committed in both countries, Liberia has prioritized reconciliation over justice and some of those involved in the war that killed a quarter of a million people are still prominent public figures.

“I am just voting for peace. We want peace right now, peaceful country, we want a peaceful situation now and things to go fine,” said James Marthics, a voter in Paynesville, a suburb of the capital Monrovia.

Some had been waiting for hours before dawn to vote and brought small wooden chairs with them, forming orderly queues as vendors sold them soft drinks and palm wine.

“I have come to vote for a change. I want to be a part of history making today,” said Edward Cooper, a retired rubber plantation worker, shortly before the polls opened.

NO ELECTRICITY

Johnson Sirleaf, Africa’s first female president and an ally of the United States, in an address to the nation on the eve of the vote urged Liberians to maintain the peace. “Embrace your neighbor, regardless of their political choice,” she said.

Liberia is one of Africa’s oldest states founded by freed U.S. slaves in the 19th century. But its last democratic power transfer, defined as a peaceful handover at the end of a full term, was in 1943.

Johnson Sirleaf beat Weah to win the election in 2005 after a period of transitional government following the civil war that ended two years earlier.

Most analysts think it is unlikely that any single candidate will win a majority in a single round this time, forcing a second one some time in early November. Results are expected to begin arriving later this week.

Among the favorites are Vice President Joseph Nyuma Boakai of the ruling Unity Party; Weah, who played for AC Milan and Paris St Germain, among other clubs; and Alexander Cummings of the Alternative National Congress.

Rebel leader Johnson, who famously held a beer as he watched a tape of his supporters murdering President Samuel Doe in 1990, is considered to have only an outside chance.

And Roddy Barclay, director at risk advisory Africa Practice, said the participation of civil war-era figures was unlikely to lead to a “slide back into an era of warlord politics”.

As well as her role in keeping the peace, Johnson Sirleaf is held in high esteem internationally for promoting women’s rights and for respecting the constitution in a continent where many leaders cling to power beyond their legal tenure.

But many at home, who call her simply “Ellen”, say they are disappointed she has not done more to accelerate development and end corruption in a country still ranked near the bottom of the U.N. human development index at 177 out of 188 countries.

One polling station in Monrovia had no electricity and officials had to use flashlights to illuminate voter lists in the early morning light, a Reuters witness said.

Others blame her for the legacy of a weak health care system which has still not fully recovered after the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic that killed more than 4,000 people in Liberia.

“We don’t feel free because the children are not going to school,” said Emma Nathaniel, a 60-year-old widow with 12 children. “We are straining ourselves,” she said from the voting line, surrounded by piles of garbage.",Liberians hope for peace in vote still haunted by civil war,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CF1N3-OZATP

(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc unveiled a corporate makeover on Tuesday that will tie its growth more strongly to aerospace technology and spin off other businesses as two publicly-traded companies by the end of 2018.

The company also raised the low-end of its full-year 2017 earnings guidance by 5 cents to $7.05 - $7.10, and said it would spend the proceeds from the spin-offs on share buybacks, acquisitions and paying down debt.

Its shares fell 1 percent after Wall Street opened.

Honeywell Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk, like his peers at other industrial conglomerates, has been under pressure to pull apart a portfolio of disparate businesses that includes automotive turbo chargers, burglar alarms and the Xtratuf boots popular in Alaska’s fishing industry.

Honeywell had been under pressure from hedge fund Third Point to spin off the aerospace division, which accounted for about 36 percent of total revenue in 2016 and which Third Point said could generate $20 billion in shareholder value if sold.

The changes announced on Tuesday split off its home and ADI global distribution business - which deal with building systems running from air conditioning to smoke alarms - into one unit and transportation systems into a second.

They include the low-margin automotive turbocharger business, joining other companies, including auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, in shedding technology tied to the internal combustion engine as regulators around the world crack down on emissions and talk of mandating a switch to battery-electric vehicles over the next two decades.

Honeywell said the two spun-off business units together would generate annualized revenue of about $7.5 billion. It said it would gain $3 billion from the spin-offs.

Ahead of its quarterly earnings report, the company also said third quarter sales were expected to be $10.1 billion, up 5 percent in organic terms compared to an earlier forecast range of +/-1 percent.","Honeywell sticks with aerospace, spins off other units",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CF0CO-OCABS

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May pledged on Tuesday to “hold a mirror up to society” with a study showing sharp racial disparities in Britain, as she looks for a way to demonstrate her leadership is about more than just delivering Brexit.

Among the findings of the audit, the data showed Asian, black and other minority ethnic households were most likely to be in persistent poverty, that ethnic minorities have a lower employment rate than white people, and that they were under-represented in senior public sector jobs.

Bogged down by Brexit and losing her parliamentary majority in a snap election in June, May has struggled to deliver on social reforms to tackle what she has called “burning injustices” since taking control of the ruling Conservative party in July 2016.

Attempting to relaunch that agenda, she published the findings of a “Race Disparity Audit” which pulled together existing data from across sectors such as health, education, employment and the criminal justice system and analyzed it to discover how ethnicity affects people’s lives.

“This audit means that for society as a whole – for government, for our public services – there is nowhere to hide. These issues are now out in the open,” she told a private meeting to launch the report, according to her office.

“The message is very simple: if these disparities cannot be explained then they must be changed.”

May’s center-right Conservatives were blindsided in June’s election by a surge in support for the left-wing policies of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has presented higher state spending as part of the cure for voters he says have been let down years of cuts to public services.

“The prime minister has done nothing but exacerbate the problems. Far from tackling the burning injustices she has added fuel to the fire,” Labour’s equalities spokeswoman Dawn Butler said. She called for the government to start offering solutions to the problems the audit highlighted.

At last week’s Conservative conference, May was keen to show party members that she had a plan to counter Corbyn’s rise and allay fears that Brexit was squeezing out action on Britain’s social problems.

“It will hold a mirror up to society and allow us and wider society to see where action is needed,” May told a meeting of her senior ministers, according to a spokesman.

May’s deputy Damian Green said the audit’s findings were not “relentlessly negative”, but added in a forward to the document: “There is still a way to go before we have a country that works for everyone regardless of their ethnicity.”

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play.
The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.
From 2009-2011, he led the Department of Justice’s disability rights enforcement as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.","On September 7, on a straight party-line vote, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee moved forward a bill that would gut key protections for people with disabilities. Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

PARIS (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) boss Tim Cook went out of his way on Monday to single out a small French firm involved with innovative features in the latest iPhones ahead of meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, who has called for a tougher line on technology company taxes.

The Apple chief executive paid a surprise visit to Eldim, a Normandy-based firm that has tested optical technology used in the facial recognition system inside new top-of-the-range iPhone X smartphones due out next month. Prices start at $999.

Face ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple’s campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices.

“Bravo for your work!”, Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted.

Cook later met Macron, who has called for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe.

“Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in back taxes from Apple.

CONSTRUCTIVE TALKS

A French presidency official said Macron and Cook did not rake over the past and described the talks about regulating digital platforms and tax policy as constructive and forward-looking.

Asked if they had discussed France’s proposal to tax the revenue of big tech companies and not profit, the Macron adviser said: “They didn’t go into specifics.”

“The tone was very open. This wasn’t a posturing competition.” Tech giants were under pressure from shareholders worried about reputational damage over how the companies arrange their taxes, the official added.

Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company.

“They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,” said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.”

Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers on Tuesday gave broad support to a law that could end the City of London’s global dominance in clearing euro-denominated financial contracts after Brexit.

The plan has raised hackles in Britain, where it threatens both job losses and tax revenues.

The draft EU law proposes that a foreign clearing house -- which stands between two sides of a transaction to ensure its smooth completion -- must be subject to more intense supervision by the bloc’s regulators if it wants to serve customers in the EU.

But if a clearing house is systemically important to the euro zone, then euro-denominated business with EU based customers must move to the bloc.

The draft law is anathema to Britain, which voted to leave the EU in a referendum last year.

It is home to LCH, an arm of the London Stock Exchange that clears most euro-denominated swaps in Europe. Financial services represent Britain’s biggest tax earning sector and the LSE has warned that thousands of jobs could leave the UK if euro clearing was forced out.

In the first debate in the European Parliament on Tuesday, lawmakers from the two biggest parties, the center right European People’s Party and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, gave broad backing to the draft law, but called for some changes.

“It’s a good proposal from the European Commission,” Polish center-right MEP Danuta Huebner told parliament’s economic affairs committee.

“In principle, I support the proposal, which I find necessary,” added Roberto Gualtieri, an Italian center-left lawmaker who chairs the committee.

The European Parliament and EU states have final say on the reform, with changes expected during the approval process.

No timetable has been agreed for approving the law and, separately, there has been scant agreement on any new relationship between the EU and Britain.

That means LCH’s European customers don’t know at the moment if they can continue using the London clearer after Brexit.

Exploit this uncertainty, Frankfurt-based Eurex unveiled a “Brexit-proof” package of sweeteners on Monday to woo LCH customers.

BREXIT PROTECTIONISM

Huebner said parts of the draft law were too complex, creating uncertainty over how exactly EU regulators and the European Central Bank would decide when euro clearing conducted outside the bloc must move to the EU.

“We have to do everything to avoid potential inconsistency in decision-making,” Huebner said. “We must not politicize the whole process.”

Gualtieri said there was a need to “upgrade” EU supervision of clearing, but lawmakers should be “very cautious, reflective and in a listening mood” given the potential consequences.

Others said there was need to avoid protectionism or using clearing as a stick to beat Britain given that the UK was already “fighting with itself”.

Kay Swinburne, a British center-right lawmaker, a lone voice in outright opposition, said a regional restriction on a global currency is the wrong approach.

“There is a reason why we have done so much work at the global level, and I really hope that we are not going to throw all of that away to have some protectionism with regards to a Brexit decision,” Swinburne added.

Banks and the LSE have warned that forcing out some clearing would split markets and bump up costs for EU companies who use swaps to insure against adverse moves in borrowing costs, raw material prices, and currency swings.",EU lawmakers give tentative nod to Brexit clearing law that could clobber Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-clearing/eu-lawmakers-give-tentative-nod-to-brexit-clearing-law-that-could-clobber-britain-idUSKBN1CF18X

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he has prepared an “economic-development” measure that would punish companies that globally outsource jobs.

The bill would provide economic incentives for companies, Trump said in an interview with Forbes magazine published on Tuesday, and reward firms that maintain jobs in the United States, and deliver punitive measures against those that move operations offshore.

“It’s both a carrot and a stick,” Trump said. “It is an incentive to stay. But it is perhaps even more so - if you leave, it’s going to be very tough for you to think that you’re going to be able to sell your product back into our country.”

He did not specify what the rewards or punishments would be. The White House was not immediately available to comment.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

Regional leader Carles Puigdemont held a meeting of his cabinet to decide how to press an independence drive that has stirred powerful emotions across Spain and raised concern in European Union partner states.

Catalan police armed with automatic rifles stood guard at Barcelona’s Parc de la Ciutadella which houses the elegant 18th century building. Spanish national police, decried by separatists over their use of force to hinder an Oct. 1 referendum, were not to be seen.

A declaration of independence would deepen Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and would almost certainly draw tough counter-measures from Madrid, possibly including suspension of the regional government.

The parliament and other buildings, such as the regional high court building, could become a focus of contention between Spanish and Catalan authorities.

Thousands of national police reinforcements sent by Madrid for the referendum remain in the area, many of them in two cruise ships docked in Barcelona harbor.

Pro-independence demonstrators were due to gather before the parliament building under the slogan “Hello Republic” to mark Puigdemont’s speech at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).

Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Barcelona against independence at the weekend, waving red-yellow Spanish flags through the city center. That rally fell a week after some 900 people were injured when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt a referendum ruled illegal in Madrid.

Related Coverage Spain's creditors size up cost of Catalan independence bid

Puigdemont has said he is determined to apply a law passed by the Catalan assembly which called for a declaration of independence within days if Catalans voted ‘yes’ in the Oct. 1 referendum.

The government of Spain’s wealthiest region says 90 percent of those who voted backed independence, but turnout was only 43 percent as many opponents of independence stayed at home.

The Madrid government has said it will respond immediately to any unilateral declaration.

Puigdemont could ask the parliament to vote on a motion of independence, which lawmakers say would start a period of up to six months during which Catalonia would write a new constitution and negotiate a divorce with Spain; or he could make a statement of intent on a future independence declaration.

Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to disclose what Puigdemont would say but told a news conference after the cabinet meeting he would be “clear and explicit” and Tuesday would be an historic day.

Ruling party lawmakers say Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is considering taking the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering new regional elections, the so-called nuclear option.

The European Commission repeated its call for dialogue in Spain to end the crisis in Catalonia. Puigdemont has also called for talks and international mediation, but Rajoy has said he will not negotiate with the Catalan leaders unless they abandon plans to declare independence.

BUSINESS CLIMATE

Markets have been rattled by the Catalan crisis, raising Spain’s borrowing costs and pushing down shares.

Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond yields were a touch lower on Tuesday, but above lows hit the previous session as investors awaited Puigdemont’s speech. Spain’s benchmark Ibex share index was down nearly one percent.

The tension is taking its toll on the business climate. On Monday, three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business drift from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum.

Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial and infrastructure firm Abertis both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued.

Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence.

Spain’s finance minister said it was the Catalan government’s fault the companies were leaving.

The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber said on Tuesday that paying National Insurance contributions for its British drivers would add tens of millions of pounds to the taxi app’s costs were they to be deemed employees.

Uber currently classifies its around 50,000 drivers in Britain as self-employed, affording them only basic entitlements, whilst employees also receive rights such as sick pay and the minimum wage.

Asked about how much it would cost in National Insurance payments if self-employed drivers were directly employed, the firm’s UK Head of Policy Andrew Byrne told parliament’s business committee:

“I don’t have the precise figures ... but I‘m certain it would be the tens of millions certainly.”

Also appearing before lawmakers, Deliveroo’s UK and Ireland Managing Director Dan Warne said additional costs including National Insurance contributions, would add around 1 pound ($1.32) to the cost of each hour.

National Insurance is collected by the government and helps pay for the state health service, pensions and certain other benefits.

Firms operating in the so-called gig economy - whereby people tend to work for different companies without a fixed contract - have been criticized by unions and some lawmakers for what they call exploitative practices.

Uber and Deliveroo both say their drivers enjoy the flexibility they offer but last year two drivers won a tribunal hearing against Uber and were granted worker rights, in a decision which the Silicon Valley firm appealed last month.

Uber’s Byrne said on Tuesday he expected the judge to make a ruling by around Christmas.

Uber is also battling to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the smartphone app of its license in the British capital. It has until Friday to lodge an appeal.

Byrne said he could hopefully see a way to address concerns by London’s transport regulator, which cited the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

At least 4,000 migrants, including pregnant women, newborn babies and unaccompanied children, have been transferred from informal camps and housing to a hangar in the city since the clashes ended on Friday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said some 6,000 had been held at the informal sites.

Hundreds of migrants who had left Sabratha arrived in Zuwara, about 25 km (15 miles) to the west, on foot along the beach, said Sadeeq Al-Jayash, head of Zuwara’s emergency committee.

“They come walking in groups ... for example there were various groups that came on Sunday -- 50, then 100 and 200 at night,” said Jayash. There were about 1,700 migrants currently in Zuwara “in desperate need of help”, he said.

Sabratha has been the most common point of departure for mostly sub-Saharan African migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean by boat from Libya.

But the number of crossings dropped sharply in July after an armed group struck a deal with officials from the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli to block departures, under pressure from Italy and other European Union member states.

That set off three weeks of fighting among rival factions that left at least 43 dead and 340 wounded, according to a new health ministry toll, and ended with the withdrawal of the armed group. The migrants who have since been rounded up were being held at sites that the group had controlled, local officials said.

“We are seriously concerned by the large number of migrants caught up in recent developments in Sabratha,” Othman Belbeisi, IOM Libya chief of mission, said in a statement.

Some migrants are being sent on to detention centers elsewhere in western Libya that are nominally under the control of the Tripoli government.

IOM officials say those centers, which were housing some 5,000 migrants, risk being overwhelmed by the new arrivals. Conditions in the centers are often dire and abuse widespread.

“Alternatives to detention must be found for migrants in Libya. In the meantime, IOM continues to provide direct humanitarian, health and psychosocial assistance to meet the urgent needs of the thousands of migrants being affected,” Belbeisi said.

Local sources have previously said that an estimated 10,000 migrants were being held in the Sabratha area.

The head of Sabratha’s department for countering illegal migration told Reuters on Saturday that help was badly needed as some migrants had received no food or water for six days.

The revelation about Google is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.

Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.

The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European residents, according to lawmakers and researchers.

Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.

Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.

Russia’s ad purchases on Google were first reported by the Washington Post.

Google did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.

“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.

‘DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY’

Google, which runs the world’s largest online advertising business, had largely evaded public or congressional scrutiny until now. On Sunday, the Daily Beast news website reported that the Kremlin recruited at least two black video bloggers to post clips on YouTube during the campaign. They posed as Black Lives Matter sympathizers who were sharply critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Though the videos were only viewed hundreds of times, they demonstrated for the first time that Russia allegedly deployed real people, not just fake online accounts or bots, to further spread propaganda.

Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into Russian interference, but concern about Silicon Valley’s role has surged over the past month against the backdrop of a cascade of revelations about how Russia appears to have leveraged their platforms to spread propaganda.

A study published on Monday by researchers with the Oxford Internet Institute, which is affiliated with the British university, found that current U.S. military personnel and veterans were targeted by disinformation campaigns on Twitter and Facebook over the past year by a nexus of pro-Kremlin, Russian-oriented sites, along with conspiracy theorists and European right-wing ideologues.

Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election. Some Democrats plan to introduce legislation to require internet companies to disclose more information about political ad purchases on their platforms.

“If Vladimir Putin is using Facebook or Google or Twitter to, in effect, destroy our democracy, the American people should know about it,” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Monday on MSNBC.

Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter. While Facebook and Twitter have confirmed plans to attend, Google has not.","Google uncovered Russia-backed ads on YouTube, Gmail : source",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-alphabet/google-uncovered-russia-backed-ads-on-youtube-gmail-source-idUSKBN1CE192

TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp’s autonomous driving system is expected to be launched in commercial vehicles as early as in 2022, in a move that will likely help the Japanese company narrow its gap with rival suppliers in a highly competitive market.

Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc’s mass-market Model 3, has been reinventing itself as a provider of advanced auto parts to escape the price competition of smartphones and other lower-margin consumer products.

The new autonomous driving system will enable autonomous driving at low- and medium-speed ranges including self-valet parking, Panasonic said on Tuesday.

“We know we are behind our rivals right now,” said Shoichi Goto, director in charge of vision and sensing technologies at the firm’s automotive R&D division.

“But we have developed key LSI (large-scale integration) chips for advanced image processing and sonar sensing that would give us major advantages, using expertise from television sets and cameras.”

The new chips need more testing and polishing before the commercial launch of the autonomous driving system, added Goto, previously a TV engineer.

Panasonic has been pushing to expand its range of advanced driving-related products to better compete with top suppliers such as Bosch [ROBG.UL] and Continental AG.

The firm has said it plans to nearly double its automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen ($22 billion) by the year to March 2022, from 1.3 trillion yen in the year to March 2017.

Panasonic established the automotive R&D division in April, transferring about 350 engineers from TV, the company’s mainstay at the time, and other consumer electronics businesses.

To bolster its push into the automotive field, Panasonic took control of Spanish auto parts maker Ficosa International SA earlier this year.

Alexander Dobrindt, parliamentary floor leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), said a coalition agreement would have to be more detailed than the one that accompanied the Grand Coalition in the last parliament.

Merkel, humbled in last month’s national election by a surging far-right, is trying to broker a three-way coalition of her conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens - a combination previously untested at federal level.

The task is further complicated by the fact that Merkel’s conservative bloc compromises her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and CSU, whose alliance has been strained by her open-door migrants policy.

The conservative allies removed one obstacle to forming a new coalition on Sunday by agreeing a limit on the number of migrants arriving in Germany.[nL8N1MJ0EG] But Dobrindt of the CSU said in an interview with Reuters television that securing a three-way alliance would be hard.

“As we know that the points that separate us outweigh those we have in common, one can have doubts about whether a coalition agreement is possible this year,” Dobrindt said.

“It is conceivable that we can’t complete in December and that final talks - if there even are any - will only possible next year,” he added.

The three-way tie-up - dubbed a “Jamaica” coalition after the black, green and yellow colours of the three party blocs, which match the Caribbean island’s flag - is Merkel’s only realistic option of forming a government.

The centre-left Social Democrats, her previous partners in a the Grand Coalition, insist they want to go into opposition.

A Jamaica coalition was formed in the tiny western state of Saarland in October 2009, but collapsed in January 2012. The same formation took power in the far northern region of Schleswig-Holstein after elections there in May this year.

BIG DIFFERENCES

At a national level, the three party groups have deep differences on issues ranging from migration to European Union reform, tax and the environment. Dobrindt said this meant they would have to nail down a detailed agreement.

“We need, in a possible Jamaica coalition agreement, a significantly higher level of detail than was the case with the grand coalition,” he said. “The differences between the parties are big, so the agreements need to go deeper.”

In their compromise struck on Sunday, the CDU and CSU agreed to limit to 200,000 the number of people Germany would accept per year on humanitarian grounds.

The FDP and Greens insist the conservatives’ agreement cannot simply be copied into a coalition deal. [nL8N1MH43P]

But Dobrindt, whose CSU is worried about losing its regional dominance in a Bavarian state election next year, said the allies’ accord must be reflected in a coalition deal.

“The regulations we have made in our joint paper - ‘Rules on Migration’ - are of course an essential part of the negotiations and must also be found in a coalition agreement,” he said.

The intransigence of the CSU, the Greens and the FDP on the migrants issue points to difficult coalition talks that risk clouding the political outlook in Germany, which has been a source of stability in Europe during Merkel’s 12 years in power.

“We want Europe to concentrate more on the big tasks and less on the small tasks,” Dobrindt said. “That means we must talk about bringing back responsibilities from Brussels to Germany - and the details of that will no doubt be difficult.”",Germany may not agree new coalition until next year - Merkel ally,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-politics/germany-may-not-agree-new-coalition-until-next-year-merkel-ally-idUKKBN1CF1PL?il=0

OTTAWA (Reuters) - When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets President Donald Trump on Wednesday, he will try to persuade the U.S. leader to focus on Mexico as a source of potential problems at talks to update NAFTA.

Although Trudeau officials were confident Trump would mostly target Mexico as the three nations started to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, Washington has slapped duties on Canadian Bombardier airliners and lumber exports in recent months and talked tough on dairy and wine.

Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Trudeau would “explain really clearly to the President ... that Canada is not America’s problem”.

Freeland, who says Canada buys more from the United States than China, Britain and Japan combined, told CTV television on Sunday that Trudeau’s message to Trump at their White House meeting would be “We are your biggest client.”

Trump has threatened to scrap the 1994 pact unless changes are made to address issues such as a $64 billion deficit with Mexico. Negotiators start the fourth of seven planned rounds of talks near Washington on Wednesday.

Freeland describes the U.S. administration as the most protectionist since the 1930s while noting the United States runs a surplus in the trade of goods and services with Canada.

Canada has so far shunned confrontation with Washington, stressing instead the merits of NAFTA and free trade. By no means everyone south of the border is convinced.

Chris Sands, a professor at the Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said Canada’s problems marked “a new era of tough love” with Washington.

“It turns out Trump is an economic nationalist ... and it’s come as a bit of a surprise to the Canadians that they have been so much on the hot seat,” he said.

Trudeau officials deny Trump is targeting Canada as part of the NAFTA talks, saying the airliner and softwood disputes have been rumbling on for years.

Mexico has been more assertive with Washington, talking openly about abandoning NAFTA if need be or slashing imports of U.S. grain.

Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister involved in the original NAFTA talks, said Ottawa had assumed traditionally close ties with the United States would insulate them from problems with NAFTA.

The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of sponsoring hardline Islamist groups, a charge Doha denies. Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous state, also joined the boycott.

Kuwaiti and U.S. attempts to ease the row have yielded little progress and media outlets backed by the opposing sides have unleashed a war of words that has aggravated tensions in the U.S-allied Gulf.

“Qatar’s hosting of World Cup 2022 should include a repudiation of policies supporting extremism & terrorism. Doha should review its record,” UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on Twitter.

“Hosting World Cup 2022 should not be tainted by support of extremist individuals & (organizations)/ terrorist figures, review of Qatar’s policies a must,” he added.

The World Cup is the centerpiece of a carefully crafted strategy to project Qatar onto the global stage via sport. In the run-up, Qatar is scheduled to host events across different sports aimed at improving infrastructure and expertise.

Although the countries boycotting Qatar would not have a direct way of halting the World Cup, they are major powers in regional sport and could interfere with Qatar’s wider plans. Egypt is the top-ranked soccer team in Africa, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE are both in Asia’s top eight.

Last month officials from the states boycotting Qatar did not turn up to the draw for a Middle East soccer tournament in Doha and said they wanted to postpone the competition that could be an early test for the World Cup hosts.

Qatari officials could not be immediately reached for comment on Gargash’s remarks.

Qatar has previously said that the rift has not affected its preparations to host the tournament and that alternative sources for construction materials had been secured.

Soccer’s governing body FIFA has said it has been in regular contact with Qatar since the row erupted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the National Football League should not be given tax breaks, wading back into his criticism of the league over silent player protests during the national anthem.

“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.

It was not clear what exactly Trump was demanding, and representatives for the White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The NFL gave up its federal tax-exempt status in 2015, according to media reports, although U.S. states and localities still offer the multi-billion dollar league tax breaks in order to attract teams and to finance stadiums.

Trump has been on a tear for weeks against NFL players who kneel during the national anthem played before games, saying the gesture disrespects the country. His strongly worded call last month for players who did this to be fired touched off an initially sharp response, including from some team owners and coaches.

The players’ silent demonstration, which began last year in protest against police violence toward racial minorities, was embraced more widely in reaction to Trump’s more recent comments, with more players taking the knee while others chose to lock arms.

A number of Republican lawmakers suggested in September that tax sweeteners should end given the protests, the Washington Post reported.

On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence walked out of an NFL game after some players knelt. Separately, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he would bench players who disrespect the U.S. flag.

On Monday, cable sports network ESPN was drawn into the fray when it suspended one of its broadcasters after she posted a tweet about the protests and Jones’ comment. ESPN, which is owned by Walt Disney Co, said it was Jemele Hill’s second violation of its social media guidelines.

Hill, who had said that those who rejected Jones’ comment should look at the team’s advertisers, later tweeted that she was not urging an NFL boycott.

In a separate Twitter post on Tuesday, Trump excoriated Hill, saying that with her “at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!”

The NFL Players Association has defended players’ right to protest.

Trump’s former Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton, also backed the players, saying in a speech on Monday, “They are protesting racism and injustice, and they have every right to do so.”

Critics of Trump, a Republican, have said he is fanning a controversy over the national anthem at NFL games to distract from pressing issues his administration is dealing with, from a powerful hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico to tensions with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars the government from limiting free speech, including prohibiting protests around the national anthem or punishing people who choose not to stand.

Rien qu‘au cours de la dernière semaine, une demi-douzaine d‘entreprises ont annoncé des projets d‘IPO sur le London Stock Exchange, avec pour objectif de lever jusqu‘à 3,7 milliards de dollars (3,13 milliards d‘euros), contre environ 4 milliards de dollars au troisième trimestre.

Bakkavör entend utiliser le produit de l‘IPO pour réduire son endettement et accroître ses investissements. Le groupe a dégagé l‘an dernier un chiffre d‘affaires de près de 1,8 milliard de livres et un bénéfice imposable de 63,1 millions de livres.

Les banques HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Citigroup, Rabobank et Peel Hunt ont été mandatées pour cette opération.","Bakkavör prévoit une IPO à Londres le valorisant jusqu'à 1,5 milliard de livres",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idFRKBN1CF1CD-OFRBS

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) will remain an industry leader, with growth driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, high-performance computing (HPC) and mobile, its chairman Morris Chang said in an interview.

Chang, 86 and dubbed the father of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as he built up the Apple Inc supplier into the world’s biggest foundry chipmaker, said he expects driverless taxis in 10-20 years and sees artificial intelligence (AI) replacing many doctors.

“We’re going to be right there, hopefully ahead of anybody. But at least we’re going to be there with other people to the upper limits of technology,” Chang told Reuters at the company’s headquarters in Taipei.

Chang expects TSMC, which has a market value of about $185 billion, to increase its capital spending by 5-10 percent over the next five years, and to continue to invest in research and development where it employs about 6,000 workers. He also expects further consolidation in the chip industry.

His remarks come just days after he said he would retire next June. He will be succeeded as chairman by Mark Liu, with C.C. Wei appointed as chief executive. The two have worked together as co-CEOs since 2013.

Puffing on a pipe, Chang said he would offer his successors advice until he steps down, and a key message would be the importance of sealing partnerships.

“We need to establish partnerships in IoT, automotive, high-performance computing,” he said, adding that mobile still has bright prospects for the next few years. “Those are the four growth platforms we have identified.”

Chang’s remarks come as TSMC, which has thrived on booming demand for chips used in smartphones, seeks to diversify its customer base and move into emerging sectors such as AI.

It must also deal with a growing threat from Samsung Electronics, the world’s top memory chipmaker, which plans to triple the market share of its contract chipmaking business within five years by aggressively adding clients.

To fend off competitors, TSMC needed to compete on every front, Chang said, adding that chip subsidies in China were a challenge for the semiconductor industry.

“We still sell in China, but the fact is that China is subsidizing a lot of companies ... so the result is that companies in China can continue to lose money for a long time and yet still survive,” he said.

While TSMC was still looking to identify the best potential partners, Chang highlighted its current partner Nvidia as a rising star in AI.

Slideshow (5 Images)

Chang founded TSMC in 1987 with paid-in capital of T$1.4 billion ($45 million), and pioneered contract chip manufacturing for chip design firms which don’t have their own factories.

Among his achievements, Chang said he was most proud of building TSMC into its present position, and also noted his time at Texas Instruments where he helped build the semiconductor business.

Chang spent 25 years at Texas Instruments and holds a doctorate from Stanford. Born in China, he went to Taiwan in 1985 after being recruited by the government to head a body promoting industrial and technological development.

He says he is bowing out after 30 years of service to TSMC to spend more time with his family, but he’ll keep a close eye on the company.

“After I leave, I’ll be looking at the balance sheet, the P&L, and I’ll be listening to the analyst calls,” he said. “I don’t think I’ll be asking questions, I’ll just be a very interested investor.”

Chang owns 0.48 percent of TSMC shares, according to the company’s website, worth around $926 million.","Retiring TSMC founder predicts fewer doctors, no taxi drivers",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-chang/retiring-tsmc-founder-predicts-fewer-doctors-no-taxi-drivers-idUSKBN1CB22B

The IMF upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage points to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

Forecasts for euro zone, Japan, China, emerging market Europe and Russia were all revised upwards.

The growth outlook in the United States was unchanged from the Fund’s July report at 2.2 percent for this year and 2.3 percent in 2018, as expected tax cuts under President Trump’s administration have not yet materialized.

The U.S. outlook for 2017 had been cut by 0.1 percentage points, and its 2018 forecast had been cut by 0.2 percentage points in the Fund’s April report, but then revised upwards in July by the same amounts.

“Given the significant policy uncertainty, IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecast now uses a baseline assumption of unchanged policies, whereas the April 2017 WEO (World Economic Outlook) built in a fiscal stimulus from anticipated tax cuts,” the Fund said in its revisions to its U.S. economic forecasts.

The U.S. Republican party has presented three tax proposals since Trump took office in January and the latest effort by the Trump administration is already mired in political disagreements in Congress.

The Fund said that over the longer term, U.S. economic growth would moderate due to sluggish productivity growth and changing demographics. It said the economy’s potential growth rate was just 1.8 percent, far lower than the 3.0 percent or more being targeted by Trump and his administration.

EURO ZONE RECOVERY

Economic growth in the euro zone was revised upwards from the July forecast by 0.2 percentage points for both 2017 and 2018 to 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent respectively, reflecting an export revival, stronger domestic demand due to accommodative financial conditions and a lowering of political risk.

The report pre-dated unrest in the Catalonia region of Spain.

The Fund cautioned that euro zone growth would remain under pressure due to weak productivity, an ageing population and, in some countries, high debt.

Economic growth in Britain for 2017 had already been revised sharply lower by the Fund to 1.7 percent in the wake of the country’s vote to leave the European Union and so-far inconclusive talks on Brexit.

The Fund had already cut its 2017 forecast by 0.3 percentage points in July from April and left its latest forecast unchanged.

Since its 2016 Brexit vote, Britain has gone from being one of the fastest growing economies in the Group of Seven rich nations to one of the slowest, with only Japan and Italy forecast to grow more slowly than the 1.5 percent forecast for Britain in 2018.

The Fund upgraded its growth rates for China all the way through 2022, on the assumption that authorities in Beijing will maintain expansionary policies. The Fund forecast 6.8 percent growth for this year and 6.5 percent for next, both upward revisions of 0.1 percentage points from July.

Looking forward, the Fund warned that potential major disruptions to its global outlook could come from “difficult-to-predict” U.S. regulatory, trade and fiscal policies, and from disruptions relating to Britain’s exit from the European Union, as well from central banks raising interest rates too quickly.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is now well into a cycle of interest rate rises that began in late 2015, although the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have yet to move away from negative rates and bond buying.

“In advanced economies, monetary policy settings should remain accommodative until there are firm signs of inflation returning to targets...(as) still-subdued wage pressures mostly reflect remaining slack, not fully captured by headline unemployment rates,” the Fund said.","World economic growth improving, even as U.S., UK potential slows: IMF",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-imf-g20-outlook/world-economic-growth-improving-even-as-u-s-uk-potential-slows-imf-idUKKBN1CF1OR?il=0

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility.
Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll.","Unlike the nerve-jangling elections earlier this year in the Netherlands, France and Britain, Germany’s has been notably dull. The country that invented “Sturm und Drang” is showing a distinct lack of storm and stress as Angela Merkel heads towards a fourth term as chancellor.

That seemingly inexorable outcome on Sept. 24 has raised hopes that she will push through greater integration within the euro area, in partnership with French president Emmanuel Macron, while also championing the rules-based international order that America has forsaken under Donald Trump. But Merkel will find it hard to satisfy such expectations, since she will face new political constraints at home, while the basis for her authority, German economic strength, will come under increasing strain.

A string of polls suggests that the politics of Merkel’s fourth term will be tricky. The chancellor is a long way ahead but she is not doing as well as in the last election, in 2013. Recent findings show support for her center-right CDU party (together with the CSU in Bavaria) at around 36 percent, down from the 41.5 percent she managed four years ago. Because of Germany’s electoral system, which broadly aligns the distribution of seats in the Bundestag with the parties’ share of the vote – while excluding those that fail to reach a 5 percent voting threshold - she will once again have to form a coalition.

The most stable government would be another “grand coalition” with the center-left SPD, her current partner, which is currently polling at around 22 percent. That might appeal to the SPD leadership but many party members are opposed to playing second fiddle again, not least since this does not pay off at the polls. If Merkel cannot form a coalition with the SPD, she may have to form a coalition with not just one but two smaller parties, the FDP and the Greens. This combination would be a first in the Bundestag and it could prove fissile by bringing together the free-market FDP, Merkel’s junior partner in her second term of office between 2009 and 2013, with Germany’s environmentalist party, which has in the past allied itself with the SPD.

The coalition arithmetic could change if the election throws up surprise results for the smaller parties. But whatever alliance Merkel forms after probably protracted negotiations, it will face a disturbing new political phenomenon. Until now the Bundestag has been immune from the upsurge of populism in Europe. But the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) looks set to break through the 5 percent threshold that held it at bay in 2013. Currently polling around 10 percent, it has mutated from its euroskeptic origins into an anti-immigration party, capitalizing upon concerns about the influx of asylum-seekers in 2015. Though riven by internal divisions and shunned by the other parties, the AfD will be able to use its presence in the Bundestag as a platform for its populist opposition to the chancellor’s policies.

The politics of Merkel’s fourth term may be more unfavorable than before, but that should be surmountable if the economy – her trump card in the election - remains buoyant. Growth prospects for this year and next year are good, continuing a robust performance in the chancellor’s last two terms. Manufacturers excel in exporting the high-quality engineering products in which Germany specializes. The current-account surplus is extraordinarily high at around 8 percent of GDP. Helped by the humming economy and low interest rates on government debt, Germany boasts healthy public finances too, running a surplus of almost 1 percent of GDP.

Peter Apps: The coming robot arms race

John Lloyd: Labor reform in France's Macron economy

German economic and fiscal strength, so crucial in underpinning the euro zone during the crisis years of 2010-12, has come to be taken for granted. Yet under the shiny paint the engine looks less reliable for the longer journey ahead. Much of the economy does not match the prowess of German manufacturers. In particular Germany lags in business services, as a report from the OECD pointed out last year. Many professions are subject to restrictions that fetter competition. Germany is overbanked with too many small lenders and the banking sector has unhelpfully high levels of public ownership.

Moreover, the business model of German manufacturing is under threat. The diesel emissions scandal that began when Volkswagen admitted cheating U.S. emissions tests has cast a shadow over the country’s premier industry and German carmakers’ big bet on the fuel now looks misplaced. They have to scramble to catch up with electric-powered models, whose time has come thanks both to technological advances and a wave of public-health measures led by cities to ban polluting vehicles. The self-driving revolution poses another challenge to German carmakers. Manufacturers fret that they may be on the wrong side of the digital divide, with Silicon Valley in effect grabbing the high value-added content of many products.

Germans are proud of their massive current-account surplus, yet the domestic counterpart is a lack of investment to absorb national savings. The government’s drive to balance the books has come at the cost of inadequate capital spending on the national infrastructure. Business investment has been subdued. Indeed, according to the OECD’s survey, German firms are behind those of other advanced countries in investing in the “knowledge-based capital”, such as software and management skills, that is increasingly important in spurring greater efficiency. That is one reason why productivity growth has been weak.

An underlying and profound weakness is that Germany’s demographics are especially unfavorable in economic terms. At almost 46, the median age of the population in 2015 was only just lower than Japan’s, the world’s oldest, according to UN data released in June. Although there was a baby boom from the mid-1950s through most of the 1960s, the birth rate fell below the replacement level (of 2.1 children per woman) at the start of the 1970s and has since been among the lowest in the world; indeed the current fertility rate of 1.5 is unusually high. These persistently low birth rates mean that there are fewer young people to replace the bulge of baby-boomers as they retire. Despite the recent upsurge in immigration the working-age population is set to fall, which will act as a persistent drag on growth by reducing the number of workers over the next couple of decades.

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility. Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll. That will limit her ability to meet the exaggerated expectations of what she can achieve both within Europe and on the wider international stage.",Commentary: Don’t be fooled by Merkel’s aura of invincibility,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-germany-commentary/commentary-dont-be-fooled-by-merkels-aura-of-invincibility-idUSKCN1BU2BJ

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - A produção de grãos e oleaginosas pelo Brasil na safra 2017/18 poderá cair até 6 por cento ante o ciclo anterior, refletindo a perspectiva de condições climáticas não tão favoráveis como aquelas da temporada 2016/17, projetou nesta terça-feira a Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (Conab).

Em seu primeiro levantamento para a nova safra, o órgão estimou que a produção varie de 224,17 milhões a 228,20 milhões de toneladas, queda de 6 a 4,3 por cento ante as 238,50 milhões de toneladas registradas em 2016/17.

“Condições climáticas altamente favoráveis contribuíram para a safra passada alcançar recorde histórico. Tais condições dificilmente se repetirão, por isso a expectativa de redução produtiva”, resumiu a Conab.

Com efeito, a companhia projeta uma queda de produtividade média de 4 por cento para as culturas de verão e de inverno, atenuando as projeções para a área plantada, que deve se manter em 60,88 milhões de hectares ou aumentar em 1,8 por cento, para 62 milhões de hectares, graças ao incremento no plantio de algodão e, sobretudo, de soja.

“A produtividade deve sofrer redução para praticamente todas as culturas”, disse a Conab.

SOJA E MILHO

Conforme a Conab, soja e milho continuam como as principais culturas e devem responder por cerca de 89 por cento do total produzido no país.

A expectativa é de que a produção de soja alcance entre 106 milhões e 108 milhões de toneladas, queda de 7,1 por cento ou de 5,1 por cento em relação a 2016/17, quando o Brasil colheu um recorde de 114,07 milhões de toneladas.

A área plantada com a oleaginosa deve alcançar um novo recorde e deve variar de 34,46 milhões a 35,20 milhões de hectares, avanço de 1,6 ou de 3,8 por cento sobre 2016/17.

Os números de produção de soja informados pela Conab são inferiores ante a média de uma pesquisa da Reuters com consultorias e instituições do mercado, mas as projeções para a área acompanham o levantamento realizado na semana passada.

Quanto ao milho, a Conab prevê uma produção total de até 93,60 milhões de toneladas, queda de 4,3 por cento, sendo 26,43 milhões de toneladas para a primeira safra, colhida no verão, e as outras 67,17 milhões de toneladas para a “safrinha”, cuja colheita se dá no inverno.

Já a área total com milho deve alcançar até 17,25 milhões de hectares, recuo de 1,9 por cento, dos quais 5,14 milhões de hectares na primeira safra e 12,10 milhões de hectares na “safrinha”.

Na pesquisa da Reuters, os especialistas projetaram, em média, uma produção de 26,66 milhões de toneladas de milho na primeira safra, com área de 5,27 milhões de hectares.

“A área para milho primeira safra, que sofre a concorrência do cultivo de soja, deve ser reduzida entre 10,1 por cento a 6,1 por cento em relação a 2016/2017...Já a soja, que vem oferecendo maior liquidez e possibilidade de melhor rentabilidade frente a outras culturas, deve alcançar maior área para produção, com um incremento médio de cerca de 2,7 por cento comparado à safra passada”, destacou a Conab.","Safra 2017/18 do Brasil deve cair com clima menos favorável, diz Conab",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CF1I9-OBRTP

The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc (FB.O), but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of the confidential investigation by Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said separately on Monday that it was looking at whether Russians bought U.S. election ads on its Bing search engine or other Microsoft-owned products and platforms. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment further.

The revelation about Google is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.

Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.

The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European residents, according to lawmakers and researchers.

Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.

Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.

Russia’s ad purchases on Google were first reported by the Washington Post.

Google did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.

“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.

‘DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY’

Google, which runs the world’s largest online advertising business, had largely evaded public or congressional scrutiny until now. On Sunday, the Daily Beast news website reported that the Kremlin recruited at least two black video bloggers to post clips on YouTube during the campaign. They posed as Black Lives Matter sympathizers who were sharply critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Though the videos were only viewed hundreds of times, they demonstrated for the first time that Russia allegedly deployed real people, not just fake online accounts or bots, to further spread propaganda.

Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into Russian interference, but concern about Silicon Valley’s role has surged over the past month against the backdrop of a cascade of revelations about how Russia appears to have leveraged their platforms to spread propaganda.

A study published on Monday by researchers with the Oxford Internet Institute, which is affiliated with the British university, found that current U.S. military personnel and veterans were targeted by disinformation campaigns on Twitter and Facebook over the past year by a nexus of pro-Kremlin, Russian-oriented sites, along with conspiracy theorists and European right-wing ideologues.

Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election. Some Democrats plan to introduce legislation to require internet companies to disclose more information about political ad purchases on their platforms.

“If Vladimir Putin is using Facebook or Google or Twitter to, in effect, destroy our democracy, the American people should know about it,” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Monday on MSNBC.

Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter. While Facebook and Twitter have confirmed plans to attend, Google has not.","Google uncovered Russia-backed ads on YouTube, Gmail : source",https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia-alphabet/google-uncovered-russia-backed-ads-on-youtube-gmail-source-idINKBN1CE18Z

Secondo i dati forniti oggi dall‘Istituto di statistica, i cittadini non comunitari regolarmente presenti al 1° gennaio 2017 erano 3.714.137. I principali Paesi di provenienza sono Marocco, Albania, Cina, Ucraina e Filippine.

Lo scorso anno hanno acquisito la cittadinanza italiana 184.638 immigrati non comunitari, il 16% in più su anno, contro i meno di 50.000 nel 2011; albanesi e marocchini insieme coprono il 39% della cifra.

Regional leader Carles Puigdemont held a meeting of his cabinet to decide how to press an independence drive that has stirred powerful emotions across Spain and raised concern in European Union partner states.

Catalan police armed with automatic rifles stood guard at Barcelona’s Parc de la Ciutadella which houses the elegant 18th century building. Spanish national police, decried by separatists over their use of force to hinder an Oct. 1 referendum, were not to be seen.

A declaration of independence would deepen Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and would almost certainly draw tough counter-measures from Madrid, possibly including suspension of the regional government.

The parliament and other buildings, such as the regional high court building, could become a focus of contention between Spanish and Catalan authorities.

Thousands of national police reinforcements sent by Madrid for the referendum remain in the area, many of them in two cruise ships docked in Barcelona harbor.

Pro-independence demonstrators were due to gather before the parliament building under the slogan “Hello Republic” to mark Puigdemont’s speech at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).

Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Barcelona against independence at the weekend, waving red-yellow Spanish flags through the city center. That rally fell a week after some 900 people were injured when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt a referendum ruled illegal in Madrid.

Related Coverage Spain's creditors size up cost of Catalan independence bid

Puigdemont has said he is determined to apply a law passed by the Catalan assembly which called for a declaration of independence within days if Catalans voted ‘yes’ in the Oct. 1 referendum.

The government of Spain’s wealthiest region says 90 percent of those who voted backed independence, but turnout was only 43 percent as many opponents of independence stayed at home.

The Madrid government has said it will respond immediately to any unilateral declaration.

Puigdemont could ask the parliament to vote on a motion of independence, which lawmakers say would start a period of up to six months during which Catalonia would write a new constitution and negotiate a divorce with Spain; or he could make a statement of intent on a future independence declaration.

Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to disclose what Puigdemont would say but told a news conference after the cabinet meeting he would be “clear and explicit” and Tuesday would be an historic day.

Ruling party lawmakers say Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is considering taking the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering new regional elections, the so-called nuclear option.

The European Commission repeated its call for dialogue in Spain to end the crisis in Catalonia. Puigdemont has also called for talks and international mediation, but Rajoy has said he will not negotiate with the Catalan leaders unless they abandon plans to declare independence.

BUSINESS CLIMATE

Markets have been rattled by the Catalan crisis, raising Spain’s borrowing costs and pushing down shares.

Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond yields were a touch lower on Tuesday, but above lows hit the previous session as investors awaited Puigdemont’s speech. Spain’s benchmark Ibex share index was down nearly one percent.

The tension is taking its toll on the business climate. On Monday, three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business drift from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum.

Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial and infrastructure firm Abertis both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued.

Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence.

Spain’s finance minister said it was the Catalan government’s fault the companies were leaving.

The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

LONDON (Reuters) - The boom in emerging market technology stocks is becoming a problem for fund managers of all stripes.

The soaring market capitalization of a handful of companies such as China’s Alibaba (BABA.N) and Tencent (0700.HK) is steadily lifting their weighting in the MSCI emerging equities index .MSCIEF.

This means investors in funds that track indexes (exchange traded funds or ETFs) - who want exposure to a range of companies for a lower fund management fee - are finding themselves increasingly exposed to a single sector.

Meanwhile, active fund managers, who justify charging higher fees for their individual stock-picking expertise, are under pressure to buy those tech stocks to ensure their funds keep up with the index’s gains.

And with both sets of investor chasing the same thing, the risk of dramatic outflows increases if the sector falters.

“It’s the opposite of what you are trying to do with an ETF - you want cheap diversified exposure but you end up being concentrated in basically 10 stocks,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma, who holds active EM funds.

The biggest five emerging market companies in the index are tech firms Alibaba, Tencent, Samsung (005930.KS), Naspers (NPNJn.J) and Taiwan Semiconductor (5425.TWO).

They comprise almost 19 percent of the index's market capitalization. That is a bigger chunk than the S&P 500 where the top five firms - Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , Apple (AAPL.OQ), Facebook (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.OQ), and Amazon (AMZN.OQ) - make up 13 percent .SPX.

The increasing use of ETFs has helped boost valuations further because they must follow the index weighting.

And the index’s concentration has intensified as valuations rose - the five companies’ share was 13.9 percent in January.

DISCOMFORT

The shift toward passive investing, evident across most asset classes, has come into focus in emerging equities, which have enjoyed a sparkling 60 percent rally since early-2016. But the sector may also illustrate the concentration risks that exchange-traded funds can bring to portfolios.

Emerging equity funds have received some $56 billion so far this year, Lipper data shows. Of this, $23 billion went into ETFs.

Investors are keen on tech companies which are making profits by disrupting the status quo in sectors from media and advertising to retail and industrials.

But the dependence on technology for returns is causing some discomfort among investors who prefer shares in emerging market car or beverage makers for instance for exposure to consumer demand in the developing world.

Ed Kerschner, chief portfolio strategist at Columbia Threadneedle, says the tech companies’ performance mostly reflects that of their U.S. peers rather than providing exposure to developing countries.

“The question is are you buying emerging markets or are you buying technology?” Kerschner said. “The risk of buying EM benchmarks is that you are not diversifying away from the S&P.”

As a result of the tech rally, the conventional market-cap weighted emerging equity index, with bigger weightings in companies with the largest market caps, has begun strongly outperforming the index where all companies are assigned the same weighting.

The success can also be reversed. Any faltering by the tech leaders would have a proportionally weighty effect on ETFs, potentially spurring big outflows.

Scott Snyder, co-portfolio manager of the ICON emerging markets fund, estimates that the four biggest tech firms have accounted for a third of 2017’s emerging equity returns.

“A lot of people that might just be piling into passive strategies in EM could be overly exposed to technology right now,” ICON’s Snyder said.

THE “WRONG” REASON

There are also signs that many active emerging market managers, who would have had more diverse investments than ETF funds, are sticking more closely to the benchmark.

Data from Copley Fund Research shows the average active share of global emerging market funds - the extent to which their holdings differ from the index - has fallen to 74.7 percent from a peak of 78 percent in April 2016.

Partly this is due to the addition in May 2016 of U.S.-listed Chinese firms to the emerging benchmark - because active investors held these stocks before their inclusion in the index - but competition from ETFs may also play a role.

“The effect of rising ETF flows and narrowing breadth has been to push active investors to get closer to their benchmarks,” said Edward Cole, a portfolio manager at GLG Man Group.

Even among active managers, many may be holding tech stocks for the “wrong” reason - fear of underperforming the index, said Kiran Nandra-Koehrer, senior product specialist in Pictet Asset Management’s emerging equities team.

While many investors are wary of paying higher fees for funds to replicate the index, active managers don’t want to risk missing out on meaty returns from tech.

A streak of losses and fund closures remains fresh in their mind, with 746 emerging market funds liquidated in the last five years, according to Lipper data.

But Psigma’s McPherson cited one of his holdings, Mirabaud’s Emerging Markets fund, which has returned over 33 percent this year, outgunning the MSCI index’s 29 percent. That shows an active manager can overcome concentration risks.

Prime Minister Theresa May made clear in a speech she delivered to parliament that she hoped her EU partners would make proposals at a new round of talks opening the way to the next stage of negotiations, saying “the ball is in their court”.

But even before she had delivered her address, an EU spokesman hit back in Brussels, saying “the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen”.

May is desperate to try to regain some of her authority and refocus on talks to unravel 40 years of union after a speech at her party conference last week, marred by a repetitive cough, a prankster and a stage malfunction, left her weaker than ever.

She has so far fought off attempts to unseat her by critics already angry over an ill-judged election when she lost her governing Conservatives’ majority. But her weakness has opened the door for many in the party to challenge her Brexit strategy with just 18 months to go before Britain leaves the EU.

With Brussels quietly preparing for a collapse in the talks and Britain getting ready for what May calls “every eventuality”, some officials and business chiefs worry the country will crash out of the EU without a deal.

Speaking in parliament, May said her negotiators had made progress on the first phase of talks, tackling the rights of expatriates and the border with EU-member Ireland, and that she was determined to secure a new partnership with the other 27 members of the wealthy political and trade bloc.

“Achieving that partnership will require leadership and flexibility, not just from us but from our friends, the 27 nations of the EU,” she told a raucous session of parliament.

“And as we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response.”

But the EU stuck to its terms: “There is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings,” European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular briefing. “So the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen.”

“SEE WHAT HAPPENS”

May, who hosted businesses on Monday to listen to their Brexit concerns, is keen to push the talks beyond a discussion of the divorce to try to offer firms some certainty about future trading conditions.

According to a source familiar with the matter, May told business leaders that for her, a roughly two-year transitional agreement was non-negotiable. “It will happen,” the source said when asked what May had spoken about.

She also said her government had no intention of revoking Article 50, which triggered the Brexit talks in March this year, and stopping Britain’s departure.

But a lack of progress in talks some 15 months after Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum has added pressure on May, who was criticized by the opposition for failing to offer any clarity on what the future relationship will look like.

“Now the reality for this Tory (Conservative) government is beginning to bite, but if things do not improve, the reality may soon begin to bite for the jobs and living standards of the people of this country,” said Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party.

A report that aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems (BAES.L) is planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs did little to ease those concerns that without progress in the talks, firms will start to make staffing and relocation decisions.

EU negotiators say that while they see no big breakthrough at the summit next week, they may offer May a hand by offering hope of a shift at the next scheduled meeting in mid-December.

Aides to May have signaled that the prime minister has accepted that her October deadline will not be met despite a speech in Italy last month which attempted to reset the tone of the difficult negotiations.

But some pro-Brexit campaigners are calling on the prime minister to get ready to step away from the talks - underlining the deep divisions in the Conservative Party.

Those differences were aired again on Monday with negative briefings in the local media against finance minister Philip Hammond, who supports prolonging the status quo with the EU for as long as possible, and foreign minister Boris Johnson, who angered some Conservatives for setting his own Brexit red lines.

Some have suggested that May will reshuffle her cabinet, but her spokesman said she had full confidence in both ministers.

“We are fast reaching the point when the prime minister should assert the authority of her office over the negotiations and call time,” Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative lawmaker, wrote in the Guardian newspaper.

John Baron, another pro-Brexit campaigner, called on the government to “prepare more thoroughly for a ‘no deal’”.

“I have long believed that the EU Commission primarily wants to punish Britain for daring to leave the organization,” he said. “We should have no fears about a ‘no deal’ scenario.”","'Ball in your court:' Britain, EU clash over next Brexit move",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-may/ball-in-your-court-britain-eu-clash-over-next-brexit-move-idUKKBN1CD10Y

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares ground out a fresh record high on Tuesday, making it almost 50 for the year, although Europe traded cautiously as markets waited to see whether Spain’s Catalonia region would push for independence later in the day.

Japan and South Korea returned from extended breaks to give Asia a lift a Wall Street looked set to open higher, [.N] but the Catalan uncertainty meant the euro zone’s main bourses [.EU] and Spanish bond markets spent the day in the red.

Catalonia’s secessionist leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the region’s parliament in Barcelona around 1600 GMT and could ask the assembly to vote on a unilateral declaration of independence from Madrid.

It is Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and Madrid’s IBEX stocks index was 1 percent lower in early afternoon trade. It is now down almost 9 percent since May, though a sharp rise in the euro has also taken a toll.

“We have not witnessed any relevant statement or signal by the separatists that would hint at a change of strategy ahead of today’s discussion in the Catalonian parliament,” economists at Barclays wrote.

“Consequently, at this point, it seems likely that Catalan President Carles Puigdemont remains on track to announce a unilateral declaration of independence as early as today.”

The euro remained resilient. It hopped to a one-week high of almost $1.18 as data showed German exports surged in August. Traders were also still upbeat after one of the European Central Bank’s German policymakers called for an end to its stimulus.

There was also help from a weaker dollar which was down for a third straight day. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, dropped 0.3 percent to 93.366 and away from Friday’s almost 3-month peak.

It gave the Turkish lira a breather after it had been sent sprawling to a nine-month low on Monday after the United States and Turkey scaled back visa services.

Mexico’s peso hovered at its weakest in more than four months too, ahead of the latest round of talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Wednesday.

“Mexican asset prices have been very well supported this year so we think there needs to be a little bit of caution,” said UBP’s EM macro and FX strategist Koon Chow.

“There is not much of a cushion for bad news now and NAFTA talks are unlikely to bring any good news.”

China’s Statistics Bureau on Tuesday said the country would have no problem meeting its economic growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, and might even beat it. Such an outcome had been widely expected after a robust start to the year.

The offshore Chinese yuan rate surged to its strongest level in more than two weeks. The central bank had also set a firmer-than-expected official rate, suggesting authorities are keen to keep the currency in check ahead of next week’s key national leadership meeting.

The stocks gains came in spite of tensions on the Korean peninsula. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Monday that any further escalation of the situation was unacceptable.

China had also called for restraint. U.S. President Donald Trump warned over the weekend that “only one thing will work” in dealing with Pyongyang, hinting that military action was on his mind.

(Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N) said on Tuesday it was considering the sale or spin-off of its consumer healthcare business, shaking up the industry and potentially putting a headache pill to lip balm operation worth as much as $14 billion up for grabs.

The move comes as Germany’s Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) is also looking to divest its non-prescription products, including brands such as Seven Seas vitamins, which could be worth around $4.5 billion.

As ageing populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication, the fragmented consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal-making in recent years.

Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very long-lasting brands with loyal customers.

Pfizer’s consumer healthcare business, whose brands include painkiller Advil and lip balm Chapstick, had revenue of about $3.4 billion in 2016. Industry experts said it could fetch around four times sales, implying a potential value of up $14 billion.

Pfizer, which saw its shares rise about 1 percent at $36.50 in premarket trading, said it would decide on the future of its consumer unit during 2018.

Reuters first reported last November that a divestment of the Pfizer consumer business was under consideration.

Established consumer health companies that might be interested in the Pfizer assets include Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Abbott (ABT.N).

They could be potentially be joined by non-traditional players such as Nestle (NESN.S), which is exploring the boundaries of food and healthcare. One person familiar with the matter said Pfizer expected a “broadening” of buyer interest.

Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Sanofi (SASY.PA) may be less likely to bid, despite their consumer health presence, given they are busy absorbing Monsanto (MON.N) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s consumer business respectively.

In explaining the thinking behind the review, Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said consumer healthcare was connected but not integral to its core prescription drug business.

“Although there is a strong connection between consumer healthcare and elements of our core biopharmaceutical businesses, it is also distinct enough from our core business that there is potential for its value to be more fully realized outside the company,” he said.

Options to be considered include a full or partial separation of the unit through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. Pfizer may also ultimately decide to keep the business.

The Pfizer business includes two of the 10 top-selling consumer healthcare brands globally in Advil and the multivitamin line Centrum. It also has 10 brands that each exceeded $100 million in 2016 sales.

A Pfizer exit from the consumer health business would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a $160 billion deal to buy Allergan (AGN.N) last year.

Separately on Tuesday, Britain’s budget forecasters gave a gloomier medium-term outlook for the economy, potentially leaving finance minister Philip Hammond with less room to offset any big hit from Britain’s departure from the European Union.

The somewhat downbeat picture for the world’s fifth-biggest economy from a raft of data - including a record goods trade deficit - contrasted with the situation in some of Britain’s closest trading partners in the European Union.

German exports outpaced imports in August, adding to signs it performed strongly in the third quarter, and Italian industrial output was much stronger than expected.

But there were some signs of encouragement for Britain.

The country’s factories had their strongest two months of 2017 in July and August, and the construction sector grew for the first time in three months.

In year-on-year terms, factory output was 2.8 percent higher, its fastest growth in six months.

Revisions to past data showed Britain’s economy had been a bit less weak earlier this year than previously thought.

“They’re not storming figures but I think they’re good enough to keep the Bank of England on track for a November rate hike,” said Victoria Clarke, an economist with Investec.

Britain’s economy has slowed sharply this year as consumers felt the pinch from rising inflation, caused largely by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote, and by weak wage growth.

BOE ANNOUNCEMENT

Nonetheless, the BoE said last month that most of its policymakers thought it was likely that they would need to raise rates for the first time in a decade in the coming months.

The BoE believes last year’s Brexit vote will create more inflation pressure by dampening business investment and slowing migration to Britain.

Figures for the much bigger services sector are due to be released on Oct. 25, along with a preliminary first estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product growth, little more than a week before the BoE’s Nov. 2 announcement.

Many economists say only a shock weakening in those figures is likely to cause the BoE to delay raising rates.

In a reminder of the long-standing problems that have held back Britain’s economy, Tuesday’s data showed the country’s deficit in its trade in goods hit an all-time high in cash terms.

That was despite the slump in the value of the pound which some supporters of Brexit have predicted will deliver an export boom. Export volumes in the three months to August were 3.2 percent lower than the previous three months, though they are 8.9 percent higher than a year before.

And there was bad news regarding the Achilles heel of the British economy - the long-standing weak record of its companies and workers to squeeze more output from their work.

Britain’s official budget watchdog said it expected to “significantly” downgrade its forecasts for productivity growth in the next five years.

Finance minister Hammond is due to present an annual budget on Nov. 22. Although he is under pressure to increase public spending and eliminate a pay cap on public sector pay, any cut in productivity forecasts would substantially limit his room for maneuver by reducing future tax revenues.","UK stuck in slow growth gear, BoE on course to raise rates",https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-economy/uk-stuck-in-slow-growth-gear-boe-on-course-to-raise-rates-idINKBN1CF1FB

LONDON (Reuters) - BAE Systems will shed 2,000 jobs as new chief executive Charles Woodburn tries to shake up Britain’s biggest defence contractor in the face of dwindling orders for the Typhoon fighter jet.

The Eurofighter Typhoon has won fewer orders this year than the rival Rafale built by France’s Dassault Aviation, as a major order expected from Saudi Arabia has not materialised, although Qatar agreed to buy 24 Typhoon and six Hawk trainer jets in September.

Woodburn, who took over as chief executive in July, plans a major overhaul of the non-U.S. operations of Britain’s preeminent defence supplier, including revamping its air and maritime operations and simplifying management structures.

“These changes will drive competitiveness; accelerate technology innovation; and deliver continued improvements in efficiency and operational excellence,” the company said in a statement.

Britain’s Unite union vowed to fight the “devastatingly short sighted” job losses that it said would undermine the sovereign defence capability of one of the European Union’s top two military powers.

BAE, which has been the backbone of Britain’s defence industry for decades, employs 34,600 people in the country out of a global workforce of 83,100.

Britain will look to support BAE and its workers, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said.

BAE said it will also cut around 375 jobs at its maritime operations, which design the Britain new Dreadnought class of nuclear submarine. Maritime accounted for a quarter of its sales, while its land unit, which builds combat vehicles, accounts for 16 percent.

It will also cut 150 jobs at its Applied Intelligence unit that helps companies and governments fight cyber-warfare.

Defence analyst Howard Wheeldon said the cuts were essentially due to a gap in orders emerging in key programmes such as Typhoon and Hawk, and other programmes, such as support work for the Tornado jet, also ending soon.

“It is the stamp of a new CEO who has looked across the group and decided where it needs to be heading,” he said.

“It takes out a management layer and lays out a new structure and the people for the years ahead.”

DEFENCE CAPABILITY

Just over half of BAE’s 19 billion pounds ($25 billion) of sales in 2016 came from its aircraft business, which is also a partner in the F-35 Lightning II combat jet programme.

Based on current orders for the Typhoon and Hawk, BAE said it needed to reduce the workforce by up to 1,400 roles.

BAE’s Warton and Samlesbury plants will suffer the brunt of the losses as around 5,000 people there work on the Typhoon programme, which is a joint project between BAE, France’s Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo.

The group had already slowed production at two of its plants in Lancashire, northern England, which are involved in building the Typhoon jet.

“These planned job cuts will not only undermine Britain’s sovereign defence capability, but devastate communities across the UK who rely on these skilled jobs,” said Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union.

BAE said in August that any new orders were unlikely to impact production delivery rates positively for at least 24 months, and production would be under constant review.

“We obviously have to review our (Typhoon) production demand very carefully,” Woodburn said at the time.

The company said on Tuesday that discussions with current and prospective operators of the Typhoon continued to support its expectations for future contract awards.

The company said the reorganisation, which does not affect its U.S. managed business, did not change its outlook for the year.

It said it still expected its underlying earnings per share to be 5 percent to 10 percent higher than full-year underlying earnings per share in 2016 of 40.3p and it continued to expect a small reduction in net debt compared with 31 December 2016.

Shares in the group were trading down 0.5 percent at 616 pence at 1134 GMT.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia accused the United States on Tuesday of pretending to fight Islamic State and of deliberately reducing its air strikes in Iraq to allow the group’s militants to stream into Syria to slow the Russian-backed advance of the Syrian army.

In the latest sign of rising tensions between Moscow and Washington, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the U.S.-led coalition had sharply reduced its air strikes in Iraq in September when Syrian forces, backed by Russian air power, had started to retake Deir al-Zor Province.

“Everyone sees that the U.S.-led coalition is pretending to fight Islamic State, above all in Iraq, but continuing to allegedly fight Islamic State in Syria actively for some reason,” said Major-General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia’s defense ministry.

The result, he said, had been that militants had moved in large numbers from Iraqi border areas to Deir al-Zor where they were trying to dig in on the left bank of the River Euphrates.

“The actions of the Pentagon and the coalition demand an explanation. Is their change of tack a desire to complicate as much as they can the Syrian army’s operation, backed by the Russian air force, to take back Syrian territory to the east of the Euphrates?,” asked Konashenkov.

“Or is it an artful move to drive Islamic State terrorists out of Iraq by forcing them into Syria and into the path of the Russian air force’s pinpoint bombing?”

He said Syrian troops were in the midst of trying to push Islamic State out of the city of al-Mayadin, southeast of Deir al-Zor, but that IS tried daily to reinforce its ranks there with “foreign mercenaries” pouring in from Iraq.","Russia accuses U.S. of pretending to fight Islamic State in Syria, Iraq",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-russia-usa/russia-accuses-u-s-of-pretending-to-fight-islamic-state-in-syria-iraq-idUSKBN1CF0KN

Given an unproven business model and the flame-out of U.S. rival Blue Apron after its own initial public offering, the loss-making German group’s plan to float belongs in the deep-freeze.

HelloFresh said on Tuesday it plans to raise between 250 million euros and 300 million euros in a Frankfurt initial public offering. Largest shareholder Rocket Internet abandoned a previous IPO attempt in 2015 due to concerns over investor demand and market conditions. It’s not clear why now will be any better.

Shares in Blue Apron, which also ships pre-prepared recipe ingredients to time-poor urbanites, have roughly halved in value since a June listing, and the group trades at around a one-times multiple of forecast sales. At a similar rating, HelloFresh might be worth just under 1 billion euros, based on Barclays estimates of its revenue – about half the upper-end valuation that Bloomberg reported on Oct. 6.

Granted, some of Blue Apron’s problems are unique, such as “operational challenges” in its fulfilment centres and a dependence on the promotion-heavy U.S. market. But both companies are reliant on costly marketing to buy growth. The German group has even cooked up a new accounting measure: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and marketing, which was 122 million euros higher than EBITDA in the first half of 2017. If getting ahead is a question of piling on marketing spend, HelloFresh could face problems should a giant like Amazon, fresh from its acquisition of Whole Foods, or a major grocer muscle in.

Fortunately there’s no need to serve up this particular dish just yet. Loss-making HelloFresh needs fresh capital to keep growing, but shareholder Rocket Internet is flush with cash after selling shares in Germany’s Delivery Hero and it stake in e-commerce group Lazada.

MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Two staff members of a Kenyan university were killed south of Mombasa on Tuesday when gunmen fired on vehicles carrying them and students to their campus, the area police chief said.

The identity of the gunmen was unclear. Police in the coastal county of Kwale, where the Technical University of Mombasa (TUM) has a campus, said they could be robbers or militants.

Security is poor in the area and the convoy had a police escort. Somali Islamist militants al Shabaab frequently carry out attacks along the Kenyan coast and have been recruiting new members there.

In 2015, al Shabaab gunmen killed 148 students at a university in Kenya’s Garissa town near the Kenya-Somali border, an attack that provoked shock and outrage in Kenya and abroad.

“A bus carrying students of TUM was ferrying them from their hostels to the campus in Ukunda for classes and was being escorted by a van that had some staff of the college and two escort police officers,” the policeman said.

“Armed men numbering about 10 emerged from the bushes and started firing at the van in front. As a result two ladies who are staff of TUM were killed in the van. The driver of the van and two police officers were injured,” he said.

“For now we are treating it as a crime like any other as we continue with investigations but that does not mean we are ruling out al Shabaab.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose to above $56 a barrel on Tuesday, supported by Saudi Arabian export cuts in November and comments from OPEC and trading companies that the market is rebalancing after years of oversupply.

Saudi Arabia has cut November allocations by 560,000 barrels per day (bpd), in line with its commitment to an OPEC-led supply reduction pact. In the United States, some production remains offline following Hurricane Nate, lending additional support.

“Prices have been boosted by news that Saudi Arabia is planning to reduce its oil shipments to customers in November,” said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

Brent crude LCOc1, the international price benchmark, was up 80 cents at $56.59 a barrel at 1326 GMT. U.S. crude gained 97 cents to $50.55.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-member producers are cutting output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until next March to get rid of a price-sapping supply glut.

OPEC is increasingly confident that the market is rebalancing fast, helped by the cutback as well as by stronger-than-expected growth in global demand.

The chief executive of trading firm Gunvor, Torbjorn Tornqvist, also said the market was rebalancing, citing falling product stocks and crude held in floating storage clearing up.

“We don’t see this market being out of balance one way or another,” he told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit taking place this week. Overall crude stocks “are still high,” he added, and OPEC needed to stick to its output curbs.

Short-term price support was coming from the United States, where 85 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production, or 1.49 million bpd, was offline following Hurricane Nate, according to official figures.

OPEC has managed record-high adherence to its supply cutting deal this year and is considering extending the deal beyond its March 2018 expiry. Some analysts have been concerned that a price recovery could tempt producers to open the taps again.

But analysts at JP Morgan said this was less of an issue, saying “concerns that OPEC compliance would fade into the fourth quarter now appear unfounded.”

“Stronger-than-assumed economic growth offers the potential for tight market conditions to continue if OPEC extends the current deal for another nine months,” the bank said.",Oil rises above $56 on Saudi export cut,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-rises-above-56-on-saudi-export-cut-idINKBN1CF043?il=0

MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) plans to reduce the size of its European dealer network and introduce online sales as it adjusts to changing buying habits, the German carmaker said on Tuesday.

VW is pushing to cut costs across all of its 12 brands in the wake of the emissions scandal as it faces having to invest heavily in the shift toward electric cars.

In the latest move it aims to increase profitability and efficiency at its 3,000-dealer European distribution network by an average of 10 percent and wants to trim the costs of the network to help double the average return per distributor to 2 percent from 1 percent.

“We have for years been in consolidation mode in all world markets,” VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann told reporters. “This will surely accelerate somewhat in the next one, two years, also in Germany.”

But the executive gave no detail on the size of planned cost reductions and the number of dealerships due to be axed under VW’s “future sales model.”

Customers of mass-market car brands like VW’s are already making greater use of online shopping, allowing them to better compare rival offerings.

VW and dealers are now developing a joint online portal, Stackmann said, without giving details.

Reduced costs will also come from greater use of new IT, enabling dealerships to cut the time needed for servicing cars by as much as 70 percent, according to VW.

A VW distributor in Europe on average employs 35 staff and that workforce can be cut by about four over time or the staff affected can be assigned elsewhere, Stackmann said.

Under the terms of the carmaker’s new contracts with dealers, to be concluded early next year, VW wants to forego its right to dictate workforce sizes, he said, allowing dealers to trim staff.","VW to reduce size of dealer network, launch online sales",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-dealers/vw-to-reduce-size-of-dealer-network-launch-online-sales-idUSKBN1CF13S?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) on Tuesday unveiled a $20 billion share buyback plan and forecast U.S. online sales to increase by about 40 percent in the fiscal year ending January 2019.

Wal-Mart’s shares were up 1.6 percent at $81.80 in premarket trading after the company also forecast overall net sales to increase by at least 3 percent in the same period.

The company, locked in a battle for market share with ecommerce giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), has been doubling down on its online business and is leveraging its 4,700 plus stores to create a more hassle-free experience for its online shoppers.

Wal-Mart reported a 60 percent jump in online sales in the United States in its latest quarter ended July.

“It is clear that Wal-Mart intends to continue to turn up the heat online, with 40 percent annual growth an impressive goal, especially on the heels of the 30 percent outlined at the 2016 investor meeting, which at the time seemed aspirational in our view,” Moody’s Lead Retail Analyst Charlie O‘Shea said.

The largest U.S. grocery retailer also said it expects to add 1,000 locations for shipping online grocery orders in fiscal year 2019. It currently ships online orders from more than 900 U.S. locations.

Competition in the grocery space has increased since Amazon bought Whole Foods and cut prices at the upmarket grocer in August.

The company forecast profit for fiscal year 2019 to increase about 5 percent over the expected adjusted earnings of $4.30 to $4.40 per share for the year ending January 2018.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets President Donald Trump on Wednesday, he will try to persuade the U.S. leader to focus on Mexico as a source of potential problems at talks to update NAFTA.

Although Trudeau officials were confident Trump would mostly target Mexico as the three nations started to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, Washington has slapped duties on Canadian Bombardier airliners and lumber exports in recent months and talked tough on dairy and wine.

Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Trudeau would “explain really clearly to the President ... that Canada is not America’s problem”.

Freeland, who says Canada buys more from the United States than China, Britain and Japan combined, told CTV television on Sunday that Trudeau’s message to Trump at their White House meeting would be “We are your biggest client.”

Trump has threatened to scrap the 1994 pact unless changes are made to address issues such as a $64 billion deficit with Mexico. Negotiators start the fourth of seven planned rounds of talks near Washington on Wednesday.

Freeland describes the U.S. administration as the most protectionist since the 1930s while noting the United States runs a surplus in the trade of goods and services with Canada.

Canada has so far shunned confrontation with Washington, stressing instead the merits of NAFTA and free trade. By no means everyone south of the border is convinced.

Chris Sands, a professor at the Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said Canada’s problems marked “a new era of tough love” with Washington.

“It turns out Trump is an economic nationalist ... and it’s come as a bit of a surprise to the Canadians that they have been so much on the hot seat,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.

Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of hostile statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.

Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organization. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.

“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, said.

“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behavior. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”

Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.

“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.

Iran’s moderate president Hasan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticizing the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.

“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures,” he added.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”

The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.

But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s missile program and over allegations it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.

The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.

The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.

“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.

Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile program. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.

Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile program. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”. In an article published in the Atlantic on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles … unless it intends to attack our territory.”","Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-nuclear-usa-irgc/iran-hardliners-pragmatists-show-unity-in-response-to-trump-idUKKBN1CF0R1

In a blunt and personal attack on outgoing ambassador John Bass, Erdogan suggested Bass acted unilaterally in suspending visa services in Turkey after the arrest of a U.S. consulate worker, and said “agents” had infiltrated U.S. missions.

The dispute has plunged already fragile relations between the two NATO allies to a new low after months of tension linked to the conflict in Syria, last year’s failed military coup in Turkey, and U.S. court cases against Turkish officials.

The U.S. embassy said on Sunday night it was suspending visa services while it assessed Turkey’s commitment to the safety of its missions and its staff, a message reiterated in a video released by Bass late on Monday.

“An ambassador in Ankara taking decisions and saying he is doing so in the name of his government is strange,” Erdogan said. “If our ambassador did this, we wouldn’t keep him there even a minute.”

The embassy said allegations that the arrested employee had links to Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the failed coup against Erdogan last year, were baseless.

But Erdogan said the arrest, and a police request to question a second consulate employee, showed “there is something cooking in the U.S. consulate in Istanbul... How did these agents infiltrate the U.S. consulate?”

He said Bass, who is due to leave the country within days to take up a posting in Afghanistan, had been making farewell visits to government offices.

“But our ministers, parliament speaker and myself did not accept and will not accept his request because we do not see him as a representative of the United States,” Erdogan told a televised news conference during a visit to Belgrade.

“NOT TRIBES”

Turkey’s currency and stock market were both hit on Monday by the dispute. On Tuesday, the main BIST 100 stock index rebounded, rising 1.94 percent by 1320 GMT, and the lira was also up 1 percent at 3.6675 to the dollar.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the visa suspension had punished citizens of both countries, and accused Washington of taking an emotional and inappropriate step against an ally.

“You are making your citizens and ours pay the price,” he said. “We call on the United States to be more reasonable. The issue must of course be resolved as soon as possible,” he said, describing U.S. behavior as “unbecoming” of an ally.

In a speech in Ankara to ruling AK Party parliamentarians, Yildirim also defended Turkey’s decision to retaliate with its own visa suspension after the U.S. embassy announcement.

“Turkey is not a tribal state, we will retaliate against what has been done in kind,” he said.

Relations between the countries have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and Turkey’s so far unsuccessful calls for Gulen’s extradition.

U.S. courts have also indicted a Turkish banker and a former minister for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran, as well as 15 of Erdogan’s security guards for attacking peaceful protesters during his visit to Washington in May.

“Did you ask permission from us when you dragged a general manager from our national bank into jail?” Yildirim said. “Why are you harboring Gulen? Does this fit our alliance or friendship?”

Yildirim said if the United States wanted to continue its alliance with Turkey it should stop support for YPG fighters battling Islamic State in Syria. Turkey says the YPG is an extension of the outlawed PKK which has fought a three-decade insurgency in southeast Turkey.

“Siding with our enemies is not fitting our alliances,” he said.",Turkey's Erdogan blames U.S. envoy for diplomatic crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-security/turkeys-erdogan-blames-u-s-envoy-for-diplomatic-crisis-idUSKBN1CF0XR

The marchers, chanting slogans and brandishing placards, halted traffic as they moved slowly through the streets. A fringe of anarchists broke windows; police responded by firing tear gas. But this was no rerun of the mass marches of past years, let alone the semi-revolutionary eruptions of 1968.

France’s second-largest union, the Conféderation Générale du Travail (CGT) was the only one of the three main workers’ organizations that took part. Another protest, this one organized by the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party is scheduled for Sept. 23. This week’s marching columns numbered, nationwide, in the few hundred thousand rather than the many millions hoped for – the police claimed 223,000, the organizers 400,000. There was little effect on production, services or transport.

It was neither victory nor defeat for either side. Instead, Macron’s changes to the vast labor code – hiring and firing will be easier, some workplace issues will be negotiated at company level – hang in the balance. The CGT, the left and the far-right National Front all oppose them, but Macron and his government have a solid, if inexperienced, majority in the Assembly.

More than his predecessors who tried and failed to liberalize France’s labor market – the center-right Nicolas Sarkozy and the center-left Francois Hollande – Macron has pinned the credibility of his presidency on systemic, cultural change, a deliberate jolting of French society and economy out of the rut into which he believes it has fallen. He is contemptuous of both former presidents (he knew Hollande well, having been both his advisor and Finance Minister), believing them to have given up too soon and too easily. When Macron spoke, as he did earlier this month, of “slackers,” he said when challenged that he meant those who retreated from the necessary surgery on France’s body politic The marchers, however, seized on the word and put it on their placards: “Macron, the slackers will kick you out,” read one.

The slackers have a point. Indeed, they have several. Labor productivity in France is relatively good, only a little behind that of the United States and the highest of Europe’s major economies. When French workers work, they work well.

Though both Macron’s labor and economic reforms have won support from the center-right and from many economists, France remains doubtful, even hostile. Perhaps the best-known Frenchman in political and intellectual circles before Macron was the economist Thomas Piketty, whose “Capital in the 21st Century” (2013) is a best seller and who has excoriated his country both for its steeply rising inequality and its hypocrisy in pretending it is egalitarian. Hypocritical it may be, but it clings to the myth, and perfectly bourgeois Frenchmen and -women may recoil from an obvious widening of the income and wealth gaps.

To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point. Germany liberalized its labor market through the so-called Hartz reforms between 2003 and 2005, but unlike France the German unions were relatively moderate, wage bargaining was already localized and investment was rising. In addition, the costs of German unification had already been paid.

If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy. That is also dependent on other ifs – if the present improvement in the European Union economy continues (the European Commission, while underscoring that all members are growing, warns of “higher-than-usual uncertainty) and if investment increases, then France could become more like Germany. The German (and EU) leader Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to see that, and Macron wishes to show her he can deliver.

Yet delivery of this kind of economy now comes with an apparently unavoidable cost. Faster growth and even a fall in unemployment produces an ever-larger underclass, composed both of those with few qualifications and the still-increasing numbers of immigrants, often from poor countries. Macron’s opponents like to quote the Cambridge University economist Christopher Bickerton, who argued in a New York Times column that “not since the economic boom of the 1950s and ’60s has capitalism in Europe been dynamic enough to combine high levels of employment with long-term material gains for the masses.” It will not do so, he believes, under Macron.

The deeper movement, about which Macron can do little, is that the greater integration into the global economy that he champions produces huge gains for the top one percent, more modest rises for the well educated and skilled, but a much larger tail of the precarious, insecure and low paid. The leftist German think tank, the Rosa Luxemburg Institute, called this trend “the end of social capitalism.” A sign of this is the general decline of social democratic parties such as the once-mighty German Social Democrats and the shrunken French Socialists. Only in the UK has the main left party, Labour, made substantial political gains with a far-left leadership.

Social democracy depended on, and greatly furthered, “social capitalism.” It did so in France, under socialist governments, did so again in Germany and still does, though with difficulty, in the Scandinavian states. Organized labor had a place, even an honored and at times powerful one. Now, its gains are a hindrance, its ideology no longer attractive. The leaders of the further left – such as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Insoumise in France - gain by being fundamentalists, opposed to capitalism itself, social or not.

In moving France towards the globalist model, Macron echoes the claim made nearly four decades ago by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that there is no alternative. In this, he may be more right than she: there is presently no popular base, no public assent, no powerful parties able to show that cooperation with capitalism is best for the workers. And that, sooner or later, will be a large problem – for leftists, or course, for the state which must provide some support for the poor and ultimately, for the capitalist system itself.",Commentary: Labor reform in France’s Macron economy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-macron-commentary/commentary-labor-reform-in-frances-macron-economy-idUSKCN1BQ2DJ

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares ground out a fresh record high on Tuesday, making it almost 50 for the year, although Europe traded cautiously as markets waited to see whether Spain’s Catalonia region would push for independence later in the day.

Japan and South Korea returned from extended breaks to give Asia a lift a Wall Street looked set to open higher, [.N] but the Catalan uncertainty meant the euro zone’s main bourses [.EU] and Spanish bond markets spent the day in the red.

Catalonia’s secessionist leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the region’s parliament in Barcelona around 1600 GMT and could ask the assembly to vote on a unilateral declaration of independence from Madrid.

It is Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and Madrid’s IBEX stocks index was 1 percent lower in early afternoon trade. It is now down almost 9 percent since May, though a sharp rise in the euro has also taken a toll.

“We have not witnessed any relevant statement or signal by the separatists that would hint at a change of strategy ahead of today’s discussion in the Catalonian parliament,” economists at Barclays wrote.

“Consequently, at this point, it seems likely that Catalan President Carles Puigdemont remains on track to announce a unilateral declaration of independence as early as today.”

The euro remained resilient. It hopped to a one-week high of almost $1.18 as data showed German exports surged in August. Traders were also still upbeat after one of the European Central Bank’s German policymakers called for an end to its stimulus.

There was also help from a weaker dollar which was down for a third straight day. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, dropped 0.3 percent to 93.366 and away from Friday’s almost 3-month peak.

It gave the Turkish lira a breather after it had been sent sprawling to a nine-month low on Monday after the United States and Turkey scaled back visa services.

Mexico’s peso hovered at its weakest in more than four months too, ahead of the latest round of talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Wednesday.

“Mexican asset prices have been very well supported this year so we think there needs to be a little bit of caution,” said UBP’s EM macro and FX strategist Koon Chow.

“There is not much of a cushion for bad news now and NAFTA talks are unlikely to bring any good news.”

Bond markets, meanwhile, were waiting to see if 10-year Treasuries would get above 2.4 percent ahead of another Fed rate hike that is now seen as almost nailed on for December.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari and his Dallas counterpart, Robert Kaplan, are due to make speeches later ahead of the minutes from the Fed’s September meeting, which will be published on Wednesday.

Overnight, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had climbed 0.6 percent, boosted by a 1.6 percent jump in Korea as shares of firms such as Samsung which have been closed for the past week, caught up with some of the global rally.

Japan’s Nikkei brushed off a weak start to finish 0.6 percent higher too, though China stocks dipped as investors cashed in some of the gains that took them to a 21-month high in the previous session. [.SS]

China’s Statistics Bureau on Tuesday said the country would have no problem meeting its economic growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, and might even beat it. Such an outcome had been widely expected after a robust start to the year.

The offshore Chinese yuan rate surged to its strongest level in more than two weeks. The central bank had also set a firmer-than-expected official rate, suggesting authorities are keen to keep the currency in check ahead of next week’s key national leadership meeting.

The stocks gains came in spite of tensions on the Korean peninsula. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Monday that any further escalation of the situation was unacceptable.

China had also called for restraint. U.S. President Donald Trump warned over the weekend that “only one thing will work” in dealing with Pyongyang, hinting that military action was on his mind.

In commodities, Brent oil prices pushed back above $56 a barrel after top producer Saudi Arabia signaled it would trim its exports and as OPEC flagged ongoing efforts to try to restore the longer-term “balance” of the market.

Brent jumped 50 cents to $56.31 a barrel, while a 54 cents rise took U.S. crude back to $50 a barrel.

“The kingdom expects all other participants in the (agreement) to follow suit and to maintain the high levels of overall conformity,” a Saudi oil Ministry spokesman said.

(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) on Tuesday unveiled a $20 billion share buyback plan and forecast U.S. online sales to increase by about 40 percent in the fiscal year ending January 2019.

Wal-Mart’s shares were up 1.6 percent at $81.80 in premarket trading after the company also forecast overall net sales to increase by at least 3 percent in the same period.

The company, locked in a battle for market share with ecommerce giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), has been doubling down on its online business and is leveraging its 4,700 plus stores to create a more hassle-free experience for its online shoppers.

Wal-Mart reported a 60 percent jump in online sales in the United States in its latest quarter ended July.

“It is clear that Wal-Mart intends to continue to turn up the heat online, with 40 percent annual growth an impressive goal, especially on the heels of the 30 percent outlined at the 2016 investor meeting, which at the time seemed aspirational in our view,” Moody’s Lead Retail Analyst Charlie O‘Shea said.

The largest U.S. grocery retailer also said it expects to add 1,000 locations for shipping online grocery orders in fiscal year 2019. It currently ships online orders from more than 900 U.S. locations.

Competition in the grocery space has increased since Amazon bought Whole Foods and cut prices at the upmarket grocer in August.

The company forecast profit for fiscal year 2019 to increase about 5 percent over the expected adjusted earnings of $4.30 to $4.40 per share for the year ending January 2018.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Tuesday it had received formal approval to start a C$500 million production unit in Canada and sought to quell talk that it had asked for special tax benefits for investing in its first such unit outside the United States.

The maker of Emmy-winning shows such as The Crown and Black Mirror said last month it was in talks with the Canadian government for an investment over a minimum of five years.

That decision was part of a broad review under Canadian Heritage Minister Melanie Joly, which included plans to modernize funding programs and review copyright, broadcasting and telecommunications legislation.

“Approximately 1,000 men surrendered over the last week. Not all, however, are terrorists,” said the security official in Erbil, the northern Iraqi base of the Kurdistan Regional Government.

They handed themselves in to Peshmerga forces in the Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk, east of Hawija, he said. “It’s fair to say hundreds probably are ISIS (Islamic State) members, but that will be clear after the debriefs,” he said.

The town of Hawija and surrounding areas fell on Oct. 5 in an offensive by U.S.-backed Iraqi government troops and Iranian-trained and armed Shi‘ite paramilitary groups known as Popular Mobilisation.

Islamic State’s last territory in Iraq is now a stretch along the western border with Syria, including the border town of al-Qaim.

The militants also hold areas on the Syrian side of the border, but they are retreating there in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.

Separately on Tuesday, Britain’s budget forecasters gave a gloomier medium-term outlook for the economy, potentially leaving finance minister Philip Hammond with less room to offset any big hit from Britain’s departure from the European Union.

The somewhat downbeat picture for the world’s fifth-biggest economy from a raft of data - including a record goods trade deficit - contrasted with the situation in some of Britain’s closest trading partners in the European Union.

German exports outpaced imports in August, adding to signs it performed strongly in the third quarter, and Italian industrial output was much stronger than expected.

But there were some signs of encouragement for Britain.

The country’s factories had their strongest two months of 2017 in July and August, and the construction sector grew for the first time in three months.

In year-on-year terms, factory output was 2.8 percent higher, its fastest growth in six months.

Revisions to past data showed Britain’s economy had been a bit less weak earlier this year than previously thought.

“They’re not storming figures but I think they’re good enough to keep the Bank of England on track for a November rate hike,” said Victoria Clarke, an economist with Investec.

Britain’s economy has slowed sharply this year as consumers felt the pinch from rising inflation, caused largely by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote, and by weak wage growth.

BOE ANNOUNCEMENT

Nonetheless, the BoE said last month that most of its policymakers thought it was likely that they would need to raise rates for the first time in a decade in the coming months.

The BoE believes last year’s Brexit vote will create more inflation pressure by dampening business investment and slowing migration to Britain.

Sterling rose after Tuesday’s official data and British government bond prices edged down. [GBP/]

Figures for the much bigger services sector are due to be released on Oct. 25, along with a preliminary first estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product growth, little more than a week before the BoE’s Nov. 2 announcement.

Many economists say only a shock weakening in those figures is likely to cause the BoE to delay raising rates.

In a reminder of the long-standing problems that have held back Britain’s economy, Tuesday’s data showed the country’s deficit in its trade in goods hit an all-time high in cash terms.

That was despite the slump in the value of the pound which some supporters of Brexit have predicted will deliver an export boom. Export volumes in the three months to August were 3.2 percent lower than the previous three months, though they are 8.9 percent higher than a year before.

And there was bad news regarding the Achilles heel of the British economy - the long-standing weak record of its companies and workers to squeeze more output from their work.

Britain’s official budget watchdog said it expected to “significantly” downgrade its forecasts for productivity growth in the next five years.

Finance minister Hammond is due to present an annual budget on Nov. 22. Although he is under pressure to increase public spending and eliminate a pay cap on public sector pay, any cut in productivity forecasts would substantially limit his room for maneuver by reducing future tax revenues.","UK stuck in slow growth gear, BoE on course to raise rates",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/uk-stuck-in-slow-growth-gear-boe-on-course-to-raise-rates-idINKBN1CF1F1?il=0

Two people died in Napa County and one in Mendocino County, officials said. An 11th death was reported in Yuba County, NBC News reported.

Some 20,000 people had been evacuated from their homes since Sunday, officials said, while CNN said more than 100 had been treated for fire-related injuries, including burns and smoke inhalation.

The 15 fires broke out during the weekend and were fanned by high temperatures and dry conditions. They spread across some 73,000 acres (29,542 hectares), fire officials said.

The largest fire, covering 42 square miles (109 square km) and 39 square miles (101 square km) respectively, struck in Napa and Sonoma counties. The status of the grape crop currently being harvested there was unclear.

In addition to potential damage to vineyards from fire itself, experts say sustained exposure to heavy smoke can taint unpicked grapes.

Fred Oliai, 47, owner of the Alta Napa Valley Winery, said winemakers were nervous.

“You can’t see anything,” he said in a telephone interview. “The smoke is very dense.” Oliai had not been able to get close enough to his vineyards to see if flames reached his 90-acre property. “We got our grapes in last week but others still have grapes hanging,” he said.

California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency Napa, Sonoma and five other counties.

That included Orange County in Southern California, where a wildfire on Monday destroyed at least a half dozen homes in the affluent Anaheim Hills neighborhood, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents, authorities said.",Fire crews battle California wildfires as death toll creeps up,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-fire/fire-crews-battle-as-deadly-california-wildfires-rage-on-idUSKBN1CE1JI

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany may need to wait until next year for a new government as the three blocs trying to form an alliance are so far apart they need a detailed coalition deal, a senior Bavarian ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel has told Reuters.

Alexander Dobrindt, parliamentary floor leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), said a coalition agreement would have to be more detailed than the one that accompanied the Grand Coalition in the last parliament.

Merkel, humbled in last month’s national election by a surging far-right, is trying to broker a three-way coalition of her conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens - a combination previously untested at federal level.

The task is further complicated by the fact that Merkel’s conservative bloc compromises her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and CSU, whose alliance has been strained by her open-door migrants policy.

The conservative allies removed one obstacle to forming a new coalition on Sunday by agreeing a limit on the number of migrants arriving in Germany. But Dobrindt of the CSU said in an interview with Reuters television that securing a three-way alliance would be hard.

“As we know that the points that separate us outweigh those we have in common, one can have doubts about whether a coalition agreement is possible this year,” Dobrindt said.

“It is conceivable that we can’t complete in December and that final talks - if there even are any - will only possible next year,” he added.

The three-way tie-up - dubbed a “Jamaica” coalition after the black, green and yellow colors of the three party blocs, which match the Caribbean island’s flag - is Merkel’s only realistic option of forming a government.

The center-left Social Democrats, her previous partners in a the Grand Coalition, insist they want to go into opposition.

A Jamaica coalition was formed in the tiny western state of Saarland in October 2009, but collapsed in January 2012. The same formation took power in the far northern region of Schleswig-Holstein after elections there in May this year.

BIG DIFFERENCES

At a national level, the three party groups have deep differences on issues ranging from migration to European Union reform, tax and the environment. Dobrindt said this meant they would have to nail down a detailed agreement.

Slideshow (4 Images)

“We need, in a possible Jamaica coalition agreement, a significantly higher level of detail than was the case with the grand coalition,” he said. “The differences between the parties are big, so the agreements need to go deeper.”

In their compromise struck on Sunday, the CDU and CSU agreed to limit to 200,000 the number of people Germany would accept per year on humanitarian grounds.

The FDP and Greens insist the conservatives’ agreement cannot simply be copied into a coalition deal.

But Dobrindt, whose CSU is worried about losing its regional dominance in a Bavarian state election next year, said the allies’ accord must be reflected in a coalition deal.

“The regulations we have made in our joint paper - ‘Rules on Migration’ - are of course an essential part of the negotiations and must also be found in a coalition agreement,” he said.

The intransigence of the CSU, the Greens and the FDP on the migrants issue points to difficult coalition talks that risk clouding the political outlook in Germany, which has been a source of stability in Europe during Merkel’s 12 years in power.

“We want Europe to concentrate more on the big tasks and less on the small tasks,” Dobrindt said. “That means we must talk about bringing back responsibilities from Brussels to Germany - and the details of that will no doubt be difficult.”",Germany may not agree new coalition until next year: Merkel ally,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CF1PL

Sally Ann Johnson, 41, for more than seven years provided what she described as healing services to a resident of the island of Martha’s Vineyard, who was more than 70 years old when she first met the spiritual healer, according to court papers.

Johnson, who ran businesses including Psychic Match Inc and Flatiron Psychic, admitted in Boston federal court that she tried to impede the administration of tax laws.

Johnson, who told the court she never passed the second grade, called herself a Romani “spiritual consultant.” She said in court she had not paid taxes in connection with the money she received as income as well as a gift.

“I honestly did not do the right thing,” she said.

Johnson, who has resided in New York, Florida, Illinois and at times Massachusetts, faces up to three years in prison.

She is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 17. Her lawyers declined to comment.

Berlin (Reuters) - Bundesverkehrsminister Alexander Dobrindt rechnet mit einer baldigen Entscheidung über die Zukunft von Air Berlin.

“Wir gehen davon aus, dass in dieser oder in nächster Woche die Gespräche abgeschlossen werden”, sagte er am Dienstag der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters. Die insolvente Fluggesellschaft verhandelt noch bis Donnerstag exklusiv mit Lufthansa und dem britischen Billigflieger Easyjet über den Verkauf von Teilen des Konzerns. “Es ist durchaus eine gute Chance, dass der Geschäftsbetrieb unter neuen Eigentümern zukünftig auch zum Großteil weiter bedient wird”, sagte Dobrindt.

Air Berlin hatte am Montag angekündigt, dass der Flugverkehr in eigener Regie mit dem Airline-Code AB spätestens zum 28. Oktober eingestellt werde. Denn nach Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens muss der Konzern Geld sparen. Air-Berlin-Chef Thomas Winkelmann und der Generalbevollmächtigte Frank Kebekus schrieben in einem Mitarbeiter-Brief, nach Abschluss der Kaufverträge müsse Air Berlin “die eigene Geschäftstätigkeit Zug um Zug beenden”. Zuletzt gab es jedoch Medienberichte, dass die Verhandlungen mit Easyjet über den Kauf von 27 bis 30 Flugzeugen scheitern könnten. Zudem hätten die Briten ihr ursprüngliches Angebot von rund 50 Millionen Euro gesenkt. Ein Insider betonte: “Easyjet pokert, das ist doch ganz normal.”

Dobrindt sagte zu den Gesprächen: “Ich weiß, dass über die Teile, über die verhandelt wird, zur Zeit mit mehreren Partnern gesprochen wird.” Zuvor hatte Reuters von dem Insider erfahren, dass es auch Gespräche mit der Thomas Cook-Tochter Condor gebe.

Unterdessen kommt die Auffanglösung für viele der 8000 Air-Berlin-Beschäftigten, die wohl ihren Job verlieren, kaum voran. Denn die nötige Transfergesellschaft braucht Geld, das die insolvente Firma nicht zahlen kann. “Auch die Berliner Politik findet die Idee ganz klasse, aber sie wollen nicht die einzigen sein, die finanzieren”, sagte ein Sprecher der Gewerkschaft Verdi zu Reuters TV. Hier seien auch Lufthansa und Easyjet gefragt. “Es kann nicht sein, dass die sich ein großes Stück vom Kuchen abschneiden, aber nicht die Verantwortung für die Beschäftigten übernehmen.”

The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc (FB.O), but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of the confidential investigation by Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

The revelation about Google is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.

Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.

The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European residents, according to lawmakers and researchers.

Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.

Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.

Russia’s ad purchases on Google were first reported by the Washington Post.

FILE PHOTO - The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Picture

Google did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.

“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.

‘DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY’

Google, which runs the world’s largest online advertising business, had largely evaded public or congressional scrutiny until now. On Sunday, the Daily Beast news website reported that the Kremlin recruited at least two black video bloggers to post clips on YouTube during the campaign. They posed as Black Lives Matter sympathizers who were sharply critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Though the videos were only viewed hundreds of times, they demonstrated for the first time that Russia allegedly deployed real people, not just fake online accounts or bots, to further spread propaganda.

Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into Russian interference, but concern about Silicon Valley’s role has surged over the past month against the backdrop of a cascade of revelations about how Russia appears to have leveraged their platforms to spread propaganda.

A study published on Monday by researchers with the Oxford Internet Institute, which is affiliated with the British university, found that current U.S. military personnel and veterans were targeted by disinformation campaigns on Twitter and Facebook over the past year by a nexus of pro-Kremlin, Russian-oriented sites, along with conspiracy theorists and European right-wing ideologues.

Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election. Some Democrats plan to introduce legislation to require internet companies to disclose more information about political ad purchases on their platforms.

“If Vladimir Putin is using Facebook or Google or Twitter to, in effect, destroy our democracy, the American people should know about it,” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Monday on MSNBC.

Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers discussed on Monday the role of their bailout fund in euro zone integration, with support for the fund to stay owned by governments, play a role in crisis prevention and become a backstop for a bank resolution fund.

The ministers are the governors of the fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which was created at the height of the sovereign debt crisis as a lender of last resort to governments. It has a lending capacity of 500 billion euros ($587.68 billion).

“Everyone agreed that the ESM has a very strong role to play not only the crisis management but also in the prevention of future crises,” the chairman of the talks Jeroen Dijsselbloem told a news conference.

A crisis prevention role for the ESM, an intergovernmental institution, could lead to a clash with the European Commission, which under European Union law now has the sole power to monitor government policies and issue recommendations.

But a German paper prepared for the meeting said that fiscal responsibilities and fiscal control belonged together and called for a bigger role for the ESM in ensuring EU budget rules, the Stability and Growth Pact, are observed.

Related Coverage Eurogroup says will miss strict German finance minister

The rules have become too complex and less predictable now, the paper argued and proposed also introducing a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism, to be managed by the ESM, as a way to bring back more discipline to government policy-making.

“The ESM could gradually be given a stronger, neutral role with regard to the monitoring of the Stability and Growth Pact,” it said, adding this could be done by amending intergovernmental treaties such as the Fiscal Compact and the ESM treaty.

While no decisions were taken on Monday, Dijsselbloem said that the ministers broadly supported using the ESM as a backstop for the EU’s Single Resolution Fund (SRF) for banks.

The SRF was created for the resolution of failing euro zone banks and is financed from annual bank contributions. It has so far accumulated 17 billion euros and is due to reach full capacity of around 55 billion euros in 2023.

Should it find before then that it needs more money than it has received from banks, it will need a backstop - and ministers are likely to agree the ESM should play that role.

Some officials would like to see the ESM provide a similar underpinning for the yet-to-be-created European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), which will insure deposits in all euro zone countries up to 100,000 euros if opposition from Germany can be overcome.

In the paper for the meeting, Berlin again rejected it, saying it “would put much too great a strain on the ESM and go against its core purpose of bailing-out countries in severe trouble”.

Germany would like to see the ESM turned into a European Monetary Fund, a move that would eliminate the need to involve the International Monetary Fund or the European Central Bank in future euro zone crises like the one that was triggered by Greece and engulfed also Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus.

The talks in Luxembourg are part of a broader discussion among finance ministers from the 19 euro zone countries on how to better organize the single currency area and integrate it more deeply after Britain leaves the European Union in 2019.

Apart from transforming the ESM, there are ideas to set up a euro zone budget, appoint a euro zone finance minister and create a euro zone subgroup in the European Parliament.","Euro zone debates bailout fund future, sees backstop, crisis prevention role",https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-eurogroup/euro-zone-debates-bailout-fund-future-sees-backstop-crisis-prevention-role-idINKBN1CE1QX

The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc (FB.O), but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of the confidential investigation by Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said separately on Monday that it was looking at whether Russians bought U.S. election ads on its Bing search engine or other Microsoft-owned products and platforms. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment further.

The revelation about Google is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.

Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.

The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European residents, according to lawmakers and researchers.

Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.

Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.

Russia’s ad purchases on Google were first reported by the Washington Post.

Google did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.

“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.

‘DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY’

Google, which runs the world’s largest online advertising business, had largely evaded public or congressional scrutiny until now. On Sunday, the Daily Beast news website reported that the Kremlin recruited at least two black video bloggers to post clips on YouTube during the campaign. They posed as Black Lives Matter sympathizers who were sharply critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Though the videos were only viewed hundreds of times, they demonstrated for the first time that Russia allegedly deployed real people, not just fake online accounts or bots, to further spread propaganda.

Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into Russian interference, but concern about Silicon Valley’s role has surged over the past month against the backdrop of a cascade of revelations about how Russia appears to have leveraged their platforms to spread propaganda.

A study published on Monday by researchers with the Oxford Internet Institute, which is affiliated with the British university, found that current U.S. military personnel and veterans were targeted by disinformation campaigns on Twitter and Facebook over the past year by a nexus of pro-Kremlin, Russian-oriented sites, along with conspiracy theorists and European right-wing ideologues.

Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election. Some Democrats plan to introduce legislation to require internet companies to disclose more information about political ad purchases on their platforms.

“If Vladimir Putin is using Facebook or Google or Twitter to, in effect, destroy our democracy, the American people should know about it,” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Monday on MSNBC.

Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter. While Facebook and Twitter have confirmed plans to attend, Google has not.","Google uncovered Russia-backed ads on YouTube, Gmail : source",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CE192-OCATC

LONDON (Reuters) - For years the options market that companies and investors use to hedge against big swings in currencies viewed the euro as a bigger political and structural risk than Britain’s pound.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

A growing technology company would move fewer jobs overseas. And a regional bank would boost its spending on cybersecurity.

These are some of the uses of the tax savings that small and medium-sized U.S. companies say they would pursue if the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress slashed corporate taxes as promised.

Small companies pay the highest taxes and they would be the main beneficiaries of such a Trump windfall. Reuters contacted the 100 largest companies by market value in the benchmark Russell 2000 index of U.S. small and mid-cap stocks as well as another 50 in the Russell 2000 with no analyst coverage. None of the 17 companies that responded to Reuters queries mentioned boosting their headcount.

The administration has said the tax cuts would largely pay for themselves by spurring more investment and creating jobs.

But companies say they look to spend on technology that will allow them to improve productivity or make acquisitions rather than hire more workers.

“We want to be a company of the future, and technology is one of the key ingredients,” said Keith Cargill, chief executive at Dallas-based Texas Capital Bankshares Inc (TCBI.O), a bank with a market value of $4.2 billion. The tax cut would be a “huge plus” for earnings, Cargill said, but with little impact on the bank’s workforce.

The Russell 2000 companies tend to pay the highest effective tax rates now - an average of 31.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data - and would stand to gain the most if corporate taxes are cut to 20 percent from 35 percent as the Trump administration has proposed.

For large companies in the S&P 500, the average effective tax rate is 28 percent, a reflection of a greater share of overseas business and more leeway in reducing their tax rates.

While few companies would discuss any details in public before outlining them to their shareholders, executives, chief financial officers and treasures say they are already starting to formulate plans for a tax windfall even if they are not certain whether and in what form it will pass.

Neil Hennessy, the chief executive of Novato, California-based Hennessy Advisors Inc (HNNA.O), a mutual fund company, told Reuters he was in “acquisition mode” and would keep looking for targets in the event of a tax cut passing.

STRIP CLUBS AND SHARE BUYBACKS

One of the first firms to publicly discuss a potential tax windfall is RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc (RICK.O), a chain of 40 strip clubs headquartered in Houston, Texas. Its chief executive Eric Scott Langan told analysts on Aug. 9 that a tax cut would allow him to buy more clubs and boost the share price, which he complained failed to reflect the firm’s organic growth.

""I think that's going to change and I think that's when you're going to see the multiple expansion come into play,"" he said during an earnings call.

The tax cut would also affect companies which do not pay taxes now either because they are not yet profitable or are using past losses to offset their tax bills.

Paul Auvil, the chief financial officer at cybersecurity company Proofpoint Inc (PFPT.O), said that the $4 billion market-cap company expects to start paying taxes in 2021 when it no longer be able to offset past losses.

By then the corporate tax rate would need to sink at least below 27 percent, Auvil told Reuters. Otherwise Proofpoint would move its intellectual property to an offshore company in Europe, where corporate taxes are lower, which would mean hiring up to 100 back office staff there, said.

“These are jobs that have every reason to be in the U.S. but it will require tax reform.”

The prospects of a tax cut have helped push the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM.P) up about 10 percent over the last six weeks, compared with a 3.7 percent gain in the fund which tracks S&P 500 .SPX.

If the tax package does pass, large companies will be more likely to buy back their own stock, while smaller firms will probably reinvest in their businesses, said Tom Forte, an analyst at New York based D.A. Davidson.

“These companies are going to take every incremental cost savings from a tax cut and invest it to keep up with the Amazons (AMZN.O) and Ubers,” Forte said.

For instance, Forte expects EBay Inc (EBAY.O) to spend most of the possible windfall on increasing its stock buyback program. A smaller company like Yelp Inc (YELP.N) would probably invest in artificial intelligence technology to better harness its website’s advertising potential, he said.

GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N), meanwhile, would spend more on its service that delivers from restaurants that do not have their own delivery staff, Forte said, while Groupon Inc (GRPN.O) would invest more in marketing and advertising.

Some smaller companies are also considering share buybacks rather any significant changes to their capital allocation.

Thomas Castellano, treasurer at drug delivery company Catalent Inc (CTLT.N), told Reuters that the $5.2 billion company would keep spending on maintaining its 35 locations around the globe and look for possible acquisitions. Any extra money would go to share buybacks and Catalent was unlikely to increase its hiring rate if a tax cut passes, Castellano said.

In a blunt and personal attack on outgoing ambassador John Bass, Erdogan suggested Bass acted unilaterally in suspending visa services in Turkey after the arrest of a U.S. consulate worker, and said “agents” had infiltrated U.S. missions.

The dispute has plunged already fragile relations between the two NATO allies to a new low after months of tension linked to the conflict in Syria, last year’s failed military coup in Turkey, and U.S. court cases against Turkish officials.

The U.S. embassy said on Sunday night it was suspending visa services while it assessed Turkey’s commitment to the safety of its missions and its staff, a message reiterated in a video released by Bass late on Monday.

“An ambassador in Ankara taking decisions and saying he is doing so in the name of his government is strange,” Erdogan said. “If our ambassador did this, we wouldn’t keep him there even a minute.”

The embassy said allegations that the arrested employee had links to Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the failed coup against Erdogan last year, were baseless.

But Erdogan said the arrest, and a police request to question a second consulate employee, showed “there is something cooking in the U.S. consulate in Istanbul... How did these agents infiltrate the U.S. consulate?”

He said Bass, who is due to leave the country within days to take up a posting in Afghanistan, had been making farewell visits to government offices.

“But our ministers, parliament speaker and myself did not accept and will not accept his request because we do not see him as a representative of the United States,” Erdogan told a televised news conference during a visit to Belgrade.

“NOT TRIBES”

Turkey’s currency and stock market were both hit on Monday by the dispute. On Tuesday, the main BIST 100 stock index rebounded, rising 1.94 percent by 1320 GMT, and the lira was also up 1 percent at 3.6675 to the dollar.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the visa suspension had punished citizens of both countries, and accused Washington of taking an emotional and inappropriate step against an ally.

“You are making your citizens and ours pay the price,” he said. “We call on the United States to be more reasonable. The issue must of course be resolved as soon as possible,” he said, describing U.S. behavior as “unbecoming” of an ally.

In a speech in Ankara to ruling AK Party parliamentarians, Yildirim also defended Turkey’s decision to retaliate with its own visa suspension after the U.S. embassy announcement.

“Turkey is not a tribal state, we will retaliate against what has been done in kind,” he said.

Relations between the countries have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and Turkey’s so far unsuccessful calls for Gulen’s extradition.

U.S. courts have also indicted a Turkish banker and a former minister for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran, as well as 15 of Erdogan’s security guards for attacking peaceful protesters during his visit to Washington in May.

“Did you ask permission from us when you dragged a general manager from our national bank into jail?” Yildirim said. “Why are you harboring Gulen? Does this fit our alliance or friendship?”

Yildirim said if the United States wanted to continue its alliance with Turkey it should stop support for YPG fighters battling Islamic State in Syria. Turkey says the YPG is an extension of the outlawed PKK which has fought a three-decade insurgency in southeast Turkey.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will block access to websites of exchanges that offer crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Russian Central Bank First Deputy Governor Sergei Shvetsov said on Tuesday.

He called them “dubious”.

Russian financial authorities initially treated any sort of money issued by non-state approved institutions as illegal, saying they could be used to launder money.

Later the authorities accepted the globally booming market of crypto-currencies but want to either control the turnover or to limit access to the market

“We cannot stand apart. We cannot give direct and easy access to such dubious instruments for retail (investors),” Shvetsov said, referring to households.

Speaking at a conference on financial market derivatives, Shvetsov said the central bank sees rising interest in crypto-currencies because of high returns from buying into such instruments.

He warned, however, that crypto-currencies gradually transform into high-yielding assets from being a mean of payment.

Bitcoin, the most well-known virtual currency that emerged in mid-2010, last traded at around $4,807, up from its initial price of less than $1.

“We think that for our citizens, for businesses the usage of such crypto-currencies as an investment object carries unreasonably high risks,” he said.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council.
What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did.","President Donald Trump’s opening speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday is drawing widespread criticism for his aggressive statements about North Korea and Iran, but it is just as significant for what he didn’t mention at all.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his ""America first"" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.","Commentary: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karas-trump-commentary/commentary-at-the-un-trumps-silences-spoke-volumes-idUSKCN1BW2AC

A perspectiva de crescimento nos Estados Unidos ficou inalterada em relação ao relatório de julho em 2,2 por cento neste ano e 2,3 por cento em 2018, já que os cortes nos impostos pela administração do presidente Donald Trump ainda não se materializaram.

O crescimento econômico na zona do euro foi revisado para cima ante a previsão de julho para 2,1 por cento em 2017 e 1,9 por cento em 2018, refletindo uma alta das exportações, uma demanda doméstica mais forte devido a condições financeiras expansionistas e uma redução do risco político.

Separately on Tuesday, Britain’s budget forecasters gave a gloomier medium-term outlook for the economy, potentially leaving finance minister Philip Hammond with less room to offset any big hit from Britain’s departure from the European Union.

The somewhat downbeat picture for the world’s fifth-biggest economy from a raft of data - including a record goods trade deficit - contrasted with the situation in some of Britain’s closest trading partners in the European Union.

German exports outpaced imports in August, adding to signs it performed strongly in the third quarter, and Italian industrial output was much stronger than expected.

But there were some signs of encouragement for Britain.

The country’s factories had their strongest two months of 2017 in July and August, and the construction sector grew for the first time in three months.

In year-on-year terms, factory output was 2.8 percent higher, its fastest growth in six months.

Revisions to past data showed Britain’s economy had been a bit less weak earlier this year than previously thought.

“They’re not storming figures but I think they’re good enough to keep the Bank of England on track for a November rate hike,” said Victoria Clarke, an economist with Investec.

Britain’s economy has slowed sharply this year as consumers felt the pinch from rising inflation, caused largely by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote, and by weak wage growth.

BOE ANNOUNCEMENT

Nonetheless, the BoE said last month that most of its policymakers thought it was likely that they would need to raise rates for the first time in a decade in the coming months.

The BoE believes last year’s Brexit vote will create more inflation pressure by dampening business investment and slowing migration to Britain.

Sterling rose after Tuesday’s official data and British government bond prices edged down. [GBP/]

Figures for the much bigger services sector are due to be released on Oct. 25, along with a preliminary first estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product growth, little more than a week before the BoE’s Nov. 2 announcement.

Many economists say only a shock weakening in those figures is likely to cause the BoE to delay raising rates.

In a reminder of the long-standing problems that have held back Britain’s economy, Tuesday’s data showed the country’s deficit in its trade in goods hit an all-time high in cash terms.

That was despite the slump in the value of the pound which some supporters of Brexit have predicted will deliver an export boom. Export volumes in the three months to August were 3.2 percent lower than the previous three months, though they are 8.9 percent higher than a year before.

And there was bad news regarding the Achilles heel of the British economy - the long-standing weak record of its companies and workers to squeeze more output from their work.

Britain’s official budget watchdog said it expected to “significantly” downgrade its forecasts for productivity growth in the next five years.

Finance minister Hammond is due to present an annual budget on Nov. 22. Although he is under pressure to increase public spending and eliminate a pay cap on public sector pay, any cut in productivity forecasts would substantially limit his room for maneuver by reducing future tax revenues.","UK stuck in slow growth gear, BoE on course to raise rates",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy/uk-stuck-in-slow-growth-gear-boe-on-course-to-raise-rates-idUKKBN1CF0TY

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Yuriko Koike says she went into politics to be a player, not a bystander.

Now Tokyo’s first female governor is shaking things up as her new “Party of Hope” challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 poll, called by the Japanese leader to seek a fresh mandate after nearly five years in office.

When the Berlin Wall dividing East and West Germany was breached in 1989, Koike was a 37-year-old TV announcer. Three years later, she ran for parliament.

“The world was changing immensely, so I went from news presenter to newsmaker. I decided Japanese politics was moving too slowly and rather than be an outside critic, I should become ... a player on the inside,” Koike told Reuters in an interview.

Koike, who defied Abe’s party last year to run for governor, isn’t seeking a seat in parliament’s lower house herself, but is the driving force – and public face – of her upstart party.

In many ways, Koike is a paradox, interviews with people who know her and a review of her career show.

She’s a global thinker with a nationalist tinge; an entrepreneurial outsider who climbed the ladder with help from old-boy mentors, and a risk taker who has balked at perhaps her biggest gamble by declining to run in the national election now.

Koike has made no secret of her ambition to be Japan’s first woman prime minister – her pet female terrier is nicknamed “So-chan” – a diminutive for “sori” or “premier” in Japanese.

She has already cracked a few glass ceilings.

She became the country’s first female defense minister in 2007, although stepped down after 55 days after a tussle with a top bureaucrat. She was also the first woman to run for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s top leadership post in 2008, but came in a distant third.

Koike comes from a business family in western Japan, a background that sets her apart from many Japanese politicians, including Abe, who are scions of blue-blood political dynasties.

Her origins may account for a style that admirers say has more in common with venture capitalists than staid lawmakers.

“She’s not afraid to take initiatives, which in most of Japan is deeply frowned upon,” said a person who has known her for 25 years and advises on financial reforms. “In Japan, it’s subtlety within riddles, but she’s blunt.”

Koike has a talent for political marketing - critics call it populism - a skill she is using as she tries to differentiate her conservative party from Abe’s equally conservative LDP with promises to “break the fetters” of vested interest politics.

She calls her party’s economic policies “Yurinomics” in contrast to Abe’s “Abenomics, and its platform includes “12 Zeroes” it wants to achieve, including “zero hayfever”, and “zero euthanasia of unwanted pets”.

“DARK SIDE”

A graduate of Cairo University in 1976 who speaks Arabic and English, Koike in some ways has a global perspective and often sings the praises of diversity.

Like Abe, she advocates opening Japan to more highly skilled foreign workers. Also like Abe, she has visited Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism, but told Reuters she would not do so if she became premier.

Koike also espouses some causes dear to Japan’s rightwing, including revising the post-war, pacifist constitution.

In the past, she has even suggested Japan should consider acquiring nuclear weapons, breaking a taboo in the only country to suffer a nuclear attack. She also opposes local voting rights for foreign residents, many of whom are of Korean descent.

“There is a dark side that doesn’t jibe with a more open-minded, dare we say, liberal view,” said her long-time acquaintance.

Koike migrated through several parties before joining the LDP in 2002, only to abandon it after becoming governor.

She counts among her mentors Ichiro Ozawa, a one-time LDP heavyweight who helped engineer the long-ruling party’s ouster in 1993 and again in 2009, as well as popular ex-premier Junichiro Koizumi.

Critics say her career reflects an opportunist streak, while allies call it practical.

”She wants to make change, but she’s also pragmatic – she can make a deal with anyone – Communists or Abe or traditional stakeholders,” said another adviser. “It’s a kind of talent.”

Despite speculation that she would abandon her job as governor to return to parliament, Koike stuck to her decision not to run. Analysts say that’s likely because her party has little chance of defeating Abe’s ruling bloc, but may do well enough for her to take the leap in the next poll.

But those who know Koike say her desire for the nation’s top post remains. “Is she Machiavellian and strategic? The answer is yes. Is she prepared to think for the long run? The answer is yes,” said her long-time acquaintance.

“Is her over-riding ambition to be Japan’s first female prime minister? That is definitely a goal.”",Japan's Koike: a political paradox shakes things up ahead of poll,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-election-koike/japans-koike-a-political-paradox-shakes-things-up-ahead-of-poll-idUSKBN1CF1PR?il=0

PARIS (Reuters) - Les piscines d‘entreposage de combustible nucléaire usé des centrales françaises et belges sont très mal protégées face aux risques d‘actes malveillants et d‘attaques terroristes, selon les conclusions d‘un rapport d‘experts publiées mardi par Greenpeace.

Selon ce rapport commandé par l‘organisation non gouvernementale, les piscines des centrales - pouvant chacune contenir plusieurs centaines de tonnes de combustible usé - sont particulièrement exposées aux risques d‘attaques par avion et par hélicoptère et ne résisteraient pas à des tirs d‘armes antichar.

Des attaques de ce type pourraient donc provoquer “une catastrophe nucléaire majeure” mettant les populations en danger dans des rayons allant jusqu‘à 250 km autour des centrales, estime Greenpeace, qui épingle la conception même des piscines d‘entreposage - aux murs insuffisamment épais selon l‘ONG -, utilisées pour refroidir des matières hautement radioactives.

L‘ONG demande en conséquence à EDF de réaliser des travaux nécessaires pour “bunkériser” ces installations, pour un coût estimé à environ un milliard d‘euros par piscine selon Yves Marignac, directeur de l‘agence d‘étude et de conseil WISE-Paris et coauteur du rapport.

La France compte 63 piscines de combustible, une sur chacun de ses 58 réacteurs en service, une dans l‘ex-site de Creys-Malville et quatre à La Hague (Manche) sur un site exploité par Areva et considéré comme particulièrement fragile par les experts diligentés par Greenpeace.

“EDF travaille en coopération étroite avec l‘Etat français pour assurer en permanence la protection des centrales nucléaires”, a déclaré une porte-parole de l‘électricien public, ajoutant que la conception des piscines de combustibles intégrait les risques des séismes et d‘inondations mais aussi d‘attaques terroristes.

Areva a déclaré que le risque terroriste était pris en compte par le groupe et les autorités depuis les attentats du 11 septembre 2001 aux Etats-Unis, avec des procédures renforcées dans le cadre du plan Vigipirate actuellement en vigueur.

“La Hague est un site extrêmement sécurisé”, a dit Areva, en citant notamment sa couverture radar permanente en liaison avec l’armée de l’air et son interdiction de survol à moins de 2.000 mètres d‘altitude et dans un rayon de trois kilomètres.

Quant aux piscines de La Hague, a ajouté Areva, elles sont dans une zone protégée par plusieurs barrières et inaccessible avec des véhicules, avec “de nombreux bâtiments qui assurent une protection contre l’impact d’un avion gros porteur”.

Engie, qui exploite le parc nucléaire belge, n‘a pas fait de commentaire dans l‘immédiat.

Sébastien Lecornu, secrétaire d‘État auprès du ministre de la Transition écologique et solidaire, a de son côté déclaré sur RTL que le gouvernement allait “examiner” le rapport de Greenpeace, qui lui a été remis mardi.

“La France a les mécanismes les plus robustes et les plus performants au monde en matière de sécurité et de sûreté”, a-t-il dit.

The maker of Emmy-winning shows such as The Crown and Black Mirror said last month it was in talks with the Canadian government for an investment over a minimum of five years.

That decision was part of a broad review under Canadian Heritage Minister Melanie Joly, which included plans to modernize funding programs and review copyright, broadcasting and telecommunications legislation.

Rohingya Muslims are still fleeing, more than six weeks after Rohingya insurgents attacked security forces in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state.

The United Nations has denounced a ferocious military crackdown in response to the attacks as ethnic cleansing aimed at driving out Rohingya.

A new surge of refugees has entered Bangladesh in recent days, including about 11,000 on Monday. Some have told of increasing hunger in Rakhine as well as of more mob attacks on Muslim villagers.

Despite growing international condemnation of the refugee crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged in recent years.

The party of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi took the first step toward trying to ease animosity with inter-faith prayers at a stadium in the biggest city of Yangon, with Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Christians and others.

Thousands of people packed the stands of the stadium, with Buddhist monks, Hindus, Christian nuns and Muslim men with beards and caps listening to religious leaders who took turns to appeal for friendship.

”Be free from killing one another, be free from torturing one another, be free from destroying or demolishing one another,” the chief Buddhist monk of Yangon, Iddhibala, told the crowd.

Stepping off the podium, he shook hands with Muslim leader Hafiz Mufti Ali.

”Citizens should collaborate in friendship and work for the country,“ Ali said, adding: ”Freedom of life, freedom of education, freedom of religion, it is absolutely necessary for the country to fulfill all these rights.”

The Rohingya had pinned hopes for change on Suu Kyi’s party but it has been wary of Buddhist nationalist pressure. Her party did not field a single Muslim candidate in the 2015 election that it swept.

Rohingya are not classified as an indigenous minority in Myanmar and so are denied citizenship under a law that links nationality to ethnicity.

Regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, they face restrictions and discrimination and are derided by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists in Rakhine, and by much of the wider population.

The militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) who launched the Aug. 25 attacks that triggered the latest spasm of violence are demanding full citizenship rights and recognition as an indigenous community.

CEASEFIRE ENDS

A one-month ceasefire the insurgents called in September in order, they said, to ease aid deliveries to Rakhine, expired at midnight on Monday, but authorities said there was no sign of any new attacks.

The government rebuffed the ceasefire, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing. It says more than 500 people have been killed in the violence since late August, most of them ARSA “terrorists”.

Even before the government offensive, the small, lightly armed ARSA appeared only capable of hit-and-run raids and unable to mount any sort of sustained challenge to the army.

The insurgents said on Saturday they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government, even though their ceasefire was ending.

Reports of food shortages in Rakhine will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

Villagers said food was running out because rice crops were not ready for harvest and authorities had shut village markets and limited food transport, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

The government has cited worry about food as a main reason people have cited for leaving, but a senior state government official dismissed any suggestion of starvation.

Among those fleeing were more than 30 people on a boat that capsized off Bangladesh on Sunday. Twenty-five people drowned, 13 of them children, police said.",Myanmar takes first step to ease Buddhist-Muslim tension,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-takes-first-step-to-ease-buddhist-muslim-tension-idUSKBN1CF08R?il=0

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s government sought on Tuesday to contain the fallout from the disclosure by the nation’s third-biggest steel maker, Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T), that it had fabricated data on components used in cars, aircraft and space rockets, sending shock waves through the Japanese manufacturing sector.

Faced with the latest in a series of missteps that have undermined Japan’s reputation for high-quality production, the industry ministry instructed Kobe Steel to assess the safety impact from the scandal.

The company said products used by about 200 companies were certified with falsified data. They included Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Central Japan Railway (9022.T), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T) and Subaru Corp (7270.T), the companies confirmed.

Analysts say the announcement further tarnishes the reputation of Japan’s globe-trotting manufacturers, long celebrated for their high-quality products. It could also undermine confidence in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s moves to improve corporate governance as part of his program of Abenomics.

The admission from the steel and aluminium maker follows scandals involving falsified data at household names such as Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata Corp., which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.

Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal involving reporting inflated profits.

“Looking back over several years, foreign investors have bought Japanese stocks on expectations for Abenomics, but among the ”three arrows,“ the growth strategy isn’t functioning,” said, Makoto Kikuchi, CEO of Myojo Asset Management.

“While they say they’re strengthening corporate governance, improprieties focused on manufacturing have been popping up. Going forward, this will be a body blow to Japanese shares.”

Toyota called the revelations a “grave issue,” and said it was making checks on where the components were used and what effect they have on products using them.

Kobe Steel shares closed at the limit low after being untraded for the whole session, diving 22 percent to 1068 yen.

IMPACT ON KOBE CUSTOMERS UNCLEAR

In a statement on Sunday Kobe Steel said some aluminium and copper products shipped from September 2016 to August 2017 were falsely labeled.

Kobe Steel said the misconduct involved dozens of staff and possibly stretched back 10 years. It apologized and said it had appointed lawyers to investigate.

Aluminium castings, forgings and flat-rolled items, along with copper strips and tubes were among the products affected, the company said in a statement.

“These are improper actions that could shake the foundation of fair trade,” Yasuji Komiyama, director of the industry ministry’s metal industries division, told reporters at a briefing on the revelations.

“We want Kobe Steel to make the utmost effort to restore trust from society”, he said.

A Kobe spokesman told Reuters the firm is working with customers to check for any issues. “To our knowledge it has not affected any customer’s products at this stage,” he said.

Boeing (BA.N) said in a statement it was working “with our suppliers since being notified of the issue.”

“Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern,” it said. Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) supply parts to Boeing including for its 777 Dreamliner.

MHI said Kobe Steel products were used on its Mitsubishi Regional Jet and rockets, including a H-2A rocket launched on Tuesday to put a navigation satellite into orbit. There were no technical problems with the components, MHI said.

Industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by Kawasaki Heavy, MHI, IHI Corp (7013.T) and Subaru and checks were being made for any safety issues.

EARNINGS FALLOUT?

Kobe Steel has said the impact of the data falsification on its earnings is still unknown.

“The impact on financials is unclear, but could be substantial depending on request(s) for replacement/recall,” Jefferies analyst Thanh Ha Pham said in a note. “Handling the situation is key to avoid long-term reputation damage.”

PARIS (Reuters) - The spent-fuel pools of French utility EDF’s nuclear reactors are highly vulnerable to attacks, Greenpeace said in a report published on Tuesday.

Written by a group of nuclear experts and delivered to French authorities, the report says that spent-fuel pools, which typically contain the equivalent of one to three nuclear reactor cores, have not been designed to withstand external aggression.

An attack leading to a loss of cooling water could spark a spent-fuel fire that could contaminate areas as far as 250 kilometers away, Greenpeace’s Yannick Rousselet said.

“EDF must address this issue and reinforce its spent-fuel pools,” he said.

EDF, which operates 58 reactors, denied its spent-fuel pools are at risk and said they have been designed to withstand earthquakes and flooding as well as terror attacks.

“Our nuclear fleet is safe and EDF, in close cooperation with the authorities, permanently evaluates the risk of terror attacks,” and EDF spokeswoman said.

Once uranium fuel is burned, the waste - which remains radioactive and very hot for years - typically is cooled in pools 2-3 years before being shipped to processing plants.

Greenpeace experts estimate the cost of upgrading the pools’ safety at about one billion euros ($1.2 billion) per reactor.

The group said that since France has built many nuclear plants right by its borders, citizens of Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Germany and Luxembourg are at risk.

“Nuclear facilities could be an attractive target for a terror organization,” said German nuclear expert Oda Becker.

Becker said the biggest risk is a complete loss of cooling water, which could happen if the building’s walls are hit by an airplane, a helicopter loaded with explosives or wall-penetrating rocket-propelled grenades.

Areva’s La Hague plant is seen as particularly vulnerable.

“With the equivalent of about 114 reactor cores in its pools ... La Hague is the nuclear facility that presents the highest risk in Europe,” said Yves Marignac, one of the experts.

Areva said that since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, Areva and French authorities have been vigilant about terrorism risk.

Much of the fuel at La Hague has largely cooled after years in storage and the site is highly secured, Areva said.

It has permanent radar coverage in cooperation with the air force and no planes are allowed to fly over it at altitudes of less than 2,000 meters in a 3 kilometer radius. La Hague’s pools are also surrounded by large buildings that protect from airplane attacks, Areva said.

State secretary for the environment Sébastien Lecornu said the government would study the Greenpeace report.

Investors were particularly wary on Tuesday as Pyongyang celebrated the founding of its ruling party, a day after Russia and China both called for restraint on North Korea following a Twitter post from U.S. President Donald Trump hinting that military action was on his mind.

In Spain, Catalonia’s secessionist leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the region’s parliament in Barcelona around 1600 GMT and could ask the assembly to vote on a unilateral declaration of independence from Madrid.

The dollar index ran into some profit-taking but was still in reach of a 10-week high scaled on Friday when surprisingly strong U.S. jobs data enhanced already high expectations that the Fed would raise rates in December.

“The Fed is going to raise rates, so we see gold breaking out of the (current) range down to the $1,250 level, with geopolitical tensions supporting the downside,” said Societe Generale analyst Robin Bhar.

Spot gold was up 0.6 percent at $1,291.90 an ounce by 1154 GMT, having earlier touched its highest since late September at $1,292.29.

U.S. gold futures for December delivery climbed 0.7 percent to $1,294.50.

Fed funds futures showed traders were pricing in a nearly 90 percent chance of a December rate increase.

Gold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Higher rates also tend to boost the U.S. currency, making dollar-priced gold costlier for non-U.S. investors.

In the wider markets, global shares ground out a record high on Tuesday, capping gains in safe-haven gold.

“We still reiterate our view ... that the precious metal will likely remain under pressure over the short term, as we see a firmer dollar, resilient equity markets, rising interest rates and slightly quieter geopolitical conditions all combining to keep serious rallies in check,” INTL FCStone said in a note.

In other precious metals, silver rose 1.5 percent to $17.19 an ounce, having touched a two-week high of $17.20.

“The gold-silver ratio is trading above the 10-year average, suggesting silver is undervalued,” Standard Chartered said in a note.

After the two sides collectively spent more than an estimated $100 million on mailings, phone calls and advertisements to woo investors, the outcome as of late Monday was too close to call, according to sources who had estimates of a preliminary voting tally.

Peltz has called for P&G to reorganize into three business units: beauty, grooming and healthcare; fabric and home care and baby, feminine and family care.

P&G, led by chief executive David Taylor, has countered that management is already working on several operational changes, and that Peltz does not have the relevant experience to be helpful in the process.

“Win or lose, Nelson Peltz has taken the activist campaign to the largest companies, which have previously been able to inoculate themselves from these kind of experiences by spending enough money to keep activists at bay,” said Bruce Goldfarb, founder of Okapi Partners, which advises on proxy contests.

Trian, a $14 billion New York-based hedge fund, owns a $3.5 billion stake in the maker of Tide laundry detergent, Crest toothpaste and Charmin toilet paper. Three top proxy advisory firms, which influence the stance of many mutual funds, have recommended P&G shareholders vote to give Peltz a board seat.

Vanguard Group Inc, State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock Inc are P&G’s top three shareholders. Individual stock owners, such as retirees and amateur stock pickers, collectively hold about 40 percent of the company’s stock, a much higher proportion than at most big companies.

P&G’s large retail base is due, in part, to long-running stock-based incentive plans for employees and the attraction of its well-known brand names for “mom and pop” investors.

This is only the third time Trian has waged a proxy contest in its 12-year history. Two years ago it narrowly lost a fight with DuPont, although within a year the company’s CEO was out a job and a faster cost cutting was underway.

Regional leader Carles Puigdemont held a meeting of his cabinet to decide how to press an independence drive that has stirred powerful emotions across Spain and raised concern in European Union partner states.

Catalan police armed with automatic rifles stood guard at Barcelona’s Parc de la Ciutadella which houses the elegant 18th century building. Spanish national police, decried by separatists over their use of force to hinder an Oct. 1 referendum, were not to be seen.

A declaration of independence would deepen Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and would almost certainly draw tough counter-measures from Madrid, possibly including suspension of the regional government.

The parliament and other buildings, such as the regional high court building, could become a focus of contention between Spanish and Catalan authorities.

Thousands of national police reinforcements sent by Madrid for the referendum remain in the area, many of them in two cruise ships docked in Barcelona harbor.

Pro-independence demonstrators were due to gather before the parliament building under the slogan “Hello Republic” to mark Puigdemont’s speech at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).

Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Barcelona against independence at the weekend, waving red-yellow Spanish flags through the city center. That rally fell a week after some 900 people were injured when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt a referendum ruled illegal in Madrid.

Related Coverage Spain's creditors size up cost of Catalan independence bid

Puigdemont has said he is determined to apply a law passed by the Catalan assembly which called for a declaration of independence within days if Catalans voted ‘yes’ in the Oct. 1 referendum.

The government of Spain’s wealthiest region says 90 percent of those who voted backed independence, but turnout was only 43 percent as many opponents of independence stayed at home.

The Madrid government has said it will respond immediately to any unilateral declaration.

Puigdemont could ask the parliament to vote on a motion of independence, which lawmakers say would start a period of up to six months during which Catalonia would write a new constitution and negotiate a divorce with Spain; or he could make a statement of intent on a future independence declaration.

Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to disclose what Puigdemont would say but told a news conference after the cabinet meeting he would be “clear and explicit” and Tuesday would be an historic day.

Ruling party lawmakers say Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is considering taking the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering new regional elections, the so-called nuclear option.

The European Commission repeated its call for dialogue in Spain to end the crisis in Catalonia. Puigdemont has also called for talks and international mediation, but Rajoy has said he will not negotiate with the Catalan leaders unless they abandon plans to declare independence.

BUSINESS CLIMATE

Markets have been rattled by the Catalan crisis, raising Spain’s borrowing costs and pushing down shares.

Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond yields were a touch lower on Tuesday, but above lows hit the previous session as investors awaited Puigdemont’s speech. Spain’s benchmark Ibex share index was down nearly one percent.

The tension is taking its toll on the business climate. On Monday, three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business drift from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum.

Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial and infrastructure firm Abertis both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued.

Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence.

Spain’s finance minister said it was the Catalan government’s fault the companies were leaving.

The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

(Reuters) - Firefighters battled 15 wildfires on Tuesday that have killed at least 11 people and destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses in Northern California while raging through the state’s world-famous wine country.

Efforts to control the fires were helped by the wind dying down on Monday, Brad Alexander, a spokesman for the governor’s Office of Emergency Services, said.

However, the death toll could still rise, he said.

Schools and colleges near the wildfires canceled Tuesday’s classes and two hospitals in Sonoma County were forced to evacuate, state officials said.

About 1,500 homes and commercial buildings had been destroyed, Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said on Monday.

Much of the damage was in California’s wine country north of San Francisco. Sonoma County bore the brunt of the fatalities, with seven fire-related deaths confirmed there, according to the sheriff’s department. Two people died in Napa County and one in Mendocino County, officials said. An 11th death was reported in Yuba County, NBC News reported.

Some 20,000 people had been evacuated from their homes since Sunday, officials said, while CNN said more than 100 had been treated for fire-related injuries, including burns and smoke inhalation.

The 15 fires broke out during the weekend and were fanned by high temperatures and dry conditions. They spread across some 73,000 acres (29,542 hectares), fire officials said.

The largest fire, covering 42 square miles (109 square km) and 39 square miles (101 square km) respectively, struck in Napa and Sonoma counties. The status of the grape crop currently being harvested there was unclear.

In addition to potential damage to vineyards from fire itself, experts say sustained exposure to heavy smoke can taint unpicked grapes.

Fred Oliai, 47, owner of the Alta Napa Valley Winery, said winemakers were nervous.

“You can’t see anything,” he said in a telephone interview. “The smoke is very dense.” Oliai had not been able to get close enough to his vineyards to see if flames reached his 90-acre property. “We got our grapes in last week but others still have grapes hanging,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - BAE Systems will shed 2,000 jobs as new chief executive Charles Woodburn tries to shake up Britain’s biggest defence contractor in the face of dwindling orders for the Typhoon fighter jet.

The Eurofighter Typhoon has won fewer orders this year than the rival Rafale built by France’s Dassault Aviation, as a major order expected from Saudi Arabia has not materialised, although Qatar agreed to buy 24 Typhoon and six Hawk trainer jets in September.

Woodburn, who took over as chief executive in July, plans a major overhaul of the non-U.S. operations of Britain’s preeminent defence supplier, including revamping its air and maritime operations and simplifying management structures.

“These changes will drive competitiveness; accelerate technology innovation; and deliver continued improvements in efficiency and operational excellence,” the company said in a statement.

Britain’s Unite union vowed to fight the “devastatingly short sighted” job losses that it said would undermine the sovereign defence capability of one of the European Union’s top two military powers.

BAE, which has been the backbone of Britain’s defence industry for decades, employs 34,600 people in the country out of a global workforce of 83,100.

Britain will look to support BAE and its workers, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said.

BAE said it will also cut around 375 jobs at its maritime operations, which design the Britain new Dreadnought class of nuclear submarine. Maritime accounted for a quarter of its sales, while its land unit, which builds combat vehicles, accounts for 16 percent.

It will also cut 150 jobs at its Applied Intelligence unit that helps companies and governments fight cyber-warfare.

Defence analyst Howard Wheeldon said the cuts were essentially due to a gap in orders emerging in key programmes such as Typhoon and Hawk, and other programmes, such as support work for the Tornado jet, also ending soon.

“It is the stamp of a new CEO who has looked across the group and decided where it needs to be heading,” he said.

“It takes out a management layer and lays out a new structure and the people for the years ahead.”

DEFENCE CAPABILITY

Just over half of BAE’s 19 billion pounds of sales in 2016 came from its aircraft business, which is also a partner in the F-35 Lightning II combat jet programme.

Based on current orders for the Typhoon and Hawk, BAE said it needed to reduce the workforce by up to 1,400 roles.

BAE’s Warton and Samlesbury plants will suffer the brunt of the losses as around 5,000 people there work on the Typhoon programme, which is a joint project between BAE, France’s Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo.

The group had already slowed production at two of its plants in Lancashire, northern England, which are involved in building the Typhoon jet.

“These planned job cuts will not only undermine Britain’s sovereign defence capability, but devastate communities across the UK who rely on these skilled jobs,” said Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union.

BAE said in August that any new orders were unlikely to impact production delivery rates positively for at least 24 months, and production would be under constant review.

“We obviously have to review our (Typhoon) production demand very carefully,” Woodburn said at the time.

The company said on Tuesday that discussions with current and prospective operators of the Typhoon continued to support its expectations for future contract awards.

The company said the reorganisation, which does not affect its U.S. managed business, did not change its outlook for the year.

It said it still expected its underlying earnings per share to be 5 percent to 10 percent higher than full-year underlying earnings per share in 2016 of 40.3p and it continued to expect a small reduction in net debt compared with 31 December 2016.

Shares in the group were trading down 0.5 percent at 616 pence at 1134 GMT.","BAE to cut 2,000 jobs as CEO Woodburn tackles Typhoon fighter order stall",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bae-systems-jobs/bae-systems-set-to-announce-up-to-2000-job-cuts-in-britain-idUKKBN1CF0L9

OTTAWA (Reuters) - When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets President Donald Trump on Wednesday, he will try to persuade the U.S. leader to focus on Mexico as a source of potential problems at talks to update NAFTA.

Although Trudeau officials were confident Trump would mostly target Mexico as the three nations started to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, Washington has slapped duties on Canadian Bombardier airliners and lumber exports in recent months and talked tough on dairy and wine.

Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Trudeau would “explain really clearly to the President ... that Canada is not America’s problem”.

Freeland, who says Canada buys more from the United States than China, Britain and Japan combined, told CTV television on Sunday that Trudeau’s message to Trump at their White House meeting would be “We are your biggest client.”

Trump has threatened to scrap the 1994 pact unless changes are made to address issues such as a $64 billion deficit with Mexico. Negotiators start the fourth of seven planned rounds of talks near Washington on Wednesday.

Freeland describes the U.S. administration as the most protectionist since the 1930s while noting the United States runs a surplus in the trade of goods and services with Canada.

Canada has so far shunned confrontation with Washington, stressing instead the merits of NAFTA and free trade. By no means everyone south of the border is convinced.

Chris Sands, a professor at the Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said Canada’s problems marked “a new era of tough love” with Washington.

“It turns out Trump is an economic nationalist ... and it’s come as a bit of a surprise to the Canadians that they have been so much on the hot seat,” he said.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar on Tuesday launched its first bid to improve relations between Buddhists and Muslims since an eruption of deadly violence in August inflamed communal tension and triggered an exodus of some 520,000 Muslims to Bangladesh.

Rohingya Muslims are still fleeing, more than six weeks after Rohingya insurgents attacked security forces in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state.

The United Nations has denounced a ferocious military crackdown in response to the attacks as ethnic cleansing aimed at driving out Rohingya.

A new surge of refugees has entered Bangladesh in recent days, including about 11,000 on Monday. Some have told of increasing hunger in Rakhine as well as of more mob attacks on Muslim villagers.

Despite growing international condemnation of the refugee crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged in recent years.

The party of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi took the first step towards trying to ease animosity with inter-faith prayers at a stadium in the biggest city of Yangon, with Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Christians and others.

Thousands of people packed the stands of the stadium, with Buddhist monks, Hindus, Christian nuns and Muslim men with beards and caps listening to religious leaders who took turns to appeal for friendship.

”Be free from killing one another, be free from torturing one another, be free from destroying or demolishing one another,” the chief Buddhist monk of Yangon, Iddhibala, told the crowd.

Stepping off the podium, he shook hands with Muslim leader Hafiz Mufti Ali.

”Citizens should collaborate in friendship and work for the country,“ Ali said, adding: ”Freedom of life, freedom of education, freedom of religion, it is absolutely necessary for the country to fulfil all these rights.”

The Rohingya had pinned hopes for change on Suu Kyi’s party but it has been wary of Buddhist nationalist pressure. Her party did not field a single Muslim candidate in the 2015 election that it swept.

Regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, they face restrictions and discrimination and are derided by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists in Rakhine, and by much of the wider population.

The militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) who launched the Aug. 25 attacks that triggered the latest spasm of violence are demanding full citizenship rights and recognition as an indigenous community.

CEASEFIRE ENDS

A one-month ceasefire the insurgents called in September in order, they said, to ease aid deliveries to Rakhine, expired at midnight on Monday, but authorities said there was no sign of any new attacks.

Slideshow (2 Images)

The government rebuffed the ceasefire, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing. It says more than 500 people have been killed in the violence since late August, most of them ARSA “terrorists”.

Even before the government offensive, the small, lightly armed ARSA appeared only capable of hit-and-run raids and unable to mount any sort of sustained challenge to the army.

The insurgents said on Saturday they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government, even though their ceasefire was ending.

Reports of food shortages in Rakhine will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

Villagers said food was running out because rice crops were not ready for harvest and authorities had shut village markets and limited food transport, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

The government has cited worry about food as a main reason people have cited for leaving, but a senior state government official dismissed any suggestion of starvation.

Among those fleeing were more than 30 people on a boat that capsized off Bangladesh on Sunday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Diamonds can at last be an investor’s best friend, the Singapore Diamond Investment Exchange (SDIX) said on Tuesday, as it launched a new standardised form of the precious stones to rival gold ingots as a safe-haven alternative to cash.

The industry says diamonds are the world’s most concentrated form of wealth, but investors have long viewed them as less useful as a store of value than gold because each stone is different, making its value subjective and trading difficult.

Alain Vandenborre, chairman and founder of SDIX, says technology has solved that problem and diamonds can now become “the new gold”.

Diamond Bullion, produced by the Singapore Diamond Mint, is a collection of investment grade diamonds whose value can be quickly checked. Denominations will initially range between $100,000 and $200,000, with higher and lower values possible in future.

The diamonds are stored in a credit card-sized device containing a chip that allows immediate valuation based on exchange trading and instant authentication, which is crucial as synthetic diamonds have no resale value.

A mark on the Diamond Bullion developed by the International Institute of Diamond Grading and Research (IIDGR), which is part of Anglo American’s (AAL.L) De Beers Group, provides a further guarantee.

De Beers, the world’s biggest diamond producer by value and a leader in equipment that grades and authenticates diamonds, traditionally sold its gems to a limited group of trusted individuals called sightholders.

Diamond trading has gradually become more open.

In 2008, De Beers began selling rough diamonds through online auctions and in June this year began auctioning polished stones too.

SDIX, launched in 2016, says it is the world’s first and only electronic exchange for trading investment-grade diamonds.

Diamond miners in principle welcomed Diamond Bullion.

“Anything that can bring transparency to the diamond price is a good thing,” said Karl Smithson, CEO of Stellar Diamonds (STELD.L), which has a diamond-mining project in Sierra Leone.",Diamonds - the new gold for rich investors?,https://in.reuters.com/article/diamonds-investment/diamonds-the-new-gold-for-rich-investors-idINKBN1CE2ND

The departure leaves Weinstein’s brother Bob, a co-chairman, and chief operating officer David Glasser at the helm of the company.

The board of directors made the decision “in light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding that he had been notified.

A spokeswoman for the executive did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company said on Friday that Weinstein, 65, was taking an indefinite leave of absence after the New York Times reported that he had made eight settlements with women who had accused him of unwanted physical contact and sexual harassment over three decades.

Weinstein has produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies including “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago.” He was a prominent donor to Democrats during the 2016 general election campaign.

The company also said it was conducting its own internal investigation.",Weinstein Co board ousts Harvey Weinstein after harassment allegations,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CE00B-OCAEN
