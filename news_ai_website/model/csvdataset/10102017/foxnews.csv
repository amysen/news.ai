The bill, which was originally introduced in February, would require pet stores to obtain the animals from “a public animal control agency or shelter, society for the prevention of cruelty to animals shelter, humane society shelter, or rescue group … that is in a cooperative agreement with at least one private or public shelter.”

If it’s signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, California would be the first state to ban the sale of animals from so-called puppy mills or mass breeding facilities, according to the Associated Press. He has until Oct. 15 to sign it, reports say.

In the meantime, here are some other things California has banned or might soon.

Plastic bags

California became the first state in the U.S. to ban single-use plastic bags in 2015, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Businesses that continue to offer the bags have to charge customers a fee.

Travel

California blocked state-funded travel to multiple states in June that had what the state attorney general considered anti-LGBT policies. Those states were: Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota and Texas.

Non-essential state-funded travel was already banned from Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Certain pets

California bars the possession of certain “restricted animals” without a specific permit, including hamsters, ferrets and gerbils.

Hedgehogs, certain parakeets and piranhas are also banned from being kept as pets.

Cars with internal combustion engines

Cars with internal combustion engines could soon be banned in California.

Mary Nichols, the California Air Resources Board chair, told Bloomberg that Gov. Jerry Brown is interested in a potential ban. However, she said banning cars with internal combustion engines wouldn’t happen in the next 10 years.

CALIFORNIA COULD BAN CARS WITH INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES, REGULATOR SAYS

Foie gras

California’s foie gras ban was reinstated this month by a federal appeals court. It found that a state law preventing sales of the food product made by force-feeding ducks and geese was not preempted by federal authority to regulate poultry products.

The ban was signed into law in 2004 after proponents said the process of fattening the birds’ livers was cruel and inhumane. The law took effect in 2012, but was blocked by a court in 2015, delighting chefs who wanted to serve it.

The decision won’t immediately go into effect.

The deeper you dig the more it becomes clear this case is about much more than bank fraud.","Perhaps you’ve lost track of the Democrat’s slowly exploding IT scandal, as much of the media is doing all it can to simply ignore it away.

I’m referring to the strange case of Imran Awan, the IT aide Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., kept on her congressional payroll even after it became known he and his wife, Hina Alvi Awan, were being investigated by the Capitol Police for possible theft, fraud, moving terabytes of data off Congress’s system and more.

Imran Awan was back in court last week. When pushed, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Mirando revealed some telling things about this case.

First, I should note that it was standing room only in the packed courtroom at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Friday morning ... okay, just kidding, actually, only a few reporters sat in the mostly empty wooden benches in the back of the courtroom. Anyone who didn’t know this was the latest scene in a slowly exploding political scandal would have thought this was only a forgettable bank fraud case.

The deeper you dig the more it becomes clear this case is about much more than bank fraud.

Awan’s attorney, Chris Gowen, even told me: “This case is hardly newsworthy.”

But before the show started, Imran’s wife, Hina Alvi Awan, entered the courtroom. She had flown away to Pakistan with their children soon after the investigation became known.

Was she back as part of a plea deal?

While Hina Alvi was gone, on August 17, 2017, a federal grand jury indicted her and Awan on four counts, including conspiracy and conspiring to obtain home equity loans for $165,000 and $120,000 from the Wright Patman Congressional Federal Credit Union and then transferring the money to Pakistan. (Read the FBI’s criminal affidavit on the bank fraud here and you’ll see why the government thinks it has a strong case.)

Imran Awan is considered such a flight risk that his passport was taken, he was given a curfew and was fitted with a tracking device.

Meanwhile, Hina Alvi’ passport was also publicly taken during the court hearing, but she was officially listed as a “walk in,” a tracking device wasn’t attached to her ankle and the government had asked the court to squash an outstanding warrant for her arrest.

Now came the revelations. Gowen, Imran’s attorney, asked that Imran’s travel restrictions be removed.

This prompted Assistant U.S. Attorney Mirando to say that when Imran was arrested at Dulles International Airport a cellphone found on him “had been wiped clean just a few hours before.”

Gowen tried to counter this by saying, “Awan had recently bought the phone, so of course it didn’t have any data on it.”

But Mirando was ready. He said the FBI found that the phone had been wiped as clean as Hillary’s server. A time stamp on the iPhone indicated it had been wiped at 6:30 p.m. that evening. Also, Imran did have a laptop on him, but one of the few things on it was a resume. Mirando used this and other details—such as the Awans quickly selling many of their Virginia properties—to explain that Imran had no intention of returning.

In another twist, Gowen brought up a computer that Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz wants back so badly she actually threatened the chief of the Capitol Police in a public hearing with “consequences” if she didn’t get it back.

Gowen argued that the computer and documents seized in a bag left in a public area of a congressional building around midnight on April 6, 2017, are “protected by attorney-client privilege.” Gowen hopes to remove this evidence from future court proceedings.

Gowen, however, didn’t answer what Imran was doing in the Longworth congressional building late at night and long after he’d been fired by every Democrat aside from Rep. Wasserman Schultz (Wasserman Schultz’s office isn’t in Longworth).

The deeper you dig the more it becomes clear this case is about much more than bank fraud. Capitol Police are investigating possible theft of congressional computer equipment, massive amounts of data moved off the congressional system, alleged fake computer data created to throw investigators off the trail, and data mined by the Awans that could include emails from many members of Congress and more.

Rep. Wasserman Schultz, who lost her post at the DNC when Wikileaks published emails showing that under her leadership the DNC worked to sabotage Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, might be exposed to even more revelations.

Meanwhile, Congress has been asked to open an ethics investigation to answer why Rep. Wasserman Schultz kept Imran on her payroll even after the Capitol Police investigation became known.

By The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board



Does President Trump want a bipartisan deal on immigration, or is his talk merely for cable-TV show? Two weeks ago he suggested the former, but on Sunday evening the White House issued demands that will make any agreement well-nigh impossible.

The issue is how to fix Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama program that granted work permits and legal immunity to some 800,000 young adults who were brought into the U.S. illegally as minors. Last month the Administration announced that it would end DACA in six months, giving Congress time to pass a permanent fix for these so-called Dreamers.

Mr. Trump declared at the time that he and Democratic leaders—“Chuck and Nancy”—were close to a deal that traded DACA legalization for bolstering border security but no “wall” on the Mexican-U.S. border. But Mr. Trump’s anti-immigration supporters howled in protest, and it now appears they have turned the President against his own deal-making.

The new White House demands include 70 immigration “priorities” that amount to everything that the restrictionist right has ever sought. They include appropriating funds to complete a wall along the southern border and slashing legal immigration by half.

The White House also wants to mandate that all employers use E-Verify to check workers’ legal status despite the program’s spotty record. And it wants Congress to expand employment-discrimination laws to replace U.S. citizens with foreign workers, which would be a sop to trial lawyers and unions. Just what the American economy needs: more labor lawsuits.

According to the White House document, “immigrants who come here illegally and enter the workforce undermine job opportunities and reduce wages for American workers, as does the abuse of visa programs.” What alternative economy are they living in? The real labor problem is a shortage, as the jobless rate has hit 4.2% nationwide. America’s tight visa caps are sending high-tech jobs to Canada and agricultural production to Mexico.

These problems would be exacerbated by the White House demand that Congress restrict “low-skilled immigration” and establish a putative merit-based immigration system with too few visas or green cards. Politicians would arbitrarily assign points to foreign applicants based on metrics like pay and education. Farm and construction workers need not apply. “Chained” immigration for extended family members of U.S. citizens and green card holders would also be abolished, thus encouraging more illegal entries.

The White House also calls for restricting grants to “sanctuary” jurisdictions that don’t cooperate with federal authorities or even that merely provide services or benefits to immigrants that aren’t covered by federal law. This means far more than left-wing cities such as San Francisco and could encompass Florida and Texas, which provide immigrants in-state tuition benefits.",Immigration Bait and Switch,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/10/immigration-bait-and-switch

But they’re totally fine with telling the vice president he has to stay for the game.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared on The Resurgent website.

Vice President Mike Pence has been an Indianapolis Colts fan for quite awhile. He served the state of Indiana in Congress during the record-setting heyday of Peyton Manning. So it was unsurprising to find out that Pence planned to be at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis yesterday when the Colts officially retired Manning’s jersey and inducted him into their Ring of Honor during halftime of their game against the San Francisco 49ers.

But the vice president’s homecoming to honor the legendary quarterback was cut short when 15-20 players for the 49ers decided to disrespect the American flag, continuing their pregame publicity stunt by kneeling. Pence left the game and tweeted out his explanation:

“I left today’s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem…While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don’t think it’s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem.”

The reaction was largely predictable, with fans tired of the political posturing of overpaid sports stars applauding, and social justice warriors condemning. What was extraordinarily funny, however, was the way that the sports media humiliated themselves in responding.

The vice president stayed, stood, and honored the flag and anthem while it was performed. He chose not to stay and honor the players who disrespected that flag with his presence at their game – like countless other fans have done as well. This isn’t that difficult to understand.

Former CBS Sports writer and current Indy Star sports columnist Gregg Doyel, a card-carrying left-wing activist, immediately registered his disgust by cranking out an article suggesting that, “Mike Pence used the Colts to spray paint Donald Trump’s political graffiti.” His hyperbole got him an invitation to appear on CNN’s ""New Day"" with fellow leftist Chris Cuomo.

He was far from alone in his indignation, though. In fact, the entire Indianapolis Star staff, which has notoriously opposed and besmirched Pence for years, apparently saw their opportunity to issue a collective, coordinated strike.

Opinion chief Tim Swarens pushed out a column accusing Pence of demonstrating a lack of leadership. Sports writer Zac Keefer kept everyone informed how much per hour it cost taxpayers to fly Air Force 2, and whined that the, “Whole thing was planned.” But the most hysterical response went to their colleague Stephen Holder who quoted NFL reporter Mike Freeman’s tweet calling Pence’s action “pre-planned outrage” and “fake outrage,” adding, “Total publicity stunt IMO (in my opinion).”

Wait a minute. Holder (and Keefer, and Doyel), have fallen all over themselves applauding the publicity stunt of players taking a knee during the anthem for weeks now. Why are some publicity stunts more equal than others?

Local radio star Tony Katz, who fills in occasionally for nationally syndicated Dana Loesch, asked Holder to clarify whether it qualifies as a publicity stunt when players kneel. Holder’s response was choice:

“Probably to you, because you either aren’t listening to them or don’t care. Good day.”

Sorry, but that’s just too funny. I’m guessing Holder doesn’t even realize that the exact same thing can be said about his response to Pence: Holder either isn’t listening to Pence when he explains why he left, or he doesn’t care. The vice president stayed, stood, and honored the flag and anthem while it was performed. He chose not to stay and honor the players who disrespected that flag with his presence at their game – like countless other fans have done as well. This isn’t that difficult to understand.

Keefer, Doyel, and Holder don’t want anyone telling players they have to stand for the anthem. But they’re totally fine with telling the vice president he has to stay for the game.

TRUMP TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION ON HEALTH CARE BY EXPANDING OPTIONS, REPORTS SAY

The president’s move comes after the GOP-led Senate failed to garner votes for a deal last month.

The president seemed to shift his focus from Republicans to Democrats over the weekend, saying he had spoken with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to collaborate on a health care plan. Trump told reporters on Saturday that he was willing to consider a “temporary deal.”

But Schumer said the president “wanted to make another run at ‘repeal and replace’ and I told the president that’s off the table.” Schumer noted that Democrats, however, were open to his suggestions.

The president has also tried negotiating with Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on an immigration package to help so-called 'Dreamers.' But Schumer and Pelosi balked at Trump's recent demands for border security and other measures as part of any deal.

The president lashed out at Democratic leaders Tuesday morning for their response.

“The problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don’t want secure borders, they don’t care about safety for U.S.A,” Trump tweeted.

TRUMP'S DACA DEMANDS MET WITH OUTRAGE FROM 'CHUCK AND NANCY'

The administration has outlined a series of conditions on any DACA deal including: additional crackdowns on “sanctuary cities;” reducing the number of incoming refugees; 10,000 more Customs and Border Patrol agents; and new initiatives curbing the number of unaccompanied immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally as children.",Trump confirms he'll use 'power of the pen' on health care,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/10/trump-confirms-hell-use-power-pen-on-health-care.html

But that obligation is heightened to a degree for pharmaceutical firms, especially the ones whose customers are dealing with serious illness or acute, chronic pain.

Insys Therapeutics deals with both types of patients.

The Arizona-based drug company got approval five years ago from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray for cancer patients dealing with chronic pain.

Subsys contains fentanyl, the highly addictive synthetic opioid that is 100 times more powerful that morphine and 50 times more powerful than heroin, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Fentanyl has been in the news for the past few years.

SURGEONS REMOVE RECORD-BREAKING TUMOR FROM PATIENT'S KIDNEY

It’s been the cause of many deaths by those who mix it with street heroin.

An accidental overdose of fentanyl was the cause of rock star Prince’s death.

Despite the dangers and all the controversy surrounding this drug, Insys thought it had a winner on its hands with its sublingual version.

But apparently not as many cancer patients were using the drug as the company had hoped.

So, executives concocted an elaborate scheme in which they created “fake” cancer patients to improve sales, according to a Senate investigation whose findings were released last week.

The report from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs was released just days after Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich filed a consumer fraud lawsuit against Insys and three doctors over a “marketing scheme” to increase sales of the drug.

Brnovich called the action part of a fight against “the unethical and greedy behavior in the pharmaceutical industry that is fueling the opioid crisis in our state.”

Senator doesn’t mince words

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri), who is steering the Insys investigation, said last week in a press conference that the company aggressively pressured its employees and many in the medical industry to increase the use of the drug.

And, she noted, it was done during a national opioid epidemic that is taking the lives of tens of thousands of people in the United States a year.

“It’s hard to imagine anything more despicable,” said McCaskill.

The senator said Insys executives misled insurance companies, provided kickbacks to doctors who went along with the scam, and falsified medical records, all just to make money.

According to the Senate report, insurance companies would only pay for the drug for a patient who “had an active cancer diagnosis, was being treated by an opioid (and, thus, was opioid tolerant) and was being prescribed Subsys to treat breakthrough pain that the other opioid could not eliminate.”

Federal prosecutors in Boston announced in December that six former Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Officer Michael Babich, had been indicted.

HERE'S HOW TO TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT OPIOIDS

Prosecutors said Babich and others led the conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe Subsys to non-cancer patients, for which the drug is not designed, through payments disguised as marketing events and speaker fees.

Reuters reported in July that while Insys ostensibly designed the speaker program to educate healthcare professionals about Subsys, its primary purpose was to reward healthcare providers who prescribed the drug.

Prosecutors said the medical providers earned thousands of dollars in kickbacks through the speaker events, which were usually just a gathering of friends and co-workers at high-end restaurants.

In July, two former Insys sales representatives, including the wife of the company’s former chief executive officer, pleaded guilty to engaging in schemes to pay kickbacks to medical practitioners to prescribe the drug.

Pharma’s image damaged

Pharmaceutical companies in the United States are closely monitored by the federal government and intensely scrutinized in their clinical trials and marketing practices.

However, when a drug company does something as egregious as Insys is accused of, the industry’s image is damaged.

The image wasn’t helped last year by Martin Shkreli, the former chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals who raised the price of a medication for AIDS patients from $13.50 to $750.

Last month, Shkreli was convicted of two counts of fraud and one count of conspiracy for misleading investors in hedge funds he ran. He’s now doing time at a federal jail in Brooklyn.

The details of the Insys story are another public relations headache for the industry.

A recent national survey by Kantar Media, a healthcare industry research firm, showed that only 22 percent of consumers who were surveyed trust the drug companies that advertise the medications they take.

Kantar’s 2017 MARS Consumer Health Study also showed that only 28 percent believe pharmaceutical ads make them more knowledgeable.

Only 44 percent agreed that prescription drugs are a more effective treatment than over-the-counter drugs.

Patients respond to scandals

Meanwhile, the response to the Insys scandal among cancer patients has been one of outrage.

In interviews with Healthline, a half-dozen cancer patients and cancer patient advocates had harsh words for Insys as well as stern advice for the industry at large.

“When you violate the trust of someone in the cancer community, it’s almost impossible to gain it back,” said Dan Duffy, a stage 3 testicular cancer survivor, author, and advocate for cancer patients.

“Insys violated the trust a company needs to have on so many levels that it defies comprehension,” Duffy added. “I’ve never been someone to call for the public shaming or firing of anyone, because I know just how important it is to have the ability to take care of yourself, as well as your family if you have one. But whoever thought this was a good idea needs to find a new line of work. Stat.”

Duffy said what Insys has allegedly done is especially appalling because it involved faking cancer for financial gain.

“I can’t say that I haven’t thought, ‘There’s a special place in hell for this person,’” he said.

Linnea Olson, a stage 4 lung cancer patient, artist, blogger, cancer activist, and mother of three, told Healthline that the relationship between cancer patients and pharmaceutical companies is complicated.

“It is a relationship fraught with tension, as they are profit-driven, which is a different onus than patients, oncologists, researchers, and advocacy organizations,” said Olson, who is currently enrolled in her third clinical trial.

Olson said cancer patients sometimes don’t trust drug companies because “we don't feel they necessarily have our best interests at heart. There is a lot of talk about patients as partners right now, and I regard most of it as rhetoric. You can’t be a true partner in a relationship if you are not an equal.”

Olson added that the one thing patients trust drug companies to do is deliver a product that is safe and appropriate.

“When we hear of a fraudulent situation such as this one — pretending that people had cancer in order to get prior approval for a powerful pain killer — it erodes that very slim sliver of trust and enhances our perception that they are in it for the money and only the money,” she said.

Casey Quinlan, a breast cancer survivor, cancer patient advocate, healthcare policy wonk, and comedy writer, is dedicated to creating a healthcare system that serves people, not profits.

She told Healthline that the issue of trust is central to cancer patients who are in treatment.

“Trust in the clinicians making the diagnosis, trust in the treatment plan proposed, trust in the science and statistical modeling that predicts outcome,” she said.

“Good science can save lives. Fakery ruins them,” she added. “To earn back trust, pharma will have to do some very public penance. I suggest they start with full transparency on all trials, and also clean house of all sales-driven decision making.”

Insys responds

It’s hard to imagine how Insys will survive as a company at this point.

But its product can and does help some people with cancer, so there could be efforts in the future to save the product, if not the company.

Insys isn’t speaking to individual media outlets.

NEW DRUG TO PROTECT INFANTS FROM WHOOPING COUGH SHOWS PROMISE

But in a statement released earlier this month, the company said it disagreed with “certain characterizations” in McCaskill’s report but agreed the “opioid epidemic must be addressed.”

In the Senate report, Insys Chief Executive Officer Saeed Motahari said the company is working to prevent the “mistakes and unacceptable actions” of the past by establishing protocols that hold employees to ethical standards.

“Insys has completely transformed its employee base over the last several years,” said Motahari, one of many new leaders at the company, which has seen more than 90 percent of its sales staff exit since 2014.

Motahari also said in the statement that the company’s former employees’ “mistakes and unacceptable actions” were not indicative of the company’s current employees.

“Over the past several years, Insys has actively taken the appropriate steps to place ethical standards of conduct and patient interests at the heart of our business decisions,” Motahari said.

By The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board



Does President Trump want a bipartisan deal on immigration, or is his talk merely for cable-TV show? Two weeks ago he suggested the former, but on Sunday evening the White House issued demands that will make any agreement well-nigh impossible.

The issue is how to fix Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama program that granted work permits and legal immunity to some 800,000 young adults who were brought into the U.S. illegally as minors. Last month the Administration announced that it would end DACA in six months, giving Congress time to pass a permanent fix for these so-called Dreamers.

Mr. Trump declared at the time that he and Democratic leaders—“Chuck and Nancy”—were close to a deal that traded DACA legalization for bolstering border security but no “wall” on the Mexican-U.S. border. But Mr. Trump’s anti-immigration supporters howled in protest, and it now appears they have turned the President against his own deal-making.

The new White House demands include 70 immigration “priorities” that amount to everything that the restrictionist right has ever sought. They include appropriating funds to complete a wall along the southern border and slashing legal immigration by half.

The White House also wants to mandate that all employers use E-Verify to check workers’ legal status despite the program’s spotty record. And it wants Congress to expand employment-discrimination laws to replace U.S. citizens with foreign workers, which would be a sop to trial lawyers and unions. Just what the American economy needs: more labor lawsuits.

According to the White House document, “immigrants who come here illegally and enter the workforce undermine job opportunities and reduce wages for American workers, as does the abuse of visa programs.” What alternative economy are they living in? The real labor problem is a shortage, as the jobless rate has hit 4.2% nationwide. America’s tight visa caps are sending high-tech jobs to Canada and agricultural production to Mexico.

These problems would be exacerbated by the White House demand that Congress restrict “low-skilled immigration” and establish a putative merit-based immigration system with too few visas or green cards. Politicians would arbitrarily assign points to foreign applicants based on metrics like pay and education. Farm and construction workers need not apply. “Chained” immigration for extended family members of U.S. citizens and green card holders would also be abolished, thus encouraging more illegal entries.

The White House also calls for restricting grants to “sanctuary” jurisdictions that don’t cooperate with federal authorities or even that merely provide services or benefits to immigrants that aren’t covered by federal law. This means far more than left-wing cities such as San Francisco and could encompass Florida and Texas, which provide immigrants in-state tuition benefits.",Immigration Bait and Switch,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/10/immigration-bait-and-switch#commenting

As reported by sources for the New York Post, the Obamas are apparently waiting for 10 Gracie Square’s housing board to approve the purchase of a unit in the building, which has been home to such famous folks as Gloria Vanderbilt, Anderson Cooper, and former first lady of China Madame Chiang Kai-shek — but it’s also got quite a tragic past, the Post reports.

SEE THE NYC TOWNHOUSE WHERE OBAMA LIVED AFTER COLLEGE

The building has been the site of two very high-profile suicides in the last 30 years, which is enough to make even a New York City real-estate agent think twice about living there.

“I don’t know of any buildings with two suicides,” said Dolly Lenz, CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, in a statement to the New York Post. “It almost says that there is a cloud on the building.”

The first victim of these tragedies was Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old son of Gloria Vanderbilt and the older brother of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. According to reports, Carter was acting strangely in the months leading up to his suicide, but had been in therapy. Then, on July 22, 1988, during a visit to his mother’s home, he abruptly ran out onto the terrace of his Vanderbilt’s two-story penthouse apartment, hopped over the ledge, and dangled there before letting himself drop from the 14th floor — all while Vanderbilt watched from feet away.

MORE ABOUT BARACK AND MICHELLE'S PROSPECTIVE NYC APARTMENT

""He let go, and there was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him,” Vanderbilt remembered during a 2011 appearance of Anderson Cooper’s talk series.

In Vanderbilt’s 1997 book, “A Mother’s Story,” she also alleged that Carter’s suicide may have triggered by an allergy to medication.

The second, much more recent suicide at 10 Grace Square took place in April 2017, and claimed the life of author, heiress and socialite Jean Stein. Stein, whose works include “Edie: An American Girl” and “West of Eden,” had reportedly been suffering from depression, according to her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, and jumped from the 15th floor of the building on April 30, the New York Times reported in its obituary.

A fellow resident who witnessed the suicide has said it was a messy one, as Stein “miscalculated” the jump and landed an eighth-floor terrace. She had also severed her leg in the fall, according to reports.

10 Gracie Square, however, is also infamous for more than these two suicides: In 1982, it was also where sixth-floor resident Frances Schreuder was arrested for conspiring with her son Marco to kill Schreuder’s father, wealthy Utah businessman Franklin Bradshaw.

Schreuder had reportedly been unhappy with the amount of money Bradshaw was allotting her, and persuaded her then-17-year-old son to shoot his grandfather dead in 1978. He was eventually caught, and Schreuder was nabbed while trying to escape out the window of her 10 Gracie Square abode.

Identifying quality wood furniture can be difficult these days. Many pieces look great in the store, only to prove flimsy once you get them home and start to use them. Here’s what to look for, and what to avoid, when shopping for your next piece of wood furniture.

When made with high-quality materials and solid construction, wood furniture can last for decades and sometimes even centuries. But not everything you see in stores is built to last. Buy something that’s made poorly and you’ll start to see wear and tear way too soon. How can you tell the difference? It’s harder than you might think. The first thing to pay attention to is the wood itself.

Solid wood. The highest-quality material for wood furniture is solid wood. This type of furniture will be made from single pieces of wood or wood boards that are glued together to make panels — trees are only so wide, after all. If something is described as being made with solid wood, find out if that describes the entire piece or just certain parts.

Hardwood. Solid wood can be categorized as either hardwood or softwood. Hardwood comes from slower-growing trees and the wood is denser and more resistant to dings. Common hardwoods include oak, ash, walnut, cherry and maple.

Softwood. Softwood comes from faster-growing trees and the wood is less dense. Some common softwoods are pine, fir and poplar. Since these trees grow faster, furniture made using their wood tends to be less expensive than pieces made from hardwood.

Domestic wood. Domestic wood comes from trees that are grown and processed in the United States. Common domestic wood species include oak, maple, cherry, walnut, ash, poplar and pine.

A quick note about how wood is described: The species can describe either the material or the stain color. So something described as walnut might be stained that color but actually be made from pine. This isn’t necessarily bad — just make sure you know what you’re getting. You shouldn’t be paying walnut prices for a piece of furniture made from less-expensive wood.

Imported wood. A lot of imported furniture is made from tropical wood species such as rubberwood (sometimes known as plantation hardwood), mango, acacia or sheesham (a type of rosewood). These species can produce a sturdy piece of furniture, but they may be susceptible to cracking if they’re coming from a humid environment to a drier one.

Benefits of solid wood. Ensuring that your furniture is 100 percent solid wood is a pretty fail-safe way to know that you’re purchasing something high-quality. Solid wood construction is extremely long-lasting and can be easily refinished and repaired down the road.

Cons of solid wood. Solid wood is definitely the best choice for furniture but, as with any natural material, there can be downsides. Solid wood is more susceptible to changes in climate, which may cause it to crack or warp. It’s also more expensive than furniture made from engineered wood products.

Plywood. Plywood (sometimes called engineered hardwood) is made by gluing together thin layers of solid wood. When used in furniture construction, plywood is covered with a thin layer of stained and finished wood — a veneer.

Pros of plywood. The main benefit of plywood is that it’s stable when the climate changes and is less likely to warp or crack in dry climates. It can also give you a sturdy piece of furniture at a lower cost than solid wood.

Cons of plywood. Sometimes the quality of plywood comes down to the quality of the veneer. Poor-quality veneers can chip, revealing the lower-quality wood underneath. Damage may also be difficult to repair since the bulk of the furniture is made using a different wood species than the veneer. Also, some plywood is made using chemicals with formaldehyde, which can affect indoor air quality, although formaldehyde-free plywood is available.

MDF. Medium-density fiberboard is made from wood waste products (basically sawdust) that have been mixed with resins. The mixture is compressed to create large, flat boards. For furniture, MDF is finished with a layer of real-wood veneer or non-wood laminate.

Pros and cons of MDF. There are more cons than pros when you’re talking about MDF furniture. Pieces made from it are less expensive than those made of solid wood or plywood, which makes them budget-friendly. However, MDF requires a lot of chemicals to make and is the highest-formaldehyde-emitting wood product out there. Other downsides: It can easily be damaged by water, it’s difficult to repair, it doesn’t hold screws very well and it’s heavy.

Particle board. Made similarly to MDF, particle board uses larger wood scraps to create boards. You can differentiate particle board from MDF by spotting the pockets of air when looking at it from the side.

Pros and cons of particle board. The one thing particle board has going for it is that it’s inexpensive. And then there are the downsides: It emits formaldehyde, requires a lot of chemicals to produce, is susceptible to moisture damage and really doesn’t hold screws well. Particle board furniture tends to loosen up quickly, resulting in wobbles.

Veneers. A veneer is a thin sheet of real wood that is applied to the outside of a piece of wood furniture. It can be added to any of the wood products mentioned above. Veneers are used when you want to match up wood grain to create a design, or to cover a lower-cost piece of furniture.

Selecting veneered furniture. Veneer quality varies widely. Look for those that are thicker, have good adhesion and are glued to solid wood or plywood as opposed to MDF or particle board. Poorly done veneers can peel and chip.

By The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board

Donald Trump’s weekend Twitter spat with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker is a familiar story: The President is a Party of One for whom personal loyalty is the only test. He isn’t going to change, so the meaningful question is how Republicans should navigate his periodic explosions to help the country and maintain their majorities in Congress.

Mr. Trump unleashed his tirade because he is still sore that Mr. Corker said this summer that the President hadn’t shown the stability or competence to be successful. The two later had it out in the Oval Office, but Mr. Corker stood by his words. And why shouldn’t he?

Mr. Corker was expressing views that are widely held on Capitol Hill and even within the Trump Administration. These men and women support the President’s policies, or at least most of them, and they remain in their jobs for the good of the cause and country. What they fear, and want to contain, are the President’s lack of discipline, short fuse, narcissism and habit of treating even foreign heads of state as if they are Rosie O’Donnell.

In other words, Mr. Corker was trying to be helpful by telling the truth. And he has standing to do so because he has tried to steer Mr. Trump in a constructive direction without personal grandstanding. He agreed to interview for Vice President until he withdrew from the running. He might have agreed to be Secretary of State had he been asked. And as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee he has had numerous private discussions with the President on a variety of national security subjects.

He is like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in engaging Mr. Trump even as he tells the President things he doesn’t like to hear.

“[I have] suffered for more than six years,” she told EFE, according to El Diario de Sevilla.

Escudero said she first learned of the error when she visited the emergency room and her primary care physician checked her out.

“He looked at her, not knowing how to break it to her, and told her that according to Social Security records she was deceased,” her daughter, Marta, told the newspaper, adding “the family has not found the funny side of this story for a long time now.”

The doctor still treated Escudero “because she knew me and knew my situation was urgent,” but that the error needed to be fixed sooner rather than later.

At first, Escudero thought it was just a computer error that could be fixed quickly at the Social Security offices. That wasn’t the case.

“They explained to me that someone probably made a typo or maybe it was a computer error. But we went to the treasury, to the courts…and everywhere I appeared as deceased,” she told the newspaper.

“On top of killing me, they find me, without hearing my story,” Escudero said, joking that she is dead to everyone but the banks, to whom she pays loans and mortgage on a regular basis. “On the government’s computers I am dead, but for the banks I am alive and kicking.”

In April 2016, she found out that a woman with her name and data had been buried six years prior in Malaga – about 127 miles away.

She said her daughter called the cemetery and confirmed the burial date and that the remains has been transferred to an ossuary because maintenance fees had not been paid. She also confirmed her mother’s social security and date of birth.

“'Look,' my daughter told them, 'that person is my mother and she is here right next to me,'” Escudero said. “Imagine the woman’s face at the cemetery.”

Earlier this month she filed a petition with Malaga courts to have the grave opened and has offered to do a DNA test – anything – to prove that the woman buried is not her.

Escudero says no one has explained to her how the woman has died, but believes that she has been confused with a sister with whom she has no contact and whose whereabouts are unknown.

McDonald’s Szechuan Sauce officially returned to the restaurant’s menu on Oct. 7 after first debuting nearly 20 years ago as part of a promotion for Disney’s animated film Mulan — though the rerelease didn’t go as smoothly as anticipated.

Interest in the long-discontinued sauce was first piqued in April 2017, after a Cartoon Network series called “Rick and Morty” made the condiment a plot point: Rick, a mad scientist-type character, professed his love for the sauce, and cited it as the impetus for all his actions. Fans then took to Change.org to organize a petition for McDonald’s to “bring back” the sauce.

McDonald later caved to demand, and announced that the cult-favorite dipping sauce would be available for one day only — along with a special commemorative poster — at participating locations.

However, McDonald’s neglected to mention that each location would only have a very limited number of sauce packets to hand out, with customers reporting that McDonald’s only allotted 20 for each store. In some cases, the clientele became so rowdy after learning of the shortage that police were called to the restaurants to disperse crowds.

Some even called to boycott the fast food restaurant over the issue, using the hashtag #BoycottMcDonalds to gain support on Twitter.

In the subsequent photos of the First Couple that emerged, one detail stood out to many Twitter users: the Manolo Blahnik stilettos Melania wore. People started criticizing the First Lady for her footwear choice, calling it insensitive and accusing her of caring more about her public image than actually helping the people affected by the hurricane. Now, in a clip from an interview with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee airing on Saturday, Trump is defending the First Lady's footwear choice.

A few weeks after the photos of Melania in her very high heels circulated the Internet, Blahnik himself spoke up in favor of the First Lady. ""I don't think she's insensitive,"" he told Harper's Bazaar. ""I think she's working nonstop to make it work—possibly she was just wearing the shoes she left New York in. Yes, I think probably she could have worn Hunter boots, but she was wearing what she was wearing.""

Back to Friday: when Huckabee asked Trump about Melania's high approval ratings, the president went on to brag about his wife and how much she loves to help other people. He also pointed out that she's taken on a lot of criticism. ""She goes and wants to look—out of respect for the White House—wants to look good leaving the front entrance to the White House. So she dresses up, she puts on formal shoes—high heels—and she leaves the White House going to Texas,"" he explained. Apparently, at the time she had sneakers with her so she could change into safer footwear when it was time to walk through the aftermath of the hurricane.

Trump goes on to mention that despite the flak his wife received, many of his supporters brought signs to a speech he gave that said they love Melania's stilettos.

This isn't the first time the First Lady has been dragged because of her fashion choices. Recently she wore a $2,950 Delpozo dress when giving a speech addressing child hunger. Days after, she wore a somewhat impractical $1,380 Balmain shirt while gardening with the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington. And of course there was the time Donald Trump tweeted about the importance of American labor with a photo of his wife wearing an Italian-made dress.

The flying museum, better known as the “Madras Maiden” touched down in Columbia, S.C. Sunday, where volunteers give 30-minute tours to veterans, visitors or families of those who served in the military.

“They do fine…I’m proud of them. [They’re] down in that plane like they were born in it,” WWII Army veteran William Pate said about the volunteers.

From 1944 to 1947, Pate jumped out of C-47’s and C-82’s as an 82nd Airborne paratrooper.

“I enjoyed what I was doing. If I could, I would do it again. But I have a lot of age on me now. I ain’t no spring chicken,” he told Fox News.

Pate and other veterans in attendance swapped war stories with each other and the crew after taking one of the flights over the city.

“It’s just an honor to be able to hear their stories, talk to their families and just keep their memories alive for generations,” Rodney Schneider said.

An aircraft maintainer by trade, Schneider explained his love for planes stretched back to his childhood. This motivated him to reach out to the Liberty Foundation, which organizes the event.

“I’ve been with the airplane now seven-days straight. Sometimes its weeks between when I’m needed,"" Schneider said.

Robert “Max” Maiden, 21, is a co-pilot for the bomber. He flies to different cities every weekend for six months.

“I’ve always loved flying old airplanes…They have a cool story to tell and they are an important part of history,” Maiden said. “You really see people get really emotional and they sit there and they go, 'Aww man this is what my dad did,' or ‘my dad built them’ or 'my dad flew them or is a gunner.' It’s really cool to share that with people.”

Erin Creed traveled to Columbia from Virginia with her father and husband to honor her grandfather, who fought the Nazis in Europe.

“I just could not believe I was on a World War Two plane,” she said. “I had his picture and his favorite hat and I just couldn’t believe [I] was flying in memory of him.”

One of only 12 B-17’s still flying the “Madras Maiden” was built toward the end of the war but never saw combat. In 2016, The Liberty Foundation began operating the aircraft and spends over a million dollars every year for upkeep. The money that is generated from ticket sales or donations helps to cover the costs.

“If that goes away, it goes back into a museum and starts collecting dust and you don’t get to hear it or smell it,” Schneider explained.

The crew’s age and skills may vary, but one thing remains the same -- the love for planes and veterans.

“We get to ride on a WWII airplane that not everybody can do and just the satisfaction of just doing it,” Schneider said.

Trump also emphasized his support for his chief of staff John Kelly, saying he hopes he will stay in the role throughout his entire administration.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

Following Outnumbered Overtime, Perino will host The Daily Briefing at 2PM/ET, an hour often dominated by breaking news, White House press briefings, and more from Washington and around the nation. With her understanding of what makes news, how to respond to it and her unique political expertise, Perino will break it all down with insight from key Beltway experts.

Perino remarked, “Our new show will aim to take on the major issues facing Americans and explore them from all angles. I am excited for this opportunity to draw from my political background to help our viewers get beyond the headlines and better understand what is really going on behind the scenes in Washington each day.”

She barely even acknowledged me when I greeted her. Then one day, everything changed.

The coworker, whom I’ll call Carrie, dropped by my office and asked for advice about how to deal with her supervisor. I appreciated the fact that Carrie trusted my advice, but I was uncomfortable with the conversation. She seemed to be gossiping more than trying to fix the problem, so I tried to turn the conversation to a more positive direction.

“That sounds frustrating, but you can’t fix your supervisor,” I said. “The only person you can work on is you. If you spend your energy trying to fix someone you can’t control, you’re just going to feel frustrated and helpless.”

She laughed and said, “You remind me of Joel Osteen.”

As we fix our thoughts on the true, honorable, right, pure, lovely and admirable things in the people around us, we’ll find less pleasure in sharing their weaknesses with others. We'll also be less interested in hearing other people spew negativity about others.

I repeated my advice with my best twangy Osteen impression and wrapped up the conversation, sincerely hoping she might actually change her behavior. She didn’t.

When Carrie would see me, she always found a way to make the conversation about her supervisor. I would give a similar motivational talk and redirect the conversation, but it never seemed to work. It became apparent that gossiping about her supervisor was how Carrie connected to other people. And I decided I wasn’t going to be one of those people anymore.

The next time Carrie tried to strike up a gossipy conversation about her supervisor, I was more direct.

“I understand that you’re frustrated with your supervisor, but if you aren’t careful, it will be the only way you can connect with people at work,” I said. “You’ll basically be using people to listen to you vent about your supervisor.”

Carrie looked visibly uncomfortable, abruptly ended the conversation and totally avoided me after that. Even when I would speak in the hallway, she would mumble an unintelligible response and look past me.

We had no relationship unless I was willing to listen to her vent. We couldn’t be friends unless we shared a common enemy. In other words, we weren’t really friends.

My relationship with Carrie was based on emotional triangulation, something Edwin Friedman warns against in his book, “Failure of Nerve.” The common denominator in all triangulated relationships is that there’s some negative third pillar – some frustration or offense – that keeps the relationship together. And it happens more easily than we realize.

We find ourselves always venting about the same subject to a friend. We repeatedly share “prayer requests” that are really passive-aggressive ways of gossiping. It’s cowardly. We can’t deal with our own problems so we find other people who will take on our anxieties and offenses.

There’s nothing wrong with being transparent about our struggles when we talk with friends, but we just need to make sure it’s not the only thing we’re talking about. We’ve got to redirect ourselves and “[f]ix our thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise” (Philippians 4:8).

As we fix our thoughts on the true, honorable, right, pure, lovely and admirable things in the people around us, we’ll find less pleasure in sharing their weaknesses with others. We'll also be less interested in hearing other people spew negativity about others.

Breaking down triangulated relationships takes hard work. It requires us to find new ways to connect with others, and it might mean that we lose friendships that can't survive without the negativity to keep it going. Even so, we’ll gain the respect of real friends who will probably be grateful to have a relationship that’s based on something more than shared offenses.",The incredible reason my coworker stopped talking to me,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/for-human-connections-that-matter-focus-on-things-that-are-excellent-and-worthy-praise.html

Marsha Blackburn was blocked on Twitter Monday because of a statement she made in the spot about the sale of fetal tissue for medical research.

Blackburn, a Tennessee representative running to fill the retiring Sen. Bob Corker’s seat, said in the ad that she “stopped the sale of baby parts.”

Twitter told Blackburn's campaign in an email obtained by Fox News that the line was “deemed an inflammatory statement that is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.”

The line, in full, states: “I’m 100% pro-life. I fought Planned Parenthood, and we stopped the sale of baby body parts — thank god.”

The social media platform said it would run Blackburn’s ad if the statement in question were omitted.

She wasn’t blocked from tweeting it on her own account, and the campaign account tweeted the ad Monday afternoon, and asked users to retweet the message as a way to “join me in standing up to Silicon Valley.”

Blackburn was the chair of a Republican-run House panel created to investigate Planned Parenthood and fetal tissue research. The panel urged Congress to stop federal payments to the women’s health organization.

Following the receipt of a number of such messages by parents, local law enforcement and school authorities closed all schools in the district the following day. The authorities claimed that it was a difficult decision to make, but citing the safety of children as their number one priority, they felt it was necessary.

It was later discovered that there wasn't much credibility to the threats, following the revelation of a particular hacker group's involvement. The self-proclaimed ""thedarkoverlord"" group laid claim to the hack on Twitter,stating that it had led to more than 7,000 students staying home due to the threats.

The group later followed this message up with proof by releasing a local student directory, including the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of individuals.

Although the hack does raise concerns about the security of school networks, the purpose of it seems to have been more anarchic in nature than anything else. In a tweet that followed the release of the school directory, those claiming responsibility suggested that the directory could be used by sexual predators (via GrahamCluley).

While such an aim seems abhorrent, the motive for such a statement could be much more straightforward than it might otherwise seem. According to DataBreaches, other schools have also seen threats of violence against students, possibly in an attempt to get the FBI to ease off its investigation of the group. This is the same collective that previously blackmailed organizations like Larson Studios and Netflix.

Monday's ""most memorable year"" night showed Vanessa emotionally telling the cameras how she and husband Nick (who dances with Peta Murgatroyd) went through the scary premature birth of their third child, son Phoenix.



She underwent emergency surgery when her water broke at 29 weeks and their son was born early.



Vanessa recalled telling doctors at the hospital about her fragile little boy, ""Make him okay.""



Nick got choked up, saying in rehearsal footage about his son, ""I've never felt so helpless. There was nothing I could do.""



Phoenix recovered and is now healthy, and Vanessa considers 2017 the year their family was complete.



Vanessa and Maks performed a rumba on the show for a score of 24 out of 30 and the partners put controversy behind them. Radar Online and People had reported Maks didn't perform with Vanessa last week because they weren't getting along and had a personality clash. But Maks has merely cited ""personal issues"" as the reason for his absence.



Nick wound up in the bottom two with former NBA player Derek Fisher after sharing the happy year he got engaged to Vanessa.



The singer told reporters backstage about their baby being in an incubator, ""Thank God, our boy is completely healthy and fine but it's scary when you're going through it and I think there's a strength in sharing that… I was petrified.

""There's beeps and alarms… and tubes… It's a hard thing. But we leaned on each other. We got through it,"" Nick said.



He earned the night's lowest score, 22 for a contemporary dance with Maks' wife, Peta Murgatroyd. But at the end of the night, it was Derek Fisher who was eliminated.



The top score of the night, 29, went to ""Hamilton"" star Jordan Fisher (with Lindsay Arnold), who told viewers about the year he'd been officially adopted in 2005 by his grandparents after his biological mom ""struggled with substance abuse. She wasn't ready to be a mom.""



His proud parents cheered in the audience for his contemporary dance tribute to them.



And after the show, Jordan told Fox News, ""The woman who gave birth to me did -- and I'm grateful for that. [She] also gave me a template for what not to do in life, of which I'm also grateful… the story is what makes me who I am.""



Paralympian Victoria Arlen and Val Chmerkovskiy earned 27 for their foxtrot that showed how she recovered from paralysis. She doubled over in tears at the end of the dance.



Violinist Lindsey Stirling and partner Mark Ballas earned 26 points as she told viewers about the year her father died of cancer.



Ballas wore Stirling's father's actual hat and scarf in the touching Viennese waltz. She cried after the tribute to her beloved dad, who had taken a teaching job to earn enough money so that Stirling could take violin classes.



Stirling said to reporters afterwards, ""It's been a really heavy week. Mark has seen me cry so much… I didn't know it would be this hard to talk about it. But… my dad was here with me. I held it together pretty well.""



Drew Scott delighted the crowd when brother Jonathan of ""Property Brothers"" joined him to perform at the end of his jive dance with Emma Slater. Matching Vanessa, they earned 24.



Terrell Owens, Sasha Pieterse, Nikki Bella, and Frankie Muniz also walked away with 24 points.



While Muniz shared with fans the year he suffered memory loss, football player Owens paid tribute to 2012, the year his grandmother died after suffering from dementia.



They were two peas in a pod, Owens recalled to Fox News about the grandma who actually raised him. ""I lived in a relatively small town and people knew wherever she was, I was. We rode around on the go cart together.""

Waste pullouts are a secret weapon of the well-oiled kitchen machine. They do the dirty job of handling your garbage, recycling and more. In fact, among surveyed homeowners who are remodeling a kitchen and upgrading cabinets, the No. 1 storage addition is a pullout waste or recycling cabinet, according to the latest Houzz kitchen trends study. But what makes them better than a regular garbage can? Actually, a pullout bin can have quite a few advantages, both in style and function. Here are some reasons why a humble pullout cabinet for waste deserves a little consideration and a space in your kitchen.

Out of sight, out of mind. When you think about your dream kitchen, what do you imagine? I’ll bet the garbage bin is not the first thing that comes to mind. But then, this is the whole point of a waste pullout: It tucks the garbage, recycling and other waste bins out of sight but within easy access. That way you don’t have to look at a messy freestanding bin or struggle with a tiny, seemingly always full can tucked under the sink.

Seamless integration. Because a waste pullout is essentially just a very deep drawer, it can easily be integrated into the look of your cabinetry, bringing some great contemporary functionality to very traditional or transitional style.

In fact, it’s quite common for a pullout drawer to be faced out with multiple false fronts to help it blend more seamlessly into a cabinet scheme.

RELATED: Pick Out the Perfect Drawer Pulls

Ease of use. If you cook often, one of the trickiest and yet most common tasks is sweeping away the remnants from chopping. You can carefully carry a chopping board to the bin, or you can bring the bin to the chopping board. Locating your garbage or compost pullout below a chopping zone means you can sweep waste directly into the bin with ease.

Here’s another smart take on this idea: a pullout chopping block (in place of a typical drawer) positioned above a waste pullout, with a simple hole to allow for trimmings to be swept directly into the bin. A great option for small kitchens, as the whole chopping station can be closed away when not in use, and the main counter can still be used for other things.

Waste sorting. Pullout cabinets aren’t just useful for holding your garbage bins. More and more cities today not only facilitate recycling or composting, they also require some level of waste sorting, and this requires managing multiple bins.

Depending on the system you use, you can easily have space for two sizable bins, or many smaller ones, configured with one tucked behind the other in a full-depth cabinet, or side by side, or many other configurations to suit your typical needs.

Odor control. One major concern that people often have with waste bins is the odors that can linger in the kitchen. There are several possible ways to combat this issue, and one is by using compartments with individual lids for organic waste.

Some waste pullout systems even integrate a special bin with a securely sealing lid specifically to hold compost, so you don’t have to change it with excessive frequency just to keep odors in check. Keep in mind how quickly it will fill; you’ll want to plan ahead so that organic waste isn’t left sitting exposed to air for too long.

Another option is to put different types of waste into their own cabinets with appropriately sized bins so that you only have to open the relevant compartment at any particular time. You can devote more space for plastics and less for compost, or vice versa, depending on your needs.

All-in-one storage. If you want to make sure nobody has an excuse for not changing the bin when it’s full, try a drawer that includes a small storage drawer inside, and you can keep garbage bags and related products right by the bins themselves.

You can also use interior drawers to split compartments into smaller subcompartments or to keep cleaning products or deodorizers on hand.

A fit for any budget. Want a fully luxe look? For just a little extra investment, a system with side panels (which can be custom fitted by your cabinetmaker) will more fully cover the bins for a discreet look even while the cabinet is pulled open.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the budget spectrum, pullout systems integrated into a standard door cabinet can turn any underused space into a garbage pullout with room for multiple bins without a total renovation. Plus, for dexterous chefs, they can be pulled and pushed by foot to facilitate disposal even when hands are full.",7 reasons to consider pullout waste and recycling cabinets,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/08/03/7-reasons-to-consider-pullout-waste-and-recycling-cabinets.html

But Bilzerian fired back at Meyer, telling Fox News his critic is ""stupid.""

“I have video proof I wasn't running away,"" he said. ""...Just think about how stupid this guy has to be for him to say he thinks people should stand their ground when there is a mass shooting.”

The point is if people stood their ground there would be 6,000 people dead… unless you were there you have absolutely no right to judge or speak about what anybody did there.""

Meyer told Fox News that Bilzerian is “entitled to his opinion.”

“If me believing helping others should come before Instagram posts is ‘stupid’... you got me right,"" he said. “Say whatever you want to about me, I can’t say I would have changed the situation; I guarantee I would have been willing to give my life for people I didn’t know.”

Meyer posted a video on Sunday in which he appeared to challenge Bilzerian to a fight.

""Why don't we handle this like men?"" he says in the video addressed to Bilzerian.

During the video he added that Bilzerian should tell him ""when and where"" he'd like to come face to face. Meyer also claimed the social media star gave out the phone number of Meyer's wife, Bristol Palin. No currently available public posts on social media indicate that Bilzerian posted Palin’s information.



He said, “So I wake up this morning and I gotta tell you Dan, you wanted to get my attention? You got it baby, you got it. Here it is…. 'You wanna bring my family in this, you wanna put my wife in danger by putting her phone number out to people? You got your little friends trying to FaceTime her?”

Bilzerian posted several short videos of the scene at the Las Vegas massacre. In one clip, a horrified Bilzerian is heard narrating, “F--k, this girl just got shot in the f--king head... I [have] to go grab a gun. I'm f--king headed back. It's f--king so crazy — some kind of mass shooting."".

Many Black Lives Matter protests call for violence against police, with chants like 'What do we want?'","The 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has spawned a violent domestic threat from “black identity extremists” who have stepped up attacks on police, according to an explosive new report by the FBI’s counterterrorism division.

The warning, first reported by Foreign Policy magazine, says that “it is very likely BIEs proactively target police and openly identify and justify their actions with social-political agendas commensurate with their perceived injustices against African Americans ...”

Brown, an African-American 18-year-old, was shot in August 2014 after struggling with white police officer Darren Wilson. Although Brown's supporters claimed it was a deadly case of police brutality, Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and resigned in November 2014.

The shooting led to protests in Ferguson that then spread to other parts of the country. It gained added momentum after subsequent racially charged police shootings, spurred on via social media and the group Black Lives Matter.

The FBI report said that the agency previously had analyzed the potential for violence of black identity extremism, a term that was unfamiliar before it appeared in the document. What has changed, according to the report, is that violence has now actually occurred and is 'likely"" to continue.



“It is very likely that BIEs’ perceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement will inspire premeditated attacks against law enforcement over the next year,” the report said. “It is very likely additional controversial police shootings of African-Americans and the associated legal proceedings will continue to serve as drivers for violence against law enforcement.”

Attacks in which police officers are targeted have been on the rise in recent years. The most high-profile such incident occurred last year in Dallas, when a gunman named Micah Johnson hid in a parking garage and fired on 11 police officers, killing five of them, during a protest against officer-involved shootings. The FBI report noted that Johnson referred to anger over police shootings and toward whites as what drove him to kill the five police officers.

The FBI report drew accusations of racial profiling.

DeRay Mckesson of Black Lives Matter told The Guardian the terrorism report echoes the days when FBI tracked activist groups including the NAACP and those that opposed wars.

“We knew that we were likely being watched,” said Mckesson, a longtime critic of government monitoriing of protest groups. “This is confirmation that the work of social justice continues to threaten those in power.”

The Guardian also quoted an unnamed source it described only as a former senior official from the Department of Homeland Security saying that the category ""black identity extremist"" was troubling.

""This is a new umbrella designation that has no basis,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""There are civil rights and privacy issues all over this.""

But others say that the FBI is correctly sounding an alarm about a serious trend.

""It's not racial profiling, it's violence profiling,"" said Scott Walter, president of Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank, told Fox News. ""Identity politics can kill, whether it's white identity politics, which killed in Charlottesville, or black identity politics, which kills cops.""

""We have to be able to distinguish between free speech and violence,"" Walter said. ""[Many] longtime [black] activist groups were not obsessed with voilence.""



Randy Sutton, a former Las Vegas law enforcement official who now is the national spokesman for Blue Lives Matter, told Fox News that the FBI report makes official what he and others in police work have been observing in recent years.

""Nobody is saying anything negative about protests,"" Sutton said, ""Protesting is everyone's right. This is about commiting acts of violence. Many Black Lives Matter protests call for violence against police, with chants like 'What do we want?' and 'Dead cops!' It's terrorism, and it's no different than Islamic terrorism.""

Sutton said the rising number of ambush attacks on police has had a chilling effect on how they do their jobs.

""Police are not being as aggressive because of the political climate,"" he said. ""There's been a dramatic decrease in proactive policing.""",FBI cites black extremists as new domestic terrorist threat,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/10/fbi-cites-black-extremists-as-new-domestic-terrorist-threat.html

As bullets began flying into a crowd of country music fans, a pack of 300-plus people ran about a mile to the Las Vegas airport, where they kicked down chain-link fences, hobbled over razor wire and were briefly mistaken by security officials for being attackers instead of shooting victims.

Once they pushed past the fence at McCarran International Airport, some of them ran onto the tarmac as helicopters beamed searchlights toward people they assumed were intruders.

Airport authorities found people who were shot, bloodied and hysterical. Officials immediately halted air traffic, diverted two dozen flights to Phoenix and other cities and shut off some runway lights.

""I'm thinking to myself, I don't know if the airport police know what's going on yet,"" said Mark Gay, who was near the front of the crowd as it ran to the airport. ""We were running, running out of the dark. If the cops were on that side, they don't know who we are. So it was: 'Put your arms out when you're coming in.'""

The large-scale airport breach highlighted the chaos that ensued after gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire on Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel on a country music festival down below, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds. The breach also raised questions about the security of the McCarran International's perimeter as people were able to barge their way through the fences of one of the nation's busiest airports.

""I don't know that we ran across any breach that was comparable to this,"" said Jenny Grover of the Government Accountability Office, which audits the Transportation Security Administration and reviews the agency's security data. ""Because of the uniqueness of the situation, I'm not really sure when it changed from a breach to a relief effort.""

McCarran has had a large number of perimeter breaches in recent years. An Associated Press investigation found that McCarran had 30 known perimeter security breaches between 2004 and 2016, making it the second-most breached major airport in the country by AP's count.

Unlike other cities where the airport is on the outskirts, McCarran is located in the heart of Las Vegas. It's only a few hundred feet from Las Vegas Strip properties like the Mandalay Bay and Luxor.

In the chaos of the massacre, some panicked concert-goers headed to the airport in the belief that it provided the best opportunity for safety, even if they had to force their way through the perimeter. At the time of the shooting, rumors were flying around about active shooters and bomb threats at a number of Las Vegas casinos, so they chose to get to the airport.

""We were making the decision — we're headed to the airport. The airport seems like the most secure, safe place,"" said Fred Rowbotham, an off-duty police officer from the San Diego area who was in the crowd that went to McCarran.

As it became clear that the crowd on the McCarran tarmac was fleeing gunfire, the airport repositioned workers to help with the evacuation and shepherded hundreds of the victims into secure facilities. For hours, they tended to the wounded and offered food, water, blankets, phone chargers and reassurance. Airport shuttle buses later took them to a central evacuation center.

Allegiant Airlines said it sheltered more than 30 people who found themselves at the airline's 24-hour maintenance facility.

""A lot of them had torn clothing, cuts and bruises,"" airline spokeswoman Hilarie Grey said. ""We were able to provide plug-ins to charge their phones, help them contact their families and just provide a safe space for a group of people who were really frightened.""

Signature Flight Support, which caters to private planes, sheltered more than 130 people that night, some of them with gunshot wounds.

""A lot of them didn't know if they were still safe. They didn't know where they were going to go, and a lot of them were visitors who didn't know how to get to their hotels,"" said Rita Carrillo, the company's area general manager.

As concert-goers fled to McCarran and other locations on the Las Vegas Strip, controllers continued to warn pilots that the confusion on the runways caused by the shooting may affect arriving and departing flights.

""There is some personnel on one of the upper levels of the Mandalay Bay, so departing might be a bit dangerous,"" a controller told pilots, according to a recording posted by LiveATC.net. ""We may not be landing any more here for the next few hours.""

Reflecting how quickly the situation was changing, a WestJet flight that had been given permission to land was later ordered not to touch down.

""Actually, you know what? Continue the approach, but I don't want you landing. There's a situation on the runway,"" the controller said.

McCarran officials insist there wasn't a problem with security on Oct. 1 because in the end, the fleeing concert-goers were helped and the airport was never in danger.

""At the end of it, the security plan worked. Security is multiple layers, with one layer being breached, the next layers kicked in. For our purposes, the airport was secure,"" said Christine Crews, an airport spokeswoman.

As for Gay, the 53-year-old Anaheim, California, man somehow managed to keep his cowboy hat and flip-flops on during the race to the airport with the others, including his girlfriend and a pregnant woman.

""We're still trying to remember how many fences we actually knocked down,"" he said.

The $50 costume — like other unauthorized costumes — does not officially use “Stranger Things” in the title, but the likeness to Eleven, played by 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, is indisputable. Brown, as Eleven, appeared on the Netflix series wearing a blonde wig, a pink dress with a high collar, and a jacket. The character also had a fondness for frozen waffles. The costume, called the Upside Down Honey — a reference to the show's alternate ""Upside Down"" universe — consists of a blonde wig, a pink dress, a jacket and a waffle-shaped purse.

The model in the costume also suffered from Eleven's same affliction: a bloody nose.

The costume's pink dress, however, has been shortened significantly, and the high collar has been lowered. The tennis shoes Brown wears have also been replaced with tan pumps, though the shoes themselves are not included with the costume.

Karan on Sunday suggested to The Daily Mail that Weinstein’s alleged victims may have been ‘asking for it’ in a rambling interview that questioned the way women dressed and how they present themselves to the world.

The DKNY designer was in Los Angeles for the CineFashion Film Awards and told a reporter that, “'To see it here in our own country is very difficult, but I also think how do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women? What are we asking? Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality?

Meanwhile, among those weighing in were his longtime allies and beneficiaries Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet, Kevin Smith and Judi Dench. They spoke up with a combination of disgust over his alleged behavior and remorse or defensiveness over their own business entanglements with him. Even the actors’ labor union SAG-AFTRA joined the chorus in condemning the disgraced movie mogul, calling reports of his alleged conduct “abhorrent and unacceptable.”

Director Kevin Smith, whose movies “Clerks” and “Chasing Amy” were produced by Weinstein, noted on Twitter that the producer financed the first 14 years of his career.

“Now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain,” Smith wrote. “It makes me feel ashamed.”

Weinstein, 65, was fired Sunday by the Weinstein Co., the studio he co-founded, three days after a bombshell New York Times expose alleged decades of crude sexual behavior on his part toward female employees and actresses, including Ashley Judd. The Times said at least eight settlements had been reached with women.

Streep, who once called Weinstein “God” while accepting the Golden Globe for “The Iron Lady,” condemned his alleged conduct as “inexcusable” while also saying she did not know about it before.

“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported,” Streep said in a statement.

Stories of his behavior, she said, were not universally known in Hollywood.

“Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,” Streep continued. “If everybody knew, I don’t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.”

Similarly, Dench, whose awards and nominations have been inextricably linked for two decades to Weinstein, first at his company Miramax and then at the Weinstein Co., said in a statement that she was “completely unaware” of the “horrifying” offenses.

“I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out,” she wrote.

A crazed gunman took the lives of at least 59 people and injured more than 500 innocent country music fans at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night.

The tight-knit country music community immediately came together to commemorate those who were murdered and to stand behind the victims and their families.

Some of the industry's biggest stars like Keith Urban and Vince Gill performed at a vigil hosted by the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp and the Country Music Association drawing a reported crowd of 600 people on Monday night.

But it’s not recognized in Los Angeles, where I live. The City Council recently voted to get rid of Columbus Day and replace it with Indigenous Peoples’ Day, commemorating “indigenous, aboriginal and native people.”

This movement sees Columbus as a symbol of destruction, and thus not to be celebrated.

This new day was first adopted in Berkeley, California in 1992. Since then, it’s spread across the nation with increasing speed, as more than 60 cities from Maine to Washington have supported the idea.

While there is plenty to criticize about Columbus, and what followed his arrival, I think this movement is missing the point.

History, in fact, is the story of conquest. We may not like it, but it’s our shared heritage. Not just Europeans, but everyone. The point is not to excuse the worst that happened, but to understand it.

It is true that the conquest of the Americas by Europeans, which starts with Columbus, was very ugly, and involved a lot of violence. But that, for better or worse, is how history worked pretty much everywhere for thousands of years. (Though it should be noted a large portion of the deaths of Native Americans was due to disease, not violence--an inevitable consequence of Old World illness in New World soil. Europe, Asia and Africa, of course, suffered through numerous plagues of their own.).

History, in fact, is the story of conquest. We may not like it, but it’s our shared heritage. Not just Europeans, but everyone. While there is only limited knowledge of what pre-Columbus America was like, it did feature war, slavery, torture and plenty of brutality.

The point is not to excuse the worst that happened, but to understand it. And to see that it is not the essence of Columbus, but rather part of the times. With all that, there are reasons to celebrate Columbus Day.

-- Celebrate Italians (though there is some question as to whether Columbus would have considered himself an Italian -- he was long thought to have been born in Genoa, then an independent city-state in what is now Italy, though everyone from Greece to Portugal to Poland have claimed him as their own). Nevertheless, Italians claim him today and Columbus Day is a good chance to recognize what Italians have contributed to America, and the world.

-- Celebrate the spirit of exploration. It took tremendous bravery to sail off into the unknown. One of the best parts of our humanity is that sense of discovery.

-- Celebrate the spread of Western civilization. Lately a lot of people have been putting down Western civilization, but its spread is one of the greatest things that’s ever happened to humanity.

The West has its good and bad points, but its best ideas—equal rights, freedom of religion, free speech, due process, open scientific inquiry, property rights and so on—have helped all people who adopt them. (Not that the West solely had these ideas, but it put them in a package that wasn’t generally available elsewhere.)

Indeed, the promise of the West has delivered freedom and bounty such as humanity has never known.

And, while we celebrate Columbus Day, we can learn from history and also take time to honor Native Americans. They were the original immigrants to the New World, and deserve their remembrance.

Once we do this, Columbus Day can be a truly inclusive holiday. It needn’t be a battleground, but a chance to celebrate the best within us.",Why celebrate Columbus Day? Here are a few reasons,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/09/why-celebrate-columbus-day-here-are-few-reasons.html

""There will be a debate,"" added McVay, EVP of content and Programming for Cumulus Media and Westwood One. ""We'll know more in a couple of weeks how it's going to change.""

The debate has already started; Caleb Keefer, the guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival hours before the shooting occurred, spoke out in favor of gun control on Monday.

""I've been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life,"" Keefer wrote on Twitter. ""Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was...We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.""

Echoing Keefer's statements is the daughter of country music legend Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash, a longtime advocate for gun control, who penned an op-ed urging her fellow musicians to take action.

Cash said the National Rifle Association (NRA) ""funds domestic terrorism"" and country music artists associated with its group ""NRA Country"" must speak up against it.

""For the past few decades, the National Rifle Association has increasingly nurtured an alliance with country music artists and their fans. You can see it in 'N.R.A. Country,' which promotes the artists who support the philosophical, and perhaps economic, thrall of the N.R.A., with the pernicious tag line 'Celebrate the Lifestyle,'"" Cash wrote in the New York Times.

""That wholesome public relations veneer masks something deeply sinister and profoundly destructive.""

A rep for NRA Country did not return Fox News' request for comment.

Country star Luke Bryan seemed to want to keep the focus on the victims. When asked about the tragedy on ""Good Morning America"" Wednesday alongside his fellow ""American Idol"" judges, Bryan steered clear of politics.

Sunday, Trump took to trashing Sen. Bob Corker on Twitter.

Yes, Corker had earned Trump’s ire by complaining of the chaos that surrounds Trump, but Corker is not a club-of-one. Trump has lashed out at other senior Republican senators for saying far less. More ominously for Trump, his tantrums could even earn him a primary challenge, something no president wants.

Already, Trump has repeatedly bludgeoned Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for the sins of being a captured POW, and voting against repeal and replace. He also chivvied Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, for investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. In addition, Trump has criticized incumbent senators Jeff Flake and Dean Heller, who face primary challenges next year.

To be sure, little good can come from these attacks by Trump on members of his own party. At a minimum, they will not help advance Trump’s legislative agenda. On the other hand, they could help make New York’s Chuck Schumer the next Senate Majority Leader, and kill any chance of a tax cut, not exactly desired outcomes for the GOP.

Most of all, Corker let Trump and the world know that his take on Trump was widely shared by Senate Republicans.

With Korea, the Iran Deal, and tax reform all hanging in the balance, a different approach would have been in order. As a matter of political self-preservation, the president should not treat Corker as he does North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Unlike “Little Rocket Man,” Corker is legally eligible to challenge Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination.

With history as a guide, sitting presidents who weather primaries have a difficult time winning reelection, just ask Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush. To be sure, two years is a lifetime in politics, and Corker would likely lose, but not before he had bloodied Trump, and raised the odds against Trump’s reelection.

Already, Corker has let everyone know that he, like Trump, is someone who won’t back down, and for the record, Corker gave as good as he got. Responding with a Tweet of his own, Corker intimated that Trump was addled, saying “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.”

On Sunday night, Corker again took aim at Trump’s fitness and foibles. In Corker’s words, Trump had treated the presidency as a “reality show,” as if Trump were “doing ‘The Apprentice’ or something.” Most of all, Corker let Trump and the world know that his take on Trump was widely shared by Senate Republicans.

As Corker put it, “Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we’re dealing with here,” adding that “of course they understand the volatility that we’re dealing with and the tremendous amount of work that it takes by people around him to keep him in the middle of the road.”

Already, some are musing that Corker’s planned departure from the Senate is not the end of his political career. Recent news reports peg Corker as a possible candidate for governor of Tennessee in 2018, with speculation mounting that he might even wage a long-shot challenge against Trump in 2020.

And while Trump and Steve Bannon gloat over Corker’s refusal to run again, they would do well to remember that Breitbart’s own Joel B. Pollak, the website’s executive editor, has already threatened Trump with the prospect of a primary if he did not toe the line on immigration and populist orthodoxy. Pollak’s words, not mine.

As Pollak put it, the Republican Party could see “the emergence of a primary candidate from the right challenging Donald Trump.” It doesn’t get any clearer. And if Pollak can threaten Trump, why not Corker?

If -- and it’s a big if -- Corker takes a flier on the White House, he would do well to remember Davy Crockett, another Tennessean who stood his ground back in the day, the day being 1834. Crockett, then a congressman, confronted President Andrew Jackson, another Tennessean and a Trump favorite, over the continued removal of the Cherokee Indians from their homes.

Crockett also complained that Jackson was overstepping constitutional limits, and that his vice president, Martin Van Buren, would admiringly gaze up at the president as if he were king. It all sounds too familiar. History rhymes, even if it doesn’t repeat itself.

In the end, Crockett had his fill of Congress, lost his seat, and died fighting at the Alamo. Like Crockett, Corker understands patriotism sometimes requires speaking difficult and uncomfortable truths. Against this backdrop, both Corker and Trump should think hard about what comes next.",Does Bob Corker challenge Trump in 2020?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/09/does-bob-corker-challenge-trump-in-2020.html

I personally think he was sincere in thinking Frank needed to back away from the lawn mower.
My guess is that if this had taken place under former President Obama’s watch, Mr. Greenhouse would have refrained from said tweet.
I also have no idea if Mr. Greenhouse has boys of his own.
And I have no idea if he owns a lawn mower.","My pop, a WWII veteran, devoted husband and the sort of father I aspire to be, didn’t raise no fools. Except me.

I know I’m a fool because back when I was 9 years old and sporting a flat top and a pair of black Converse All-Stars, my pop advised me that I was now taking over the lawn mower duties from one of my older brothers. That brother was being promoted to the job of painting the house for the summer. So, head room being what it is, Pop handed the keys to the mower to his youngest boy.

Actually, no keys were involved. The mower was an old Sears model. For those of you too young to know your American history, Sears was the Amazon of the 20th century. Anytime between 1893 and ’round about 1985, if you wanted pants, a dishwasher, football pads, a lava lamp or a reciprocating sprocket wrench with detachable sprockets, then by damn you got it at Sears.

The lawn mower I inherited as a 9-year-old that early summer afternoon was a late-’60s gas-powered Sears model my brothers called “Chopper.” Chopper ate anything that got too close to its massive rotating semi-sharp blades. It belched smoke as clumps of grass, rocks and half-chewed army men flew out from all sides. As a 9-year-old, I calculated Chopper’s weight to be somewhere between 160 pounds and a two-door Buick. It took all 85 pounds of me, and about three hours, to push that beast around our yard.

Now I know Pop raised a fool, because when he announced solemnly that Chopper was my responsibility, I looked him in the eye and said what I typically said back then: “Yes sir… you bet.” What I should have said was, “Pop, I don’t mean to tell you your business, but do you have any idea how dangerous lawn mowers are to kids?” And then I would have handed him a couple of articles detailing those dangers, and for good measure recited current regulations related to child labor laws and how he just might be in violation of said laws.

Yes sir, that’s what I should have done. I know that now because that’s what former New York Times labor reporter Steven Greenhouse recently suggested following the curious case of Frank the Amazing Mowing Boy.

By now you’ve likely heard the heartwarming tale of Frank Giaccio, the 11-year-old kid from Virginia. Frank has himself a lawn mowing business. According to reliable sources, he charges $8 a lawn. I’m not that good at math, but I believe that’s approximately 8 clams more per yard than I made during my mowing career, so I think it’s safe to say that Frank is some kind of business genius.

Anyway, one day Frank reached out to the White House Office of Lawns and Shrubbery, which is overseen by the Department of Landscaping over at the Ministry of the Interior I believe, and said it would be his honor to mow the White House lawn. Apparently realizing the lawn in fact did need mowing, they reached out to Frank and Bob’s your uncle. I do not know if Frank was also tasked with picking up dog poop prior to mowing. That may well fall under a different department.

Bottom line, Frank got his wish, and by all accounts he did a very fine job mowing the White House lawn. President Trump came out to greet and thank him. In the video of the encounter, Frank almost looks too busy to stop and shake hands. Clearly he’s worried about keeping the mowing line straight. And to be honest, he probably had a couple more lawns to get to that day. And as if this story needed any more of a kick in the pants, Frank apparently told the president that when he grows up, he wants to be a Navy Seal.

I don’t know about you, but after my experience as a kid, and now as a father raising three young boys, I wanted to shake Frank’s hand and tell him well done, keep it up.

But then, Steven Greenhouse came along and rained on my freshly cut lawn. He sent out a tweet that read, in part: “Not sending a great signal on child labor, minimum wage & occupational safety.” Now there’s a good chance that all Mr. Greenhouse was doing was pointing out that children and lawn mowers can be a dangerous combination. He is, after all, a writer on a wide variety of labor topics.

I don’t believe he was making any statement about the need to teach kids responsibility and the value of hard work. I personally think he was sincere in thinking Frank needed to back away from the lawn mower. But, frankly, children and anything else can be a potentially dangerous combination. My boys Scooter, Sluggo and Muggsy could take a cantaloupe, two mini marshmallows and a feather duster and turn it into a deadly weapon. Just the other day, Muggsy broke his nose while using a cardboard tube as a pirate sword.

Given that I’m a bit of a cynical sort, there is also the chance that Mr. Greenhouse didn’t vote for the current president and saw this as an opportunity to creatively take a dig at him. My guess is that if this had taken place under former President Obama’s watch, Mr. Greenhouse would have refrained from said tweet. That’s just speculation, folks.

I also have no idea if Mr. Greenhouse has boys of his own. My research staff is off on another team-building exercise at an all-inclusive resort, and I can’t remember the Wi-Fi password in the office. And I have no idea if he owns a lawn mower. If he resides in New York City, another fact I can’t be bothered to check, there’s a good chance that he has limited experience with yard implements.

What’s my point? When I started writing, I was going to take an easy potshot at Mr. Greenhouse and talk about how we all spend way too much time coddling our kids and trying to reduce life’s risks down to zero, and how mowing lawns teaches kids responsibility and the value of hard work. But Mr. Greenhouse has already been lambasted for his tweet in social media circles … and I don’t have the energy to leap on that dog pile.

Speaking of dog piles, I can look out my kitchen window and see my boy Scooter picking up after our dog Hendricks in the back yard. Scoot’s only 10, but sitting inside the garage is a gas-powered mower with fairly dull blades, and it’s now become his responsibility.

Not to worry, Mr. Greenhouse, I gave him a safety briefing… told him to watch out for flying rocks and chewed-up action figures, advised him not to stick his fingers where they don’t belong and, when pushing it up hill, don’t let it roll back on you. It was the same briefing I got from my pop. Scooter listened attentively, and I’m proud to say his response was, “You bet.” He’ll be just fine.","Frank, the lawnmower boy, still has liberals all worked up.

After the report was published, Weinstein told the Times in a statement: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”

“We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting,"" a New York Times spokesperson said. ""Mr. Weinstein was aware and able to respond to specific allegations in our story before publication. In fact, we published his response in full.""

Weinstein later said he planned to sue the Times for $50 million.

On Sunday, three days after the Times' report, The Weinstein Company fired Weinstein ""effective immediately"" following the ""new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days.""

Here's what Weinstein has been accused of, based on recent reports.

Thursday, October 5

“Scream” actress Rose McGowan was paid a $100,000 settlement from Weinstein in 1997 following a hotel room incident. The settlement wasn't an admission of guilt, the paper described a legal document as saying.

The Times report also detailed how Weinstein, while in a bathrobe in his hotel room, had asked if he could give actress Ashley Judd a massage or the star could watch him take a shower.

""How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?"" Judd told the newspaper she recalled thinking.

In 1998, Zelda Perkins, a former production assistant with Miramax, confronted Weinstein, and told him to stop his “inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms,” The New York Times reported.

Perkins, now working as a theater producer in London, was reportedly concerned for other women working in the office, and threatened Weinstein’s behavior with legal action, according to former coworkers.

The Times reported that Miramax negotiated a settlement with Perkins and her lawyer, and Perkins declined to discuss what happened with the newspaper.

Emily Nestor, a temporary employee of Weinstein’s, said he’d made sexual advances to her as well, promising he’d help with her career, according to the report.

Additionally, the Times reported an incident with Weinstein and an unnamed assistant, who he reportedly tried to convince to give him a massage while he stood naked in front of her at a hotel, which left her “crying and very distraught,” according to a memo by Lauren O’Connor.

In O’Connor’s 2015 memo, in which she penned several accounts of women in the company and the atmosphere Weinstein’s advances created, she recalled how Weinstein would ask her to meet with aspiring actresses after they’d have meetings with him in his hotel room.

She wrote how she felt that she was being used to build relationships with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.”

Laura Madden detailed to the Times how Weinstein had asked her more than once for massages at hotels and how he would constantly make her re-evaluate herself after rejecting him.

“It was so manipulative,” Madden said. “You constantly question yourself – am I the one who is the problem?”

Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and actress, met with Weinstein at his office in New York’s SoHo neighborhood, the Times reported. But Battilana reportedly called the police hours later saying Weinstein had grabbed her breasts, while asking if they were real, and put his hand up her skirt.

Charges were ultimately not filed against Weinstein, and he and Battilana reportedly agreed to a settlement, according to an anonymous source who spoke with the Times.

Rebecca Traister, a reporter for The Cut, wrote how she encountered Weinstein while covering one of his book parties in early 2000. She claimed he screamed at her for a question she asked, calling her an obscene name.

When her boyfriend and colleague intervened and tried to get Weinstein to apologize to her, she said “Weinstein went nuclear.” He reportedly pushed her boyfriend down a set of stairs and dragged him out to the street in a headlock.

Traister said the altercation was later described as “a case of an aggressive reporter barging into a party she wasn’t invited to and asking impertinent questions.”

Overall, eight women detailed their alleged inappropriate interactions with Weinstein to The New York Times. The report alleges that various employees were asked to perform ""turndown duty"" for Weinstein, which included getting him ready for bed at night and also waking him up in the morning.

Friday, October 6

Fox 11’s Lauren Sivan on Friday detailed an alleged 2007 encounter with Weinstein in a HuffPost report. Sivan said that while working for local station News 12 Long Island, Weinstein cornered her in the hallway of a Manhattan restaurant closed to the public and masturbated in front of her.

Sivan said she had rejected an attempt by Weinstein to kiss her and told him she had a boyfriend. “Well, can you just stand there and shut up,” she claims he responded prior to allegedly masturbating.

“Luckily I didn't need a job or favor from him + didn't have to be polite,” Sivan tweeted Friday. “Others did. Keep that in mind.”

In another tweet, she said, “For those asking why I waited? YOU try telling that story 10yrs ago. Only possible now because of women with bigger names far braver than me.”

She later spoke about the alleged incident on Megyn Kelly’s NBC show Monday.

In a tweet which has since been deleted, “Shaun of the Dead” actress Jessica Hynes, now 44, recounted an alleged incident involving Weinstein, People reported.

“I was offered a film role at 19,” she reportedly wrote on Twitter. “Harvey Weinstien came on board and wanted me to screen test in a bikini. I refused & lost the job.”

Saturday, October 7

Former model Zoe Brock wrote in a blog post for Medium that in 1997, when she was 23, she was ""Harveyed."" Brock said she ""had no intention of leading"" Weinstein on, and ""felt safe in his company to be"" herself.

Weinstein allegedly tricked her into going to his hotel room, where she found herself with no phone and no cash. He appeared naked and asked her for a massage, she said, adding that she felt ""uncomfortable.""

Brock eventually, according to her blog post, got Weinstein to let her leave.

Sunday, October 8

The Wrap founder Sharon Waxman claimed in an article that while working for The New York Times in 2004, she “got the green light to look into oft-repeated allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein.”

Waxman said she was able to find the man in charge of Miramax Italy. Citing “multiple accounts,” she alleged that “his real job was to take care of Weinstein’s women needs, among other things.”

Waxman claimed she was able to find “a woman in London who had been paid off after an unwanted sexual encounter with Weinstein,” she recalled in her piece.

However, Waxman alleged that there had been “intense pressure from Weinstein,” with the article “gutted.”

“The story was stripped of any reference to sexual favors or coercion and buried on the inside of the Culture section, an obscure story about Miramax firing an Italian executive,” she wrote.

“Our former colleague Sharon Waxman wrote about a story that was published in The Times in 2004,” a Times spokesperson told Fox News. “No one currently at The Times has knowledge of editorial decisions made on that story. But in general the only reason a story or specific information would be held is if it did not meet our standards for publication.”",Harvey Weinstein sex scandal: Detailing the allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/10/harvey-weinstein-sex-scandal-detailing-allegations.html

“A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will Bench players who disrespect our Flag. ‘Stand for the Anthem or sit for the game!’”

Jones doubled down on his hardline stance Monday, telling ESPN reporter Chris Mortensen there will be “no exceptions” to his rule because players who disrespect the flag need consequences.

""(Jones) said there are no exceptions to this rule or this policy. Any player who disrespects the flag or does not stand for the anthem will not play in the game,"" Mortensen said. ""And if they want to notify the team before the game, hey I'm not going to do this, they can make them inactive. No exceptions -- he started naming Dak Prescott, Zeke Elliott. No exceptions, he said, there are no exceptions.""

Jones also cited a passage in the NFL Game Operations Manual that suggests how players act on the sideline when the national anthem is being played. Failing to act in a certain way could lead to fines, suspensions or even a team losing draft picks. Jones credited Trump with reminding him of that.

The NFL has said that the game operations passage is policy and not a rule and that it doesn’t plan to punish players over anthem protests.

Jones made his initial comments hours after Vice President Mike Pence left the game in Indianapolis early when several San Francisco 49ers players took a knee during the national anthem. It is the strongest statement any owner has made since Trump reignited the anthem controversy weeks prior.

“I know this, we cannot ... in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,"" he said following the Cowboys’ 35-31 loss to the Green Bay Packers. ""We know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we're clear.""

Dallas players have stood on the sideline, many with hands over their hearts, during the anthem ever since former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling last season in protest of what he believed were instances of racial injustice in the U.S.

Jones said showing respect for the flag and the anthem is more important to him than any potential issues of team unity.

""There is no room here if it comes between looking non-supportive of our players and of each other or creating the impression that you're disrespecting the flag, we will be non-supportive of each other,"" Jones said. ""We will not disrespect the flag.""

Jones said he wasn't aware of whether any of his players had raised a fist at the end of the anthem before the Green Bay game.

""I don't know about that,"" Jones said. ""But if there's anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then we will not play. OK? Understand? If we are disrespecting the flag, then we won't play. Period.""

Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross also said Sunday he changed his view on players kneeling for the national anthems and now wants all players to stand, the Miami Herald reported.

As she stretched, her son started lifting himself off of the floor coming into a baby version of a plank.

The 25-year-old decided to join her son and did a push-up every time he muscled his way up.

Hall’s sister recorded the video of the two of them working on their abs – Dreiling holds his plank for quite some time before lowering himself back to the ground.

By the time the pair quit, Dreiling had done four push-ups in a row.

When the video was reposted, comments swarmed in – mostly positive about Dreiling’s tiny feats of strength. However, some questioned whether the mom was pushing her baby to do a little more than he should be.

The black of night gave way to the purples and indigo of early morning. Bright-eyed foxes were surprised by our headlights.

We listened to the radio. I tuned into Fox Business on Sirius XM to get the latest headlines. They were grim. In Las Vegas, the death toll was mounting. Horror. Again.

“This is not what I expected we’d be listening to,” my husband said.

The Taconic Parkway rolled in front of us, gray fog still hugging blue hills, but what we saw in our minds’ eye was fresh blood smeared on the t-shirts of frantic survivors. We heard the stunned voices of those who had fled the concert; they sounded empty, exhausted. Soon, we would see the actual video, and the bodies dropping on black pavement. In those pictures, police scrambled for cover and a way to stop the massacre that would eventually claim 59 lives.

We still support each other in this country. And, people are still generous and eager to extend to a helping hand.

And, the old questions came back. Why this violence again? Where does it come from? How do we stop it?

I got to work that morning and went about my business. Then, an email from my husband. He said a woman named Maria left a message on our home phone line. She’d found my iPad, which I had inadvertently left at the commuter train station. My worry about my personal data seemed inconsequential compared to the Las Vegas tragedy. I had nearly forgotten it amid the bad news. But I revived at the message the iPad had been found and called Maria to make plans to pick it up that night. Our conversation was abbreviated. She had an Eastern European accent that was difficult for me to understand by telephone.

I drove up to her home which is not too far from mine, stopping first to pick up a bouquet to give her. I felt I should respond to her kindness with my own. A petite Maria answered the door and invited me in. The house was neat as a pin. A daughter sat in the kitchen, consumed by homework. It feels so normal, I remember thinking.

Maria handed me the iPad and overcome with gratitude I gave her a hug and told her not everyone would have done the same thing. “It’s the way my parents raised me, she said. I replied, “It’s good to remember that this week, in particular.”

I moved for the door to leave but Maria stopped me. “I don’t watch TV,” she said. “I looked you up. I’m sorry for your trouble.” By that, she meant the breast cancer I have been successfully fighting for the past year and a half. I hugged her again, this woman I never even knew ten minutes before. And, then, her eyes filled with tears. “My husband died of cancer,” she said. And then we were both crying and before I left we hugged a third time.

I am relieved and so grateful to have met Maria and visited her at her home. That experience, not the Las Vegas killings, is the new normal and the old normal. We still support each other in this country. And, people are still generous and eager to extend to a helping hand. Thank you, Maria, for reminding me of that.","Gerri Willis: Las Vegas one week later: Gratitude, a hug and a shared tear is the new normal AND the old",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/09/gerri-willis-las-vegas-one-week-later-gratitude-hug-and-shared-tear-is-new-normal-and-old.html

Previously a devoted pro football fan, Limbaugh told Sean Hannity that he did not watch Sunday's slate of games after hearing of the planned protests by players and vowed ""I'm going to be playing golf on Sundays now.""

The act of taking a knee during the pregame playing of the national anthem was started by then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick last year. Kaepernick said his action was a protest of racial inequality and police brutality.

President Trump brought the protests back into the national spotlight Friday when he asked the crowd at an Alabama rally, ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'get that son of a b---- off the field right now, out, he's fired?'""

The middle school’s health teacher assigned a quiz that defined 10 “sexual identity” terms, such as gay, lesbian, and transgender. The quiz required the sixth graders to identify and differentiate between various sexual orientations and identities, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.

One mother, Octavia Parks, was particularly shocked when her 12-year-old daughter came home with the assignment.

""Why are they teaching that in school?” Parks said. “What does that have to do with life?""

Parks felt that the material was not appropriate for school, and that her daughter was too young to learn about sexual orientation.

""We're talking about a sixth grader who still watches Nickelodeon,” Parks said. “I'm not ready to explain what these words are nor what they mean.""

Parks recalls an earlier conversation with the health teacher, during which she was assured that such material would not be taught.

""We had a brief conversation and she assured me that this sort of thing would not happen.” Parks said. “Nonetheless, it is happening.""

Now, Parks has signed a consent form to remove her child from the health class. She is not the only parent to find fault with the controversial quiz.

Eva McClain, the mother of a past Lithonia Middle School student, agrees that the material is inappropriate for school. She also said that the sexual orientation quiz was not part of the health class’ curriculum when her daughter was in school.

Vice President Mike Pence has been an Indianapolis Colts fan for quite awhile. He served the state of Indiana in Congress during the record-setting heyday of Peyton Manning. So it was unsurprising to find out that Pence planned to be at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis yesterday when the Colts officially retired Manning’s jersey and inducted him into their Ring of Honor during halftime of their game against the San Francisco 49ers.

But the vice president’s homecoming to honor the legendary quarterback was cut short when 15-20 players for the 49ers decided to disrespect the American flag, continuing their pregame publicity stunt by kneeling. Pence left the game and tweeted out his explanation:

“I left today’s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem…While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don’t think it’s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem.”

The reaction was largely predictable, with fans tired of the political posturing of overpaid sports stars applauding, and social justice warriors condemning. What was extraordinarily funny, however, was the way that the sports media humiliated themselves in responding.

The vice president stayed, stood, and honored the flag and anthem while it was performed. He chose not to stay and honor the players who disrespected that flag with his presence at their game – like countless other fans have done as well. This isn’t that difficult to understand.

Former CBS Sports writer and current Indy Star sports columnist Gregg Doyel, a card-carrying left-wing activist, immediately registered his disgust by cranking out an article suggesting that, “Mike Pence used the Colts to spray paint Donald Trump’s political graffiti.” His hyperbole got him an invitation to appear on CNN’s ""New Day"" with fellow leftist Chris Cuomo.

He was far from alone in his indignation, though. In fact, the entire Indianapolis Star staff, which has notoriously opposed and besmirched Pence for years, apparently saw their opportunity to issue a collective, coordinated strike.

Opinion chief Tim Swarens pushed out a column accusing Pence of demonstrating a lack of leadership. Sports writer Zac Keefer kept everyone informed how much per hour it cost taxpayers to fly Air Force 2, and whined that the, “Whole thing was planned.” But the most hysterical response went to their colleague Stephen Holder who quoted NFL reporter Mike Freeman’s tweet calling Pence’s action “pre-planned outrage” and “fake outrage,” adding, “Total publicity stunt IMO (in my opinion).”

Wait a minute. Holder (and Keefer, and Doyel), have fallen all over themselves applauding the publicity stunt of players taking a knee during the anthem for weeks now. Why are some publicity stunts more equal than others?

Local radio star Tony Katz, who fills in occasionally for nationally syndicated Dana Loesch, asked Holder to clarify whether it qualifies as a publicity stunt when players kneel. Holder’s response was choice:

“Probably to you, because you either aren’t listening to them or don’t care. Good day.”

Sorry, but that’s just too funny. I’m guessing Holder doesn’t even realize that the exact same thing can be said about his response to Pence: Holder either isn’t listening to Pence when he explains why he left, or he doesn’t care. The vice president stayed, stood, and honored the flag and anthem while it was performed. He chose not to stay and honor the players who disrespected that flag with his presence at their game – like countless other fans have done as well. This isn’t that difficult to understand.

According to Joe Antos, a scholar in health care at the American Enterprise Institute, low- and middle-income households are the least likely to have insurance and least likely to know how to avoid paying the penalty.

You can’t get to ‘yes’ unless you ask.

So, President Trump and Senate Republicans, as leaders sworn to protect the U.S. Constitution, please walk away from Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R).

The man does not believe in the basis of our democracy, the Constitution.

He once tried to order federal judges to ignore the law of the land and deny marriage licenses to gay couples. He says a Muslim should not be allowed to serve in Congress, simply because of his or her religion.

And in blasphemy that should send Republicans through the roof, Moore blames America for the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. He said they were God’s punishment for the nation’s “perverseness and oppression.”

Moore stands in a line of repugnant GOP candidates, such as former Missouri Rep. Todd Akin. As a candidate for Senate in 2012, Akin claimed that a woman's body is able to distinguish between “legitimate rape” and illegitimate rape, and shut down pregnancies from “legitimate rape.”

Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee, and the two top Senate Republicans, then-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and his number two, Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), called on Akin to get out of the race.

But last week Moore got a warm welcome from the head of the GOP’s Senate campaign committee, Sen. Cory Gardner (Colo.). “We support him in keeping this seat in Republican hands,” said Gardner.

The critical difference for Republicans between Akin and Moore is that the party does not want to risk seeing its slim 52-48 majority reduced by one with a possible year-end vote on tax cuts approaching.

Moore’s support for the tax cut is not certain. Cutting the deficit is his priority and the current Republican plan will do the opposite.

There is a bigger picture here, however. Surely the GOP has bigger fish to fry than depending on Moore’s vote in support of a tax cut?

Is a legislative victory so important that it justifies promoting authoritarian government?

Moore’s outrageous statements invite ridicule from fair-minded Americans in all parties who believe in the nation’s founding principles — specifically, that there should be no government-sanctioned religion.

But to laugh at Moore’s attempts to undermine the Constitution is to dismiss the dangers his rhetoric poses.

A recent Huffington Post article revealed the depth of concern:

“A dangerous demagogue,” is how Rev. Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State has described Moore.

Larry Decker, head of the Secular Coalition of America, a group that stays out of politics, felt compelled to make an exception and oppose Moore.

Decker said in a statement that Moore has repeatedly “flaunted his disregard for the Constitution” by asserting “religious beliefs must take precedence over the law.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based group, also points to Moore’s disdain for the Constitution and history of “basing judicial opinions on his Biblical beliefs.”

Richard Cohen, president of the law center, has called Moore the “Ayatollah of Alabama,” suggesting that Moore’s goal of replacing the Constitution with the Christian bible is comparable with the view of Islamic extremists who would replace civil law with Sharia law based on the Quran.

But the man who needs to take the lead in repudiating Moore is Trump.

Trump rode a populist tide of rage to win the White House. He opened the door to dark forces in our politics with his vulgar talk about grabbing women by the genitals, and demonizing immigrants and Muslims.

Now he is in danger of being swallowed by the same anti-government populist wave. If Moore wins, he will unleash a tide of Republican candidates for House and Senate seats who care nothing about democracy and have no skill at governing.

Their penchant for waging culture wars and attacking the rule of law will break down the party’s unity on Capitol Hill and make it impossible to gather votes to pass Trump’s legislative agenda.

Recall that Moore’s key support in the primary race came from Steve Bannon, the president’s former top advisor.

Bannon wants to break apart the Republican Party to increase his power as the leader of a populist rebellion.

Moore is his instrument for throwing the GOP into a downward spiral of chaos.

The latest polling from JMC Analytics has Moore at 48 percent support with Democrat Doug Jones at 40 percent. Former Vice President Biden visited Alabama last week to campaign alongside Jones in Birmingham.

Jones is well-known for his years of service as a U.S. attorney and for prosecuting the perpetrators of the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing in Birmingham.

Both parties — Republican and Democratic — have a moral obligation to do everything they can to ensure Moore does not get to the Senate.

That is why McConnell’s Senate Leadership Fund PAC spent $10 million to defeat Moore in the Alabama primary. Even Trump opposed Moore.

Now Trump, McConnell and the GOP are biting their tongues bloody because they are being told to be pragmatic and focus only on the possible loss of a Senate seat.

Donald Trump was the test case for this new era of shameless politics.

Trump energized dark forces in our politics. Now he has a special responsibility to bring them to heel.","Juan Williams: Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans, please walk away from Alabama's Roy Moore",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/09/juan-williams-mr-trump-and-senate-republicans-please-walk-away-from-alabamas-roy-moore.html

The company is considering the possibility of testing the drug for prevention or treatment of whooping cough.","A potential new drug might protect infants from whooping cough in their first few months of life, before they can be vaccinated, early research suggests.

In a new study, researchers gave this drug to baboons just after they were born, and found that the drug protected the animals when they were subsequently infected with the bacteria that cause whooping cough.

The study was presented here Thursday (Oct. 5) at an infectious disease conference called IDWeek 2017.

SURGEONS REMOVE RECORD-BREAKING TUMOR FROM PATIENT'S KIDNEY

Human infants are most vulnerable to whooping cough during their first two months of life — when they are too young to get the whooping cough vaccine. (Babies' immune systems are not mature enough to respond to the whooping cough vaccine until they are 2 months old.) For this reason, women are advised to get the whooping cough vaccine, called Tdap, during pregnancy, so that they can pass protective antibodies to the fetus before birth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

But not all pregnant mothers get the whooping cough vaccine — among U.S. women who gave birth between fall 2015 and spring 2016, less than half (49 percent) received the recommended vaccine, according to the CDC.

""It's hard to get 100 percent of all mothers vaccinated,"" said Jennifer Maynard, an associate professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, and lead author of the new study.

A potential solution to this problem would be to give infants a drug as soon as they are born that would protect them against whooping cough.

HERE'S HOW TO TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT OPIOIDS

Maynard and her colleagues investigated such a drug in their study. The drug contains an antibody — an immune system protein that binds to harmful pathogens to stop infection. In this case, the antibody, called hu1B7, binds to the toxin produced by whooping cough bacteria and renders the toxin harmless.

""It's essentially giving you instant immunity, as if the baby has been fully vaccinated,"" Maynard told Live Science.

In the new study, the researchers gave hu1B7 to seven baboons a few days after they were born, and compared them with another seven baboons who did not receive hu1B7. When the animals were later infected with whooping cough bacteria, called Bordetella pertussis, all of the baboons that received hu1B7 appeared normal, and didn't develop any symptoms of whooping cough. In contrast, the baboons that did not receive hu1B7 got sick, and four had to be euthanized, Maynard said.

The study was funded in part by Synthetic Biologics, a biotechnology company that is developing the drug with hu1B7. The study was also funded by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

Unlike a vaccine, hu1B7 antibodies don't provide long-term protection — the antibodies are degraded and cleared from the body after a limited amount of time, Maynard said. The hu1B7 drug has a ""half life"" of about 25 days in people, meaning that about half of the drug is cleared from the body in that time. But Maynard and colleagues have engineered a slightly different version of hu1B7 that doesn't degrade as quickly. Based on their animal studies, the researchers hypothesize that this altered version of hu1B7 would have a half life in people of 80 to 100 days.

If this turns out to be true, ""then you could give one dose and it could really protect [infants] for that whole period during which babies are most susceptible,"" Maynard said.

The next step is to conduct a trial in humans to see if the findings from the animal studies hold true in people. Synthetic Biologics has an ""orphan drug"" designation for its drug, which allows the company to move forward more quickly with a human trial, Maynard said.

An earlier study by Synthetic Biologics also found that hu1B7, combined with a second antibody called hu11E6, was effective at treating Bordetella pertussis infection in baboons. The company is considering the possibility of testing the drug for prevention or treatment of whooping cough.

According to the NJ.com, New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection gave permission for the annual six-day bear hunt throughout eight different counties, as a means to help control the areas’ bear populations. A separate six-day hunt will take place in December, as well.

Last year’s hunt pulled in a record 636 bears after both six-day hunts were completed, according to reports. The Department of Environmental Protection estimates that there are currently 2,800 more in northern New Jersey.

Hunters taking part in the six-day hunt are currently only allowed to use arrows to take down the bears, but muzzle-loaders will be allowed starting on day four. The December hunt will also allow for shotguns, the New Jersey Herald reports.

Animal rights activists and critics, meanwhile, argue that the bi-yearly hunts are unnecessary to control the state’s bear population.

The Herald reports that protesters have been gathering near a check-in station for hunters every year since the bear-hunting program began in 2010.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic nominee for New Jersey governor, is also a vocal opponent of the state's annual hunt, and once said he would place a ""moritorium"" on the practice if he were to be elected, SNJToday reported.

“Pauli Murray represents the best of Yale: a pre-eminent intellectual inspired to lead and prepared to serve her community and her country,” Yale President Peter Salovey said in April 2016.

According to the school, Murray also helped organize the March on Washington with Martin Luther King, Jr. and was appointed by former President John F. Kennedy to the Committee on Civil and Political Rights of the President’s Commission on the Status of Women.

Republican lawmaker, Sen Joel Anderson, reportedly voted against the bill.

General Motors is developing a self-driving pack animal. Correction: self-driving pachyderm.

The SURUS borrows its name from a legendary elephant that helped Hannibal cross the Alps and turns it into an acronym that stands for Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure.

It’s a flatbed truck without a cab that’s equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain and fully autonomous driving capability.

GM is pitching the zero-emissions vehicle as both a commercial cargo carrier and military supply truck that can stealthily operate in warzones without putting troops at risk.

The platform features an electric powertrain at each end of the vehicle that gives it four-wheel-drive for off-road capabilities and four-wheel-steering to improve its maneuverability in tight spaces.

A cab for a human driver and passengers can be attached to help lead several of the vehicles wirelessly linked in a virtual train.

Instead of loading it with gear or containers, modules outfitted as mobile hospitals or for other functions can potentially be attached.

GM says SURUS has a range of 400 miles per fill up of the hydrogen tanks built into the chassis, and can be used to generate power and produce water from its exhaust in remote locations.

The project follows the creation of a fuel cell-powered Colorado pickup called the ZH2 that is currently being tested by the U.S. Army’ Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC.)

Fuel cell powertrains are nothing new to General Motors. It's spent billions on them since it unveiled the Autonomy concept in 2002, which was a hydrogen-powered chassis that was envisioned to work with different bodies, much like a passenger car-size version of SURUS.

The vehicle also brings to mind the ‘Autotrucks’ conceptual designer Nick Pugh created for the film ‘Logan’ starring Hugh Jackman.

Pugh’s idea was to separate the drivetrain into independent twin-axle pods that could travel in tandem to a loading area and pick up a shipping container at either end. They were a menacing and memorable element of the blockbuster, which was set in the year 2029.

SURUS could be on the road, or at least lugging stuff around battlefields and worksites sooner than that. General Motors is in talks to provide TARDEC with a SURUS for an evaluation, and is working toward putting autonomous vehicles into production within a couple of years.

More than 200 people were hurriedly evacuated from two Santa Rosa hospitals threatened by wildfires that bloomed overnight.","Authorities in Northern California late Monday said there were at least 11 dead and more than 100 reported missing in wildfires raging through much of the state's wine country.

Scott Alonso, communications director for Sonoma County, said family members have been reporting those missing in calls to a hotline in the county. He said it is possible that many or most of the missing are safe but simply can't be reached because of the widespread loss of cell service and other communications.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the fire has consumed another 2,000 acres since Monday afternoon and is now at 27,000 acres. The 14 fires destroyed at least 1,500 homes.

Andy Luttringer, who lives in Santa Rosa, looked at the damage to his home of nearly 20 years. He told the paper that he regretted not grabbing more of his wife’s artwork. His wife died of cancer a few years ago.

“I’m really mad at myself,” the 62-year-old retired cop told the paper. “I could have grabbed a couple of her pieces. The rest of the stuff I couldn’t care less about.”

At least 100 people have been injured in the wildfires.

St. Joseph Health said 100 patients have been treated, most for smoke inhalation, at two of its hospitals, Santa Rosa Memorial in Santa Rosa and Queen of the Valley Medical Center in Napa.

Those hospitals took on the majority of patients with other hospitals in the area evacuated because of the fires.

Two of the injured are critical. One has been transferred to a burn center with significant injuries. Fifteen of the injuries are described as moderate and the rest are minor.

Chris Thomas, 42, from Kirkland, Wash., who was visiting Napa with his wife, Marissa, for a wine-tasting trip, told The Chronicle that he was awakened by a fire truck’s loudspeaker ordering them to leave.

“It was surreal,” Thomas said. “When I started loading stuff into the car, it was a hell-storm of smoke and ash. There were 30- to 40-mph winds. I couldn’t even breathe, so I ran back to the unit to get Marissa. It was so smoky I went to the wrong unit. When I found her I said, ‘Forget it, let’s just go.’ It went from being an annoying evacuation to something really scary.”

Former San Francisco Giants pitcher Noah Lowry and his family were among those who had to flee from the ferocious series of wildfires in Northern California.

Lowry said that he, his wife, his two daughters and his 2-week-old son had to leave their home in Santa Rosa in a matter of minutes as the flames approached. Lowry said he ""can't shake hearing people scream in terror as the flames barreled down on us.""

He said he ran into a closed U.S. 101 freeway because the flames had jumped it. But he and his family were able to get away in time and get to a friends' house where they are staying.

Vice President Mike Pence said during a visit to California that the federal government stands ready to provide any and all assistance to the state. Pence said, ""We are standing with you.""

Authorities have imposed a sunset-to-sunrise curfew in the city of Santa Rosa and say they are on the lookout for looters as firefighters battle the blazes. Acting Police Chief Craig Schwartz said the curfew will be enforced in a mandatory evacuation zone, with violators possibly subject to arrest.

California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties because of wildfires that the governor says are threatening thousands of homes.

Brown issued the declaration on Monday, as multiple fires forced people to evacuate their homes.

More than 200 people were hurriedly evacuated from two Santa Rosa hospitals threatened by wildfires that bloomed overnight.

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Director Ken Pimlott says an estimated 20,000 people have been evacuated. He called the estimates of destroyed structures very conservative.

Pimlott said most of the fires started at about 10 p.m. Sunday and their causes are under investigation.

The Napa Valley Vintners association says most wineries were closed Monday because of power outages, evacuation orders and the inability of employees to get to work.

The trade association said Monday that it does not have verifiable information on winery buildings that burned down or the impact the fires would have on the 2017 harvest.

Workers had picked most grapes for the season before fires broke out.

The wind-driven wildfires came as Napa and Sonoma counties were finishing highly anticipated harvests of wine grapes. Workers on Monday should have been picking and processing the ripe grapes that would make chardonnay and other wines.

At least two wineries were destroyed and many others damaged.

More than 5,000 Southern California homes were evacuated Monday as fire crews struggled to battle a rapidly growing brush fire.

The blaze has scorched 6,000 acres and destroyed dozens of structures in Orange County.

Plumes of smoke were visible over Disneyland and officials issued air quality warnings for parts of Los Angeles County.

An Anaheim police spokesman says there is no containment so far.

Bruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West’s Mallory Square as a “reclamation party” got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.

“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”

The legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.

Harris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”

Residents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.

The eruption of vampire-driven vigilante violence in the African nation came after rumors surfaced in September that real-life bloodsuckers were creating havoc. Those reports prompted the formation of lynch mobs who've accused people of vampirism, according to a U.N. Department on Safety and Security report obtained by Reuters.

“These districts have severely been affected by the ongoing stories of blood sucking and possible existence of vampires,” the agency said regarding districts in the southern part of the country.

The report said roving mobs searching for vampires have been mounting road blocks, raising security concerns for U.N. workers.

The Acting U.N. Resident Coordinator, Florence Rolle, told Reuters in an email “some U.N. staff have relocated while others are still in the districts depending on locations of their operations,” but Rolle did not provide specific numbers of relocated workers.

The rumors of vampires may have originated in neighboring Mozambique, according to the U.N. report, which recommended the “temporary suspension of U.N. activities in the area until the situation is normalized.”

The president of Malawi said the reports of mob violence over vampire fears were “distressing and agonizing.""

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Director Ken Pimlott said an estimated 20,000 people have been evacuated as 14 large fires are zero percent contained. The fires are burning throughout an eight-county swath of Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties.

At least 10 people have died as a result of the burning wildfires, officials said Monday night. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office tweeted that seven deaths were reported in Sonoma County.

The California Fire Public Information Officer tweeted that two people are confirmed dead in Napa County, in addition to one death in Mendocino County.

Other fatalities are expected, according to Pimlott, but damaged areas are difficult to assess as the fires continue to burn.

More than 100 people were treated for burns and smoke inhalation from the raging fires, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The city of Santa Rosa has enacted a curfew from sunset until sunrise in mandatory evacuation zones. People in those evacuation zones will be subject to stop, and potential arrest if they refuse to leave those areas, officials said.

During the curfew period, authorities will be looking for looters, the Acting Police Chief Craig Schwartz said.

""Right now with these conditions we can't get ahead of this fire and do anything about the forward progress,"" Napa County Fire Chief Barry Biermann said at a news conference.

A spokesperson for Pacific Gas and Electric told The Associated Press that 114,000 customers were without power.

The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said there were multiple fires reported around the county, including a ""very large fire"" that jumped a freeway and spread into the east side of Santa Rosa.

Multiple fires broke out Sunday night as strong winds buffeted the area. Emergency lines were inundated with callers reporting smoke in the area, prompting officials to ask that the public ""only use 911 if they see actual unattended flames, or are having another emergency.""

The Tubbs Fire between Santa Rosa and Calistoga alone grew from 200 acres to 20,000 acres by Monday morning, CalFire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox told KTVU.

Cal Fire Deputy Chief Scott McLean called the conditions ""very volatile.""

""People need to be careful,"" McLean said.

Belia Ramos, chairwoman of the Napa County Board of Supervisors, said officials did not yet have a count on how many properties were affected, either by the fire directly or by evacuations.

""We're focusing on making evacuations and trying to keep people safe. We are not prepared to start counting. Certainly with day just breaking now, we are starting to see the structures that are affected,"" she said shortly after sunrise.

""The gusts are very, very — they're tremendous and it's what makes this fire unpredictable. It's something that we're having to be very cautious about,"" she said.

Downed trees were blocking parts of one rural road and fires were burning on both sides of Highway 12 as gusts reached up to 60 mph.

“The winds picked up to 40-plus miles per hour probably, very windy, and it changed direction and it headed straight down the valley floor,” Napa resident and Ranch Markets owner Arik Housley told “FOX & Friends.”

The fires were also near some wineries in the famed Napa Valley. It was not immediately clear if the Francis Ford Coppola Winery was affected by the ferocious blaze, but some wineries on Silverado Trail had some damage.

Windsor Fire Chief Jack Piccinini told the Associated Press that nearly every one of Sonoma County's fire resources is being used, but it is not enough.

""Everyone in Sonoma County is spread out fighting these fires, but they don't have enough resources to handle something like this. The only thing we can do is hope the wind will come down,"" he said.

Community centers, the Sonoma County Fairgrounds and other local centers have been opened for evacuees.

""It was an inferno like you've never seen before,"" said Marian Williams, who caravanned with neighbors through flames before dawn as one of the wildfires reached the vineyards and ridges at her small Sonoma County town of Kenwood.

Williams told the AP she could feel the heat of fire through the car as she fled.

""Trees were on fire like torches,"" she said.

Fires also burned in Yuba, Butte and Nevada counties — all north of the state capital. Cal Fire tweeted that as many as 8,000 homes were threatened in Nevada County, which lies on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.

The National Weather Service issued a warning of dangerous conditions that could lead to rapidly spreading wildfires, which goes until early Tuesday. The fires created thick smoke in San Francisco, 60 miles south of the Sonoma County fire.

Some passengers are complaining about the unscheduled delay on social media. Carnival spokeswoman Christine De La Huerta says the ship has plenty of provisions, and it's meandering in the Gulf while awaiting the reopening.

Officials have to survey the ship channel and make sure navigational markers are in place after a storm. A spokeswoman with the Alabama State Docks says the Coast Guard reopened the port with restrictions on Monday.

The ship has a total guest capacity of 2,056 people and carries a crew of 920. The ship departed Mobile on a five-night Caribbean trip on Oct. 2.

Nate caused relatively little damage in Alabama, but it could still take days to deal with the storm's worst effects.

On Dauphin Island, Mayor Jeff Collier said workers were using heavy equipment Monday to remove as much as 6 feet of sand that washed across a more than 3-mile stretch of the island's main road and more than 20 side streets.

Collier says Nate ""moved the beachfront on to the roadway,"" and neither power company nor city water workers can begin repairing damage until the road is clear.

To the east, at Gulf State Park, waves from the storm washed out removable flooring panels on a more than 1,500-foot-long fishing pier that was rebuilt after being destroyed by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Workers were replacing the panels Monday with a goal of reopening the pier in time for the National Shrimp Festival, which opens Thursday in nearby Gulf Shores.

Nate slogged its way across the U.S. East Coast on Monday, dumping heavy rains and bringing gusty winds to inland states as a tropical depression, a day after Hurricane Nate brought a burst of flooding and power outages to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Nate spared the region the kind of catastrophic damage left by a series of hurricanes that hit the southern U.S. and Caribbean in recent weeks.

Nate — the first hurricane to make landfall in Mississippi since Katrina in 2005 — quickly lost strength Sunday, with its winds diminishing to a tropical depression as it pushed northward into Alabama and Georgia with heavy rain.

When I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and told I would probably be dead in four months, I went in an instant from living the American Dream with my wife and son to living a nightmare. In that moment of depression, I might have chosen to end my life.

After a seizure sent me to the hospital, the neurosurgeon told me I had a brain tumor known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and that the tumor was inoperable. In fact, three different doctors told me there was nothing that they could do.

The news was overwhelmingly depressing. As a United States Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq War, I could have lost my life on a faraway battlefield serving my country. Thankfully I survived, but I had now received a death sentence at home.

With the support of my family, I chose to fight the cancer. I have had some great success with an experimental, cutting-edge treatment and am still alive three years after I was told I had only a few months to live.

Not everyone is so lucky to have the support I do. Since my diagnosis of terminal brain cancer my wife and I welcomed our second son into the world. I would have missed out on so much if I had been given – and had accepted – the option of assisted suicide.

Assisted suicide laws require a prognosis of six months or less to live, but how can we let our life-and-death decisions rest on these prognoses, when even the most experienced doctors are often wrong? My own experience reveals how tragic that could turn out to be.

We also know from the 2016 Oregon Health Report that in Oregon, which 20 years ago became the first state to make assisted suicide legal, only 4 percent of patients considering ending their lives were referred for psychological evaluation.

Yet a 2008 study, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ, revealed that 25 percent of patients requesting assisted suicide suffered from major depressive disorder. These numbers suggest that people with mental illness could well be prescribed a death-too-soon, instead of the treatment they deserve.

On top of that, the legalization of assisted suicide injects government and profit-driven insurance companies into everyone’s end-of-life decisions. Just in the last year, more cases have surfaced of patients being denied coverage for care, showing how legalizing assisted suicide results in more abuse and less choice.

Take, for example, Stephanie Packer, a California mother of four suffering from a serious case of scleroderma, a chronic connective tissue disease. She reported that her insurance company denied her coverage for chemotherapy treatment but would pay for her to kill herself.

Then there is Dr. Brian Callister, a Nevada physician who asked insurance medical directors to approve lifesaving, curative treatments for a patient in California and another in Oregon – two states that have legalized assisted suicide. Callister’s requests were denied, and the patients were offered coverage for suicide drugs instead.

People are starting to realize the threat that assisted suicide poses. Though an onslaught of new bills has been introduced, 23 states have rejected laws designed to legalize assisted suicide this year.

And states like Alabama and Ohio recently enacted laws to strengthen the prohibition of assisted suicide. Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.

Some vulnerable populations, like people with disabilities and terminal illness, are at more immediate risk to be adversely affected by the legalization of assisted suicide. But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch.

But that’s not the world I want. I want to teach my kids to fight for more. I want my friends to find ways to focus on the good. I want my colleagues to create beautiful works that can brighten some dark place. And I am not alone. Most of us believe that the goodness in the world far outweighs the bad. This is not to minimalize the severity of what we see in the news, it is unbelievable, unacceptable and despicable. But, in this world, we have to keep a true perspective that people wish for better. That they wish for goodness.

""I don't know who this man was but I do believe that God sends all kinds of people to our lives who have the ability to share something as simple as a smile.""

Let’s give ourselves permission to still see the good in others. Let’s focus on the simple acts that change our day or perspective. Let’s notice the gentleman holding the door while we struggle with our groceries. Or the bus driver who waits a few extra minutes for the mom who is running late to meet her kindergartener. Or the stranger who pulls onto the side of the road to help change a tire. Or the teenager who steps in to stop a bully. Or someone who offers a tiny gesture of encouragement.

A friend recently shared a story with me about a stranger who offered encouragement that changed everything. She said:

It was my first day back to work after a 12-week maternity leave. I was headed to drop off our baby girl for her first day of daycare. I was a wreck. My emotions were all over the place and I was questioning both our decision for me to return to work as well as the daycare we had chosen back when I found out I was pregnant.

It was early morning on a Monday in January, 2000. I remember it vividly. I was at a two-lane stoplight waiting for the light to turn red when a truck pulled up beside me on the passenger side of my car. The tears were running down my face and I remember praying that this would all be okay. As the truck stopped I glanced through the passenger side of the window and a kind man locked eyes with me and gave me a smile that still resonates in my memory. I don't know who this man was but I do believe that God sends all kinds of people to our lives who have the ability to share something as simple as a smile. Of course, I was still emotional and heartbroken to leave my baby, but I knew God would be with her just as He was with me.

By changing our perspective we have the power to change everything. I am allowing myself, and invite you to join me, as I search for ways to concentrate on the good. It won’t be easy--we are programmed to zero in on the negativity. It’s going to take work and discipline to walk away from conversations that bring us down. It’s going to require a new mindset.

I am up for it. Who is with me?",I won't let Las Vegas shooting change my mind. People are good,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/09/wont-let-las-vegas-shooting-change-my-mind-people-are-good.html

The outspoken UFC president went after the country singer for opting to perform on ""Saturday Night Live"" over singing the national anthem at UFC 216 in Las Vegas this weekend.

""His image was more important then coming back to Vegas and playing for the people who are his fans and who got shot watching him play,"" White told TMZ. ""F--k you Jason Aldean. Stay out of Vegas.""

Aldean performed Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" on ""SNL"" as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas last week that claimed the lives of 58 people.

A rep for Aldean had no comment.

The country singer, who was performing onstage at the festival when the shooting began, also returned to Vegas this weekend with his wife to meet with those injured by the shooting at two different hospitals.

Before performing Petty's hit song on ""SNL,"" Aldean addressed the audience saying, ""Like everyone, I’m struggling to understand what happened that night and how to pick up the pieces and start to heal. So many people are hurting. There are children, parents, brothers, sisters, friends. They’re all part of our family.

""So I want to say to them: We hurt for you. We hurt with you. But you can be sure that we’re gonna walk through these tough times together every step of the way. Because when America is at its best, our bond and our spirit – it’s unbreakable.""

The 31-year-old actor confided on camera that he’s suffered nine concussions and several ""mini-strokes"" and the effects have been so bad that he can't even remember being on his hit sitcom ""Malcolm in the Middle.""

""It makes me a little sad. Things pop back into my mind I should have remembered,"" said Muniz, who is also a race car driver and has endured several crashes.

Muniz's ""Malcolm in the Middle"" co-star Bryan Cranston told ""DWTS"" cameras, ""I will tell him, 'Remember this? Remember that from 'Malcolm'?""

The sitcom ran from 2000 to 2006 and Muniz elaborated to reporters backstage with dance partner Witney Carson by his side that his memory loss ""is long-term.""

""It's something I never really talked about…It's just my life but we were talking about 'Malcolm' and how it started and I don't really have memories of being on the show. My memory of being on the show is seeing the episode[s],"" he said.

Muniz said his memory loss is ""a weird thing"" that has happened ""over the last ten years.""

""My mom was with me while I was doing 'Malcolm' and stuff, she'll bring up things or trips we went on or big events that you would think I'd remember --and it's a new story to me,"" he said.

Although racing is a dangerous sport, Muniz said of his memory loss, ""I don't know what the cause of it is. It's not something I've looked into. It's just how my brain is, so I thought that was normal. I didn't know I should remember going to the Emmys.""

The former child star reflected, ""My whole life from when I was eight until now has been literally non-stop….maybe it's because I had to remember so much, even lines…I didn't really take them in.""

Surprisingly, Muniz told Fox News he hasn't consulted any doctors about his memory problem: ""I'm not a doctor person. Every time I go to the doctors, they tell me I'm just crazy,"" he laughed.

But the star's devoted girlfriend, Paige Price, helps Muniz with his memory by keeping a journal of events for him.

Muniz said, ""I get sad of the thought of losing the memory because I know that I do, so she writes literally in detail, she's a writer, a journal so I can look at any day and it does bring me back. She's very supportive.""

Meanwhile, dance partner Carson is happy that Muniz's short-term memory is fine, so he can remember the steps.

“The Big Lie” by Dinesh D’Souza claims to expose the “Nazi roots of the American left,” but Rogen took to Twitter on Aug. 13 to ask Costco, “Why do you sell books that compare left wing people like me to Nazis?”

Liberal writer Kurt Eichenwald even defended D’Souza, calling him a “liar” who has free speech rights to “spin his drivel.”

Rogen responded, “I'm not saying they ban him or imprison him or fire him from whatever his job is. Just surprised they sell his sh-- next to tubs of yogurt.”

D’Souza quickly responded himself, “Don’t call a book sh-- without reading it. If you do, I’d honestly like you to tell me what I got wrong.”

The two-month old tweet gained attention on Monday when media analyst Mark Dice chimed in, “Look at this Hollywood Libtard acting like a Nazi trying to get a book banned. What's next Seth? Burning them?” Dice’s comment resulted in his loyal followers poking fun at the “Knocked Up” actor, and has been retweeted and liked over 3,000 times.

“He’s upset at being compared to a Nazi but has no problem comparing right wing people Nazis,” one user wrote, while another said, “Because Seth Rogan [sic] left wingers are socialists. The Nazis were socialists. You see the connection?”

Dice’s presumably conservative followers piled on, with one writing, “He hasn’t read the book! They all run their mouths without a clue. Hollyweirds think normal people think like them. No we think for ourselves,” and another saying, Rogen “should probably stick to smoking pot and making unfunny movies. Leave the political commentary to the professionals.”

Rogen is an outspoken liberal who offers his opinions via Twitter on a regular basis. On Monday he retweeted a photo mocking Stephen Bannon and defended women accusing movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment over the weekend.

“I believe all the women coming forward about Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment. It takes bravery to do so,” Rogen wrote.

Tittle died at Stanford Hospital. The cause of death was not immediately known.

Tittle played for the Baltimore Colts, San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants in a 17-season career from 1948 to 1964 during which he played in seven Pro Bowls. He tossed 242 touchdowns, leading the league three times, in 1955, 1962 and 1963.

Yelberton Abraham Tittle was born Oct. 24, 1926 in Marshall, Tex. He became a star for LSU before he was selected with the sixth overall pick of the 1948 draft by the Detroit Lions.

Tittle was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971.

Tittle never won a championship, but came to personify the competitive spirit of football, thanks to an iconic photo taken by Dozier Mobley during Tittle's final season in 1964.

The frame caught the then-37-year-old quarterback, who looked older than his years, after throwing an interception returned for a touchdown by Pittsburgh's Chuck Hinton. Tittle is seen kneeling in exhaustion and pain from an injured rib, blood dripping down his face from a head gash.

Tittle, also called ""YAT"" by his teammates, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. He threw 36 touchdown passes while winning the MVP award in '63, and held the NFL record for most TD passes in a season until Dan Marino threw 48 in 1984.

Tittle passed for 33,070 yards and 242 touchdowns in two leagues during his career, including 13 300-yard passing games in an age when the running game dominated the sport. Tittle was the only quarterback of his generation to throw at least 30 touchdown passes in back-to-back seasons when he did it with the Giants.

Born Yelberton Abraham Tittle in Marshall, Texas, on Oct. 24, 1926, he led LSU to the Cotton Bowl before he was drafted by the NFL's Detroit Lions in 1948. He joined Baltimore of the AAFC instead, sticking with the Colts when they joined the NFL in 1950 until they temporarily disbanded the following year, when he was redrafted by San Francisco, another former AAFC club.

Tittle then started 78 games and earned four of his seven Pro Bowl selections during a decade with the 49ers. He even became the first pro football player to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1954.

For three seasons, he was part of the 49ers' ""Million Dollar Backfield"" with Hugh McElhenny, Joe ""The Jet"" Perry and John Henry Johnson — the only full backfield in NFL history with every member in the Hall of Fame.

The group was broken up in 1957, and Tittle lost his job to John Brodie for most of his final three seasons with San Francisco. Tittle still teamed up with receiver R.C. Owens to create another piece of football history with the ""alley-oop"" pass — a high-arching downfield throw with Owens' exploiting his superior jumping ability against smaller defensive backs.

Tittle's career appeared nearly finished when San Francisco traded him to New York, but the quarterback was an improbable hit in the Big Apple. He became the Giants' starter in 1961, winning over fans and teammates who had favored 40-year-old Charlie Conerly.

Tittle became one of the NFL's most dependable passers, and New York reached the league's title game from 1961-63, but lost each time, leaving Tittle agonizingly short of his only remaining goal. The Giants plummeted to 2-10-2 in 1964, and Tittle retired after one of his worst pro seasons.

Tittle established Y.A. Tittle & Associates Insurance Services during his playing days, and he ran the business in Palo Alto, California, well past the standard retirement age. He appeared briefly in the 1999 movie ""Any Given Sunday,"" playing a coach, and was a favorite presence at memorabilia shows and NFL alumni functions.

Destiny Tompkins, 19, took to Facebook last week to recount the incident, which took place after a district manager came to visit her Banana Republic location in White Plains, N.Y.

“So today I went into work at Banana Republic at the Westchester Mall and after the district manager (a white woman) popped in for a visit, I was told to go to the office to speak with my manager,” wrote Tompkins in a Facebook post on Wednesday evening.

She then explained that she expected her store manager, a white man named Michael, to tell her something was wrong with her outfit. But instead, he began questioning her about her box-braid hairstyle, she says.

“He told me that my braids were not Banana Republic appropriate and that they were too ‘urban’ and ‘unkempt’ for their image,” wrote Tompkins, adding that Michael told her he couldn’t allow her to work until she changed her hairstyle.

Tompkins tried to explain how the braids keep her hair from drying out, but she alleges that Michael simply recommended she start using shea butter, and sent her back out to the floor.

“I have never been so humiliated and degraded in my life by a white person,” Tompkins wrote. “In that moment, I felt so uncomfortable and overwhelmed that I didn’t even finish my work shift and ended up leaving.”

“Box braids are not a matter of unprofessionalism, they are protective styles black women have used for their hair and to be discriminated against because of it is truly disgusting and unacceptable,” she added. “Make this public bc [the people at Banana Republic] need to be exposed for their blatant racism and discrimination. There’s no reason why a white person should feel allowed to tell me that I can’t wear my hair the way that I want bc it’s too black for their store image.”

Tompkins’ post has since been shared more than 51,000 times. She’s also been praised by supporters, one of whom suggested Tompkins take action against the company.

Tompkins’ mother, Jess Fig, later thanked the supporters in her own Facebook post.

The 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has spawned a violent domestic threat from “black identity extremists” who have stepped up attacks on police, according to an explosive new report by the FBI’s counterterrorism division.

The warning, first reported by Foreign Policy magazine, says that “it is very likely BIEs proactively target police and openly identify and justify their actions with social-political agendas commensurate with their perceived injustices against African Americans ...”

Brown, an African-American 18-year-old, was shot in August 2014 after struggling with white police officer Darren Wilson. Although Brown's supporters claimed it was a deadly case of police brutality, Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and resigned in November 2014.

The shooting led to protests in Ferguson that then spread to other parts of the country. It gained added momentum after subsequent racially charged police shootings, spurred on via on social media and the group Black Lives Matter.

The FBI report said that the agency previously had analyzed the potential for violence of black identity extremism, a term that was unfamiliar before it appeared in the document. What has changed, according to the the report, is that violence has now actually occurred and is 'likely"" to continue.

“It is very likely that BIEs’ perceptions of unjust treatment of African Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement will inspire premeditated attacks against law enforcement over the next year,” the report said. “It is very likely additional controversial police shootings of African Americans and the associated legal proceedings will continue to serve as drivers for violence against law enforcement.”",FBI Cites Black Extremists as New Domestic Terrorist Threat,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/10/fbi-cites-black-extremists-new-domestic-terrorist-threat#commenting

And there’s no better dragstrip than Atco Dragway in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a muscle car hotbed and home to the legendary Jersey Devil.

That’s where I had the chance to strap into the driver’s seat and take a Demon for a dozen runs. I should say “the seat,” because it comes with only one, making it the world’s most awesome pizza delivery vehicle.

And it can haul.

The Demon is the most powerful American car ever made. It has a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that puts out 808 hp and still gets 22 mph on the highway. It’s an update of the Challenger SRT Hellcat’s 707 hp motor, which now seems quaint — even more so if you fit the Demon with the special engine control module, included in a tool-and-parts kit called the Demon Crate, that allows it to run on 100 octane race gas and bumps the power up to 840 hp to go with its 770 lb-ft of torque.

Over half of the Hellcat engine’s components were modified in the, including the block, and a monstrous 2.7-liter supercharger strapped on to the top of it. The Demon’s 8-speed automatic transmission, driveshaft, differential and half shafts are appropriately beefed-up, as well.

There is no manual transmission available, but the automatic is one of the coolest ever made. It’s equipped with a feature called a TransBrake. It’s a drag racing technology that, in this case, engages first and second gears simultaneously to bind the transmission, so you can step on the gas to build up torque in the engine and drivetrain without having to use the brakes, which wouldn’t be able to hold back much of what the Demon dishes out before the tires started spinning. Meanwhile, a torque converter with a high stall speed lets you rev engine even higher than you normally could without moving as you await the green light.

Before we get to that, a few other notes on the Challenger’s transformation from Hellcat to Demon. With the project’s goals being a sub-10-second quarter-mile and the ability to lift the front wheels on launch, the SRT team knew it had to trim a few pounds — 232 pounds, it turns out — from the coupe’s over 2-ton weight.

Eliminating the passenger seat and rear bench (both can be added back in for $1 each) along with the trunk carpet and spare tire was the easy part. Swapping in some lightweight suspension parts and smaller brakes is indicative of the Demon’s drag racing focus — although it retains its computer-controlled shock absorber system and still handles pretty well for a behemoth.

The suspension plays an important role in the Demon’s straight-line speed, too. When you set the car to Drag Mode, it stiffens the rear shocks and softens the fronts to help transfer the weight to the meaty, 12.4-inch wide Nitto drag radials at launch. The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny “front-runner” tires installed. The Demon Crate comes with a set of rims for a pair.

The first time I gave it a shot, I skipped the TransBrake and used the traditional launch control system to get a feel for things. And oh, how it felt.

You simply press the brake pedal hard, floor the gas, release the brake and become one with the deep bucket seat. I’ve been in quick production cars before, but none prepared me for the violence the Demon took off with. The thunder coming out of the exhaust mixed with the screeching supercharger enhanced the experience in a way the silent electric motors of a ‘Ludicrous’ Tesla never could.

And it pulled all the way down the strip, which I covered in 10.2 seconds at 134 mph. And to think that launch control neuters the car. Using the TransBrake is the way to unleash its full abilities, but you’ll need plenty of your own to go with it.

To engage it, you pull both paddles behind the steering wheel, give it some gas (but not too much) and then, when the screen on the instrument cluster tells you it’s OK, you let one paddle go and take your foot off the brake.

It’ll let you sit there like that for about 15 seconds. You release the other paddle to get moving, and then it’s all you. There’s no traction control in this mode, so you need to modulate the throttle to keep from smoking the tires. It’s easier said than done with all that power, even on a strip prepped with sticky traction compound and rubbered-in. On my first three tries, I botched it pretty good.

I eventually managed to get away cleanly a couple of times, but never did better than the launch control. I’m sure a drag racing regular could.

Jim Wilder, the Demon’s development manager, is one of those. He took me for a run in a two-seat car with front-runners on it and pretty much all I can remember is getting walloped in the back and looking at the sky as we left the line. He may have overseen its development, but the launch control has nothing on him. I was so taken aback by the ride that I spaced out and forgot to check his time. Pride wouldn’t allow me to tell you what it was, anyway.

Dodge isn’t the first to hop up a Hellcat, of course. Plenty of shops have figured out how to get this much power and more out of it. The difference is that the Demon comes with a warranty. Wilder said his team did over 500 quarter-mile runs on a single axle, and more than 900 with the same transmission, and both looked like new when they pulled them out to inspect them. It’s doubtful any Demons will see that much action in the real world.

The Demon starts at $86,090. That’s a lot for a toy, and that’s exactly what it is. But it’s likely a steal at that price.

Dodge is building only 3,300 of them for the U.S. and Canada, and they’ve all been allocated. It did its best to keep dealers from marking them up, but some people are already trying to flip cars they don’t have yet for double what they’re paying, and a few probably will. If not now, then in a few years at one of those collector car auctions on TV.

That is, unless Dodge manages to outdo itself. When the Hellcat came out a few years ago, everyone thought it marked the end of days for the muscle car, and then they went and made the Demon and turned the Hellcat into a commodity. While it is a one-year-and-done model, the Challenger is going to be around at least until 2020, so there’s time for an even more evil encore.

But what the devil would they call it?

Jesus Campos, a security guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was shot by Paddock six minutes before he began shooting into a crowd of 22,000 people enjoying the country music festival down below, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joe Lombardo said in a news conference Monday evening.

Campos was responding to an alarm going off in the hotel and ventured off to find the source when he came across the sound of drilling.

The security guard told investigators that Paddock was drilling to an adjacent wall in the hallway — most likely to install a camera or to point a rifle — but never finished the job.

Lombardo said the alarm that went off was not connected to Paddock’s room.

Lombardo said Monday that a maintenance worker was also on the 32nd floor at the time Campos was shot, and Campos prevented that man from also being shot or otherwise injured.

Lombardo confirmed that Paddock had also shot at two aviation fuel tanks roughly 2,000 feet away from his hotel room, apparently in an effort to divert attention away from his shooting at the large crowd of people.

While authorities have yet to find a motive for Paddock, Lombardo said that they are continuing to investigate, noting “every piece of information we get is one more piece of the puzzle.”

Paddock's brother, Eric, and girlfriend, Marilou Danley, are still being interviewed in the wake of the shooting in an effort to gain insight.

Officials have yet to find a possible connection between Paddock and ideology, and Lombardo said there is no evidence there was a second shooter.

Lombardo said that while investigators have found 200 incidents of Paddock moving through the city, there was no evidence he was with anyone else.

Many had speculated in the days following the shooting that a note found in Paddock’s hotel room was possibly a suicide note, but Lombardo said the piece of paper seen in leaked pictures was only a note with numbers on it.

Las Vegas police officers who entered Paddock’s room told CBS News’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday night that the note contained hand-written calculations, which included “the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for the crowd.”","Mandalay Bay security guard was shot six minutes before Las Vegas gunman began shooting, police say",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/09/mandalay-bay-security-guard-was-shot-six-minutes-before-las-vegas-gunman-began-shooting-police-say.html

NORTH KOREA: WHAT WOULD A NUCLEAR ATTACK LOOK LIKE?

South Korea announced in May a “large amount of data” was stolen during a cyber attack that was possibly orchestrated by Kim Jong Un’s rogue regime. That same month, Yapizon, a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, announced 3,816 bitcoins — online currency that amounts to about $5.3 million — was taken on April 22. The company did not disclose who it believed to be the culprit, but security firm FireEye noted North Korean hackers were also suspected of targeting online currency providers.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday said the U.S. has “military options that [President Trump] can employ if needed.”

""There's one thing the U.S. Army can do, and that is you have got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our President can employ if needed,"" Mattis said during an Army conference in Washington, D.C. ""We currently are in a diplomatically led effort.”

KIM JONG UN’S NORTH KOREA: BRINGING THE WORLD TO THE BRINK

Trump, meanwhile, has continued his attacks against “little rocket man” Kim Jong Un and his regime, with the president taking to Twitter early Monday to say more than two decades of U.S. policy toward North Korea “didn’t work.”

“Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn’t work!” Trump wrote.

TRUMP ON NORTH KOREA, FROM 'ROCKET MAN' TO 'FIRE AND FURY'

The weekend tweets came after the president’s Thursday meeting with senior military leaders and their spouses, where he cryptically told reporters “this might be the calm before the storm.” When asked to elaborate on Friday, Trump said, “You’ll find out.”

North Korean state media announced on Sunday Kim Jong Un promoted his sister, Kim Yo Jong, to become an alternate member of the country’s top decision-making body, the politiburo. The decision came the same weekend Kim declared his country’s nuclear weapons a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia” against “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”

In spite of the horror that we witness on news channels or hear on the radio or read on the internet, I am going bold. I am choosing to allow myself to believe that ultimately people are good.

Pollyanna? Not really. The idea that we live in a world with nothing but hurtful, selfish, attention-seeking criminals, is too much for me, and I am betting, too much for you, too. Who wants to live in a world where there is no love or trust or goodness?

After watching the news coverage of the Las Vegas massacre, or the collapse of the Twin Towers, or rampant school shootings, I could easily allow myself to change my tune on this. Madmen are everywhere, I could think. Let’s cancel every concert, football game, and summer fair. Let’s hide inside, where we all are safe from harm.

But that’s not the world I want. I want to teach my kids to fight for more. I want my friends to find ways to focus on the good. I want my colleagues to create beautiful works that can brighten some dark place. And I am not alone. Most of us believe that the goodness in the world far outweighs the bad. This is not to minimalize the severity of what we see in the news, it is unbelievable, unacceptable and despicable. But, in this world, we have to keep a true perspective that people wish for better. That they wish for goodness.

""I don't know who this man was but I do believe that God sends all kinds of people to our lives who have the ability to share something as simple as a smile.""

Let’s give ourselves permission to still see the good in others. Let’s focus on the simple acts that change our day or perspective. Let’s notice the gentleman holding the door while we struggle with our groceries. Or the bus driver who waits a few extra minutes for the mom who is running late to meet her kindergartener. Or the stranger who pulls onto the side of the road to help change a tire. Or the teenager who steps in to stop a bully. Or someone who offers a tiny gesture of encouragement.

A friend recently shared a story with me about a stranger who offered encouragement that changed everything. She said:

It was my first day back to work after a 12-week maternity leave. I was headed to drop off our baby girl for her first day of daycare. I was a wreck. My emotions were all over the place and I was questioning both our decision for me to return to work as well as the daycare we had chosen back when I found out I was pregnant.

It was early morning on a Monday in January, 2000. I remember it vividly. I was at a two-lane stoplight waiting for the light to turn red when a truck pulled up beside me on the passenger side of my car. The tears were running down my face and I remember praying that this would all be okay. As the truck stopped I glanced through the passenger side of the window and a kind man locked eyes with me and gave me a smile that still resonates in my memory. I don't know who this man was but I do believe that God sends all kinds of people to our lives who have the ability to share something as simple as a smile. Of course, I was still emotional and heartbroken to leave my baby, but I knew God would be with her just as He was with me.

By changing our perspective we have the power to change everything. I am allowing myself, and invite you to join me, as I search for ways to concentrate on the good. It won’t be easy--we are programmed to zero in on the negativity. It’s going to take work and discipline to walk away from conversations that bring us down. It’s going to require a new mindset.

“Where’s Hillary Clinton? Where’s she standing on this issue? She’s been silent. Her silence is deafening,” Republican Party Chair Ronna McDaniel said Monday, according to The Hill.

Weinstein contributed $46,350 to Clinton during her presidential candidacy, as well as to HILLPAC, a committee Clinton used to support other Democrats while she was a senator, according to The Associated Press.

Days after the accusations against Weinstein surfaced, Clinton's Twitter page has made no mention of the story -- but she did have time to plug her children's book and a talk at Stanford University.

Weinstein and his family have given more than $1.4 million in political contributions since the 1992 election cycle, virtually all of it to Democratic lawmakers, candidates and their allies, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

In a statement Monday, Karan said her remarks were taken out of context and don't represent her feelings. She says she believes ""sexual harassment is NOT acceptable and this is an issue that MUST be addressed once and for all regardless of the individual.""

Karan on Sunday suggested to The Daily Mail that Weinstein’s alleged victims may have been ‘asking for it’ in a rambling interview that questioned the way women dressed and how they present themselves to the world.

The DKNY designer was in Los Angeles for the CineFashion Film Awards and told a reporter that, “'To see it here in our own country is very difficult, but I also think how do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women? What are we asking? Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality?

Meanwhile, among those weighing in were his longtime allies and beneficiaries Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet, Kevin Smith and Judi Dench. They spoke up with a combination of disgust over his alleged behavior and remorse or defensiveness over their own business entanglements with him. Even the actors’ labor union SAG-AFTRA joined the chorus in condemning the disgraced movie mogul, calling reports of his alleged conduct “abhorrent and unacceptable.”

Director Kevin Smith, whose movies “Clerks” and “Chasing Amy” were produced by Weinstein, noted on Twitter that the producer financed the first 14 years of his career.

“Now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain,” Smith wrote. “It makes me feel ashamed.”

Weinstein, 65, was fired Sunday by the Weinstein Co., the studio he co-founded, three days after a bombshell New York Times expose alleged decades of crude sexual behavior on his part toward female employees and actresses, including Ashley Judd. The Times said at least eight settlements had been reached with women.

Streep, who once called Weinstein “God” while accepting the Golden Globe for “The Iron Lady,” condemned his alleged conduct as “inexcusable” while also saying she did not know about it before.

“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported,” Streep said in a statement.

Stories of his behavior, she said, were not universally known in Hollywood.

“Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,” Streep continued. “If everybody knew, I don’t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.”

Similarly, Dench, whose awards and nominations have been inextricably linked for two decades to Weinstein, first at his company Miramax and then at the Weinstein Co., said in a statement that she was “completely unaware” of the “horrifying” offenses.

“I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out,” she wrote.

The Affordable Care Act individual mandate requires that Americans pay the individual shared responsibility payment, otherwise known as a penalty or a tax, if a household or individual fails to have health care coverage.

There were 6,665,480 households who chose to pay the Obamacare penalty in that year rather than signing up for Affordable Care Act coverage. They paid a total of $3,079,255,000.

Finally, 92 percent of the households—6.1 million households—paid the penalty and earned less than $75,000 a year.

The penalties have increased every year since the Affordable Care Act was implemented. In 2014, the penalty totaled a flat fee of $95 or 1 percent of income above the filing threshold. In 2015, the penalty increased to a flat fee of $325 or 2 percent of a household's income, whichever one was higher. In 2016 and 2017, the penalties increased even higher to a flat fee of $695 or 2.5 percent of gross income.

It said it tested its first nuclear bomb on Oct. 9, 2006, coinciding with Party Foundation Day in North Korea, Lee said.
“They have a strategic game plan,” Lee said, dismissing the idea that North Korea simply “throws a tantrum” and launches missile tests.","This week marks two significant dates for North Korea – the anniversaries of its first nuclear test and the foundation of the ruling Worker’s Party of Korea.

Officials have warned that North Korea could use the special dates – in particular, the Oct. 10 anniversary of the Worker’s Party – to provoke the U.S. or launch a new missile.

""There is a clarity of purpose in what (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un is doing. I don’t think he’s done,"" Yong Suk Lee, the deputy assistant director of the CIA’s Korea Mission Center, said at a conference last week, according to Reuters. “In fact, I told my own staff (that) Oct. 10th is the Korean Workers Party founding day. That’s Tuesday in North Korea, but Monday – the Columbus Day holiday - in the United States. So stand by your phones.”

As North Korea’s past provocations have coincided with dates important to them, the U.S., China or Japan, Dr. Sung-Yoon Lee, the Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Professor of Korean Studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, predicted the east Asian country could test a missile by late Monday night.

North Korea said it had “perfect success” with a hydrogen bomb test on Sept. 3, 2017, Labor Day weekend in the U.S. It said it tested its first nuclear bomb on Oct. 9, 2006, coinciding with Party Foundation Day in North Korea, Lee said.

Other nuclear tests have lined up with Memorial Day weekend in the U.S. in 2009, Lunar New Year celebrations in China in 2013, Kim Jong Un’s birthday in 2016 and the Day of the Foundation of the Republic in 2016.

North Korea also tested its first successful intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4, 2017.

“I have a feeling that they’re ready [for provocation] and they’re biding their time … for the most adverse impact,” Lee told Fox News Monday. He predicted that the country could fire a missile into the waters by Guam – which would illicit a response that would still be less than if Americans were killed.

NORTH KOREA’S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM HAS GROWN WITH EACH KIM REGIME

“They like to rub it in and spoil government officials’ long weekends,” Lee said.

A member of Russia’s lower house of parliament told local media that North Korea is preparing to test a long-range missile believed to reach the west coast of the U.S., according to The Guardian.

“They are preparing for new tests of a long-range missile. They even gave us mathematical calculations that they believe prove that their missile can hit the west coast of the United States,” Anton Morozov reportedly said last week after visiting Pyongyang.

As North Korea continues to develop its nuclear program, Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are engaged in a war of words and threats. Trump promised last month to “totally destroy” the Asian nation if provoked.

Lee also noted that China’s 19th party congress will meet later this month, and Trump is expected to visit China, Japan and South Korea in November – which could be when North Korea provokes next.

Earlier this year the New York Times reported that hundreds of radioactive wild boars were roaming Fukushima in Japan, six years after the nuclear plant’s meltdown.","Some 31 years after the world’s worst nuclear accident in Chernobyl, a wild boar with more than 10-times the safe limit of radiation has been killed by hunters hundreds of miles away in Sweden.

After the 1986 catastrophe at Chernobyl in Ukraine, a cloud of radioactive particles reached parts of Sweden, leaving a frightening environmental legacy.

Environmental consultancy Calluna is seeing extremely worrying radiation levels in wild boars in Central Sweden. Local hunters are now wary of killing the boars for food.

“Hunters won’t shoot the animals,” Calluna Environmental Consultant Ulf Frykman told Fox News.

INSIDE THE NEW EFFORT TO ENTOMB CHERNOBYL'S WRECKAGE

Frykman explained that, of 30 wild boar samples taken from the area surrounding the city of Gävle this year, only six were below the safe radiation limit of 1,500 becquerel per kilogram (Bq/kg). Alarmingly, flesh from one wild boar that had been killed by hunters registered a massive 16,000 Bq/kg, while others were 13,000 and 11,000 Bq/kg.

“When you see 16,000 [Bq/kg], people get worried,” he said.

Additionally, five wild boar samples from the area around Tärnsjö, also in Central Sweden, measured above 1,500 Bq/kg.

Wild boars’ feeding habits make them particularly vulnerable to lingering contamination from the radioactive isotope cesium-137. Frykman explained that, because the boars root in the soil for food, they are more exposed to the isotope. “The cesium stays in the ground,” he said. “It’s not a problem for moose and deer any more who eat higher up, from bushes.”

AMID CHERNOBYL'S RUINS, SOMETHING OF VALUE REMAINS

Of around 400 moose that were tested last year, only one or two were over the 1,500 Bq/kg level, according to Frykman.

The environmental consultant, however, expects to see even higher radiation levels in wild boars as the animals continue to migrate north. The soil north of the Tärnsjö area has double the level of contamination, he said, adding that wild boars measuring 30,000 to 40,000 Bq/kg may be seen next year.

Frykman is concerned that, if hunters don’t shoot the wild boars, their growing population will get even bigger, causing problems for crops. “The families of wild boars are growing fast – it’s worrying,” he said.

The Telegraph reports that workers at the Forsmark nuclear plant near Gävle were the first to raise the international alarm after the Chernobyl disaster.

RADIOACTIVE BOARS RAMPAGING THROUGH GERMANY

Wild boar populations in other parts of Europe, such as Germany, have also been contaminated with radioactivity in the aftermath of Chernobyl.

Earlier this year the New York Times reported that hundreds of radioactive wild boars were roaming Fukushima in Japan, six years after the nuclear plant’s meltdown.

The 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has spawned a violent domestic threat from “black identity extremists” who have stepped up attacks on police, according to an explosive new report by the FBI’s counterterrorism division.

The warning, first reported by Foreign Policy magazine, says that “it is very likely BIEs proactively target police and openly identify and justify their actions with social-political agendas commensurate with their perceived injustices against African Americans ...”

Brown, an African-American 18-year-old, was shot in August 2014 after struggling with white police officer Darren Wilson. Although Brown's supporters claimed it was a deadly case of police brutality, Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and resigned in November 2014.

The shooting led to protests in Ferguson that then spread to other parts of the country. It gained added momentum after subsequent racially charged police shootings, spurred on via on social media and the group Black Lives Matter.

The FBI report said that the agency previously had analyzed the potential for violence of black identity extremism, a term that was unfamiliar before it appeared in the document. What has changed, according to the the report, is that violence has now actually occurred and is 'likely"" to continue.

“It is very likely that BIEs’ perceptions of unjust treatment of African Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement will inspire premeditated attacks against law enforcement over the next year,” the report said. “It is very likely additional controversial police shootings of African Americans and the associated legal proceedings will continue to serve as drivers for violence against law enforcement.”",FBI Cites Black Extremists as New Domestic Terrorist Threat,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/10/fbi-cites-black-extremists-new-domestic-terrorist-threat

ESPN subsequently suspended her for two weeks.

JEMELE HILL, ANTI-TRUMP ESPN HOST, CALLS FOR FANS TO BOYCOTT NFL ADVERTISERS

Hill's efforts followed new rules made by Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who said any player who disrespects the flag will not play.

“I know this, we cannot…in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,” Jones said. “We know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we’re clear.”

JERRY JONES GIVES COWBOYS PLAYERS ULTIMATUM: STAND FOR ANTHEM OR SIT FOR GAME

Hill issued instructions for “change” on Twitter following Jones’ comments.

“Change happens when advertisers are impacted. If you strongly reject what Jerry Jones said, the key is his advertisers,” Hill tweeted Sunday.

Trump tweeted support for Jones overnight -- but on Tuesday morning, the president questioned the NFL’s “massive tax breaks.”

“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump tweeted.

The NFL’s tax status has been controversial for years. The league announced in 2015 it would voluntarily lose its tax-exempt status, but the league still enjoys various tax breaks. According to Time, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called the tax-exemption a “distraction” in 2015 and said it has been “mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years.”

Trump is not the only Republican who has slammed the league’s tax break in recent weeks.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., criticized it, saying, “In America, if you want to play sports you’re free to do so. If you want to protest, you’re free to do so. But you should do so on your own dime.”

Scott Alonso, communications director for Sonoma County, said family members have been reporting those missing in calls to a hotline in the county. He said it is possible that many or most of the missing are safe but simply can't be reached because of the widespread loss of cell service and other communications.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the fire has consumed another 2,000 acres since Monday afternoon and is now at 27,000 acres. The 14 fires destroyed at least 1,500 homes.

Andy Luttringer, who lives in Santa Rosa, looked at the damage to his home of nearly 20 years. He told the paper that he regretted not grabbing more of his wife’s artwork. His wife died of cancer a few years ago.

“I’m really mad at myself,” the 62-year-old retired cop told the paper. “I could have grabbed a couple of her pieces. The rest of the stuff I couldn’t care less about.”

At least 100 people have been injured in the wildfires.

St. Joseph Health said 100 patients have been treated, most for smoke inhalation, at two of its hospitals, Santa Rosa Memorial in Santa Rosa and Queen of the Valley Medical Center in Napa.

Those hospitals took on the majority of patients with other hospitals in the area evacuated because of the fires.

Two of the injured are critical. One has been transferred to a burn center with significant injuries. Fifteen of the injuries are described as moderate and the rest are minor.

Chris Thomas, 42, from Kirkland, Wash., who was visiting Napa with his wife, Marissa, for a wine-tasting trip, told The Chronicle that he was awakened by a fire truck’s loudspeaker ordering them to leave.

“It was surreal,” Thomas said. “When I started loading stuff into the car, it was a hell-storm of smoke and ash. There were 30- to 40-mph winds. I couldn’t even breathe, so I ran back to the unit to get Marissa. It was so smoky I went to the wrong unit. When I found her I said, ‘Forget it, let’s just go.’ It went from being an annoying evacuation to something really scary.”

Former San Francisco Giants pitcher Noah Lowry and his family were among those who had to flee from the ferocious series of wildfires in Northern California.

Lowry said that he, his wife, his two daughters and his 2-week-old son had to leave their home in Santa Rosa in a matter of minutes as the flames approached. Lowry said he ""can't shake hearing people scream in terror as the flames barreled down on us.""

He said he ran into a closed U.S. 101 freeway because the flames had jumped it. But he and his family were able to get away in time and get to a friends' house where they are staying.

Vice President Mike Pence said during a visit to California that the federal government stands ready to provide any and all assistance to the state. Pence said, ""We are standing with you.""

Authorities have imposed a sunset-to-sunrise curfew in the city of Santa Rosa and say they are on the lookout for looters as firefighters battle the blazes. Acting Police Chief Craig Schwartz said the curfew will be enforced in a mandatory evacuation zone, with violators possibly subject to arrest.

California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties because of wildfires that the governor says are threatening thousands of homes.

Brown issued the declaration on Monday, as multiple fires forced people to evacuate their homes.

More than 200 people were hurriedly evacuated from two Santa Rosa hospitals threatened by wildfires that bloomed overnight.

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Director Ken Pimlott says an estimated 20,000 people have been evacuated. He called the estimates of destroyed structures very conservative.

Pimlott said most of the fires started at about 10 p.m. Sunday and their causes are under investigation.

The Napa Valley Vintners association says most wineries were closed Monday because of power outages, evacuation orders and the inability of employees to get to work.

The trade association said Monday that it does not have verifiable information on winery buildings that burned down or the impact the fires would have on the 2017 harvest.

Workers had picked most grapes for the season before fires broke out.

The wind-driven wildfires came as Napa and Sonoma counties were finishing highly anticipated harvests of wine grapes. Workers on Monday should have been picking and processing the ripe grapes that would make chardonnay and other wines.

At least two wineries were destroyed and many others damaged.

More than 5,000 Southern California homes were evacuated Monday as fire crews struggled to battle a rapidly growing brush fire.

The blaze has scorched 6,000 acres and destroyed dozens of structures in Orange County.

Plumes of smoke were visible over Disneyland and officials issued air quality warnings for parts of Los Angeles County.

An Anaheim police spokesman says there is no containment so far.

The singer told reporters backstage about their baby being in an incubator, ""Thank God, our boy is completely healthy and fine but it's scary when you're going through it and I think there's a strength in sharing that… I was petrified.

""There's beeps and alarms… and tubes… It's a hard thing. But we leaned on each other. We got through it,"" Nick said.



He earned the night's lowest score, 22 for a contemporary dance with Maks' wife, Peta Murgatroyd. But at the end of the night, it was Derek Fisher who was eliminated.



The top score of the night, 29, went to ""Hamilton"" star Jordan Fisher (with Lindsay Arnold), who told viewers about the year he'd been officially adopted in 2005 by his grandparents after his biological mom ""struggled with substance abuse. She wasn't ready to be a mom.""



His proud parents cheered in the audience for his contemporary dance tribute to them.



And after the show, Jordan told Fox News, ""The woman who gave birth to me did -- and I'm grateful for that. [She] also gave me a template for what not to do in life, of which I'm also grateful… the story is what makes me who I am.""



Paralympian Victoria Arlen and Val Chmerkovskiy earned 27 for their foxtrot that showed how she recovered from paralysis. She doubled over in tears at the end of the dance.



Violinist Lindsey Stirling and partner Mark Ballas earned 26 points as she told viewers about the year her father died of cancer.



Ballas wore Stirling's father's actual hat and scarf in the touching Viennese waltz. She cried after the tribute to her beloved dad, who had taken a teaching job to earn enough money so that Stirling could take violin classes.



Stirling said to reporters afterwards, ""It's been a really heavy week. Mark has seen me cry so much… I didn't know it would be this hard to talk about it. But… my dad was here with me. I held it together pretty well.""



Drew Scott delighted the crowd when brother Jonathan of ""Property Brothers"" joined him to perform at the end of his jive dance with Emma Slater. Matching Vanessa, they earned 24.



Terrell Owens, Sasha Pieterse, Nikki Bella, and Frankie Muniz also walked away with 24 points.



While Muniz shared with fans the year he suffered memory loss, football player Owens paid tribute to 2012, the year his grandmother died after suffering from dementia.



They were two peas in a pod, Owens recalled to Fox News about the grandma who actually raised him. ""I lived in a relatively small town and people knew wherever she was, I was. We rode around on the go cart together.""

Weight Loss Supplements that WorkJust like any other medication, weight loss supplements have both benefits and side effects.

Every year, millions of Americans go after this same goal, some successful and others not so much. To attain their goals, they may choose from the over-abundance of diets and exercise programs available, and some turn to weight loss supplements as well.

While you shouldn’t rely on supplements to do all the work for you, there are a few that can be used safely to boost your weight loss efforts.

Before you decide on weight loss supplements, though, you should consider the health effects carefully. Always check with your doctor first to be sure about safety, and remember that these pills are supplements. They’re meant to be used alongside healthy eating habits and proper exercise.

DO YOU HAVE LIVER DAMAGE?

Again, never use supplements by themselves to lose weight. Some people turn to weight loss pills so that they can continue an unhealthy lifestyle while staying thin.

This dangerous mentality could lead to frightening situations like addiction, overdose or death. Also, brands that claim to shed weight without any effort may contain ingredients that will do you more harm than good. If you have any doubt about a supplement, stay away.

Weight Loss Supplements that Work

Just like any other medication, weight loss supplements have both benefits and side effects. When choosing a supplement, you should know all the possible effects and consider them in light of your own health history. Especially if you have other health issues, you should check carefully for ingredients that may trigger or worsen your symptoms.

Let’s look at 3 supplements that you could consider adding to your weight loss program:

1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea has long been known for its health benefits, mainly because the drink is high in antioxidants. In particular, green tea contains large amounts of polyphenol antioxidants called catechins, which may help reduce oxidative stress.

For weight loss, studies have shown that green tea extract can help boost the metabolism. Researchers think that the combination of antioxidants and caffeine work together to accomplish this goal.

MOM LOSES FINGER IN FREAK ACCIDENT AT SON'S BASEBALL GAME

For example, in one study, researchers gave participants green tea and guarana extract 30 minutes before each meal. Researchers then analyzed how much energy the participants were burning.

After testing multiple times, researchers found that participants burned an extra 180 calories per day with just this supplement. In addition, green tea extract enhances norepinephrine, a hormone that tells the body to break down stored fat for energy.

Side Effects: Nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach or headaches may occur due to the dietary change or caffeine content. Rare side effects include tremors, seizures or irregular heartbeat. Because of the caffeine content, you should consult with your doctor about using green tea extract if you have a heart condition.

2. Berberine

Another lesser known supplement that provides powerful help is berberine. This supplement is derived from plants and actually enters the body’s cells through the bloodstream, changing the function of the cell. One major benefit that berberine has is its ability to regulate and reduce blood sugar content.

In addition, studies suggest that berberine does boost weight loss directly. In one study, researchers tested 37 participants who suffered from metabolic syndrome.

During testing, the participants took berberine three times per day for three months, and in turn reduced their BMI from 31.5 to 27.4. Also, the researchers noticed that many participants lost abdominal weight and improved other areas of their health.

IS YOUR THYROID SLEEPING ON THE JOB?

Side Effects: Common problems with berberine include cramping, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation and stomach pain. Also, you’ll want to discuss whether or not to take berberine if you are already on medication to lower your blood sugar.

3. Meratrim

One relatively new but promising supplement is Meratrim, a blend of two plant extracts. In one study of the supplement, researchers tested over 50 overweight individuals. Participants were told to take the supplement or a placebo twice a day in addition to eating a 2000-calorie diet and walking for 30 minutes, five times per week.

At the end of 16 weeks, researchers found that participants had decreased their weight, triglycerides and total cholesterol. In addition, no participants reported side effects. Because Meratrim is new, you should consider a more well-tested supplement if you have any major health issues.

As popular as it is to use fad diets and supplements to lose weight, your main program should focus on exercise and healthy eating.

However, if you choose to boost your efforts with a weight loss supplement, choose one that fits your lifestyle and keeps you safe. Most supplements do have side effects and risks and should never be taken to lose weight alone. In the end, remember that your improved health is the main goal and that healthy weight loss happens gradually for lasting results.

Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense.","In many parts of the world, if you are born poor you will almost certainly stay poor for your entire life. You don’t get the chance to get a good education or go on to a well-paid career. You struggle – picking crops, mopping floors, mowing lawns, waiting on tables, or in other low-paying jobs, barely making ends meet.

But in America – known the world over as the Land of Opportunity – upward mobility is the national ideal. It doesn’t always happen, of course. But just the possibility draws immigrants from the world over to our shores – my own parents included. For most, education is the key that enables them or their children to break out of poverty and enter the middle class or go higher, as I and millions of others have been able to do.

For this reason, providing equal educational opportunity for all is vitally important – not just for students who can get college degrees that transform their lives, but for America. We need an educated workforce to keep our economy and our nation strong. We need to keep the American Dream alive.

A stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

One immigrant who achieved the American Dream and helped thousands more young people do so as well was Jack Kent Cooke. Born in Canada in 1912, he never had the chance to go to college, leaving high school during the Great Depression to help support his struggling family. He went from selling encyclopedias door to door, to leading a band, to being a runner on the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange, to working as a salesman, to managing radio stations.

Cooke kept working his way up, becoming a part-owner of radio stations, newspapers and a magazine, and then buying a minor league baseball team in Toronto and other businesses. He immigrated to the United States in 1960 and became an even more successful businessman and owner of sports teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Kings and the Washington Redskins.

The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which I now head as executive director, has awarded $175 million in scholarships to more than 2,300 high-achieving, low-income students from 8th grade through graduate school, along with comprehensive counseling and other support services. The foundation has also provided over $97 million in grants to organizations that serve such students.

Every year, the Cooke Foundation finds absolutely brilliant students who have overcome incredible obstacles and gives them scholarships. Some of our Cooke Scholars have been homeless, have gone hungry, have been undocumented, have suffered from serious illnesses, have been kicked out of their homes after announcing they were LGBT, have been teenage parents, and have faced other big challenges.

Yet Cooke Scholars have graduated with distinction from some of the top colleges and universities in the world. Some have become physicians, created nonprofit organizations to help others in need, become medical researchers working to prevent and cure diseases, launched successful businesses, become professors, started charter schools, written books, and taken on many other important rules. How sad it would have been if they never had the chance to get a college education and instead spent their lives in dead-end jobs.

Yet a stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

What’s lacking isn’t brainpower among those with low incomes. What’s lacking is the opportunity to get a higher education and the money to pay for it.

But we should be embarrassed that millions of low-income young people who do these things and are enormously talented hit a cash ceiling when they try to better themselves with a college degree. They should not be denied equal educational opportunity simply because they were born into families of modest means. If given the chance, they can make our nation proud.","America is the land of opportunity, and should be proud of it",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/america-is-land-opportunity-and-should-be-proud-it.html

JEMELE HILL, ANTI-TRUMP ESPN HOST, CALLS FOR FANS TO BOYCOTT NFL ADVERTISERS

Hill's efforts followed new rules made by Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who said any player who disrespects the flag will not play.

“I know this, we cannot…in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,” Jones said. “We know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we’re clear.”

JERRY JONES GIVES COWBOYS PLAYERS ULTIMATUM: STAND FOR ANTHEM OR SIT FOR GAME

Hill issued instructions for “change” on Twitter following Jones’ comments.

“Change happens when advertisers are impacted. If you strongly reject what Jerry Jones said, the key is his advertisers,” Hill tweeted Sunday.

Trump tweeted support for Jones overnight -- but on Tuesday morning, the president questioned the NFL’s “massive tax breaks.”

“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump tweeted.

The NFL’s tax status has been controversial for years. The league announced in 2015 it would voluntarily lose its tax-exempt status, but the league still enjoys various tax breaks. According to Time, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called the tax-exemption a “distraction” in 2015 and said it has been “mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years.”

Trump is not the only Republican who has slammed the league’s tax break in recent weeks.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., criticized it, saying, “In America, if you want to play sports you’re free to do so. If you want to protest, you’re free to do so. But you should do so on your own dime.”

Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi told an international conference on enhancing nuclear safety that Washington's recent ""delusionary negative postures do not augur well"" for keeping the deal intact.

He said Iran didn't want to see the deal unravel but that ""much more is at stake for the entire international community than the national interests of Iran.""

U.S. President Donald Trump is set to deliver a speech on Iran this week in which he is expected to decline to certify Iran's compliance in the landmark 2015 agreement, referring it to Congress, and perhaps targeting the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard with new sanctions.

Salehi praised the progress that had been made since the 2015 deal, saying nonproliferation and disarmament efforts had benefited worldwide. He called it ""simply too precious to be allowed to be undermined or weakened.""

""The failure of the nuclear deal will undermine the political credibility and international stature of the U.S. in this tumultuous political environment,"" Salhehi warned.

He concluded that he hoped ""common sense shall prevail.""

The U.S. administration has faced two 90-day certification deadlines to state whether Iran is meeting the conditions needed to continue enjoying sanctions relief under the deal and has both times backed away from a showdown. But Trump more recently has said he does not expect to certify Iran's compliance with the October deadline looming.

On Monday, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, praised the 2015 deal as a ""win-win"" solution that was working.

""We settled a milestone for nonproliferation and we prevented a dangerous devastating military escalation,"" she told the conference via video message, adding that the International Atomic Energy Agency had certified Iran's compliance with the deal, including via inspections, eight times since it was signed.

She warned that with rising nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula, ""We have an interest and a responsibility and a duty to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran"" and strengthening, not weakening the nonproliferation regime.

Jenkins reiterated to NBC Sports Philadelphia that the demonstrations during the national anthem were not about the flag and were “in no way disrespectful to our flag, country or service members.”

""I think we've made that very clear that what we are demonstrating about has nothing to do with the flag but everything to do with social injustice, racial inequality and the things that, you know, Jerry Jones and other owners who are making statements have yet to address,"" he said.

Regina Twist, 36, of Hot Springs, died early Sunday after attending a Saturday evening barbecue at a friend's house near Springfield, 40 miles northwest of Little Rock. The woman visited regularly for weekend gatherings and had never shown similar behavior, according to the grandmother of the cookout's host, who lives on the same property.

Deputies grabbed the woman by her arms after she dropped the knife outside her car, then handcuffed her, according to Hannum. Once she fell quiet, the deputies realized something was wrong and attempted to resuscitate her, Hannum said.

While the showdown and its aftermath were ""just horrible,"" the deputies ""were very professional,"" Hannum said.

Sheriff Mike Smith would not speculate on whether alcohol or some other substance made the woman act irrationally. Twist was pronounced dead at a Morrilton hospital and her body was sent to the state Crime Lab for an autopsy. State police said Monday that toxicology tests can take weeks.

State records showed that a Regina Twist with the same birthdate and hometown had been a registered dental assistant with permission to take X-rays, polish teeth and administer nitrous oxide. The license lapsed Dec. 31, according to the state Board of Dental Examiners.

Smith said Monday the deputy who deployed the chemical agent and stun gun is on paid administrative leave while state police investigate.

The other deputies who responded were back on duty Monday. Their body camera videos have been handed over to the state police.

It’s hard to see how a war of words with Bob Corker helps the president.

What Corker told the New York Times for a story yesterday is so blistering that if a Democrat had made such a full-throated attack on Trump, he’d be dismissed as an overzealous partisan.

Sure, the Tennessee senator has been liberated to speak his mind now that he’s not running for reelection. But his words to the Times, against a president of his own party, are still extraordinary. And with his chairman’s gavel, he can make plenty of trouble for Trump over the next year.

Corker, who made a fortune in construction, has played golf with Trump and was briefly considered for secretary of State before taking himself out of the running.

Trump, who ran against the Republican establishment, has also had strained relations with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and occasionally makes nice with the Democrats.

The animosity between Trump and Corker has been building for some time. Last week, for instance, the senator said Rex Tillerson is one of three people who help “separate our country from chaos.”

The lead of the Times piece is Corker saying that the president is treating his office like “a reality show” and is making threats that could lead the country “on the path to World War III.”

That’s not exactly mild diplomatic language. In fact, Corker undermines his own message by using such inflammatory phrases. Can we take it down a couple of notches?

“Incredibly irresponsible,” Kellyanne Conway told Fox.

Corker also said that top administration officials must protect Trump from his own instincts: “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him.”

The explosive interview gave ammunition to the president’s media detractors, who jumped on Corker’s contention that many Republican senators agree with him privately.

The Washington Post’s take on Trump: “If he sincerely cared about getting big bills done, he wouldn’t go to war with Corker. Especially when his party has a working majority of just two seats in the Senate… Going after Corker is like when Trump described the health bill that passed the House as ‘mean.’ It makes it less likely that other lawmakers will go out on a limb for him.”

Over the weekend, Trump appeared to hit back at Corker’s “chaos” comment, tweeting:

“Senator Bob Corker ‘begged’ me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said ‘NO’ and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said ‘NO THANKS.’ He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal! Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!”

Corker says much of that is untrue, that Trump urged him to run and said he’d endorse him, but that after two terms he decided against it. He also got into the Twitter sandbox: “It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.”

Now Bob Corker is not a household name, and by itself, this controversy won’t resonate with the majority of voters.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

Built in 1930, the white-glove, full-service, pre-war building has 15 floors and 43 apartments. Other notables who have lived there include Gloria Vanderbilt, conductor André Kostelanetz and New Yorker critic Alexander Woollcott.

Plus there’s a gym and an indoor basketball court, which would appeal to the fitness-loving ex-president and first lady. Most importantly, the building has strong security, including an underground drive-in garage, from which they could directly access their apartment without stepping outside.

A duplex apartment at 10 Gracie Square went into contract last week for $10 million, and real estate insiders are speculating that could be the Obamas’ new NYC pad, although this could not be confirmed at press time.

California Gov. Jerry Brown signed the legislation last week.

The sponsor, Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, has argued adamantly that nobody is going to be criminally prosecuted for using the wrong pronoun.

“It’s just more scare tactics by people who oppose all LGBT civil rights and protections,” he said in a statement last month.

But the language seemingly allows for the possibility, however remote.

The bill itself is aimed at protecting transgender and other LGBT individuals in hospitals, retirement homes and assisted living facilities. The bill would ensure those facilities accommodate transgender people and their needs, including letting them decide which gender-specific bathroom they prefer to use.

""It shall be unlawful for a long-term care facility or facility staff to take any of the following actions wholly or partially on the basis of a person’s actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status,"" the bill reads.

Among the unlawful actions are “willfully and repeatedly” failing to use a transgender person’s “preferred name or pronouns” after he or she is “clearly informed of the preferred name or pronouns.”

The law states that if provisions are violated, the violator could be punished by a fine “not to exceed one thousand dollars” or “by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed one year,” or both.

Wiener's office noted that violations for residential care facilities under existing law rarely resulted in criminal charges, especially for minor violations. Criminal penalties are meant more for violations that expose a patient to risk of death or serious harm, his office said.

Wiener’s office noted that the law “does not create any new criminal provisions,” but rather creates “new rights within an existing structure.”

One opponent of the law, the California Family Council's Greg Burt, slammed the measure when the bill was in its early stages.

Perhaps it’s appropriate that the first cover would feature a nearly naked Paltrow, covered in, you guessed it, gray goop — styled, no doubt, by a Sandro Botticelli fan.

But let’s be clear, this isn’t just any muddy goop. We are later led to believe that it is a special “French clay hailed for its detoxifying powers.”

Remember, nothing can be simple in Goop-land — this is the lifestyle brand that touted a $15,000 gold-plated vibrator on its website last year, after all.

So why would Paltrow, accomplished as she is, want to expand her website of inane ideas into the print world?

Well, the 45-year-old actress said she got the idea when she was 14 and an extended hospital stay left her little alternative but to thumb through stacks of Seventeen, Mademoiselle and Vogue.

What, was there no TV in the room?

The issue includes a story, “Frenemies with Benefits,” that may have high intentions in pitch meetings, but it ends up delving no deeper than slumber party chatter.

Beyond that, we get the usual mix of recipes and questionable health advice for which Goop is famous.

Bee-venom therapy can treat rheumatoid arthritis and soften scar tissue, we are told. Paltrow used it to treat her c-section scar but doesn’t offer compelling evidence that her therapy worked.

“Did it help? I think it did,” she says.

Goop dutifully points out that bee-venom therapy’s effectiveness has not been proven and that doctors warn that it can cause anaphylactic shock and strokes in patients who are allergic to bee venom.

For the less invasive practice, Paltrow turns to “earthing,” the increasingly popular practice of having more direct contact with the earth. Put simply, walking barefoot in grass. Paltrow swears it’s “healing.”

Paltrow also warns readers of things to stay away from. Like perfumes.

“‘Fragrance’ can represent any number of undisclosed ingredients, making that word on the label a Trojan horse for chemical compounds like phthalates, which, in some studies, have been shown to be harmful to humans,” the mag cautions.

The deeper you dig the more it becomes clear this case is about much more than bank fraud.","Perhaps you’ve lost track of the Democrat’s slowly exploding IT scandal, as much of the media is doing all it can to simply ignore it away.

I’m referring to the strange case of Imran Awan, the IT aide Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., kept on her congressional payroll even after it became known he and his wife, Hina Alvi Awan, were being investigated by the Capitol Police for possible theft, fraud, moving terabytes of data off Congress’s system and more.

Imran Awan was back in court last week. When pushed, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Mirando revealed some telling things about this case.

First, I should note that it was standing room only in the packed courtroom at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Friday morning ... okay, just kidding, actually, only a few reporters sat in the mostly empty wooden benches in the back of the courtroom. Anyone who didn’t know this was the latest scene in a slowly exploding political scandal would have thought this was only a forgettable bank fraud case.

The deeper you dig the more it becomes clear this case is about much more than bank fraud.

Awan’s attorney, Chris Gowen, even told me: “This case is hardly newsworthy.”

But before the show started, Imran’s wife, Hina Alvi Awan, entered the courtroom. She had flown away to Pakistan with their children soon after the investigation became known.

Was she back as part of a plea deal?

While Hina Alvi was gone, on August 17, 2017, a federal grand jury indicted her and Awan on four counts, including conspiracy and conspiring to obtain home equity loans for $165,000 and $120,000 from the Wright Patman Congressional Federal Credit Union and then transferring the money to Pakistan. (Read the FBI’s criminal affidavit on the bank fraud here and you’ll see why the government thinks it has a strong case.)

Imran Awan is considered such a flight risk that his passport was taken, he was given a curfew and was fitted with a tracking device.

Meanwhile, Hina Alvi’ passport was also publicly taken during the court hearing, but she was officially listed as a “walk in,” a tracking device wasn’t attached to her ankle and the government had asked the court to squash an outstanding warrant for her arrest.

Now came the revelations. Gowen, Imran’s attorney, asked that Imran’s travel restrictions be removed.

This prompted Assistant U.S. Attorney Mirando to say that when Imran was arrested at Dulles International Airport a cellphone found on him “had been wiped clean just a few hours before.”

Gowen tried to counter this by saying, “Awan had recently bought the phone, so of course it didn’t have any data on it.”

But Mirando was ready. He said the FBI found that the phone had been wiped as clean as Hillary’s server. A time stamp on the iPhone indicated it had been wiped at 6:30 p.m. that evening. Also, Imran did have a laptop on him, but one of the few things on it was a resume. Mirando used this and other details—such as the Awans quickly selling many of their Virginia properties—to explain that Imran had no intention of returning.

In another twist, Gowen brought up a computer that Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz wants back so badly she actually threatened the chief of the Capitol Police in a public hearing with “consequences” if she didn’t get it back.

Gowen argued that the computer and documents seized in a bag left in a public area of a congressional building around midnight on April 6, 2017, are “protected by attorney-client privilege.” Gowen hopes to remove this evidence from future court proceedings.

Gowen, however, didn’t answer what Imran was doing in the Longworth congressional building late at night and long after he’d been fired by every Democrat aside from Rep. Wasserman Schultz (Wasserman Schultz’s office isn’t in Longworth).

The deeper you dig the more it becomes clear this case is about much more than bank fraud. Capitol Police are investigating possible theft of congressional computer equipment, massive amounts of data moved off the congressional system, alleged fake computer data created to throw investigators off the trail, and data mined by the Awans that could include emails from many members of Congress and more.

Rep. Wasserman Schultz, who lost her post at the DNC when Wikileaks published emails showing that under her leadership the DNC worked to sabotage Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, might be exposed to even more revelations.

Meanwhile, Congress has been asked to open an ethics investigation to answer why Rep. Wasserman Schultz kept Imran on her payroll even after the Capitol Police investigation became known.

By The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board

Donald Trump’s weekend Twitter spat with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker is a familiar story: The President is a Party of One for whom personal loyalty is the only test. He isn’t going to change, so the meaningful question is how Republicans should navigate his periodic explosions to help the country and maintain their majorities in Congress.

Mr. Trump unleashed his tirade because he is still sore that Mr. Corker said this summer that the President hadn’t shown the stability or competence to be successful. The two later had it out in the Oval Office, but Mr. Corker stood by his words. And why shouldn’t he?

Mr. Corker was expressing views that are widely held on Capitol Hill and even within the Trump Administration. These men and women support the President’s policies, or at least most of them, and they remain in their jobs for the good of the cause and country. What they fear, and want to contain, are the President’s lack of discipline, short fuse, narcissism and habit of treating even foreign heads of state as if they are Rosie O’Donnell.

In other words, Mr. Corker was trying to be helpful by telling the truth. And he has standing to do so because he has tried to steer Mr. Trump in a constructive direction without personal grandstanding. He agreed to interview for Vice President until he withdrew from the running. He might have agreed to be Secretary of State had he been asked. And as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee he has had numerous private discussions with the President on a variety of national security subjects.

He is like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in engaging Mr. Trump even as he tells the President things he doesn’t like to hear. We hope they and others keep it up, understanding that doing so is difficult and might make them a target of the President’s wrath.",Wall Street Journal: The Truth About Trump and Corker,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/10/wall-street-journal-truth-about-trump-and-corker

Keep in mind that online ads aren’t necessarily a bad thing.","Is this just a coincidence? You recently looked at cameras online, and now you’re seeing ads for cameras. You were browsing new outfits, and now your browser is showing ads for shirts and trousers.

Not long ago, “interest-based advertising” creeped out a lot of people who couldn’t understand why Facebook, for example, knew what they had just shopped for on Amazon. The truth is that personalized ads are the result of a very impersonal process.

Interest-based advertising crunches bits of data gathered from your browser to make marketing more efficient. Special algorithms analyze your visits over time and across different websites, making it possible to predict your preferences and show ads that are likely to interest you.

But sometimes, all this tracking can be overwhelming. While the process is basically automatic and unmanned, interest-based ads can feel like an invasion of privacy. That’s why many people look for ways to throw the trackers off their scent.

Here are three simple ways to do just that.

1. Wipe out history, turn off cookies

To start, you’ll want a clean slate. You should eliminate any trace of your past searches by clearing all the browsing data, history, cache and cookies from your web browsers.

Next, disable or limit tracking on your gadget, including on favorite services like Facebook. If you’re not sure how how to do this, click here for the steps to wipe out where you’ve been and what you’ve done. Next, make sure to delete third-party advertising cookies. Click here to learn how to remove them and prevent them from coming back.

When you’re finished, take a moment to test your browser with an online security and privacy checker. I like the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s tool that shows you the information about the browser you’re using and your risk level. Click here for the free download and more details.

2. Opt out of ads

You may notice only a handful of culprits, but many companies use algorithms to track your behavior and send you targeted ads.

Thankfully, there’s a way for you to opt out of interest-based, or “behavioral,” ads. The Digital Advertising Alliance lets you review its participating partners. When you first visit the DAA, the websites will scan your computer. Once the scan is complete, you’ll be shown a list of partners advertising directly to you.

From there, you can learn more about the practices these companies use for interest-based ads. You can opt out using “opt-out cookies” that are stored in your browser with your preferences.

Click here for the steps to opt-out of this form of online targeted advertising.

3. Go incognito

Every major web browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera — has private, or incognito, browsing. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies, including ad-tracking cookies, and your computer won’t record your browsing history. It’s almost like you were never online.

When your browser is in private browsing mode, it will show a special icon. In Firefox, it’s a mask; in Chrome, it’s a little spy; in Edge, it’s “InPrivate.” These all indicate that you’re in incognito or private mode.

Private browsing will keep your computer safe from casual snoopers. Someone who jumps on your computer won’t see where you’ve been.

Keep in mind that online ads aren’t necessarily a bad thing. Yes, they can annoy us, but they’re also the reason most online content is free. Without them, media outlets and content creators would have to find a different source of revenue. For most of us, seeing a few presumptuous ads is a tiny price to pay.

Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi told an international conference on enhancing nuclear safety that Washington's recent ""delusionary negative postures do not augur well"" for keeping the deal intact.

He said Iran didn't want to see the deal unravel but that ""much more is at stake for the entire international community than the national interests of Iran.""

U.S. President Donald Trump is set to deliver a speech on Iran this week in which he is expected to decline to certify Iran's compliance in the landmark 2015 agreement, referring it to Congress, and perhaps targeting the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard with new sanctions.

Salehi praised the progress that had been made since the 2015 deal, saying nonproliferation and disarmament efforts had benefited worldwide. He called it ""simply too precious to be allowed to be undermined or weakened.""

""The failure of the nuclear deal will undermine the political credibility and international stature of the U.S. in this tumultuous political environment,"" Salhehi warned.

He concluded that he hoped ""common sense shall prevail.""

The U.S. administration has faced two 90-day certification deadlines to state whether Iran is meeting the conditions needed to continue enjoying sanctions relief under the deal and has both times backed away from a showdown. But Trump more recently has said he does not expect to certify Iran's compliance with the October deadline looming.

On Monday, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, praised the 2015 deal as a ""win-win"" solution that was working.

""We settled a milestone for nonproliferation and we prevented a dangerous devastating military escalation,"" she told the conference via video message, adding that the International Atomic Energy Agency had certified Iran's compliance with the deal, including via inspections, eight times since it was signed.

She warned that with rising nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula, ""We have an interest and a responsibility and a duty to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran"" and strengthening, not weakening the nonproliferation regime.

TRUMP TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION ON HEALTH CARE BY EXPANDING OPTIONS, REPORTS SAY

The president’s move comes after the GOP-led Senate failed to garner votes for a deal last month.

The president seemed to shift his focus from Republicans to Democrats over the weekend, saying he had spoken with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to collaborate on a health care plan. Trump told reporters on Saturday that he was willing to consider a “temporary deal.”

But Schumer said the president “wanted to make another run at ‘repeal and replace’ and I told the president that’s off the table.” Schumer noted that Democrats, however, were open to his suggestions.

The president has also tried negotiating with Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on an immigration package to help so-called 'Dreamers.' But Schumer and Pelosi balked at Trump's recent demands for border security and other measures as part of any deal.

The president lashed out at Democratic leaders Tuesday morning for their response.

“The problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don’t want secure borders, they don’t care about safety for U.S.A,” Trump tweeted.

TRUMP'S DACA DEMANDS MET WITH OUTRAGE FROM 'CHUCK AND NANCY'

In episode 3, “The Relaxation Integration,” Sheldon had to confront a brand new version of himself.

The episode opens with the gang having dinner, and Sheldon is more high strung than usual as he attempts to pick the perfect date for their wedding. He insists that he is smart enough to solve the problem of a perfect wedding date, but his friends balk when they hear that he’s issued save-the-dates for 80 dates. Later that night, the stress takes its toll as he has a dream featuring a more laid-back version of himself. This Sheldon goes with the flow, doesn’t have a care in the world and says things like “whatevs.” Amy hears him talking in his sleep and gets worried that wedding planning is too much for him.

Meanwhile, Bernadette tells Howard that she’s going out for drinks with a new co-worker. He immediately suggests setting her up with either Raj or Stewart. However, she insists that she just wants to make a work friend. If she grows not to like her, then she’ll “ruin her life with Stewart or Raj.”

Unfortunately, Howard wants his friends fixed up more than he wants his wife not to be mad at him. Raj and Stewart crash the meet up to fight for the single friend’s affection.

Meanwhile, Amy has recorded another session of laid-back Sheldon, which he isn’t happy to learn. He’s clearly upset at her for recording him in his sleep and capturing this new personality that his brain seems to be keeping from him without his consent. She explains that she’s just worried about him and tries to break down the psychology of what his dreams could mean.

“Don’t try to put science lipstick on your new-age pig!” he retorts.

Later, he confesses to Penny that he wants to try and adopt this laid-back Sheldon if his subconscious is clearly trying to bring it to the forefront.

Elsewhere, Raj and Stewart go out again with Bernadette’s friend, but come on just a bit too strong. She reveals that she’s not looking to date either of them and really just wants to make friends in a new city. Raj presses her for which one she would have chosen, while Stewart seizes the high-road and agrees to see her again just as friends. When she agrees, he immediately rubs victory in Raj’s face.

The episode ends with a disheveled and filthy Sheldon returning home to Amy. He shares a story that begins with him buying flip-flops only to lose one in a sewer grate. Being the new laid-back Sheldon, he attempted to retrieve it when he touched something furry, and things devolved from there. The ordeal helped him draw a conclusion - he needs her to plan the whole wedding. With that, an overjoyed Amy admits that she’s always wanted a June wedding, on a cliff, overlooking the sunset.

Hill violated the company’s social media guidelines a second time, according to ESPN, after she called on fans to take indirect action against the Dallas Cowboys after owner Jerry Jones told players they would be benched if they didn't stand up during the national anthem.

“Change happens when advertisers are impacted,” Hill wrote. “If you strongly reject what Jerry Jones said, the key is his advertisers.”

Hill wasn’t formally punished for mocking Trump on Twitter, but ESPN took action when she called for fans to boycott the Cowboys’ advertisers.

“Jemele Hill has been suspended for two weeks for a second violation of our social media guidelines. She previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet. In the aftermath, all employees were reminded of how much individual tweets may reflect negatively on ESPN and that such action would have consequences. Hence this decision,” an ESPN spokesman said in a statement.

In response, Hill's co-host on “SC6,” Michael Smith, chose to sit out Monday night's broadcast, in a “mutual” decision with ESPN, The Wrap reported.

Other supporters of Hill said they were outraged. Rev. Al Sharpton said the suspension “should NOT go unanswered. ESPN and advertisers will hear from us!”

Rosie O'Donnell tweeted “We are with you,” adding the hashtag #systemicRACISM.

Jones issued his edict before the Cowboys' game Sunday against the Green Bay Packers. It came after amid a backlash against players “taking a knee” during the national anthem, driven in part by President Trump's angry denouncement of what some players called legitimate social protest.

“I know this, we cannot ... in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,” Jones said. “We know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we're clear.”

Jones’ comments, the strongest made on the anthem controversy, came after he was asked about Vice President Mike Pence leaving the game in Indianapolis early after several San Francisco 49ers players took a knee during the national anthem. Hill, an outspoken liberal, tweeted that Jones “has created a problem for his players, specifically the black ones… If they don't kneel, some will see them as sellouts.”

The ESPN host wrote, “By drawing a line in the sand, Jerry put his players under more scrutiny and threw them under the bus... If the rationale behind JJ's stance is keeping the fanbase happy, make him see that he is underestimated how all of his fanbase feels.”

She urged “paying customers” to “boycott his advertisers” if they didn’t agree with Jones’ comments. Hill quoted a list of Cowboys’ advertisers in one of her tweets and sent a message to her 760,000-plus Twitter followers.

ESPN, the network that employs Hill, agreed to pay $15.2 billion in 2011 to air the NFL’s “Monday Night Football,” according to The New York Times. The NFL and its content are obviously extremely valuable to ESPN and Hill's latest violation will cost her two weeks of work.

ESPN declined comment regarding whether or not Hill will be paid during the suspension. The NFL declined comment when reached by Fox News.

Hill, who currently has a pair of photographs with former President Barack and Michelle Obama pinned atop her Twitter feed, co-hosts “SC6,” a relatively new version of the network’s flagship show, SportsCenter.

Hill was in the middle of a national story when she criticized President Trump on Twitter last month. Her tweets caught the attention of the White House and Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who said she considered the rhetoric a “fireable offense.” Trump even took to Twitter himself to mock ESPN and demand an apology.

“Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has surrounded himself with other white supremacists,” Hill wrote on Sept 11. She called him “the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime.” Hill also called Trump a “bigot,” and “unqualified and unfit to be president.” She even added: “If he were not white, he never would have been elected.”

There was speculation that ESPN wanted to sideline Hill for one episode of “SC6” as a result of the Trump tweets but her co-host, Michael Smith, refused to do the show without her. Citing “two sources familiar with the situation,” Think Progress reported last month that ESPN executives reached out to other black hosts to fill in. According to the website, ESPN scrapped the idea when two African-American ESPN hosts declined to fill in for Hill and Smith. The outspoken duo hosted the show that night. ESPN denied that it attempted to find alternative hosts.

Hill eventually admitted that she cried over the situation in a meeting with ESPN President John Skipper, but didn't exactly apologize to Trump or his supporters.

“Since my tweets criticizing President Donald Trump exploded into a national story, the most difficult part for me has been watching ESPN become a punching bag and seeing a dumb narrative kept alive about the company’s political leanings,” Hill wrote.

“It was the first time I had ever cried in a meeting. I didn’t cry because Skipper was mean or rude to me. I cried because I felt I had let him and my colleagues down,” Hill wrote in a commentary on the ESPN site The Undefeated.

Jones and the rest of the Cowboys kneeled arm-in-arm before the national anthem before a game against the Arizona Cardinals two weeks ago, days after Trump reignited the anthem-protest controversy with a series of tweets. Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the Anthem last season in protest of what he believed were instances of racial injustice in the U.S. He is currently out of the league and many feel his political stance is why no team has given him an opportunity to play in 2017.

Back in 2014, ESPN suspended Bill Simmons for criticizing NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. The following year his contract was not renewed by the network. Hill was also suspended nearly a decade ago when she compared Boston Celtics fans to Nazis in a blog on ESPN’s website in 2008.",ESPN’s Jemele Hill suspended from network for two weeks,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/09/espn-s-jemele-hill-suspended-from-network-for-two-weeks.html

Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task.
The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving.
It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving.
Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.","The infotainment technology that automakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, an AAA study says.

The study released Thursday is the latest by University of Utah professor David Strayer, who has been examining the impact of infotainment systems on safety for AAA's Foundation for Traffic Safety since 2013. Past studies also identified problems, but Strayer said the ""explosion of technology"" has made things worse.

Automakers now include more options to allow drivers to use social media, email and text. The technology is also becoming more complicated to use. Cars used to have a few buttons and knobs. Some vehicles now have as many as 50 buttons on the steering wheel and dashboard that are multi-functional. There are touch screens, voice commands, writing pads, heads-up displays on windshields and mirrors and 3-D computer-generated images.

""It's adding more and more layers of complexity and information at drivers' fingertips without often considering whether it's a good idea to put it at their fingertips,"" Strayer said. That complexity increases the overall amount of time drivers spend trying to use the systems.

The auto industry says the new systems are better alternatives for drivers than mobile phones and navigation devices that were not designed to be used while driving.

The vehicle-integrated systems ""are designed to be used in the driving environment and require driver attention that is comparable to tuning the radio or adjusting climate controls, which have always been considered baseline acceptable behaviors while driving,"" said Wade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.

But Jake Nelson, AAA's director for traffic safety advocacy and research, said drivers took their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel while using infotainment systems in each of the 30 cars and light trucks, all 2017 models, that were tested in the study. The drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.

Clearly automakers haven't worked hard enough to make the systems quick and easy to use, Nelson said. Researchers rated 23 of the 30 vehicles ""very high"" or ""high"" in terms of the attention they demanded from drivers. Seven were rated ""moderate."" None required a low amount of attention to use.

Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task. At 25 mph (40 kph), a car can travel the length of four football fields during the time it takes to enter a destination. Previous research has shown that drivers who remove their eyes from the road for just two seconds double their risk for a crash.

Under pressure from the industry, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2012 issued voluntary safety guidelines to automakers for dashboard technology instead of enforceable safety standards. The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving. However, the ability to program navigation while driving was available in 12 vehicles in the study.

The guidelines also recommend automakers prevent drivers from texting while driving, but three-quarters of the vehicles tested permit drivers to text while the car is moving. Texting was the second-most distracting task performed by test drivers.

Drivers looked away from the road less when using voice commands, but that safety benefit was offset by the increased amount of time drivers spent interacting with the systems.

AAA said drivers should use infotainment technologies ""only for legitimate emergencies or urgent, driving-related purposes."" It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving. Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.

Nearly 70 percent of U.S. adults say they want the new technologies in their vehicles, but only 24 percent feel that the technology already works perfectly, according to an opinion survey conducted for AAA.

""Drivers want technology that is safe and easy to use,"" said Marshall Doney, AAA's president and CEO, ""but many of the features added to infotainment systems today have resulted in overly complex and sometimes frustrating user experiences for drivers.""",Technology crammed into cars worsens driver distraction,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/06/technology-crammed-into-cars-worsens-driver-distraction.html

He recalls the first day he stepped on American soil:“It was a very beautiful day,” he says.
Instead, he started working for the Minneapolis School District and then the city’s housing authority.
Along the way, Tufaa maried and he and his wife have five children ranging in age from eight to 21.
“I believe in the American dream because I appreciate what this country can provide to people like me,” Tufaa says.","When Minneapolis entrepreneur Tashitaa Tufaa came to the United States from his native Ethiopia he quickly embodied the American spirit.

The political refugee, now in his late 40s, came to this country in 1992 with nothing to his name and worked his way up from washing dishes to running his own transportation company that still continues to grow.

Tufaa says that his drive was inspired by his adopted home.

“I had read a lot about America,” he said in a recent interview with Fox News. “Even though I had never been, I have always been a fan of the American way.”

Tuftaa was born in the Ethiopian village of Aloo and grew up working on his family’s farm with his 13 siblings until he attended an American college in Zimbabwe. He eventually returned to Ethiopia, where he was a history and English teacher until the early 90s when he decided to leave due to his native country’s changing political climate.

“I wasn’t forced to leave my country,” he says. “I just knew that it was time to leave when I saw politicians fleeing. I knew it wasn’t safe. I came here and decided not to go back.”

“Even though I had never been, I have always been a fan of the American way...” - Tashitaa Tufaa

He was granted political asylum and wound up in the city of Minneapolis, where he stayed in low-income housing with old college friends who had emigrated from Zimbabwe. He recalls the first day he stepped on American soil:

“It was a very beautiful day,” he says. “I was in downtown Minneapolis. I was amazed by the tall buildings and how clean it was compared to where I came from.”

Tufaa says that during those initial days in the U.S. it was difficult to find a job, but he never once thought about wavering.

“It was definitely hard. If you wanted a white-collar job, there were not many available,” he says. “My first job was as a dishwasher at the Minneapolis Hilton for $5.60 an hour and I thought at the time that it was great.”

Tufaa washed dishes for about ten months before moving on to a manufacturing job and a security position before enrolling in graduate school at the University of Minnesota. He continued working security jobs as he went through school.

“I would work until midnight and during the day in between my morning and afternoon classes,” he recalled. “I had few hours to sleep, but the biggest thing was these opportunities for work. We were not able to get this back home. You were lucky if you were able to get one job, here, I could get three jobs.”

Tufaa eventually graduated from school and wanted to pursue a career as a diplomat but quickly found out that he would have to be a U.S. citizen to do so (he became a citizen in 2000). Instead, he started working for the Minneapolis School District and then the city’s housing authority. He also worked extra jobs as a taxi and bus driver.

“I would leave work at 4:30 and then go drive a bus,” he says.

In 2003, he was laid off from his job with the city.

“That’s when I decided to form my own company.”

The determined Tufaa set out to market himself to school districts in the area, looking to provide transportation services for students.

“It was rough building it up,” the entrepreneur said. “On paper, my company was incorporated, but technically, I had no experience. People generally don’t trust you if you can’t show them your experience.”

In September of that year, Tufaa finally started gaining that experience when he started providing bus services to a handful of special needs students. School administrators took notice of the stellar job he did and he started receiving more and more work from the district, putting nearly all of his profits back into the business.

Eventually, Tufaa was able to establish his company, Metropolitan Transportation Network (MetroTN) and soon after he received his first large contract with the Beacon Academy School after their original bus provider went out of business mid-year. About 300 of the school’s 400 plus students ride MetroTN buses to this day.

Business continued to grow for Tufaa and MetroTN now boasts three facilities in the state, with a fourth on the way in October. The company currently includes 300 employees, including several family members who also emigrated from Ethiopia.

“They had to apply like everyone else,” he says, half-joking.

Along the way, Tufaa maried and he and his wife have five children ranging in age from eight to 21.

He looks to continue the expansion of MetroTN and serve other facets of public transportation in the city he has called home for nearly 25 years.

“I believe in the American dream because I appreciate what this country can provide to people like me,” Tufaa says.

Supporters of single-payer health care should realize the error of their ways, because single-payer isn't a shortcut to universal health care.","Do people who are overweight or obese deserve health care? In the United Kingdom's socialized health care system, the answer appears to be ""no."" And if Democrats get their way, the same could be true in the United States.

To save money, the U.K. National Health Service recently announced it will ban obese patients from many surgeries for up to a year. Such rationing is standard in single-payer health care systems. Americans will face the same fate if Democrats can enact Medicare for All here.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently introduced his Medicare for All bill backed by 15 other Democratic senators. His call to create such a single-payer health care system was a major part of his failed campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.

Known as ""lifestyle rationing,"" the new British policy debunks the myth that single-payer systems deliver truly universal health care.

In addition, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is urging Democrats to make single-payer a centerpiece of their upcoming campaigns.

Known as ""lifestyle rationing,"" the new British policy debunks the myth that single-payer systems deliver truly universal health care.

The rule applies to patients with a body mass index of 30 or higher. It would hit a 5-foot-10 man who weighs more than 209 pounds, or a 5-foot-4 woman who weighs more than 174 pounds. These patients will have to wait a year, or lose 10 percent of their weight, before they can receive elective surgeries like hip or knee replacements.

The National Health Service in Britain believes such discriminatory rationing is the ""best way of achieving maximum value from the limited resources available.""

Of course, overweight people aren't the only ones denied care in single-payer systems. The bureaucrats who run them have little choice but to ration care for everyone.

When patients pay virtually nothing for health care, they have little incentive to limit their consumption. If someone feels even slightly under the weather, he or she can immediately go to the doctor and demand medicine, rather than simply rest up and hydrate. So patients flood doctor's offices and hospitals.

With no market forces at work to regulate demand, the only way for the government to keep costs under control is to forcibly limit the supply of medical services.

Single-payer systems do so by offering doctors and hospitals relatively paltry sums for their services. The average general practitioner in the United Kingdom earns about $130,000 per year. By contrast, a general practitioner in America earns over $200,000 annually, on average.

This combination of lower pay and seemingly limitless demand for care is causing many British doctors to leave the medical field – or go elsewhere to practice. There are 7,000 fewer doctors in the United Kingdom today than in 2005. In just the first month of this year, nearly 300 doctors applied for certificates to work overseas.

In addition, fewer medical students are completing their educations. In 2016, half of junior doctors left the National Health Service after their first two years of training. That is an abrupt increase from 2011, when less than three in ten junior doctors exited.

As a result, the National Health Service is in the midst of an unprecedented staffing shortage. More than 30,600 positions are currently vacant. Almost 40 percent of those openings are for nurses and midwives.

So patients wait. More than 4 million are standing by for surgery – the highest figure in a decade.

The single-payer system in Canada is hardly better, particularly for patients seeking specialist care. According to the Fraser Institute, the median wait time between referral from a general practitioner and treatment by a specialist in 2016 was 20 weeks – the longest on record.

America's own experiment with single-payer – the Veterans Health Administration in the Department of Veterans Affairs – is a national embarrassment. A federal investigation found that more than 200 veterans died while waiting for care at a Phoenix VA facility in 2015. The same is true of almost 100 veterans at a Los Angeles VA hospital between October 2014 and August 2015.

These horror stories are worth remembering now that the apparent failure of the GOP's health care reform effort has revived calls for single-payer in the United States.

Some U.S. doctors appear to be falling in line behind liberal icons Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. According to a new survey from Merritt Hawkins, a physician recruiting firm, 42 percent of doctors strongly support single-payer. Fourteen percent are somewhat supportive.

Supporters of single-payer health care should realize the error of their ways, because single-payer isn't a shortcut to universal health care. As the experiences of other countries prove, it's a pathway to grotesque rationing, long waiting lines and needless suffering.","Single-payer health care means you might be denied surgery for being too fat -- no, really",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/single-payer-health-care-means-might-be-denied-surgery-for-being-too-fat-no-really.html

But when they arrived at the unnamed airport for the return trip — seen in the photo with severely swollen faces and bandages around their heads — immigration officers at passport control didn’t believe them when they tried to prove their identity, despite displaying their tickets and various documents, according to the report.

Tesla’s entrepreneurial boss Elon Musk claims his cars “already have the hardware needed for a full self-driving capability”, known in the industry as a “Level Five” engineering standard.

However in a briefing about autonomous cars to Australian media in Detroit overnight, Scott Miller, General Motors’ director of autonomous vehicle integration said “I think he’s full of crap”, when asked what he thought about Musk’s claim.

“If you think you can see everything you need for a Level Five autonomous (car) with cameras and radar, I don’t know how you do that,” said Mr Miller.

“To be what an SAE Level Five full autonomous system is, I don’t think he (Elon Musk) has the content to do that.”

The car industry tests extensively before releasing new technology to the public.

“We put the customer in the middle of everything; we think it’s irresponsible to say (a car has fully autonomous capability) at this point,” said Mr Miller.

“The level of technology in doing what it takes to do … Level Four or Level Five, which is cameras and radar, I don’t think it’s physically possible (with what Tesla currently has),” he said.

“I think you need the right sensors and the right computer package to do it. We have lydar, radar and cameras on (our cars). The reason we have that type of sensor package is … to be deeply integrated into Level Five, you should have some redundancies (back-up measures in case of equipment failures).”

Mr Miller added: “Do you really want to trust one sensor measuring the speed of a car coming into an intersection before you pull out? I think you need some confirmation.”

Mr Miller said lydar and radar systems do a good job of measuring object speed and cameras do a great job of identifying objects.

Tesla’s autopilot hardware technology suite includes eight cameras, one radar and ultrasonic sensors.

“You can use the right sensor images to give you competence in what you’re seeing,” said Mr Miller. “That’s important if we’re going to put this technology out for general consumption to the public.

“Could you do it with what’s in the current (Tesla) Model S? I don’t think so.”

Jenkins, who has raised a fist during the national anthem since Week 2 of last season, told NBC Sports Philadelphia if Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie enacted a rule similar to what Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he would do, it would not stop him from demonstrating.

""I would still do it,"" Jenkins said. ""I mean, I've been that committed to it because that decision is not mine. I made the decision a year ago that I was going to use my platform in a way to create positive change both on the field and off the field and having someone tell me I couldn't do that simply because, you know, a president or your bottom line is getting ready to be affected, that wouldn't deter me.""

Jones said Sunday after the Cowboys’ loss to the Green Bay Packers that any player that chose to “disrespect” the flag by kneeling during the national anthem would not play. He doubled-down on those comments Sunday in an interview with ESPN.

Jenkins reiterated to NBC Sports Philadelphia that the demonstrations during the national anthem were not about the flag and were “in no way disrespectful to our flag, country or service members.”

""I think we've made that very clear that what we are demonstrating about has nothing to do with the flag but everything to do with social injustice, racial inequality and the things that, you know, Jerry Jones and other owners who are making statements have yet to address,"" he said.

Jenkins said he would like for NFL owners to talk about the issues that players are protesting against – racial injustice, police brutality and the education gap – to move the conversation forward.

The Eagles veteran has been one of the most prominent leaders of the NFL protests since San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick opted out of his contract this past offseason.

Yahoo Sports reported last month Jenkins, teammate Torrey Smith, Seattle Seahawks’ Michael Bennett and former NFL player Anquan Boldin co-authored a letter to the league office asking for money, political involvement and other commitments from the league. It also asked the NFL to recognize the month of November as activism awareness month.

This mural is like a giant puzzle – more than 400 feet wide to be exact – and some of its missing pieces may never be found.

But that's not stopping the National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City from trying to collect the remnants of the Panthéon de la Guerre, an iconic work commemorating about 6,000 allied figures from the Great War.

""People are amazed when they see it,"" senior curator Doran Cart told Fox News, whose museum is displaying a smaller version of the painting after it shifted ownership following World War I, was cut apart and then repurposed by an American artist.

“It is still an important mural even though it’s not as large as it once was, it still contained this whole idea of honoring the allies,"" Cart said.

The original painting was completed in Paris in 1918 by around 140 artists working under the guidance of French artists Pierre Carrier-Belleuse and Auguste Gorguet. In a specially built octagonal building to house the painting, artists pieced together a 402-foot-long circular canvas, which was also 45 feet high, making it one of the largest murals in the world.

“The artists’ work progressed under the depressing atmosphere of many military reversals – at times the gloom was heavy – the thousands of casualties in an apparently hopeless struggle did not build up a very spirited artistic atmosphere,” American soldier Daniel MacMorris, who later revised the work, wrote in a 1958 letter to a reporter at Britain’s Daily Telegraph. “They kept doggedly at it, like men who are determined to finish the embellishment of a great tomb.”

The Panthéon de la Guerre (translated Pantheon of War) contained 3,000 actual portraits of French military men and around three million people viewed the painting in Paris until it was taken down in 1927, according to MacMorris.

It then made its way across the Atlantic for a U.S. tour, stopping in New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago’s World’s Fair in 1933-34 before being stored outside in a 55-foot crate in Baltimore.

HOW WORLD WAR I CHANGED THE WORLD FOREVER

William Haussner, a Baltimore art collector, restaurant owner and World War I German soldier, scooped up the painting at a local auction in 1952 for $3,400, according to an article in LIFE magazine.

""He kind of rearranged it. Instead of the French being in the middle, he put the Americans in the middle."" - World War I Museum Senior Curator Doran Cart

“He tried every possible avenue to get some organization to take it over and install it in its original form in a suitable building,” MacMorris wrote. “Over many years there seemed to arise several possibilities but no one actually did anything about it. It was deteriorating in a box in outdoor storage all the time and Mr. Haussner was paying $100 per month storage.”

Haussner had one look at the painting a year later, as he hired a 48-foot long trailer truck, three cranes and 22 workmen to bring the Panthéon de la Guerre to a parking lot and unroll it, LIFE magazine reported.

“I think it’s real pretty,” Haussner was quoted as saying as he spent hours walking up and down the artwork.

But over time, the elements took their toll on the mural and left portions of it gone forever.

“While it was laying outside, the sky and the battlefields -- which were two thirds of the painting -- were basically destroyed by the weather,” Cart told Fox News.

MacMorris, who worked at an art institute at the time, was able to convince Haussner to donate the painting to the Liberty Memorial Association in Kansas City in 1957, where it would finally get a home – but it would have to be showcased on a smaller scale. The Association owns the Museum.

“Had we not acquired it for Kansas City it seemed doomed for eventual destruction in the hands of some junk dealer,” he said.

MacMorris photographed the painting and cut some figures out of the photos while trying to decide how to downsize the massive artwork. He then took scissors and a paintbrush to the canvas.

“He squeezed this large painting into this current space which is about 40 feet long and 13 feet high,” Cart told Fox News. “He kind of rearranged it. Instead of the French being in the middle, he put the Americans in the middle. In the original, the Americans were at the end since they came in late in the war in 1917.”

The artist also painted new faces into the mural: Carrier-Belleuse and Gorguet, former presidents Harry Truman and Franklin Roosevelt, and a Woodrow Wilson-like quote.

The revised Pantheon made its debut at the museum in 1959 after more than two years of work.

GERMAN WORLD WAR I SUBMARINE DISCOVERED WITH 23 BODIES INTACT

MacMorris said the American focus of his work was to pay tribute to Wilson’s efforts to form the post-World War I League of Nations.

“The purpose of my rearrangement is not the glorification of the U.S.A. nor the dimming of any other nation’s glory but, instead, to render homage to Woodrow Wilson and the League of Nations,” he said. “The exaltation of the brotherhood of man, and the suppression of tyranny – in other words the inception of the United Nations of today.”

The unused scraps of the Pantheon were either thrown out or given away – some back to Haussner, who put them up in his restaurant until he died. Other pieces were handed to art students who helped MacMorris with his vision and influential Kansas City residents.

Cart said the museum is hoping to collect as many of these missing pieces as possible to show them in exhibitions in person and online. Some -- like the large remnants Haussner had -- are still out there somewhere.

The museum doesn’t have a specific number as to how many pieces exist, but believes there are “dozens and dozens of fragments.”

One of the more recent submissions has been a several foot-wide piece of a French cavalry soldier riding on a horse, Cart said. Other fragments in the museum’s archives have been put on display in the past.

“Over the years… we have acquired many fragments that were removed and people were getting up in age and they all knew MacMorris, [so] they donated back to the museum,” Cart told Fox News. “We never really know when these are going to turn up.”",World War I Museum hoping to uncover lost pieces of iconic mural,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/10/world-war-museum-hoping-to-uncover-lost-pieces-iconic-mural.html

Jones’ comments, the strongest made on the anthem controversy, came after he was asked about Vice President Mike Pence leaving the game in Indianapolis early after several San Francisco 49ers players took a knee during the national anthem.

""I know this, we cannot ... in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,"" he said following the Cowboys’ 35-31 loss to the Green Bay Packers. ""We know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we're clear.""

Jones and the rest of the team kneeled arm-in-arm before the national anthem before a game against the Arizona Cardinals two weeks ago, days after President Trump reignited the anthem-protest controversy.

Dallas players have stood on the sideline, many with hands over their hearts, during the anthem ever since former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling last season in protest of what he believed were instances of racial injustice in the U.S.

Jones said showing respect for the flag and the anthem is more important to him than any potential issues of team unity.

""There is no room here if it comes between looking non-supportive of our players and of each other or creating the impression that you're disrespecting the flag, we will be non-supportive of each other,"" Jones said. ""We will not disrespect the flag.""

Jones said he wasn't aware of whether any of his players had raised a fist at the end of the anthem before the Green Bay game.

""I don't know about that,"" Jones said. ""But if there's anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then we will not play. OK? Understand? If we are disrespecting the flag, then we won't play. Period.""

Additionally, Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said he changed his view on how his team should handle the national anthem. Ross said because Trump made standing for the national anthem about “patriotism,” he evolved the way he looks at the protest, according to the Miami Herald.

Ross now wants all of the Dolphins players to stand for the anthem. Three Dolphins players – Kenny Stills, Julian Thomas and Michael Thomas – remained off to the sideline during the anthem Sunday.

The NFL has said the game operations manual distributed to teams includes a reference to players standing for the anthem, but that it's a policy and not a rule. The league has said it doesn't plan to punish players over anthem protests.

""The league in mind should absolutely take the rules we've got on the books and make sure that we do not give the perception that we're disrespecting the flag,"" Jones said.

Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper.""","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on Acculturated.com.

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

During my years of painting people’s homes, I’ve learned that small spaces don’t have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home’s exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I’ve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home’s overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home’s design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn’t too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it’s between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room’s features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

8. Laundry room. You can’t avoid the task of laundry, so at least make it a room that is easy on the eyes and generates positivity. Think of a paint color you would never dream of using in the social areas of your home but would make you happy, such as a playful orange, a bold purple or a sunshine yellow. Who knows, being around your favorite color might even make the chore a little more enjoyable.",Transform a whole house by painting these 8 small spaces,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/22/transform-whole-house-by-painting-these-8-small-spaces.html

Russell Salic donated money to charity but never to terrorists, renounces terrorism and has never held a gun in his life, lawyer Dalomilang Parahiman said in an interview.

U.S. prosecutors said Friday that Salic was one of three Islamic State group sympathizers who plotted bombings and shootings to take place at New York City concert venues, subway stations and Times Square last year before U.S. agents thwarted the plot.

Canadian citizen Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy was arrested in the U.S. last year and has pleaded guilty, and an American of Pakistani origin, Talha Haroon, was arrested in Pakistan in November.

In May last year, Salic allegedly sent approximately $423 from the Philippines to an undercover FBI agent posing as an Islamic extremist to help fund the planned New York attacks. Salic, who allegedly was known to fellow extremists as ""Abu Khalid"" or ""the doctor,"" also informed the undercover agent that he intended to continue sending money in support of the Islamic State group in the future, according to court documents made public in New York.

Salic allegedly told the undercover agent that his ultimate goal was to join the Islamic State group in Syria but that ""it would be a great pleasure if we can slaughter"" people in New York, the documents said.

Salic's lawyer, however, quoted him as saying, ""I only donated money for humanitarian consideration out of pity for the needy but I have never thought of giving funds to the ISIS,"" using an acronym of the Islamic State group.

Once, Salic donated money to prevent students from losing their teacher, who had not been receiving his salary, Parahiman said. An online posting about his good deed prompted many other people to seek the doctor's help, though he was only able to help about five nongovernment groups and people, including an Australian, Parahiman said.

The lawyer also said Salic told him his Facebook account was hacked, allowing the hacker to chat with others while pretending to be the doctor. Salic decided to surrender to Manila's National Bureau of Investigation in April after being informed by Philippine airport officials that he was being sought for terrorism-linked charges.

Salic then planned to travel to Hong Kong but did not proceed with the trip.

Chief State Counsel Ricardo Paras told AP the U.S. government sent an extradition request in May. The Philippine government filed the request before a Manila court on behalf of the U.S. and hearings on the request would start next week.

In Islamabad, lawyer Idrees Ashraf said a Pakistani court will hear a bail plea this week by Haroon, who faces possible extradition to the United States for allegedly conspiring to plot the New York attacks.

Judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqi of the Islamabad High Court on Tuesday asked for a response from the Interior Ministry to Haroon's plea and set the next hearing for Friday, Ashraf said. He said his client's father, Haroon Rashid, previously obtained a stay of his son's extradition from the same court, saying his son is innocent and would be in danger if sent to the United States.

Haroon's extradition was approved by a district magistrate in January.

Aside from the U.S. charges, Salic also faces separate criminal complaints for alleged involvement in the abduction of six sawmill workers, two of whom were later beheaded, in the southern Philippine town of Butig in Lanao del Sur province in 2016, according to Philippine prosecutors.

Even if the Manila court approves the U.S. extradition request, the Department of Justice in Manila would have to decide whether to have Salic face criminal complaints in the Philippines first or be flown to the U.S. to answer the terrorism allegations there, Paras said.

The kidnappings and beheadings have been blamed on the Maute group, a band of militants aligned with IS that was largely unknown until it led a siege of southern Marawi city in May.

""I felt like death,"" Kaheel said, her voice strained. ""Thank god I survived the (delivery), but my diarrhea hasn't stopped.""

The Red Cross has warned that cholera, a diarrheal disease that has been eradicated in most developed countries, could infect a million people in Yemen by the end of the year.

Two and a half years of war have sapped Yemen of the money and medical facilities it needs to battle the contagion, to which aid agencies and medics say the poor, the starving, the pregnant and the young are most vulnerable.

The cholera ward is full of children - some writhing in agony, others eerily still. The blanket over one boy too weak to move rises and falls with his shallow breathing.

Save the Children said in August that children under 15 represent nearly half of new cases and a third of deaths, with malnourished children more than six times more likely to die of cholera than well-fed ones.

Millions of Yemenis are struggling to find food and the baking desert plains around Hodeidah are hotspots both of hunger and sickness.

Yemen's war pits the armed Houthi movement against the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition that has launched thousands of air strikes to restore him to power.

At least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

The country's health sector has been badly battered while a struggle over the central bank has left public sector salaries for doctors and sanitation workers unpaid.

Soumaya Beltifa, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Sanaa, warned that a lack of funds and health personnel were blunting efforts to eradicate the disease, making it unlikely Yemen would be healthy again soon.

It was her eyes, though, that truly terrified me. You could see the unrelenting, unshakable, unmovable fear they held.

In all fairness, nothing about fear should shock us. We’ve all been fearful at some point in our own lives.

But this was different.

This was a terrifying mix for when anger, shock and absolute horror all roll into one perilous package. It was as if you were about to tell someone they were going to...and then I knew what was about to happen.

And there is no preparation for it. None.

The doctor looked at me, looked at her patient, my wife Jennifer, and then looked down at the paperwork she had in front of her that contained Jen's test results. She repeated this over and over, as if she didn’t believe what her eyes were telling her.

When she finally stopped, the words for her were hard to find. But when she did speak, our world would be transformed forever.

The prognosis came in two parts. First, Jennifer’s thyroid had stopped working—certainly not good but something that happens to many people and was treatable. However, the second part was devastating: her kidneys were near total failure and her body was shutting down. If emergency measures weren’t enacted—and soon—she would be dead within six weeks.

Six weeks.

No one said anything at first. Then, after maybe ten seconds, we all looked at each other—no one really had a reaction. It felt like, for a moment, in that doctor’s office, time stopped.

For me, when I heard the news my reaction was paused for a simple reason: I wanted to cry, scream and yell—all at the same time.

I instantly blamed myself. I knew I should have pushed Jen to go to the doctor sooner. I should have been persistent, I should have seen the signs for what they were. But we kept making excuses for what was happening for months, and now we were paying the price—perhaps the ultimate price.

You see, starting in January 2015, Jennifer, the love of my life, my best friend—my everything—saw her health slowly start to slip away.

At first, we dismissed her symptoms as the result of her efforts to lose weight through diet and exercise. But as her health became gradually worse—her energy level deteriorated, she felt aches and pains throughout her body and felt awful all the time—we started to worry.

By the time the summer rolled around, things had gotten much worse. Jennifer was now losing weight dramatically. By July, she had lost almost seventy pounds in seven months. When we would go to the grocery store, separating into different aisles, there would be times I couldn’t find her as she looked like a completely different person.

Even at this point we dismissed the symptoms—now blaming Jennifer’s stressful job as a travelling psychologist, treating adolescent patients in some of the most poverty stricken and crime ridden neighborhoods of Washington, D.C.—as the culprit. It would take me comparing pictures of her from then to a few years prior to understand she needed medical treatment—or I might lose her.

When we walked out of the doctor’s office and went out onto the street we both grabbed for each other. Our heads nearly collided, each of us sobbing, shaking and crying uncontrollably, a reaction that words could never do justice to.

We both said at the same time: “What are we going to do?”

Once the shock washed away she did the only thing she could do, the only thing left to do: fight for her life.

And let there be no doubt, this was a battle that would test Jennifer’s will to live, test the strength of our marriage and make us rethink everything that was important to us.

Forever.

But just like every battle, there are some constants that aren’t changeable.

Ask anyone who has fought kidney disease and they will tell you a hard truth: you don’t ever beat it. You can become stable, even achieve some sort of remission from its unrelenting advance, but once your kidneys start to have problems they don’t ever heal themselves, they never return to their ‘normal’ state. So, the best result we could hope for in the war for Jennifer’s life was a draw, that no matter how hard she battled, no matter how much I supported her, no matter what sacrifice she was willing to make, all we could hope for is that it would not get any worse.

With this knowledge in hand, Jennifer’s struggle would begin.

The first order of battle began with constant visits to George Washington Hospital here in Washington, D.C. for battery after battery of tests. The constant blood work, doctor’s appointments and follow-up checkups were exhausting.

But none of that would compare to a kidney biopsy.

In what should be the latest Lannister torture method from ""Game of Thrones,"" Jennifer laid down on her stomach with her hands extended, holding onto what can only be described as grips. She was then given a small amount of numbing medication. After about a minute the doctor used a small device to remove a small 1cm piece of her kidney—while she was awake. When she came back to her hospital room she cried for hours as the pain was so intense.

Jennifer’s struggle, though, was just beginning.

Her kidney functioning levels were dropping fast and the amount of poison in her blood was increasing. If this could not be stopped, she would soon need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Her doctors recommended she be placed on steroids that could, emphasis on could, help stabilize her and maybe allow her kidneys to function slightly better. But there was a big downside to this treatment. Not only would Jennifer gain weight dramatically, but she would become temporarily—but horribly—disfigured as her whole body would swell uncontrollably.

She asked what other options she had. The doctor responded quite simply: “None.”

And with that, Jennifer’s descent into hell began.

If there was a dark time in this whole ordeal—or darker than any other—this was it. Jennifer was placed on the highest possible steroid dosage a person can take. From January 2016 to May of that year, Jen would be able to do very little as her arms and legs would begin to swell nonstop. When she did go outside, if she even had the energy to do so, people would shun her, as her face swelled to the point where she could no longer smile or make normal facial expressions. If she went to buy shoes, since all her pre-kidney disease shoes no longer fit, no one would wait on her. People would go to the other side of the street when they saw her, giving her dirty looks, time and time again.

Eventually, she stopped going outside—the physical and now emotional pain was too much to bear. The only thing that brought her joy was sitting by the window in our apartment, to feel a little bit a part of the outside world, looking down from six floors up as people walked to work or went about their lives. She would ask me constantly: “Am I going to die?” or “Is this my fate? To slowly rot away, just watching the world pass me by?”

Compounding all of this was the havoc this caused on her personally and professionally. She was fired from her job—they simply could not hold her position any longer after being out of the office for months. That meant she now had no health insurance—what could have been a death sentence, as the costs of treatment could easily bankrupt someone if they could not afford a private insurance plan that covered kidney disease. Thankfully my employer was able to add her to my plan quickly.

There was also the challenge of having to apply for Social Security Disability—a process so painful, so soul draining, so time consuming that it is hard for me to fathom how anyone can successfully navigate the process, especially if you’re sick. Despite countless forms that needed to be filled out repeatedly—with Jennifer’s hands so swollen at times it proved nearly impossible—hours and hours on the phone with lawyers and being sent for medical evaluations for the wrong things, Jennifer fought hard to get the assistance she needed. To this day, after one year of waiting and two denials in what should be a cut and dry case, Jennifer will now have to fight the federal government in court for the help she deserves. If we were not married and Jen needed Social Security and Medicare for survival she would already be dead.

Watching Jennifer go through all of this, knowing I could do almost nothing to help, took its toll on me as well.

This is where I started to break—and where our marriage was tested. How does one emotionally make peace with the fact that they are potentially watching their wife die?

At first, I became very quiet, withdrawn from the world. I then became very angry, feeling like we were robbed of the life we planned. Jennifer and I started to fight about anything—everything—as we did not know how to interact anymore. We did not know how to live in a world where she might not be part of it for much longer. And that scared me to my core.

Thankfully, our marriage would hold through this tough time—and get even stronger. We sat down one day and faced our fears together. Through hours of tough talk, laughter, heartache and sobbing, we admitted our greatest fear: not wanting to lose each other. We made a deal, right then and there: that no matter what, we would not take out our fears out on one another. That we would fight this no matter what, hand and hand, side by side, to the end—no matter where that brought us.

And then a small miracle happened. We made the decision to move out of the hustle and bustle of Washington, D.C. to the quiet suburbs of Rockville, 20 miles north. There, Jennifer and I spent the summer of 2016 laughing, swimming and learning to live with our fears—and we made a sort of peace with them. Once we let go of worrying about what we could not control, Jennifer starting getting some good news: the amount of poisons in her blood started to decrease. Month after month the functioning of her kidneys were improving ever-so-slightly. Her energy started to improve and her appearance started to return to normal, as the doctor started weaning her off the steroids.

Today, Jennifer is a as close to ‘normal’ as she will likely ever be. We know her battle with kidney disease will be one she wages for the rest of her days, but she has begun to reclaim the life she knew, piece by piece. She won’t ever be able to work again, as the daily stresses of any sort of employment could push her kidneys back toward failure. Her energy level can change hour by hour, many days she simply can’t leave the house.

But most importantly and positively, her spirit held strong and never broke. We moved back to Washington, D.C. in July, as she felt she needed to be close to the nation’s capital. She is back to being the happy, uplifting and inspirational person I love more than anything—someone who helped me in my darkest hours. In some small part, I was able to do the same for her.

We know the road in this struggle will be long and challenging, with many ups and downs along the way, but I know we can face it together, whatever comes. And for that, we are most grateful.",The doctor told my wife she had six weeks to live -- two years ago,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/09/22/doctor-told-my-wife-had-six-weeks-to-live-two-years-ago.html

Authorities were called to Russian-born Alina Sheykhet's home around 9 a.m. after her parents found her unresponsive on the second floor of the residence, the Pittsburgh Police said in a news release.

Sheykhet's roommates originally thought she was still sleeping, but Sheykhet's brother, Artem, 25, told KDKA-TV she was found unresponsive on the floor after her father forced open the door to her room. Artem, who was celebrating his birthday, told the television station he believed she was murdered.

The Allegheny County medical examiner ruled the death a homicide, but didn't specify what, where or how Sheykhet was struck on her body or what type of object may have been used.

Neighbors reported a party at the residence Saturday night, attended by about 30 people, but police haven't said whether that's a part of their investigation.

The house is located in an area where many Pitt students live in off-campus housing. Several said they were ""shocked"" by the apparent murder.

“You don’t really hear about this often here. You hear about small stuff like robberies or people falling off buildings, but you never hear of a murder,"" Pitt sophomore James Hennessy told WTAE-TV. ""So I’m really shocked. Kind of scary.""

Sheykhet attended Montour High School in Robinson Township, a Pittsburgh suburb, after moving from Ivanovo, Russia, according to her Facebook page. The social media page doesn't say how long ago Sheykhet came to the country.

A friend of Sheykhet told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette she was a ""talented, careful person.""

""I could go on and on about how much of a wonderful person she is,"" Mark Schlaegle, a former classmate and friend from Montour High School, told the paper. ""Alina was the most beautiful, open-minded, talented, careful person.""

The university issued a statement expressing sadness and extending ""its deepest sympathies to the student's family and those who knew her."" The school planned to have counselors available Monday to students who requested them.

The statement also suggested authorities know more than they're letting on about who, or how, Sheykhet was killed than they've stated publicly, saying, ""Police do not believe the situation, which occurred off campus, provides further threat to the University community.""

Campus police were working with the city's Violent Crime Unit on the investigation.

Many Black Lives Matter protests call for violence against police, with chants like 'What do we want?'","The 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has spawned a violent domestic threat from “black identity extremists” who have stepped up attacks on police, according to an explosive new report by the FBI’s counterterrorism division.

The warning, first reported by Foreign Policy magazine, says that “it is very likely BIEs proactively target police and openly identify and justify their actions with social-political agendas commensurate with their perceived injustices against African Americans ...”

Brown, an African-American 18-year-old, was shot in August 2014 after struggling with white police officer Darren Wilson. Although Brown's supporters claimed it was a deadly case of police brutality, Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and resigned in November 2014.

The shooting led to protests in Ferguson that then spread to other parts of the country. It gained added momentum after subsequent racially charged police shootings, spurred on via social media and the group Black Lives Matter.

The FBI report said that the agency previously had analyzed the potential for violence of black identity extremism, a term that was unfamiliar before it appeared in the document. What has changed, according to the report, is that violence has now actually occurred and is 'likely"" to continue.



“It is very likely that BIEs’ perceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement will inspire premeditated attacks against law enforcement over the next year,” the report said. “It is very likely additional controversial police shootings of African-Americans and the associated legal proceedings will continue to serve as drivers for violence against law enforcement.”

Attacks in which police officers are targeted have been on the rise in recent years. The most high-profile such incident occurred last year in Dallas, when a gunman named Micah Johnson hid in a parking garage and fired on 11 police officers, killing five of them, during a protest against officer-involved shootings. The FBI report noted that Johnson referred to anger over police shootings and toward whites as what drove him to kill the five police officers.

The FBI report drew accusations of racial profiling.

DeRay Mckesson of Black Lives Matter told The Guardian the terrorism report echoes the days when FBI tracked activist groups including the NAACP and those that opposed wars.

“We knew that we were likely being watched,” said Mckesson, a longtime critic of government monitoriing of protest groups. “This is confirmation that the work of social justice continues to threaten those in power.”

The Guardian also quoted an unnamed source it described only as a former senior official from the Department of Homeland Security saying that the category ""black identity extremist"" was troubling.

""This is a new umbrella designation that has no basis,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""There are civil rights and privacy issues all over this.""

But others say that the FBI is correctly sounding an alarm about a serious trend.

""It's not racial profiling, it's violence profiling,"" said Scott Walter, president of Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank, told Fox News. ""Identity politics can kill, whether it's white identity politics, which killed in Charlottesville, or black identity politics, which kills cops.""

""We have to be able to distinguish between free speech and violence,"" Walter said. ""[Many] longtime [black] activist groups were not obsessed with voilence.""



Randy Sutton, a former Las Vegas law enforcement official who now is the national spokesman for Blue Lives Matter, told Fox News that the FBI report makes official what he and others in police work have been observing in recent years.

""Nobody is saying anything negative about protests,"" Sutton said, ""Protesting is everyone's right. This is about commiting acts of violence. Many Black Lives Matter protests call for violence against police, with chants like 'What do we want?' and 'Dead cops!' It's terrorism, and it's no different than Islamic terrorism.""

Sutton said the rising number of ambush attacks on police has had a chilling effect on how they do their jobs.

""Police are not being as aggressive because of the political climate,"" he said. ""There's been a dramatic decrease in proactive policing.""",FBI cites black extremists as new domestic terrorist threat,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/10/fbi-cites-black-extremists-as-new-domestic-terrorist-threat.html

LOUIS (AP) — Republican Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley has made it official: He's running for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill in 2018.

Hawley, a 37-year-old in his first year of elected office, will release a video Tuesday morning announcing his candidacy. His campaign made the video available to The Associated Press.

He said he wasn't planning to run for Senate. ""But we believe we have to do all we can to win a better future for our country,"" Hawley said on the video.

""It's time to do something new,"" Hawley said. ""America is an exceptional place, and it's still a young country. Its future is worth fighting for. So let's get ready and do our part.""

McCaskill and Missouri Democrats have anticipated the announcement for months. The Missouri Democrat in July launched a digital ad accusing Hawley of using the attorney general's office as a stepping stone to higher office.

Hawley said on the video that he and his wife didn't initially plan a Senate run. ""But we believe we have to do all we can to win a better future for our country,"" he said.

Timmy Teepell, a senior adviser to Hawley's campaign, said in a statement that Hawley will formally launch the campaign in 2018 and wait until then to make campaign appearances.

McCaskill, 64, is in her third term in the Senate, but Missouri voters have increasingly favored Republicans in recent years. Just one statewide office holder, Auditor Nicole Galloway, is a Democrat, and only two other federal lawmakers are Democrats — congressmen William Lacy Clay of St. Louis and Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City.

The Senate campaign figures to be a mirror image of the 2016 campaign involving Missouri's other incumbent senator, Republican Roy Blunt. In that campaign, Blunt, first elected to Congress in 1996, held off a highly-regarded young Democratic challenger, Jason Kander.

Unlike Kander, though, Hawley seems to have momentum on his side. Once considered a swing state, Missouri has turned decidedly Republican in recent elections. In statewide races in 2016, Republicans replaced Democrats as governor, attorney general, secretary of state and treasurer, and Republican Donald Trump easily carried the state over Democrat Hillary Clinton. In fact, Republicans haven't lost a statewide race since McCaskill defeated Republican Todd Akin in 2012.

McCaskill is among 10 Senate Democrats running in states won by Trump, and the Missouri race could be crucial in control of the Senate, where the GOP currently has a narrow majority of 52 seats.

Former Sen. John Danforth of St. Louis has publicly announced his support for Hawley and encouraged him to run. But Hawley must also bring in the more conservative wing of the Republican Party, a balancing act that could prove difficult.

The Kansas City Star reported last week that Hawley spoke with former White House strategist Steve Bannon after Bannon helped Roy Moore win the Alabama Republican primary in September over incumbent Sen. Luther Strange. A spokesman for Hawley did not immediately respond to a request to confirm if Hawley was seeking the support of Bannon, who left his White House post in August and returned to Breitbart News, which he led before joining Trump's campaign.

Vice President Mike Pence in July called Hawley about the race.

South Korea’s Defense Ministry did not comment on the alleged hack, which reportedly occurred in September 2016 but was only revealed Tuesday, but Rhee Cheol-hee, a lawmaker in South Korea, confirmed the data breach to the BBC. The hack consisted of 235 gigabytes of military documents and about 80 percent of what was stolen hasn’t been identified.

NORTH KOREA: WHAT WOULD A NUCLEAR ATTACK LOOK LIKE?

South Korea announced in May a “large amount of data” was stolen during a cyber attack that was possibly orchestrated by Kim Jong Un’s rogue regime. That same month, Yapizon, a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, announced 3,816 bitcoins — online currency that amounts to about $5.3 million — was taken on April 22. The company did not disclose who it believed to be the culprit, but security firm FireEye noted North Korean hackers were also suspected of targeting online currency providers.

North Korea denied stealing the documents, the BBC reported. The country celebrated the anniversary of the establishment of the Worker’s Party Tuesday and Pyongyang’s first nuclear bomb test on Monday.

Pyongyang is suspected of having expert hackers attack South Korean government websites and facilities for years. North Korea has accused its neighbor of “fabricating” the claims, the BBC reported.

News of the hack comes amid increasing tensions in the region.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday said the U.S. has “military options that [President Trump] can employ if needed.”

""There's one thing the U.S. Army can do, and that is you have got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our President can employ if needed,"" Mattis said during an Army conference in Washington, D.C. ""We currently are in a diplomatically led effort.”

KIM JONG UN’S NORTH KOREA: BRINGING THE WORLD TO THE BRINK

Trump, meanwhile, has continued his attacks against “little rocket man” Kim Jong Un and his regime, with the president taking to Twitter early Monday to say more than two decades of U.S. policy toward North Korea “didn’t work.”

“Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn’t work!” Trump wrote.

TRUMP ON NORTH KOREA, FROM 'ROCKET MAN' TO 'FIRE AND FURY'

The weekend tweets came after the president’s Thursday meeting with senior military leaders and their spouses, where he cryptically told reporters “this might be the calm before the storm.” When asked to elaborate on Friday, Trump said, “You’ll find out.”

North Korean state media announced on Sunday Kim Jong Un promoted his sister, Kim Yo Jong, to become an alternate member of the country’s top decision-making body, the politiburo. The decision came the same weekend Kim declared his country’s nuclear weapons a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia” against “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”

The story originally broke last week on Ruptly, a video-focused news agency operated by Russia's state-owned RT media outlet, which cited a waitress from Lucy’s Cantina Royale in Manhattan as its source. In the video, the outlet reported that Lucy’s was honoring Putin with a five-patty burger weighing exactly 1,952 grams, a number which celebrated the year of his birth, reports The Independent.

The manager for Lucy’s Cantina Royale says he has no idea why this video was made, but insists that Lucy’s “disavows the statements made in the video, which are false,” according to a statement obtained by The Independent.

“Lucy’s Cantina Royale was subject of a hoax involving Vladimir Putin’s birthday. Our restaurant has never celebrated Vladimir Putin’s birthday in any way, shape, or form, and has never offered a ‘Putin Burger,’” manager Tim Ryan said.

It’s not clear how many of Lucy’s employees were suspended, but the Independent reports that the video also contained testimony from two “barmaids,” one of whom praised Putin as an “outstanding politician and political leader.“

Ruptly, too, has since questioned the validity of the report, and issued a statement to that effect after a reporter for the Moscow Times uncovered the hoax.

“The report was carried out by individual employees and not the restaurant itself, which, regrettably, compromised the accuracy of this video,” Ruptly wrote.
