FRIDAY PUZZLE — When you’ve had a busy or a tough week — a week where it feels as if your hair is on fire — your best bet is to find a distraction. Ideally, this distraction should be good for you (or at least not terribly harmful) and should allow you to focus hard on it so that you can temporarily displace thoughts about what kindled that hair fire to begin with.

My own go-to distractions are running, reading, cooking and knitting. When I really need to distract myself and focus down, I enjoy British-style cryptic crosswords. I’m sure you have your own distractions.

My point is, once the hair fire is extinguished and the smoke settles, you deserve a reward for making it through. The Venn diagram of “distractions from hair fires” and “rewards” probably overlaps quite a bit, but in my opinion, sitting down on a Friday with a lovely beverage and a Patrick Berry themeless crossword is one of the best ways to end the week. I put that firmly in the rewards circle.

Mr. Berry can bring some fresh entries to his grids and bring back entries that have not been seen for a while. The middle section — BARBARA JORDAN, SOCIAL STUDIES and ACCOUNT HOLDER — is O.K. in terms of liveliness, but those are all debuts, so bonus points there. What I really liked was the openness of the center, which gave Mr. Berry room to cross those center entries with ROBERT ALTMAN, METEOR SHOWERS and SENATOR ELECT.

Rather, because normal blood pressure varies with a child’s age, gender and height, doctors typically needed to consult pages of charts to determine whether a patient’s pressure was normal or not.

Now, the new guidelines provide a short, easy-to-use table based only on a child’s gender and age, from 3 to 18, that doctors can readily consult and even hang in the office where they and parents can see it.

Study after study has demonstrated that elevated blood pressure is correctly diagnosed in less than one-quarter of the children who have it. For example, the largest study, published last year in the journal Pediatrics, covered more than 1.2 million patients ages 3 to 18. Electronic health records showed that 398,079 had their blood pressure measured at three or more visits. Of these, readings in 12,138 children met the criteria for hypertension and 38,874 for pre-hypertension (now called elevated blood pressure). But only 23.2 percent with hypertension and 10.2 percent with pre-hypertension were diagnosed as such and duly noted for follow-up in their health records.

Dr. David Kaelber, a pediatrician and internist at the MetroHealth System in Cleveland who directed the study and was co-chairman of the team that developed the new guidelines, said in an interview, “It’s great to have guidelines, but they’re only as good as the people who actually follow them.”

You may wonder why a diagnosis of high or elevated blood pressure in children is so important. Although children don’t usually suffer the consequences of high blood pressure in the pediatric years, Dr. Kaelber said that, unless properly treated, it can result in early heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease.

Elevated blood pressure in children predicts high blood pressure in adults, a leading risk factor for heart attacks and strokes. Already in young adults who’ve had elevated blood pressure as children, “you can see two kinds of cardiovascular damage,” Dr. Joseph T. Flynn, lead author of the new guidelines, said in an interview. “There is thickening of the left ventricle, the heart’s main pumping chamber, and thickening of blood vessel walls that is clearly tied to atherosclerosis and heart attacks in adults.”

Because high blood pressure often runs in families, detecting it in a child may prompt a check of the parents and other family members and end up saving their health and lives, Dr. Flynn said.

And as demonstrated by Matthew Goodwin’s experience, in about 20 percent of cases there is an underlying and correctable cause for high blood pressure in children. Failing to make the correct diagnosis can be disastrous. As Mrs. Goodwin put it bluntly, “Matthew could have died.”

The prevalence of elevated blood pressure and frank hypertension in children and adolescents has risen dramatically in recent decades, largely the result of increasing overweight and obesity in the young. An estimated 17 percent of children aged 2 to 19 are obese, and approximately two million children have hypertension.

Other contributors to the prevalence of hypertension in children include a growing dependence on fast foods, processed foods and snacks that are high in salt, causing excess sodium and fluid in the blood and an added strain on the delicate blood vessels that feed the kidneys.

The new guidelines from the pediatric academy urge health care practitioners to measure and record blood pressure at every well-child or preventive care visit, whether or not the child is overweight or there appears to be anything wrong. If the blood pressure reading is recorded in an electronic health record, the computer does the necessary calculation to determine if the reading is normal.

To prevent this exam from being overlooked, Dr. Kaelber suggested that parents gently nudge the practitioner by asking, “By the way, how is my child’s blood pressure doing?”

If, based on the chart, blood pressure is above normal, the guidelines offer clear follow-up procedures, for example, when to recheck the child, whether to prescribe lifestyle measures like dietary changes and physical activity or drug treatment, and when to look for a possible underlying cause of blood pressure that is persistently elevated despite treatment.

A diagnosis of high or elevated blood pressure should be based on three consecutive elevated readings. Dr. Kaelber noted that an underlying cause of hypertension is more common in children than in adults, especially in children younger than 9.

Dr. Flynn, chief of pediatric nephrology at Seattle Children’s Hospital, said his team, among others, solves a major problem in getting an accurate blood pressure assessment by using an ambulatory blood pressure monitor for 24 hours on every child with a high reading. In 30 percent to 40 percent of cases in which office blood pressure readings are consistently elevated, the cause is so-called “white-coat hypertension” – meaning the child is simply stressed from seeing a doctor. The monitor, which is a little bigger than a smartphone, takes many measurements during the child’s normal waking and sleeping hours.

The monitor has the added advantage, Dr. Flynn said, of greatly reducing the number of children who must undergo further testing to determine why their blood pressure is high, saving both money and undue stress on the family and the health care system.",New Blood Pressure Guidelines for Children,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/well/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-for-children.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

Making a fish dinner at home can be a bit of a splurge, given how expensive fresh seafood is. It would be a shame to overcook your hard-earned haul.

Broiling or grilling can cause lean, white-fleshed fish like halibut (but also thick flounder fillets, snapper, grouper and large sea scallops) to dry out. For moist, juicy results, frying or searing is the best option. I tend to use a simple searing method for cooking firm, white-fleshed fish on the stovetop; it’s easier and cleaner than frying.

For best results, use a cast-iron pan, or any other heavy nonstick pan (even a griddle). Coat the pan with olive oil, and let it get hot before you put in the fish fillets. Leave the fish undisturbed until it is nicely golden on the first side, then flip it and cook the second side until just done.

With perfectly pristine fresh fish, you want no sauce at all — or a sauce that enhances without distracting from the fish’s flavor. Sometimes, the best solution is a drizzle of olive oil and a lemon wedge.

For something a bit fancier and not much more effort, a quick sauce made in the pan is a good choice, too. A browned butter sauce, what French cooks call beurre noisette, tastes rich and nutty. You make it at the very last minute, just after the fish comes out of the pan.

When a chunk of cold butter hits the hot pan, it immediately begins to sizzle and foam. Be careful to cook the butter until it just starts to brown, then turn off the heat. As when making caramel, residual heat will continue to cook the mixture, and the brown will deepen. You want the sauce to taste toasty, not burned, and there’s a fine line. To stop the browning and supply a welcome citrusy hit, give it a squeeze of lemon.

As an additional enhancement, throw a handful of fresh sage leaves into the pan. It is amazing how immediately the sage flavor permeates the sauce. The herb contrasts nicely with both butter and fish, and the subtle combination is quite wonderful.

Mr. Erdogan’s government quickly shut down the investigations and released Mr. Zarrab and Mr. Aslan.
But four years on, court filings in Manhattan show, these same recordings have become a part of the United States case.
In a conversation two weeks later, on Oct. 3, 2013, Mr. Caglayan told Mr. Aslan that Mr. Erdogan had directly demanded an increase in exports.","And in recent days, as tensions between the countries grew worse amid a diplomatic dispute over Turkey’s detention of a United States Embassy employee, Turkish officials justified their actions by equating them to the embargo charges in New York.

“You will arrest my bank’s deputy general manager for no reason, and will try another citizen of mine for two years, and want to use him as an informant,” Mr. Erdogan said in speech on Thursday in which he defended the American employee’s arrest.

A close reading, however, of a lengthy summary of the Turkish investigation, which prosecutors have filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan and which includes excerpts from transcripts of the wiretap recordings, suggests that Mr. Erdogan’s objections may involve more than just patriotism. In several of the conversations, the records show, three of the men now charged discuss meeting with Mr. Erdogan and acting, as one puts it, on “the prime minister’s order” to increase Turkish trade.

Photo

The excerpts, a copy of which has been translated independently by The New York Times, do not suggest that Mr. Erdogan was aware of any illegal activity, and he is neither named nor referred to in an American indictment filed last month. But they offer evidence that Mr. Erdogan, back in 2013, was meeting regularly with several of the men at the height of their suspected sanctions busting.

One question now is whether one or more of the defendants — two of whom are jailed in New York and scheduled for trial on Nov. 27 — might still plead guilty and cooperate with the United States authorities in the hope of winning leniency in sentencing.

“I’m sure Erdogan worries about that, and I’m sure he worries about what could come out at trial,” said Eric S. Edelman, a former United States ambassador to Turkey. “Either one could be very damaging to him.”

The case currently centers on three men, all of whom knew Mr. Erdogan personally. Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, is suspected of having helped the Turkish government bypass United States sanctions on Iranian trade by using gold and other nonmonetary goods to pay for Iranian gas. American prosecutors say that Mr. Zarrab was helped by Zafer Caglayan, then Turkey’s economy minister, and Suleyman Aslan, at the time the chief executive of a state-owned Turkish bank.

Mr. Caglayan and Mr. Aslan are not in custody of either the United States or Turkey; Mr. Zarrab has been jailed in the United States since March 2016, after being arrested during a family trip to Disney World.

Mr. Zarrab has enlisted a team of high-profile lawyers to assist in his defense, among them Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump, and Michael B. Mukasey, a former United States attorney general. They have met with Mr. Erdogan and senior Trump administration officials in an effort to resolve the case as a diplomatic matter.

Mr. Zarrab’s lead lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, declined to comment. Mr. Zarrab has pleaded not guilty.

The case has been largely ignored by the public in the United States. But it has been widely reported and discussed in Ankara, where many of the government’s supporters see it as a continuation of a December 2013 attempt by parts of the Turkish judiciary to unseat Mr. Erdogan’s administration.

Photo

At that time, prosecutors in Turkey announced investigations into Turkish officials suspected in several corruption scandals. Mr. Caglayan and two other ministers quickly resigned, and Mr. Aslan and Mr. Zarrab were arrested, in what was the biggest challenge to Mr. Erdogan’s reputation since his party came to power in 2002.

Mr. Erdogan presented the investigations as a de facto coup attempt, mounted by followers of the same Islamist sect — the Gulen movement — that Mr. Erdogan would later say led a failed military putsch in July 2016. Mr. Erdogan’s government quickly shut down the investigations and released Mr. Zarrab and Mr. Aslan. Many of the police officers and prosecutors involved in the cases were later purged from their jobs.

The 2013 allegations, and the wiretaps on which they were based, were denounced as fiction — claims that many Turks found credible because of the Gulen movement’s problematic history. Gulenist prosecutors had been found to have fabricated evidence in earlier trials of secular army officers. (This week, Turkey’s state-run news agency said the American Embassy employee whose detention had fanned tensions had links to one of those prosecutors.)

But four years on, court filings in Manhattan show, these same recordings have become a part of the United States case.

The court records show that Mr. Erdogan’s voice was not captured on any of these particular recordings. But in the fall of 2013, he is referred to frequently by his office in conversations among some of the people suspected of conspiracy.

In June 2013, the Obama administration had closed the loophole that had allowed Turkey to pay for Iranian gas with gold. That fall, two of the alleged conspirators discussed finding an alternative method to evade the sanctions, according to transcripts of the recordings cited in the case.

The method the men are accused of settling on had problematic side effects for the Turkish economy. Since large quantities of gold were no longer being channeled through Turkey, the country’s trade deficit looked set to increase.

Mr. Erdogan was alarmed by this development, according to statements captured by the wiretaps. With local elections looming, Mr. Erdogan may have feared damage to his reputation as a savvy manager of the Turkish economy. According to the recordings, Mr. Erdogan spoke with Messrs. Zarrab, Caglayan and Aslan about the need to restore Turkish export figures to the record high of the previous year.

Photo

There is no evidence that Mr. Erdogan demanded or expected this to be achieved through illegal means. But the result he sought had previously been accomplished only through a method that was now outlawed under American sanctions. And the defendants charged in the United States are accused, in part, of returning to a version of the gas-for-gold scheme — a course of action Turkish investigators say the men took after they had spoken with Mr. Erdogan.

In one of the conversations, on Sept. 19, 2013, Mr. Zarrab claimed that he had personally spoken to Mr. Erdogan about the trade deficit, and had assured the leader he would help increase Turkish exports by $4 billion. “We have to do our best to achieve this $4 billion goal,” Mr. Zarrab is quoted as telling the bank chief, Mr. Aslan, “because I promised the prime minister.”

In a separate conversation on the same day, Mr. Zarrab told another associate that a smaller increase would be better than nothing. “Even two billion is important because I will go to meet the prime minister directly,” Mr. Zarrab said, according to the transcript.

In a conversation two weeks later, on Oct. 3, 2013, Mr. Caglayan told Mr. Aslan that Mr. Erdogan had directly demanded an increase in exports. “Turkey needs at least $2 to $4 billion in exports,” Mr. Caglayan said. “Last night we had a two-hour meeting with the prime minister in Istanbul and explained to him that there is a lot of pressure.”

Turkish investigators concluded from another conversation, on Sept. 16, 2013, that Mr. Aslan had spoken to Mr. Erdogan, who told him to “do something, whatever the method” to increase exports. The transcripts do not show that Mr. Erdogan was told how Mr. Zarrab, Mr. Aslan and Mr. Caglayan intended to increase exports — or that Iran was the ultimate beneficiary of Mr. Zarrab’s alleged scheme.

“My reading of the transcripts, as someone who has been covering Turkish politics for 27 years, leads me to say that Erdogan fully understood what was going on,” said Atilla Yesilada, an Istanbul-based consultant at Global Source Partners, an analysis firm, and a political commentator.

Mr. Yesilada acknowledged that nothing in the transcripts showed that the issue of sanctions busting had been brought to Mr. Erdogan’s attention.

Mr. Erdogan himself, however, has spoken publicly in the past about his willingness to break the United States sanctions on Iran.

“When we are approached on that matter — ‘You should obey the sanctions, you should obey’ — we cannot obey,” Mr. Erdogan said in December 2012 at a news conference in Istanbul. “This is strategically important for us.”",Why a New York Court Case Has Rattled Turkey’s President,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/world/europe/turkey-new-york-case.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The fact that it included a wide assortment of suggestions in a borough not named Manhattan was impressive enough, compared to the other apps I tested, but the recommendations themselves were also spot on.

For example, Astoria’s popular Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden was rightfully featured, but so was SingleCut Brewery, a lesser-known, but worthwhile, beer spot.

Cool Cousin

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.

Like a Local

Well-designed and easy to navigate, Like a Local has fewer contributors than the other apps (28, providing 197 tips for New York at the time of writing) but it is in more cities than the others (over 300) and best functions as a complementary tool.

The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a “special tip” for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: “Come early because the restaurant’s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.”

You don’t have to sign up to use the app, so you can dig right in and explore — though if you want to use the app offline, you have to pay $1.99 per city.

There’s also an option to “ask locals,” which works like a message board. I asked for Upper East Side restaurant recommendations (it is a neighborhood not represented well on any of the apps) and after a week had yet to get a response.

The recommendations included mainstream spots like St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the Central Park more often than the other apps did.

37A: This is one of those clues that was probably a no-brainer for some of you, but I went down the catwalk looking for an answer to “Prep for the runway, maybe.” We’re dealing with airliners, not fashion lines, and the answer is a crossword stalwart, DEICE.

51A: Religious references always bounce off my unschooled mind, but I find Pope Francis’ personality fascinating and when I saw this quote — “when one goes against one’s conscience” — I assumed that he meant guilt, which didn’t fit. This was also probably not a universally difficult clue, but it was a thought-provoking one for me. He’s referring to SIN, something I’ve always thought of as an absolute, objective rather than subjective or personal.

72A: “Cause of insomnia, maybe” just had to be guilt. Why did I fixate on this particular sensation while doing this puzzle? Worry, stress, self-doubt, a strong urge to begin a move to Scandinavia at 3 a.m. — there are many things that can keep one up at night. Including, I guess, a DRIP — be it a slow leak or someone who just won’t stop talking.

138A: An example of how precise cluing can be, “We should avoid doing that” led me to snap in BAD IDEA when I was first circling the grid. I realized my mistake soon thereafter — it’s LETS NOT — but I probably could’ve avoided the error by reading more closely. Also, what word was I thinking of at 112D to end in B? Not using my noggin.

46D: This term for a “ratcheting wheel mechanism,” PAWL, was a completely new word to me. It wasn’t a blocker for anything so I just let it fill itself in with crosses at the end of solving. This used to happen to me all the time when I started doing puzzles 350 years ago, but these days it’s a novelty to discover a common word like this. It’s also used in the puzzle, though rarely.

5A: Hi, kids! I wasn’t around for ADLAI Stevenson’s presidential campaign either, but I got this and I’ll explain how I did it.

In the mid-20th century, it was apparently fashionable among campaign slogan writers to try to make their slogans rhyme, primarily because it would have been considered laughable at the time to suggest that the candidate might want to have a beer with anyone who wasn’t at least a governor. Slogan writers would sit in small, smoke-filled offices with long lists of words that rhymed with their candidate’s name (“Badly for Adlai?” “No. ...” “Sadly for Adlai?” No!”), and they were released only when they hit on something that was not terrible and could fit on a campaign button. My point is, if you see a clue like “‘Madly for ___’ (1952 campaign slogan),” you have enough information to know that you should be thinking about a midcentury candidate whose name rhymed with “madly.”

42A: The holy Kaaba is a CUBE-shaped mosque in the town of Makka.

49A/57D: It’s unusual to see two words that are so close in current meaning in the same puzzle (YEARN and YENS), especially when they are clued so similarly. The etymology of the two words is different, however, so it’s allowable.

67A: “Even Homer NODS” is an idiom that means that even people who are the best at something can make mistakes during a momentary lapse in concentration. It’s an allusion to the epic poet Homer’s work, which apparently contains errors in continuity.

25D: This is not a comment on SEURAT’s mental health. “Artist who went dotty?” is a comment on his use of pointillism.

What’s different is the mentality of Rohingya; they are very used to this kind of devastation. They’re very accustomed to being so oppressed and so beaten down. You never see people cry. You rarely see people get really emotional. People are just very, very honest about where they’re at, and it’s almost more striking in a way.

What about the politics of this? Are there people in the camps talking about any of that?

I think people are just really happy to be here, to be honest.

Something that’s really striking to me — and that’s only because maybe that I’m here and experiencing it — is to look at the way that not only the Myanmar government but also the Myanmar population is reacting to all this, which is basically to deny it.

Damien: What have you made of the response in Myanmar, Hannah, especially from the country’s leader (and Nobel Peace Prize winner), Daw Aung San Suu Kyi?

Hannah: It’s complicated. I think that when she became the de facto leader of the Myanmar government last year, there was this wish from the international community that we would have this feel-good narrative.

In Asia, it’s been a story of the rollback of democracy, and so here was just one story where there was this peaceful transition from a military junta that ruled for almost 50 years to a civilian leader — this democracy activist, this Nobel Peace Prize laureate.

And the truth of the matter is that she is still very, very constrained, and the military controls a lot of things — and controls the people who are committing what seem to be atrocities in the Rohingya areas in northern Rakhine state and in western Myanmar.

Having said that, she is the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the one weapon that she has that the military doesn’t have is her moral authority — and she has not used it. And so I think that the international community has every right to call her and say: “Look, you know we understand that your position is very difficult. But if you don’t speak out for these people, then who will?”

You’re a relatively newly installed bureau chief for The Times in Southeast Asia, though you’ve been covering the region for years. What else are you looking at in the region?

The thing about Southeast Asia is it’s 11 countries or so, all of which are very different. And nothing really ties them together except, I would say, maybe two things.

One is the fact that democracy has been seriously challenged throughout the region. You look at Thailand, where I am now, which is now ruled by a military junta. You have Myanmar, which has this kind of quasi-civilian government. You look at Malayasia, where there are allegations of corruption and a rollback of rights, and the Philippines, where you have a leader who has publicly endorsed a fatal drug war. You have Indonesia, which is kind of the shining light of democracy in the region but has serious ethnic and religious issues of its own.

The other issue is a religious change, and it relates to Myanmar as well. There you have this divide between a Buddhist majority nation and a Muslim minority. In Thailand you have the similar thing — you have a country that is about 90 percent Buddhist with, in the south, a Muslim insurgency.

And then you have places like Malaysia and Indonesia, where it’s majority Muslim but there are significant religious minorities chafing against the majority.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Entering a Rebus on the Web

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc). This will open an expandable square in which you can type multiple characters. Step 2: Type in your answer and press Enter/Return, or click anywhere outside the field to close and save your rebus.

The first step in combating bad news burnout might seem obvious: Limit alerts and just stop checking your phone and social media feeds for news so often. But that could be harder than you think. The average person checks their phone some 150 times a day. And that constant connection wires us to want more.

“It’s the repeated exposure that is the problem,” Dr. Christina Mangurian, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in an email. Going without your smartphone can trigger a burst of the stress hormone cortisol and induce a fight-or-flight response that only settles down by checking it again. Still, you have to start somewhere. “I suggest limiting the alerts and turning off phones a couple of hours before bed,” Dr. Mangurian advises.

Experts say recharging your smartphone in another part of the house overnight can help, as well as setting time limits around news and social media check-ins. Dr. McNaughton-Cassill recommends logging a day or two of online activity, in the same way people who are trying to lose weight might write down everything they eat. Apps like RescueTime can help you get a clear picture of your online life, including how much time you check your newsfeeds. It can also temporarily block websites that may be contributing to the problem.

Remember the Good News

One thing I’ve done over the last week to help boost my own spirits is to focus more of my digital attention on uplifting apps, sites and tech tools, and there are certainly a lot of them out there. One of my favorites so far is one of the simplest: a free app called Uplifter. It’s basically a mobile journal with daily prompts like, “What three good things have happened recently?” or “What three things are you grateful for?”

“I talk about this in my clinical practice all the time,” said Dr. McNaughton-Cassill. “It’s basically cognitive behavioral therapy, the idea that people can think differently about the same event. So, if you only focus on the negative, you’re going to feel bad. Look for a silver lining, and try to find something positive to focus on, such as all the people who have helped others during crisis events.”

In a weeklong experiment I just finished on my personal Facebook page, I promised to post only uplifting stories and asked my some 5,000 friends to do the same. The response was overwhelming. Inspiring, compassionate, funny and heartwarming stories rolled in from sites like Upworthy, Sunny Skyz, The Dodo, GivesMeHope and even Awkward Family Photos.

Consider Online Therapy

A somewhat ironic upside of our near constant state of connection these days is that help is often just a few clicks away, and that’s the case with a growing number of therapy apps and sites. Doctors on Demand and Talkspace are among the apps that offer counseling with licensed mental health professionals. The American Psychological Association offers advice on choosing a reliable online therapy service and whether it might be right for you.

Practice Self-Care

The half-dozen doctors and mental health experts I talked with for this article all emphasized the importance of self care over the latest news updates. “Self care implies that I cannot absorb all of the horrible things happening in this world 24 hours a day,” says Dr. McNaughton-Cassill. “I have to find a way to step back. I can’t watch the news because I care too much, and I can’t see any way to fix it right now.”

In addition to exercise, sleep, eating well and making time for friends and family, “I would think about meditation apps too,” Dr. Mangurian suggests (see our guide on “Choosing a Meditation App”). “Taking time out to breathe is important. Taking time for yourself is important. We feel during difficult times that we can’t take time for yourself — but we must so we can care for others.”",Earthquakes! Fires! Shootings! Storms!

The Girl Scouts start in kindergarten: It’s a petal badge, for daisies, who are the youngest members.","Girls will soon be able to join the Boy Scouts. The group says it has a lot to offer girls. But it’s also worth considering what boys could learn from the Girl Scouts.

The organizations are different in many ways, starting with the badges they offer. Over all, the boys seem to have more chances to do things (with badges in activities like whitewater rafting, welding and bugling). The girls have more badges for caring for others (being a good neighbor, a voice for animals, a social butterfly).

The Girl Scouts, who allow only children who identify as girls, say they teach leadership and risk-taking, and are adding badges in outdoor skills, engineering and computer science. But what if the Boy Scouts also did more of what the Girl Scouts do? It could serve them well in their personal lives and their careers.

Boys are falling behind in school and in some parts of the economy. That’s in part because modern-day work relies less on physical labor and more on caregiving and collaboration. Jobs that involve these so-called feminine skills are the ones that are growing, in number and pay, according to research from Harvard.

Meanwhile, when girls are encouraged to do things that boys have traditionally done, but boys aren’t encouraged to do “girl” things, it’s a message that what’s masculine is superior and what’s feminine is inferior. That dynamic helps explain why jobs that are considered traditionally female pay less, and why pay goes down when women enter jobs that used to be done mostly by men.

Some Girl Scout badges promote stereotypical notions of femininity. Many are about helping others. Even the flowers badge asks girls to “find out how flowers help people.” There’s also a focus on appearance. The independence badge, for “striding down your path to changing the world,” includes learning how to “make your clothes look great.” The “eating for you” badge — recently called “eating for beauty” — emphasizes how nutrition helps with “smooth skin, shiny hair and strong nails.”

The Scout Law for each group includes similar virtues, like being honest, helpful and friendly. But girls might be better off, too, if more boys earned badges like those from the Girl Scouts for respect and fair play, and for taking responsibility for their actions, not to mention babysitting and making dinner. In that spirit, here are 10 Girl Scout badges that might benefit Boy Scouts:

Babysitter

Most of the fastest-growing jobs, like those for health aides and physical therapists, involve caring for others, so boys would benefit from learning these skills. Researchers say caring for younger children or pets is a good way to do so (both groups have pet badges.) Even in two-income families, women still do more child care, another reason to teach boys early.

Simple Meals

Women, on average, spend more than twice as much time as men each day preparing food and cleaning up afterward, according to the American Time Use Survey. But everyone needs to eat. The Boy Scouts recently made a badge for cooking a requirement of the Eagle Scout rank.

Scribe

“Words are powerful tools,” this badge’s instructions say. “Just writing down your feelings actually makes you feel better!” Girls are taught to have a larger emotional vocabulary than boys. As a result, many boys end up suppressing their emotions or letting them out in destructive ways, researchers say.

Coaching

This badge requires Girl Scouts to “motivate a team to accomplish its goals.” Teamwork is one of the most important skills in the modern economy. Jobs requiring social skills, like lawyer, nurse and financial manager, have grown much more than those that don’t, like machine operator and welder, research shows. Teamwork is a core part of Boy Scout activities too.

Making Friends

Another badge focuses on social skills, this one for Girl Scouts who “show friends you care” and “learn how to disagree” — skills that would surely be useful for boys in their personal lives and their jobs.

My Great Day

“Life is more fun when it’s running smoothly,” this badge’s instructions say. “Try out some great ways to get organized.” These include sorting, planning and doing homework. Schools reward skills like being organized, waiting one’s turn and following directions. Girls seem to develop self-control earlier, which might be one reason boys have more discipline problems and lower grades in school.

Respect Myself and Others

Respect for others is at the root of many problems today, whether political polarization or sexual harassment. Teaching it to children seems at least as important as woodworking and archery. The Girl Scouts start in kindergarten: It’s a petal badge, for daisies, who are the youngest members.

Responsible for What I Say and Do

Boys tend to have more discipline problems, but the problem, according to educators and researchers, comes when people dismiss them with the excuse that boys will be boys. Taking responsibility for their actions — another petal badge, for kindergarteners and first graders — is a valuable skill for children of either sex. The Boy Scouts emphasize ethical and moral choices in their mission statement.

Fair Play

This badge is for Girl Scouts who learn to “include everyone” and to “be part of a team,” with the idea that “everyone follows the same rules.” Research has shown that one reason women stall before reaching positions of power is that institutions aren’t inclusive. People tend to hire and promote others who look like them. When women offer ideas, they are often interrupted or considered to be too aggressive.

Well, I’d say it was like watching a group of vacationing dentists try organized sport for the first time, but there are reasons to fear dentists. Dentists know how to hurt people.

The worst part didn’t come during the match itself, lukewarm drizzle though it was, but after the match, when the leaders of United States soccer delivered their verdicts to the press. How did they, having just overseen the worst debacle in the last generation of their sport, plan to change things to ensure nothing like this would happen again?

“Nothing has to change,” Bruce Arena, the coach of the men’s team, declared.

“You don’t make wholesale changes based on the ball being two inches wide or two inches in,” Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, insisted.

Really? Your goal — the goal of every national soccer federation — is to win the World Cup. Don’t you make wholesale changes based on not making it into the World Cup?

Gulati was referring to the fact that Clint Dempsey had a shot hit the woodwork in the final minutes of the game. If it had gone in, the team would have qualified. So why panic? I might be sympathetic to this argument if I thought being two inches from disqualification were a reasonable goal for the men’s team to aspire to. In fact, had the shot gone in, qualification would only have masked the team’s pitiful state a little longer.

What Arena and Gulati don’t seem to understand is that fans of the United States men’s team have spent years in a state of excruciatingly patient optimism. We’ve worked hard to convince ourselves that each small sign of progress — a Gold Cup win here, a last-second goal there — meant the team was in good hands. That hasn’t always been easy. It often feels as though the national team is permanently on the threshold of a success it never quite reaches, as if it’s built to thrive on medium-size stages but fizzle on large ones.

The kind of progress Gulati seems to value most is corporate, institutional, political. He cares about sponsorships, shoring up organizational foundations. He has done wonders for the United States federation’s standing within soccer’s international body, FIFA. He’s had less success improving quality of play, both at the top of the game and at the youth level, where American men’s teams have missed consecutive Olympics under his watch.

For me, and I think for many American fans, the immortal flub of this qualifying campaign has driven home the fragility of my faith in the team’s path. For a long time I was willing to tell myself that the professionals knew what they were doing. Now I think we’ve given too much trust to leaders who’ve done a better job selling their own competence than demonstrating it.

The World Cup, with its thousand ethical shortcomings forever balanced against its capacity to deliver joy, is already dispiriting in too many ways to justify investing more hope in this brand of pseudo-technocracy.

It’s time for a change. Arena resigned on Friday. Gulati is up for re-election in February. He needs to go as well. The next thing I want to see from United States soccer is a jackhammer, not a news conference.

It was bad. For American soccer fans, Tuesday was a fiasco, a result so frustrating, embarrassing and preventable that it called into question everything we thought we knew about the way the game in this country is run.

What happened Tuesday is that the United States men’s team was knocked out of World Cup qualifying thanks to an almost surreally meek performance against Trinidad and Tobago, previously the worst team in the Concacaf conference for teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean. Needing only a draw to clinch their ticket to Moscow, the Americans politely self-asphyxiated en route to a 2-1 loss.

Harvey Weinstein, who has denied “any allegations of non-consensual sex,” was fired on Sunday by Weinstein Company board members, which include his brother. Several other members of the all-male board have quit, including Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor; Marc Lasry, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks and chief executive of Avenue Capital Group, an investment firm; Tim Sarnoff, president of production services and deputy chief executive of Technicolor; and Richard Koenigsberg, an accountant, who resigned on Thursday.

The Weinstein Company, with roughly 150 staff members in New York and Los Angeles, has assets that are potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It includes a television unit anchored by series like “Project Runway.” A theatrical division has seven completed films, including “The Current War,” a period drama about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse starring Benedict Cumberbatch, who said in a statement on Tuesday that he was “utterly disgusted” by Mr. Weinstein’s “horrifying and unforgivable actions.”

As Hollywood has distanced itself from the company — Apple ended plans for a series produced by the Weinstein Company, for instance, and other network partners have considered similar action — questions have mounted about whether the studio can continue. On Thursday, bankruptcy speculation surfaced in Variety. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Weinstein Company was “exploring a sale or shutdown.”

In his statement on Friday about business as usual, Bob Weinstein cited upcoming releases from the studio’s Dimension label, which focuses on family and horror movies. They include “Polaroid,” a horror movie scheduled for release in theaters on Nov. 22, and a children’s film, “Paddington 2,” which is set for Jan. 12 release. Mr. Weinstein also mentioned “War With Grandpa,” a comedy starring Robert De Niro that is planned for Feb. 23.

But the trajectory from mostly black clubs to more mainstream venues to even more mainstream TV and movies is a familiar one to almost any breakout African-American comic, Mr. Pharoah noted.

“Jamie Foxx, Tommy Davidson, Chris Rock, Bernie Mac, even Eddie Murphy,” he said. “We know the chitlin circuit very well.”

A gifted mimic from a young age, Mr. Pharoah began performing standup as a teenager near his hometown, Chesapeake, Va., before being introduced to the comic Charlie Murphy (“Chappelle’s Show”), who took him on the road for several years. That led to appearances on BET and a spot in the cast of “Saturday Night Live” in 2010. That stint lasted until he was fired from the show last fall, a surprising move that Lorne Michaels has said was part of an effort to refresh the cast.

(The first episode of “White Famous” includes a dilemma over a cross-dressing role, a charged issue among African-American comics.) But these days he’s more diplomatic. He declined to revisit his departure from “Saturday Night Live,” calling the show a key step in a career that is “finally starting to break open” with film roles in Steven Soderbergh’s “Unsane” and the animated “The Adventures of Drunky.”

Over scrambled eggs and veggie sausage, Mr. Pharoah discussed “White Famous,” awkward culture gaps and his grandmother’s meatloaf. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Having to tone down certain things. I can’t walk into an office where I’m trying to get a movie and talk like I talk in the neighborhood. [Affects a classic uptight Caucasian voice] ‘He’s talking like that? And who does he hang around?’ So you’ll see both sides: You’ll see me with my best friend, Ron Balls (Jacob Ming-Trent), and we’ll be talking real neighborhood. Then you’ll see me go into a place and be a little toned down, a little cautious. That’s how it is for me. I’m talking to you right now and I’m like, ‘Ah this is The New York Times …’

This could be a scene in the show.

Yeah, really. [In the white accent] ‘So it all started when I was conceived, I was a twinkle in my father’s eye …’ Or my mother’s. I don’t know where the twinkle goes.

Have there been awkward moments that arise from that culture gap?

Maybe with people trying too hard. People you interact with on productions might try to do some weird handshake — ‘Yo, yo’ [slaps his hands together in an elaborate routine]. You’re like, ‘Oh, I don’t — I just shake like this. You’ve been watching BET too long.’

My cousins might try to hit me up for more. On my Instagram some of them, they’re like ‘Hey, how you doing, cuz?’ And you know what that means: ‘How you doing, cuz?’ is ‘I need something.’ I never get hit up where it’s just, ‘How are you doing?

The government’s costs are also likely to rise, since subsidies to purchase insurance through the marketplaces increase as premiums rise.
Mr. Schumer said the coming spending measure offered a “very good opportunity” to secure money for the subsidies.","But Republicans in Congress are divided. Some worry that ending the subsidies would hurt their constituents. Others are loath to do anything that could be seen as propping up the health law that they had promised to tear down.

For their part, Democrats are convinced that any blame for rising premiums and shrinking choices will fall on Republicans, who now control the White House and Congress. After spending the year trying to preserve the Affordable Care Act, Democrats did not appear ready on Friday to make major concessions.

“Unless our Republican colleagues act, the American people will know exactly where to place the blame when their premiums shoot up and when millions lose coverage,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.

The uncertainty over the payments to insurers has loomed over Congress for months, but Mr. Trump’s action is forcing lawmakers to confront the issue head on less than three weeks before the start of the annual open enrollment season under the Affordable Care Act.

Even with the president’s move, it was far from clear whether lawmakers could agree on steps to continue the payments. The negotiations between Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray had stalled over how much latitude to give states seeking waivers from requirements of the Affordable Care Act.

Still, Ms. Murray expressed optimism and called on Republican leaders to support the efforts.

About seven million people benefit from the cost-sharing subsidies. The president’s decision, by destabilizing insurance markets and driving up premiums, could adversely affect millions of others who buy insurance on their own and do not receive federal subsidies, health policy experts said.

Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and co-chairman of a bipartisan group of lawmakers called the Problem Solvers Caucus, said Mr. Trump’s decision “increased the stakes” for Congress. More than two months ago, Mr. Reed’s group offered a series of proposals to shore up insurance markets, including funding the subsidies.

“It’s only going to get worse as this marketplace continues to destabilize,” Mr. Reed said. “If we stay where we are and do nothing, I think this is going to be a pox on all of our houses.”

Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he had been in discussions with other Republicans over proposals to drive down premiums that could be tied to a continuation of the subsidies for insurers.

“The fundamental question is, what do you get in terms of relief for insurance premiums and health care costs, broadly, in exchange for continuing a bailout to the insurance companies in the short run or long run?” Mr. Meadows said.

As lawmakers mulled how to move forward, doctors, hospitals, insurers, state insurance commissioners and advocates for patients denounced Mr. Trump’s decision.

“Our patients will ultimately pay the price,” said Dr. David O. Barbe, the president of the American Medical Association. “We urge Congress to accelerate its efforts to reinstate these payments before further damage is done.”

Governors also weighed in, expressing alarm at the termination of the subsidies. “We are deeply concerned that the administration has declined to continue these payments, further increasing uncertainty for state marketplaces,” the National Governors Association said.

Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, a Republican, told The Nevada Independent that the president’s decision was “going to hurt kids.” He continued: “It’s going to hurt families. It’s going to hurt individuals. It’s going to hurt people with mental health issues. It’s going to hurt veterans. It’s going to hurt everybody.”

The attorneys general of 18 states, including California, Massachusetts and New York, filed suit on Friday to prevent any interruption in the payments.

But the Trump administration insisted that a federal district judge was right in ruling last year that the payments were unconstitutional because Congress never explicitly provided money for them.

“Congress has the power of the purse, and it is up to Congress to decide which programs it will and will not fund,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a legal opinion, adding: “The executive branch cannot unilaterally spend money that Congress has not appropriated.”

The cost-sharing subsidies are available to people with incomes of 100 percent to 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $12,060 to $30,150 a year for an individual.

“Cost sharing reductions are critical to low income Americans,” Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, wrote on Twitter. “Congress should guarantee their funding through the appropriations process.”

In fact, the consequences of the president’s action would ripple through the individual market. The premium increases would be felt most by middle-class consumers who do not qualify for federal aid with either their premiums or their out-of-pocket costs.

The government’s costs are also likely to rise, since subsidies to purchase insurance through the marketplaces increase as premiums rise. The Congressional Budget Office said in August that if the cost-sharing subsidies were cut off, premiums would shoot up 20 percent next year, and federal budget deficits would increase by $194 billion in the coming decade.

Yet conservative Republicans made clear they have no appetite for providing billions of dollars to insurers.

“Under no circumstance should Congress attempt to expand Obamacare by cutting a check for President Obama’s bailout of insurance companies,” said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee.

Representative Dave Brat, a conservative Republican from Virginia, said Mr. Trump was simply correcting a “constitutional error” made by the Obama administration.

Mr. Brat said he did not want to provide money for the subsidies because they would just “prop up a failing system in which the government coerces people to buy gold-plated insurance policies that no one can afford.”

The showdown increased tensions over a fiscal deadline facing lawmakers. Mr. Trump and Democrats struck a deal in September that included a stopgap spending measure to keep the government funded through Dec. 8.

Now, the fate of the cost-sharing reduction payments could wind up intertwined in the negotiations over a spending measure to avert a government shutdown. Already, the contentious issue of immigration could become part of those spending talks, as Democrats are determined, in the coming months, to secure protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.

“I find a lot of people who give nothing to charity — nothing,” Ms. Seepes said.","Sunday is the start of the 106th annual New York Times Neediest Cases Fund campaign. The fund began the year after Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times, gave money to a homeless man for shelter and new clothes on Dec. 25, 1911. The campaign last year raised $6,177,625 — over half a million dollars more than the year before.

Contributions to this campaign will be collected into January, and like last year, online donations can be made through GoFundMe. Ms. King cited the ease of donating through GoFundMe as a reason for her first donation, in December.

The Times pays the fund’s overhead costs, with all donations going directly to the beneficiary organizations: Brooklyn Community Services, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, Children’s Aid, the Community Service Society of New York, FPWA, the International Rescue Committee and UJA-Federation of New York. The organizations spend the money at their discretion, often to cover gaps in public assistance.

The career of Mr. Lippmann, now 81 and living in Hudson, Fla., was informed by poverty issues and the plight of the less fortunate. Before moving behind the bench, he was a lawyer for 17 years at the Legal Aid Society in the Bronx. Early in his judicial career, he ruled that a mentally disturbed homeless woman who had been involuntarily hospitalized should be released and allowed to return to the streets. In the decision, Mr. Lippmann wrote, “It is my hope that the plight she represents will also offend moral conscience and rouse it to action.” He later told The Times, “I believe that society’s role is a major part of the problem.”

That belief partly stemmed from the influence of a beloved high school teacher, William J. Nagle, who taught Latin and Greek at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx in the first half of the twentieth century. Each year Mr. Nagle collected donations from students for the fund, some years accruing about $4,000 — the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars today.

Among the students who were influenced was Mickey J. Littmann, who graduated in 1952 and is now a managing director of investments in Manhattan. Mr. Littmann said he had donated to the fund since he was 16, though that first time, he admitted, “I donated money I got from my parents.”

Giving annually, he adds a dollar each year, one for every year since he graduated high school. “The idea is just to give something for the organizations who benefit from it, and certainly to the people who need it,” Mr. Littmann said.

For some donors, the tradition comes from family. Margaret Boorstein, who grew up in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan, said her mother read aloud articles about recipients of Neediest Cases funds when the family gathered in the parlor.

In the early 1960s, one story about a girl close in age tot Ms. Boorstein at the time inspired her own fund-raising efforts. Around age 8, she began selling small soap bars with her younger sister, Elizabeth, for 2 cents a bar, donating the earnings to the fund. She has given almost every year since.

“I think I’m lucky,” Ms. Boorstein said. “I can afford it. I don’t go overboard. I don’t give millions upon millions of dollars, not that I have millions upon millions of dollars. I understand that people struggle.”

Ruth Queen, whose father grew up in the Bronx in the Depression era, started giving to the fund in the late 1950s. “I was taught there’s always someone poorer than you, and you have to give back,” she said.

Ms. Queen of Old Bridge, N.J., said she saw taking part in the fund-raising campaign as an important part of the Jewish tradition of charitable giving. “It’s part of who we are,” she said. “Tikkun olam: You give back. I’ve done what my parents always did, and my children will follow us.”

As pivotal as tradition has been to donations, often it is empathy or a personal connection to a story that motivates readers to give. During last year’s campaign, Jackie Syrop of Lawrenceville, N.J., was moved by the plight of a Syrian boy whose family, refugees in Jordan, struggled to afford medicine to treat his Type I diabetes.

“When we saw this kid, we said, this is our nightmare,” Ms. Syrop said. “That this would have been us.” The story mirrored her own life. Her 26-year-old son, Joe Beckett, was given a diagnosis of Type I diabetes at age 5. As a middle-class family, it was a challenge to afford the necessary medical care.

“A lot of stories tug at your heartstrings, but in this case I felt, you could suddenly be this kid’s mother,” Ms. Syrop said. “And it’s so sad. This is how it is. You can’t protect your kid, you can’t do anything.”

Likewise, Eleanor Seepes of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, has long understood the complications of being a single mother with a sick child. She raised her daughter, who has brittle bone disease, on her own after the death of her husband more than 30 years ago.

“My own personal life is so strained — I read these stories and it really gets to me,” she said. “I have to help and show that I’m grateful it wasn’t worse.”

Every year, she gives $25 to $35 from her fixed Social Security income to a person or family featured.

“A lot of times, it’s where a parent is trying and trying for so many years to stay ahead and make a meaningful life,” Ms. Seepes said. “It really appeals to me.”

Three years ago, that connection was deeply personal. Ms. Seepes came across an article about a single mother caring for a child with the same disease as her daughter.

Ms. Seepes is celebrating her 80th birthday next month by hosting a party at a bar, and instead of presents, she is asking guests to donate to a charity. She has compiled a two-page list of suggestions, and the Neediest Cases Fund is among them.

“I find a lot of people who give nothing to charity — nothing,” Ms. Seepes said. “I can’t understand that.”",Tradition of Helping Neediest Cases Inspires Readers to Give Back,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/nyregion/tradition-of-helping-neediest-cases-inspires-readers-to-give-back.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

They left with bone fragments.

These were among the first steps in a painstaking process of finding the missing and the dead, under unusually difficult conditions. The fires were so hot that car wheels made of aluminum — which has a melting point of 1,221 degrees Fahrenheit — turned into puddles.

“People have been cremated, for lack of a better term,” said Sgt. Ray Kelly, a spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, which has more than 40 experts helping in the forensic investigation. “Any DNA that was on the bones is gone — it’s consumed,” Sergeant Kelly said.

At Journey’s End, technicians in bright orange and lemon yellow jackets raked through ash and fragments of household items. In the debris were the frame of a bed, the wire covering of a fan and magazines and books turned to ash that disintegrated when touched.

“This will be without a doubt the most complicated identification process this area has ever seen,” said Jim Wood, an expert in forensic dentistry who was helping identify bodies through dental records. Mr. Wood, who now represents the area in the State Assembly, also helped identify victims of the Sept. 11 attacks.

Officials have released names of about half of those confirmed killed; most were elderly, but not all. Christina Hanson, 28, who was disabled and used a wheelchair, died in her apartment in Santa Rosa. Kai Shepherd, 14, was killed in Mendocino County, trying to run from the fire.

By Friday morning, more than 221,000 acres statewide had burned in the spate of fires that started on Sunday, said Ken Pimlott, chief of Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, including more than 150,000 acres in Sonoma and Napa Counties, north of San Francisco. The causes of the fires are still unknown.

Some survivors told of being roused Sunday night or early Monday by friends, or by police officers or sheriff’s deputies driving down their streets, honking or shouting through loudspeakers. But many said they got no official warning, or that one came too late.

Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of emergency alert systems in telling people to evacuate. Sonoma, Napa and other counties have alert systems that send text messages to mobile phones, but those warnings generally go only to the people who have signed up to receive them, and the fires knocked out cellular service in many areas.

The more aggressive “Amber alert” system, with text messages and screeching alarms, can reach nearly every mobile phone in a region, but it was not activated on the night the fires broke out. Officials have said that they were concerned about setting off a panic and jamming roads.

The authorities described a chaotic scramble to evacuate residents from Santa Rosa amid thick smoke and flying embers.

“There wasn’t time to map out anything. There wasn’t time to make a plan,” said Sgt. Spencer Crum of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, one of a dozen officers on duty on Sunday night.

Sergeant Crum said he and his fellow officers drove up narrow driveways, blaring horns and sirens. He remembers repeatedly screaming, “Get out of here now!”

Some residents resisted. Some were in wheelchairs; he lifted them into his patrol car. “I said, ‘You are going to die if you stay here,’” Sergeant Crum recounted. “We did the best we could with the time we had.”

The sheer speed at which the fire spread and jumped that first night also made it impossible to keep track of what was burning.

One of those killed, Michael J. Dornbach, 57, who lives in Southern California, was visiting relatives and friends who live in the rugged, wooded hills near Calistoga, in Napa County. “He was saying how beautiful it was and how he wanted to move here,” said his sister, Laura Dornbach, who was with her brother an hour before the fire, and then drove to her own home.

When the fire came Sunday night, “he didn’t want to leave without his brand-new pickup truck, and he couldn’t find the keys,” she said, her voice catching. “They were searching frantically, and everyone was begging him to get out. My son said ‘Uncle Michael, this is serious, we have got to get out, please!’ But my brother was a stubborn man. I’m just so confused that he wouldn’t leave. And I don’t understand why everyone else didn’t just drag him out.”

The others drove away, but minutes later, she said, her son, Robert M. Lee, 18, “drove up the mountain again to get him, but he got stopped by authorities.” The next day, Ms. Dornbach got word that her brother was dead.

Farther north, Sara Shepherd called her parents at 1 a.m. Monday to say that nearby hills were burning, so she, her husband, and their two children were evacuating their house in a remote area of Redwood Valley. “They didn’t think their lives were in danger,” said Mindi Ramos, Ms. Shepherd’s sister.

But the conflagration advanced so fast that they could not make it down their mile-long driveway before the flames closed in. They abandoned their car and fled on foot, scattershot, unsure where to go. The Shepherds’ son, Kai — a shy 14-year-old who liked baseball, wrestling and playing saxophone — died.

Ms. Shepherd, her husband, Jon, and their daughter, Kressa, were all seriously injured and still hospitalized on Friday, Ms. Ramos said. It was unclear whether they knew that Kai was gone.

Carmen and Armando Berriz, Southern California residents, had rented a house just outside Santa Rosa for a wine country getaway with their daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter. Awakened by noise, the group ran out in their nightclothes and piled into three cars to flee through blinding smoke.

The Berrizes, in the third car, never made it, their escape apparently blocked by a fallen tree, a family member said. They returned to the house and took refuge in the swimming pool, the flames raging around them for hours. Ms. Berriz, 75, died; Mr. Berriz, 76, suffered burns and smoke inhalation.

Ms. Grant, the daughter of Arthur and Suiko Grant, said her father, 95, and mother, 75, apparently got into their car and tried to leave, but it appeared that a fallen telephone pole and downed power lines blocked the sole, narrow route to or from their home. They hid with their dog in their wine cellar, where they asphyxiated as the fire, which burned their house to its foundation, consumed all the available oxygen.

“The only thing that makes me feel any better is that they didn’t burn alive,” Ms. Grant said. “And they were at least together.”

Doug and Tracy Hugill, of Santa Rosa, woke to the smell of smoke around 1 a.m. on Monday, and got an alert on their phones at 1:37 a.m. warning of fire. The alert did not say to evacuate, but they loaded their children and some belongings into their car.

At 2:09 a.m., another alert came, saying “EVACUATE THAT AREA NOW.” By then, the house behind them was ablaze, the streets were thick with smoke, flaming embers were landing around them, and neighbors were banging on doors, telling people to leave.

“By the time we got the push alert, the fire had crossed the freeway to our house,” said Mr. Hugill, a systems engineer. “We had barely enough time to get out.”

On Friday more than 9,000 firefighters, using more than 1,000 fire trucks, more than 100 bulldozers and more than 100 aircraft — many of them supplied by other states and the federal government — were battling the fires, Chief Pimlott said.

Though crews made some progress containing the blazes on Thursday and Friday, they continued to spread, with new neighborhoods added each day to the list of evacuation orders. Officials warned that dry, windy conditions expected over the next few days meant the flames could blow out of control again.

“Everyone needs to be thinking right now,” Chief Pimlott said, “‘What is my evacuation plan? What am I going to take with me? How am I going to get out?’ And be prepared to do that literally on a moment’s notice. Not a half-hour, not an hour — you need to be thinking about that in minutes.”","In California, Fires So Fast Hesitation Proved Lethal",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/us/california-wildfires-victims.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“It is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America,” they said. “Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.”

Lawmakers from both parties have urged the president to continue the payments. Mr. Trump had raised the possibility of eliminating the subsidies at a White House meeting with Republican senators several months ago. At the time, one senator told him that the Republican Party would effectively “own health care” as a political issue if the president did so.

“Cutting health care subsidies will mean more uninsured in my district,” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, wrote on Twitter late Thursday. She added that Mr. Trump “promised more access, affordable coverage. This does opposite.”

But Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, praised Mr. Trump’s decision and said the Obama administration had usurped the authority of Congress by paying the subsidies. “Under our Constitution,” Mr. Ryan said, “the power of the purse belongs to Congress, not the executive branch.”

The future of the payments has been in doubt because of a lawsuit filed in 2014 by House Republicans, who said the Obama administration was paying the subsidies illegally. Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the United States District Court in Washington agreed, finding that Congress had never appropriated money for the cost-sharing subsidies.

The Obama administration appealed the ruling. The Trump administration has continued the payments from month to month, even though Mr. Trump has made clear that he detests the payments and sees them as a bailout for insurance companies.

This summer, a group of states, including New York and California, was allowed to intervene in the court case over the subsidies. The New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said on Thursday night that the coalition of states “stands ready to sue” if Mr. Trump cut off the subsidies.

Mr. Trump’s decision to stop the subsidy payments puts pressure on Congress to provide money for them in a spending bill.

Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the panel, have been trying to work out a bipartisan deal that would continue the subsidy payments while making it easier for states to obtain waivers from some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. White House officials have sent mixed signals about whether Mr. Trump was open to such a deal.

The decision to end subsidies came on the heels of Mr. Trump’s executive order, which he signed earlier Thursday.

With an 1,100-word directive to federal agencies, the president laid the groundwork for an expanding array of health insurance products, mainly less comprehensive plans offered through associations of small employers and greater use of short-term medical coverage.

It was the first time since efforts to repeal the landmark health law collapsed in Congress that Mr. Trump has set forth his vision of how to remake the nation’s health care system using the powers of the executive branch. It immediately touched off a debate over whether the move would fatally destabilize the Affordable Care Act marketplaces or add welcome options to consumers complaining of high premiums and not enough choice.

Most of the changes will not occur until federal agencies write and adopt regulations implementing them. The process, which includes a period for public comments, could take months. That means the order will probably not affect insurance coverage next year, but could lead to major changes in 2019.

“With these actions,” Mr. Trump said at a White House ceremony, “we are moving toward lower costs and more options in the health care market, and taking crucial steps toward saving the American people from the nightmare of Obamacare.”

“This is going to be something that millions and millions of people will be signing up for,” the president predicted, “and they’re going to be very happy.”

But many patients, doctors, hospital executives and state insurance regulators were not so happy. They said the changes envisioned by Mr. Trump could raise costs for sick people, increase sales of bare-bones insurance and add uncertainty to wobbly health insurance markets.

Chris Hansen, the president of the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society, said the order “could leave millions of cancer patients and survivors unable to access meaningful coverage.”

In a statement from six physician groups, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the doctors predicted that “allowing insurers to sell narrow, low-cost health plans likely will cause significant economic harm to women and older, sicker Americans who stand to face higher-cost and fewer insurance options.”

While many health insurers remained silent about the executive order, some voiced concern that it could destabilize the market. The Trump proposal “would draw younger and healthier people away from the exchanges and drive additional plans out of the market,” warned Ceci Connolly, the chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans.

Administration officials said they had not yet decided which federal and state rules would apply to the new products. Without changing the law, they said, they can rewrite federal regulations so that more health plans would be exempt from some of its requirements.

The Affordable Care Act has expanded private insurance to millions of people through the creation of marketplaces, also known as exchanges, where people can purchase plans, in many cases using government subsidies to offset the cost. It also required that plans offered on the exchanges include a specific set of benefits, including hospital care, maternity care and mental health services, and it prohibited insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions.

The executive order’s quickest effect on the marketplaces would be the potential expansion of short-term plans, which are exempt from Affordable Care Act requirements. Many health policy experts worry that if large numbers of healthy people move into such plans, it would drive up premiums for those left in Affordable Care Act plans because the risk pool would have sicker people.

“If the short-term plans are able to siphon off the healthiest people, then the more highly regulated marketplaces may not be sustainable,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president for the Kaiser Family Foundation. “These plans follow no rules.”

Mr. Trump’s order would also eventually make it easier for small businesses to band together and buy insurance through entities known as association health plans, which could be created by business and professional groups. A White House official said these health plans “could potentially allow American employers to form groups across state lines” — a goal championed by Mr. Trump and many other Republicans — allowing more options and the formation of larger risk pools.

Association plans have a troubled history. Because the plans were not subject to state regulations that required insurers to have adequate financial resources, some became insolvent, leaving people with unpaid medical bills. Some insurers were accused of fraud, telling customers that the plans were more comprehensive than they were and leaving them uncovered when consumers became seriously ill.

The White House said that a broader interpretation of federal law — the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 — “could potentially allow employers in the same line of business anywhere in the country to join together to offer health care coverage to their employees.”

The order won applause from potential sponsors of association health plans, including the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Restaurant Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group for the construction industry.

The White House released a document saying that some consumer protections would remain in place for association plans. “Employers participating in an association health plan cannot exclude any employee from joining the plan and cannot develop premiums based on health conditions” of individual employees, according to the document. But state officials pointed out that an association health plan can set different rates for different employers, so that a company with older, sicker workers might have to pay much more than a firm with young, healthy employees.

“Two employers in an association can be charged very different rates, based on the medical claims filed by their employees,” said Mike Kreidler, the state insurance commissioner in Washington.

Mr. Trump’s order followed the pattern of previous policy shifts that originated with similar directives to agencies to come up with new rules.

Within hours of his inauguration in January, he ordered federal agencies to find ways to waive or defer provisions of the Affordable Care Act that might burden consumers, insurers or health care providers. In May, he directed officials to help employers with religious objections to the federal mandate for insurance coverage of contraception.

Both of those orders were followed up with specific, substantive regulations that rolled back Mr. Obama’s policies.

In battles over the Affordable Care Act this year, Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans said they wanted to give state officials vast new power to regulate insurance because state officials were wiser than federal officials and better understood local needs. But under Thursday’s order, the federal government could pre-empt many state insurance rules, a prospect that alarms state insurance regulators.

Another part of Mr. Trump’s order indicates that he may wish to crack down on the consolidation of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, a trend that critics say has driven up costs for consumers. Mr. Trump said that administration officials, working with the Federal Trade Commission, should report to him within 180 days on federal and state policies that limit competition and choice in the health care industry.","Trump to Scrap Critical Health Care Subsidies, Hitting Obamacare Again",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order-health-insurance.html

Rather, because normal blood pressure varies with a child’s age, gender and height, doctors typically needed to consult pages of charts to determine whether a patient’s pressure was normal or not.

Now, the new guidelines provide a short, easy-to-use table based only on a child’s gender and age, from 3 to 18, that doctors can readily consult and even hang in the office where they and parents can see it.

Study after study has demonstrated that elevated blood pressure is correctly diagnosed in less than one-quarter of the children who have it. For example, the largest study, published last year in the journal Pediatrics, covered more than 1.2 million patients ages 3 to 18. Electronic health records showed that 398,079 had their blood pressure measured at three or more visits. Of these, readings in 12,138 children met the criteria for hypertension and 38,874 for pre-hypertension (now called elevated blood pressure). But only 23.2 percent with hypertension and 10.2 percent with pre-hypertension were diagnosed as such and duly noted for follow-up in their health records.

Dr. David Kaelber, a pediatrician and internist at the MetroHealth System in Cleveland who directed the study and was co-chairman of the team that developed the new guidelines, said in an interview, “It’s great to have guidelines, but they’re only as good as the people who actually follow them.”

You may wonder why a diagnosis of high or elevated blood pressure in children is so important. Although children don’t usually suffer the consequences of high blood pressure in the pediatric years, Dr. Kaelber said that, unless properly treated, it can result in early heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease.

Elevated blood pressure in children predicts high blood pressure in adults, a leading risk factor for heart attacks and strokes. Already in young adults who’ve had elevated blood pressure as children, “you can see two kinds of cardiovascular damage,” Dr. Joseph T. Flynn, lead author of the new guidelines, said in an interview. “There is thickening of the left ventricle, the heart’s main pumping chamber, and thickening of blood vessel walls that is clearly tied to atherosclerosis and heart attacks in adults.”

Because high blood pressure often runs in families, detecting it in a child may prompt a check of the parents and other family members and end up saving their health and lives, Dr. Flynn said.

And as demonstrated by Matthew Goodwin’s experience, in about 20 percent of cases there is an underlying and correctable cause for high blood pressure in children. Failing to make the correct diagnosis can be disastrous. As Mrs. Goodwin put it bluntly, “Matthew could have died.”

The prevalence of elevated blood pressure and frank hypertension in children and adolescents has risen dramatically in recent decades, largely the result of increasing overweight and obesity in the young. An estimated 17 percent of children aged 2 to 19 are obese, and approximately two million children have hypertension.

Other contributors to the prevalence of hypertension in children include a growing dependence on fast foods, processed foods and snacks that are high in salt, causing excess sodium and fluid in the blood and an added strain on the delicate blood vessels that feed the kidneys.

The new guidelines from the pediatric academy urge health care practitioners to measure and record blood pressure at every well-child or preventive care visit, whether or not the child is overweight or there appears to be anything wrong. If the blood pressure reading is recorded in an electronic health record, the computer does the necessary calculation to determine if the reading is normal.

To prevent this exam from being overlooked, Dr. Kaelber suggested that parents gently nudge the practitioner by asking, “By the way, how is my child’s blood pressure doing?”

If, based on the chart, blood pressure is above normal, the guidelines offer clear follow-up procedures, for example, when to recheck the child, whether to prescribe lifestyle measures like dietary changes and physical activity or drug treatment, and when to look for a possible underlying cause of blood pressure that is persistently elevated despite treatment.

A diagnosis of high or elevated blood pressure should be based on three consecutive elevated readings. Dr. Kaelber noted that an underlying cause of hypertension is more common in children than in adults, especially in children younger than 9.

Dr. Flynn, chief of pediatric nephrology at Seattle Children’s Hospital, said his team, among others, solves a major problem in getting an accurate blood pressure assessment by using an ambulatory blood pressure monitor for 24 hours on every child with a high reading. In 30 percent to 40 percent of cases in which office blood pressure readings are consistently elevated, the cause is so-called “white-coat hypertension” – meaning the child is simply stressed from seeing a doctor.

PhotoMr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers.
Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography.
While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.","Thirty years ago, Tim Rasmussen wore a mullet to the photojournalism version of Woodstock on a small upstate New York farm. He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

We’re nearing the season for ghost stories — or, in the case of William Alexander’s new middle-grade novel, “A Properly Unhaunted Place,” un-ghost stories, cautionary tales about what happens when we try too hard to put our history behind us. Eleanor Henderson’s “The Twelve-Mile Straight” and Josephine Rowe’s “A Loving, Faithful Animal” wrestle with the enduring trauma of violence over generations, and Alice McDermott’s “The Ninth Hour” draws narrative power from that perennial burden of Catholicism, shame. Two finalists for the National Book Awards appear on this week’s list: Frank Bidart’s collected poems, “Half-Light,” and Carmen Maria Machado’s debut collection of stories, “Her Body and Other Parties.” You have until the awards are announced on Nov. 15 to finish them.

FRESH COMPLAINT: Stories, by Jeffrey Eugenides. (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $27.) Eugenides’s first collection of short stories is his first book since “The Marriage Plot” in 2011. “Line by line, paragraph by paragraph, Eugenides writes like a man who is enjoying himself. The feeling is contagious,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “The comedy in these stories derives from the fact that these people are not quite ready for this world — or at least not ready for what this world has become. Innocence everywhere has been trampled.”

ADMISSIONS: Life as a Brain Surgeon, by Henry Marsh. (Thomas Dunne Books, $26.99.) Like “Do No Harm,” Marsh’s previous memoir, “Admissions” is “wandering and ruminative, an overland trek through the doctor’s anxieties and private shames,” our critic Jennifer Senior writes. Marsh once again recounts his miscalculations and surgical catastrophes; rails against the constraints of an increasingly depersonalized British health care system; and describes his operating theater in all of its Grand Guignol splendor.

HER BODY AND OTHER PARTIES: Stories, by Carmen Maria Machado. (Graywolf, $16.) The eight fables in Machado’s book, a finalist for the National Book Award, all depict women on the verge. The collection is “a love letter to an obstinate genre that won’t be gentrified,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “It’s a wild thing, this book, covered in sequins and scales, blazing with the influence of fabulists from Angela Carter to Kelly Link and Helen Oyeyemi, and borrowing from science fiction, queer theory and horror.”

THE NINTH HOUR, by Alice McDermott. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) In McDermott’s novel, the cause of a young Irish widow and her daughter is taken up by the nuns of a Brooklyn convent. But as the years pass, this struggling pair can’t banish worldly temptation, with possibly dire consequences for their faith. Writing about nuns is a risky business, but McDermott situates their lives exactly where they belong: in the difficult, often conflicting world that embraces practical competence, a commitment to extreme generosity and a lived belief not only in goodness but in the fairness of God.",10 New Books We Recommend This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/books/review/10-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

For Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist, the information they received did not prepare them for reality.
“If we had known” that the taxes would rise so high, Ms. Ljungkvist said, “we never would have bought this place.”","A collision of factors has led Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist to this point. The tax projections in the offering plan were overly optimistic given that they live in an area in the midst of rapid residential growth and skyrocketing property values. The plan was also vague about the limits of their tax abatement. While someone who is buying an older apartment can scour years of tax history to anticipate how high taxes might go, Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist had to rely on the limited tax predictions in the offering plan. It is not clear how common it is for buyers to experience a confluence of events like this — a perfect storm.

Still, why were they caught so off guard? “This is a mystical process,” said Alex Barrett, the principal of Barrett Design, the building’s developer, about how taxes are calculated for his projects. “Hell if I know how it happens. We rely on these consultants to tell us: ‘This is what it’s going to be.’”

Seeking more clarity, I called Paul J. Korngold, who is something of a tax guru in the world of residential real estate. If you’re building a condo, he is one of a handful of the top tax lawyers you would hire to figure out how the city might assess a property once that hole in the ground turns into a dazzling tower of glass and steel. (Mr. Korngold, a partner at the Manhattan law firm Tuchman, Korngold, Weiss, Liebman and Gelles, did not advise Barrett Design on the Atlantic Avenue condo, but he has advised the company on other projects.)

Predicting the future, of course, is not a simple task. A tax lawyer or tax consultant prepares an opinion letter that calculates what taxes would likely be the first year the building is operational, often two or more years before a condo opens. But a lot can change in two years, particularly in a neighborhood where dozens of new residential buildings are popping up around the same time. First-budget-year taxes, which are what you see in the Schedule A, can also be surprisingly low because there is a good chance that the property was under construction for part or most of that time and therefore not assessed as a fully operational condo.

Walk into an open house and the brochure you pick up will include the Schedule A tax estimate, not a bad number to use if you’re trying to sell an apartment. Brokers “want to sell the units,” Mr. Korngold said. “They want to show low taxes.” So brokers work with the information in the Schedule A. For a fuller picture of what you will eventually owe, you or your lawyer have to thumb through the offering plan to find that tax opinion letter.

But the letter predicts taxes only for the first year that the building is fully operational. After that first year, a buyer is on his or her own. The city, meanwhile, reassesses properties every year and assessments and taxes usually only go in one direction — up.

In a small condo with 10 units or fewer, like the one on Atlantic Avenue, tax increases are limited to up to 8 percent a year, or 30 percent over five years. Larger condos have no such limits.

“No one can 100 percent predict what the Department of Finance is going to do and the sponsor doesn’t make any guarantees,” said Pierre E. Debbas, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. He said tax estimates are usually accurate. “But every now and then there’s an outlier that could be off.” Out of the hundreds of deals handled by his firm in the past year, Mr. Debbas has received complaints from three buyers, a small number unless you are one of them.

Yes, taxes rise, but the letter in Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist’s offering plan, prepared in 2013 by Metropolitan Realty Exemptions, a Brooklyn company, seems to have left out some details. For example, on the 421a abatement, the letter said any increase in assessed value “shall be exempt from property taxes.” Yet, the tax exemption only covers around $84,000 in assessed value, so anything over that would be subject to regular taxes. While most of the other apartments in the building are assessed at around $84,000, the home of Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist has been assessed at $135,505.

The letter also calculated $17,853 in residential taxes for the entire building, based on a projection of how the city would assess the property once construction finished. But two years later, Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist are on the hook for more than that amount just for their one unit. In other words, the estimate was really low compared with reality, and neither the couple, nor their lawyer, saw a red flag.

Calls to Metropolitan Realty Exemptions for comment were not returned.

Certainly, we live in a buyer-beware world, and it is up to the person buying the apartment to do the homework — that’s why you hire a lawyer. “The developer quotes you a price, but you have to have your eyes wide open,” said Dr. Sheron Latcha, 49, a nephrologist who is under contract to buy a one-bedroom apartment in One Waterline Square, a Richard Meier-designed tower on the Upper West Side. “If you didn’t read the fine print, that’s on you.”

But sometimes the fine print is not enough. For Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist, the information they received did not prepare them for reality. The couple are now concerned that as the tax abatement dwindles, so, too, will the equity in their home. “If we had known” that the taxes would rise so high, Ms. Ljungkvist said, “we never would have bought this place.”",Could a Perfect Tax Storm Strike Your Condo?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/realestate/could-a-perfect-tax-storm-strike-your-condo.html

One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow.","Though Monika Bulaj grew up in Communist Poland, she was nonetheless a devoutly Catholic child who studied mystics and dreamed of a life as a cloistered nun. But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

For Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, the moment recalled the 1970s, when another government, this one in Washington, not Moscow, targeted black activists. She served as a community worker for the Black Panther Party as the F.B.I. used false information to go after its members.

“That actually got people killed and destroyed organizations,” Ms. Lee said. “Now look at Facebook allowing ads by the Russian government to create this kind of environment. That’s a problem. I don’t know if they’re even aware of the history and how dangerous allowing the promotion of division and racial animosity and racial hatred can be.”

And nearly a year after the election, black lawmakers say, little is being done to reverse the damage. Russia studied and exploited the “fault lines of racial tension,” said Representative Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York, and multiple investigations into Russia’s actions and the Trump’s campaign possible involvement have thus far offered no safeguards to stop Moscow’s efforts.

“Things are moving far too slow because we should be putting protective measures in place,” Ms. Clarke said. “We need to step up to the challenge.”

During the meeting, Ms. Sandberg frequently said she agreed as more than a dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus demanded action from the company. Several people in the meeting said Ms. Sandberg frequently said, “We will do better” and “You will get answers.”

But her answers fueled the anger of some black lawmakers who said for years that they have been pushing Facebook to add a black person to its all-white board of directors and to diversify its staff. Several members have also written letters to Facebook and other companies demanding answers related to the presidential election.

On Thursday, the company’s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, said in the meeting that Facebook had recently hired a record number of minority employees, and Ms. Sandberg promised that the company planned to add a black person to its board.

The issue of Russia exploiting already charged race relations in the United States hits especially home for many members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, Democrat of Missouri, who explained to Ms. Sandberg on Thursday that a man had attempted to bomb his office in 2014 in Kansas City based on false information and conspiracy theories. Mr. Cleaver, a cousin of Eldridge Cleaver, an early leader of the Black Panthers, said after the meeting that he was constantly on guard because many detractors falsely believe that his family member killed police officers.

“People get all worked up on the internet and do crazy things, and some of us are the recipients of their insanity,” Mr. Cleaver said. “It feels like the whole country is changing, and we’re having a national nervous breakdown.”

For others, the anger is more with Moscow than Silicon Valley. Already, they say, the United States has to deal with the remnants of slavery, institutional racism in schools and the criminal justice system, and now a foreign adversary is stirring a boiling pot.

Shortly after the meeting with Ms. Sandberg, Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he was concerned that the F.B.I. may have bought into Russia’s exploitation of African-Americans with its new class of threats called “Black Identity Extremists.” Mr. Richmond said that he feared that the F.B.I. may now go after black people who protest unfair policing practices and discriminatory policies based on false information peddled on social media.

“This is a very fragile moment in time for African-Americans across this country,” Mr. Richmond said. “What we needed Facebook to understand is that they play a role in the perception of African-Americans.”

Representative Robin Kelly, a Democrat of Illinois, said she often hears from constituents who want to know why the investigations have taken so long. Ms. Kelly is also the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on Information Technology and sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats. Neither panel has had a hearing on Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election, she said.

“I don’t know the intelligence process, and I’m sure they want to be thorough and all of that,” she said. But, she added, “people are anxious.”

At least some members of the caucus have started thinking about what ways Congress may have to step in and shield Americans from Russia’s influence.

Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, said lawmakers may need to come up with new ways to combat false information and fight back against Russia. That might mean Facebook would face new regulations.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Once again, we have a lesson in paying attention and reading clues or any notes associated with the puzzle carefully. There’s got to be a reason the Across clues are so ... terse.

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

Today’s puzzle isn’t all that difficult once you get the hang of the theme, and the crossings are relatively gentle. If you’ve been looking forward to training your brain to think of alternate meanings in clues, this one by Alex Eaton-Salners might be just the Thursday puzzle for you.

Today’s Theme

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

Meanwhile, Tehran had invested its national pride and an estimated $100 billion in its nuclear program. The regime was not about to give up on those investments, even though international sanctions painstakingly built by the Obama administration cost it some $150 billion. In fact, at the time the nuclear deal was negotiated, Iran was on the threshold of becoming a nuclear state with the ability to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a weapon in a matter of weeks. The J.C.P.O.A. pushed that “breakout time” to more than a year.

Next, Mr. Trump trotted out the canard that the deal gave Iran “over $100 billion its government could use to fund terrorism.” Never mind that the money in question is actually Iran’s — the proceeds from oil sales that countries around the world froze in bank accounts at the United States’ behest — or that virtually all of it is being dedicated to unmet domestic needs, to pay off debts and to prop up Iran’s currency.

As to Iran’s nuclear obligations under the agreement, Mr. Trump asserted that “we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran’s path to a bomb.” This will be news to the I.A.E.A., which now benefits from the most intrusive and transparent inspection and monitoring regime ever devised. Its major provisions last 20 to 25 years, and under the Additional Protocol that Iran is obliged to adopt under the agreement, the I.A.E.A. will have the right to access declared and undeclared sites in perpetuity, including Iran’s military facilities.

And that “short term” delay in Iran’s race to a bomb? Mr. Trump ignored the fact that while certain constraints on Iran’s enrichment capacity go away in 10 or 15 years, it is permanently barred under the Non-Proliferation Treaty from acquiring a nuclear weapon or doing weapons-related work. If Iran nonetheless moves in that direction, thanks to the inspection regime a future president will have a much greater likelihood of seeing it and a united international community to confront it — both of which the United States will lose if it reneges on the deal.

Now that Mr. Trump has decertified Iran’s compliance with the nuclear agreement, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Mr. Trump called on Congress and America’s allies to use the time “to address the deal’s many serious flaws.” If not, he said, “the agreement will be terminated.”

By “fix” Mr. Trump means legislation to impose new conditions on Iran beyond the purview of the agreement and to extend its constraints indefinitely. That would put the United States, not Iran, in violation of the agreement and isolate Washington, not Tehran, around the world. It would allow Iran to resume its pursuit of nuclear weapons or to stick with the deal for its economic benefits, forcing the United States to sanction its closest allies for doing business with Tehran. It would provide a “we told you so” gift to Iranian hard-liners in their struggle with pragmatists. It would shackle, not advance, Mr. Trump’s ability to sign others on to his broader strategy to confront Iranian aggression. More broadly, it would undermine America’s credibility — and its ability to strike agreements that make the country safer in the future.

Congress must resist the temptation — and the political pressure — to unilaterally renegotiate the Iran deal and therefore kill it. Instead, it could usefully lay out what Mr. Trump’s speech did not: an actual comprehensive strategy to contend with Iran’s non-nuclear behavior, including diplomatic efforts to end the conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Iraq that Iran exploits; stronger security cooperation with the Gulf States and Israel; better coordination with America’s allies; and targeted sanctions on Iran that do not violate the nuclear accord.

The smart kitchen might even track how much of the dish you end up throwing away, and let you know who took the last beer in the refrigerator. (Don’t worry! It ordered more.)

“We are creating new actors in our kitchens,” said Rebecca Chesney, research director for the Food Futures Lab at the Institute for the Future, and a featured speaker here. “We are talking to them and they are talking back to us.”

In the future, apparently, no one will need to know how to cook at all.

“You’ll get appliances and hardware that lets you perform at a higher level of proficiency than what you can train for,” said Nikhil Bhogal, a founder and the chief technical officer of June, which makes a WiFi-enabled countertop oven by the same name that recognizes the food you put into it and tells you how to cook it precisely.

Much of this is still just a glint in an engineer’s eye. To truly connect everything in the kitchen, technology and recipes will have to be standardized in such a way that food can be tracked from the farm to the plate.

The dreamers here talked of inventing a single database, like iTunes, for recipes, or even doing away with recipes altogether.

From the stage, the TV cooking personality and cookbook author Tyler Florence went as far as to declare that “recipes are completely dead,” in the way that paper road maps are dead. He then announced that he was joining a “proprietary connected food platform” start-up called Innit.

Innit is still in development, but it appears to be software based on online recipes that have been broken down into preparations for various starches, produce and proteins. It will eventually learn, through the miracle of artificial intelligence, what sauce you like on your chicken and whether you have chicken in refrigerator, and then give you a recipe for it.

Cooks at the conference were skeptical. It was hard to find anyone who wanted to discuss the joy that comes from cooking, or the escape from a hectic, technical life that softly scrambling an egg in the morning can bring.

Some lawmakers are now talking about potential ways to regulate the businesses.

In addition to the new crisis communications firms, the company has placed ads in places like The New York Times and The Washington Post. But it has been difficult to quell the concerns of lawmakers, and Ms. Sandberg’s meetings this week were focused on fixing various problems facing the company.

Ms. Sandberg, 48, knows her way in Washington, having worked here for years as a top aide in the Treasury Department. She is now regularly mentioned as a potential political candidate. That speculation increased in 2013 after the release of her first book, “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.” She was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and is a top Democratic donor.

She has tried to deflect rumors about running for office, but they persist, and her appearance in Washington this week is unlikely to quell them. At her only public event in Washington, she gave smooth and measured answers to questions from Mike Allen, a co-founder of Axios, the online news start-up that hosted the event. The performance stood in stark contrast to efforts from Mr. Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and chief executive, who usually appears far less comfortable in such situations — and who has also been mentioned as a potential political candidate.

With House Intelligence Committee leaders who are investigating the company’s role in foreign meddling in the election, Ms. Sandberg agreed to hand over a broader set of data linked to fake Russian accounts and to give more information about how that data was targeted to users. With top Republican and Democratic leaders of the House, she emphasized the company’s desire to help with the investigation and promoted its plan to hire thousands of people to review ad purchases so the mistakes of the 2016 election are prevented from happening again.

The members have been critical of Facebook’s lack of diversity on its board of directors, and lawmakers have criticized the company for allowing racially charged ads on its site during the election that were placed by the Russian accounts under review in the federal investigation. Sitting at a large wood conference table with the House members of the caucus, she listened to complaints and questions while taking notes.

Ms. Sandberg responded with personal reflections. She said she was disappointed that Facebook ads had been used to sow racial division during the election, according to the caucus chairman, Representative Cedric L.

Butterfield, a Democrat from North Carolina. And she promised that Facebook would appoint an African-American member to its board in the near future.

“I remain cautiously optimistic,” Mr. Butterfield said after the meeting.

A group of Facebook executives, including Elliot Schrage and Anne Kornblut, traveled with her from the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The Axios event was filled with Facebook lobbyists including Joel Kaplan, who had been running damage control with Republicans in government, and Erin Egan, a top policy executive.

After the meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, one of her last events of the tour, Ms. Sandberg walked past dozens of reporters with smartphones pointed at her and asking questions. Accompanied by Ms. Egan and the company’s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, she walked up the marble steps of the Capitol to the white-carpet offices of the House minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, where she put her big, black satchel in an empty conference room as she typed into her smartphone.

When asked to comment on her day, Ms. Sandberg waved her hands and said: “Sorry, we’re not talking. I need time for myself.”",Sheryl Sandberg Blitzes Washington in P.R. Push for Facebook,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/technology/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-ads.html

Say what you need.”How physicians feel about themselves may actually translate into how patients feel about them.
So I was spared having to tell him I was defecting, and I’ll soon be seeing another doctor anyway.","“It’s a trend that reflects the state of medicine today,” Dr. Danielle Ofri, associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and author of “What Patients Say, What Doctors Hear,” told me. “Physicians are so risk-averse they prescribe medications as a default and reflexively refer patients to specialists. It’s systemic.”

What to do? After all, this was my health here. As a lifelong recreational athlete and fitness enthusiast, I’d entered my 60s healthy, but eventually – inevitably – my age would catch up with me. Was I going to risk my longevity to avoid hurting my doctor’s feelings? I needed a physician I respected and trusted. Should I stick with the status quo or take a hike?

“Your experience is more common than was the case even 20 years ago,” Dr. Michael Fleming, former president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, told me. “It can be very frustrating to be a patient nowadays. That’s why they’re more inclined to switch doctors than ever before.”

A 2001 study in the Journal of Family Practice showed that one-fifth of patients left their primary care doctors voluntarily over a three-year period. Patient satisfaction with the relationship often predicted loyalty, the research revealed. Indeed, patients with the poorest physician relationship were three times more likely to leave than those with high-quality relationships. Today, those figures might be even higher: With the upheavals in insurance coverage and physicians increasingly available at a pharmacy, urgent care center or via telemedicine, some people no longer even visit their own primary care doctors.

My most recent appointment with my doctor made reaching a decision much easier. For years, he discussed my health with me in his office while typing his observations into an electronic health record on his computer. He would turn sideways to talk with me, then look back at his screen. He typically looked at the computer more than at me, but at least I could see his face.

In my latest visit, that arrangement was no more. Instead, he sat at a computer in his examining room with his back to me. Yes, he literally turned his back on me. I could still hear his voice but now without seeing his face.

“The electronic medical record has turned physicians into data entry technicians,” Dr. Russell Phillips, director of the Center for Primary Care at Harvard Medical School, told me. “It inserts an interference between doctor and patient.” A study last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine painted a picture of this predicament. It showed that while physicians are in the examination room with patients, they spent only 53 percent of their time on face-to-face contact and 37 percent on medical records and other administrative chores.

Clearly I now had to turn my back on my doctor, too. The big question was, how? How do you go about firing your longtime doctor? Does the American Medical Association recommend a protocol? Do you just say, “Your services are no longer required?” Or “I’m sorry, but I’ve decided to take my health in a different direction?” Or “Forgive me, but I need to start seeing someone else?”

“So many patients have no idea about how to approach this struggle, and they feel bad about the idea,” George Blackall, associate professor at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and co-author of “Breaking the Cycle: How to Turn Conflict Into Collaboration When You and Your Patients Disagree,” told me. “You should reach out to talk to your doctor. That’s the key. Make clear how you feel. Say what you need.”

How physicians feel about themselves may actually translate into how patients feel about them. The more satisfaction internists take in practicing medicine the more satisfied their patients are likely to be, a study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine concluded. And the reverse also appears to be true. “Burnout and caregiver fatigue among physicians is a real and growing problem that impacts patients,” a spokesman for the American Medical Association told me.

In Mayo Clinic Proceedings last year, Dr. Tait Shanafelt, director of the Mayo Clinic’s program on physician well-being, said, “Research has shown that more than half of U.S. physicians are experiencing symptoms of burnout, and the rate is increasing.”

As I agonized over my decision, a Facebook friend who also goes to my doctor delivered a surprise: She posted a message saying that he would be retiring soon. So I called his office to verify. Yes, the receptionist told me, he would be retiring next month.

So I was spared having to tell him I was defecting, and I’ll soon be seeing another doctor anyway. Mine quit his job before my health went on me (and possibly before his did, too). As it turns out, he’s done me a big favor.

Mr. Feo la Cruz, 46, acknowledged the apathy, particularly after the collapse of the street protests this summer.","The new entity has stripped the opposition-controlled Legislature of power, opened a committee to investigate treason charges against opponents and aims to rewrite the Constitution.

And the street protests that have rocked Venezuela for months this year, leaving at least 120 dead, have largely dissolved, leaving few outlets of opposition to the country’s ruling socialist party.

“What we are living is no longer a democracy,” said Mr. Feo la Cruz. But he added that he still saw a chance on Sunday to “convert it back into a democracy.”

Many experts are not as optimistic. Luis Vicente León, who heads Datanálasis, a Venezuelan polling firm whose numbers show wide support for the president’s rivals, says opposition politicians may sweep the statehouses, only to find themselves powerless once they enter them.

“What’s clear is that these governors won’t be able to govern,” he said.

And if the election is any sign of what lies ahead for the opposition, it will be a rough road.

One of its most popular politicians, Henrique Capriles, was banned by the government this year from participating in politics. A half-dozen other opposition mayors were sentenced to jail this summer, with some fleeing the country afterward.

Venezuela’s electoral commission, controlled by Mr. Maduro’s allies, has printed ballots with the names of opposition candidates who are not running and moved many polling places far from neighborhoods that voted for the opposition in the past.

Even the election’s date was manipulated. Venezuelans have been waiting more than a year to vote for governors since the government abruptly suspended the election last year. It rescheduled the vote for the fall only after the protests dissolved.

“I refer to it as an ‘authoritarian project,’ or a ‘deficient democracy,’” said David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group based in the United States. “There is a big gray zone between dictatorship and democracy that Venezuela is in right now.”

Mr. Smilde said the government’s main motivation for even holding the vote at all was to undo Venezuela’s increasing isolation from neighbors.

The day after the new ruling assembly was formed in July, the Trump administration imposed sanctions against Mr. Maduro and eventually banned banks from buying the state oil company’s debt, aside from short term notes of credit.

Last month, a group of 12 Latin American countries released a statement declaring that they wouldn’t recognize the new governing assembly either, a move that complicates the cash-strapped government’s ability to obtain loans.

“They want to be able to point to this election and say, ‘We are a democracy,’” said Mr. Smilde. “They are hoping to hold on, and that the international community will get used to them as they did with Zimbabwe, Cuba and other countries.”

For its part, the opposition is hoping that the election will give it a political toehold in the country. And it thinks that Mr. Feo la Cruz’s state, Carabobo, is ripe territory for that.

Carabobo was once a prosperous region, home to car manufacturing, oil refineries and the country’s largest port. Carabobo has also been stronghold of Mr. Maduro’s party — a former military officer was its governor until recently — and a place where the nation’s economic collapse has taken a large toll. Above its largely empty port is a garbage dump where people now scavenge for food.

“We’ve been three years without water,” said Asimira Lugo, a 60-year-old retiree who watches over her grandchildren in La Belisa, a barrio that has typically voted for Mr. Maduro’s party.

She was watching a campaign event in which Mr. Feo la Cruz was walking the streets to greet potential voters. The smell of open sewage hung in the air and residents put out buckets to collect rain water.

But while residents said they favored Mr. Feo la Cruz, few turned out that day to see him, reflecting a sense of resignation among many Venezuelans that there was little the opposition would be able to do to turn around the country.

“Now no one believes in anyone,” said Jhonathan Hernández, a 36-year-old kiosk owner in Augusto Pinaud, a working-class neighborhood in Puerto Cabello.

Mr. Feo la Cruz, 46, acknowledged the apathy, particularly after the collapse of the street protests this summer.

“It’s been a slow process,” he said. “Our main challenge has been getting people’s hope back and channeling that energy, the spirit of struggle, using the main weapon citizens have now: voting.”

Mr. Maduro’s party is backing Rafael Lacava, the 49-year-old former mayor of Puerto Cabello, who has spent much of the campaign handing out government-subsidized food and inaugurating new building projects to show his sway with the country’s leaders.

He is also known for spontaneous displays on the campaign, like taking off his shirt during events and releasing a stump speech while he runs on a treadmill.

“Carabobo needs soul, it needs for hope to return,” he said in the video, panting from the exercise machine.

But the enthusiasm has not yet translated into widespread support. Only about 18 percent of voters said they favored him in a September survey by Datanálasis, the polling firm.

And it’s that popular advantage over the ruling party that the opposition hopes will boost it, even if it is likely to remain locked out of actually governing, its candidates say.

While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists.
“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967.","Catherine Leroy was 21 when she arrived in Vietnam in 1966 with only a hundred dollars, a Leica M2 and a limited professional portfolio. Over the next three years covering the war, she built an exceptional body of work: surviving and documenting a capture by the North Vietnamese Army, parachuting in combat operations with the 173rd Airborne, and being published on the covers of major magazines, including Life and Paris Match.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges. They are candid and revealing, attesting to her resiliency, exposing insecurities, and showing her in moments of triumph, despair, optimism or courage.

Photo

Despite her many strong images, Ms. Leroy had remained relatively unknown, partly because she wasn’t a self-promoter, and partly because women photographers have often been excluded from the medium’s history, especially war photography. Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”

The “war at home” phrase captured the idea that the war had been lost on the home front. It was a story line promulgated by Hollywood within which veteran disparagement became a kind of “war story,” a way of credentialing the warrior bona fides of veterans who may have felt insecure about their service in Vietnam. In “First Blood,” the inaugural Rambo film, the protagonist, John Rambo, flashes back to “those maggots at the airport, spittin’, callin’ us baby killers and all kinds of vile crap.” The series supported the idea that decisions in Washington had hamstrung military operations. “Apocalypse Now” fed outright conspiracy theories that the C.I.A.’s secret war run from Washington had undercut the military mission. “Coming Home” and “Hamburger Hill” played on male fears of unfaithful wives and girlfriends, a story line hinting that female perfidy and the feminist subversion of warrior morale had cost us victory.

Women had been prominent in the opposition to the war. Two organizations, Women Strike for Peace and the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, led early protests; Cora Weiss, Jane Fonda and Joan Baez lent their social and celebrity standing to the efforts to end the fighting. New Left organizations such as the campus-based Students for a Democratic Society intersected with the burgeoning women’s movement to boost young women into leadership roles in the antiwar movement. Placards reading “Girls Say Yes to Boys Who Say No” — no to the draft, that is — lent credence to the fears of conservatives who were pro-war and distraught over loosening strictures on premarital sex and believed that the rising of the women meant societal collapse.

The adoption of long hair, embroidered shirts and bell-bottom pants, and general rejection of military bearing by men in the movement evinced a softening of conventional sex-gender boundaries. By the late 1960s, troops in Vietnam were battling authorities over hair length, and the right to wear love-bead necklaces and draw peace symbols on their helmets.

Finger pointing for the loss of the war began even before it was over. The pacifists and radicals who stoked the antiwar movement were easy targets for the patriotic right wing looking for scapegoats, but the visibility of women in the resistance to the war made them suspects as well. After Ms. Fonda went to North Vietnam on a peace mission in 1972, she was denounced as a traitor in profanely sexist language and tarred as “Hanoi Jane.” Years later, the feminist author Susan Faludi wrote that fears of emasculation having cost America its victory in Vietnam were the basis of a backlash against women in the 1980s.

But, the reporter pressed, why spitting? Resisting the urge to plunge into the Freudian exegesis I wanted to take, I pointed to the long history of spitting imagery in legends of betrayal. In the New Testament, Christ’s followers spit on him in renunciation of their loyalty. Following Germany’s defeat in World War I, soldiers returning from the front claimed to have been spat on by women and girls. The German stories were studied by historians and found to be part of the “Dolchstosslegende,” or stab-in-the-back legend, that the military had been betrayed behind the lines, sold out at home.

Anticipating the question, I agreed that the presence of such stories in religious teachings and myths only pressed more questions to the fore about where the biblical Apostles and German folklorists got them, questions that will keep professors and students of cultural studies occupied for years.

But, I ventured, where the stories go — how they play out in the political culture — is more important than where they come from. The reporter seemed interested. In Germany, I recalled, the imagery of shellshocked World War I veterans became a stand-in for the nation’s lost pride and damaged sense of racial superiority. The riffs of betrayal in the photographs, films and news reports of veterans made victims by war kept alive the certainty that enemies outside the gates could never defeat a rearmed and unified Germany; the stories incited a dangerous witch hunt that led to the Holocaust.

Is the abiding American discomfort with the war it lost in Vietnam and the enduring allure of the spat-upon veteran stories indicative of betrayal preoccupations at work in our own culture? Is it the post-Vietnam lost-war narrative that feeds the back-to-the-future sentiments in campaign promises to restore and rebuild America? And are the recent public and political spectacles of nativism and gun-toting masculinity symptoms of a wounded people more than deviant personalities?

Fancy candles have become so ubiquitous, they sometimes feel like unthoughtful gifts. This holiday season, I will instead be giving a new collection of soaks and salts from the natural beauty store Follain. For the product line, the shop’s founder Tara Foley worked with four of her favorite brands: The Follain x Farmaesthetics Dream Bath Elixir, a cloudy tonic with blue yarrow and eucalyptus essential oils, fosters deep breathing, while the lactic acid in Follain x RICA’s milk bath of white clay and pink rose promises to soften the skin. Then there’s the detoxifying lavender bath salt (with salt sourced from Utah, Bolivia, the Himalayas and the Dead Sea), a collaboration with the Malibu brand OSEA, that hits the water with a satisfying fizz. Finally, after toweling off, try the rose body butter, a collaboration between Follain and Organic Bath Co. “People love to luxuriate in the ingredients and take a moment for themselves away from the noise,” says Foley, a “a huge bath person” who’s bound to make converts of us all. follain.com — KATE GUADAGNINO

An Art Show Downtown, for One Night Only

“I don’t want to rail against capitalism or anything,” begins the gallerist Bill Powers , “but the art world can get a bit corporate — and the more expensive it gets, the more corporate it gets. It’s nice to do something outside of the white box.” Like, say, inside the pastel-hued Café Henrie on the Lower East Side, where, last month, Powers introduced his “One Night Only” artist series, which put the work of Austin Eddy on display for the titular one night. The next installment is scheduled for Oct. 19 and will feature paintings by the club owner and D.J. Paul Sevigny. According to Powers, some of the pieces have a Pop Art-y, Sister Corita vibe and others are minimalist and muted, more in the tradition of Robert Motherwell.

The evening will effectively be Sevigny’s debut as a fine artist. “I always think — and this is going to sound completely insane — that there’s an element of public service to what I do,” explains Powers, who founded the Upper East Side Half Gallery . “Even though Paul is widely successful, this was a sort of secret wish of his, and I’m happy to be a part of that. Hopefully, we sell a couple of works and bring some different worlds together, but I don’t think this is the first step toward his MoMA retrospective,” he says, laughing. “And it doesn’t have to be.” Oct. 19, from 7 to 11 p.m. Café Henrie, 116 Forsyth Street, New York — HILARY MOSS

A Kerry James Marshall Tote, for a Cause

Many times cooler than standard gift shop gear — the Van Gogh umbrella, the Monet scarf — are the custom artist totes that the New York brand MZ Wallace has made for its Gives Back program. In 2015, co-founders Monica Zwirner and Lucy Wallace Eustice printed a black and white text-based painting by Glenn Ligon onto their roomy quilted Metro Tote, with proceeds from the limited run going to the Studio Museum in Harlem’s art education programs. Another tote, featuring a Raymond Pettibon drawing that posits “Good prose is of no harm,” benefited the New York Public Library.

Now, the pair has teamed up with Kerry James Marshall . Zwirner got the idea while wandering through Marshall’s “Mastry” exhibition last year, which first opened at the MCA Chicago. Funds from the new collaboration will go to that museum’s education initiatives, which is fitting given the artist’s ties to the community (he lives and works in Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood) and the fact that he first entered a museum on a sixth-grade field trip. Zwirner points out that the image on the bag — one of Marshall’s vibrant, untitled works of a painter with her palette — mirrors itself on either side of the tote, so that the pictures join at the seam in a way that references the artist’s newer Rorschach-style pieces. “It’s been a dream to work with him,” Zwirner says, “and we’re excited to start seeing them around the city. It becomes a bit of a wink, like ‘you and I are seeing eye to eye. We both decided to support something.’” www.mzwallace.com/kjm — K.G.

New Clothes, With Old Stories Behind Them

It looked like a midlife crisis when, in 2000, Susan Hull Walker quit being a minister to take up weaving. “I was overeducated from the neck up, and thought I wanted to make things with my hands,” she explains. But while doing a Masters in fiber arts at SCAD, she became more enamored of the people and narratives behind various textile traditions than in creating herself. ""There were artisans around the world far better than I could ever be,"" she says, and so she set about traveling the globe to meet them. She quickly realized how easily these “textile languages” could go extinct, forcing the artisans — mostly women — to move away from their villages and their children, in order to take jobs in factories. Dismayed by how nonprofits were encouraging them to churn out touristic knickknacks — “they were only looking at how these women could make money, but not meaning,"" she decided to serve as a bridge between the makers and clients willing to pay for something of value that could be kept for a lifetime.

Walker’s brand, Ibu Movement , is different from other companies in which Western designers make clothing and accessories in the developing world. Because it is essential to her that the artisans be part of the creative process and utilize their particular talents and cultural references — not simply make things in Western neutrals — she has studied the individual skills of the more than 70 artisan groups and collectives she works with in 34 different countries. She then hires someone whose global style and sensibility she admires, like Ali McGraw, to design a collection, and acts as craft matchmaker, finding the right artisan for each idea. (She also follows along through execution, encouraging the designer to tweak or adapt their concept to make it more relevant to a crafter’s particular skills.) By creating high quality items, she is able to pay the workers ""a more than fair-trade wage."" “These women have huge skill sets that have never been valued,” she says. “In the same way that I get paid for what I know, I want them to be paid for what they know.""

Walker’s latest collaboration with the well-traveled interior designer and author Charlotte Moss has more 50 pieces, from Moroccan indigo caftans to felted wool dresses from Kyrgyzstan to Peruvian jewelry carved from cow horn (who knew?). One of Moss’s little black dresses even employs an open needlework technique done by Afghani women, typically used to cover the eye opening in a burqa. A bridge indeed. The Charlotte Moss for Ibu Boutique is open at the Pierre Hotel, 2 East 61st Street through Sunday, Oct. 15th. ibumovement.com, — DEBORAH NEEDLEMAN

A Book That Will Remind You Why You Love New York

For her new book, “Worn in New York,” the writer and T contributor Emily Spivack asked 68 interesting individuals one question: “What piece of clothing reminds you of a significant moment or experience in New York City?” The result is a page-turning collection of short stories that range from funny and inspiring to nostalgic. It’s a beautiful window into how the city has shaped so many lives — and offers a glimpse into the things people wore during particularly poignant moments. There’s Aubrey Plaza’s old NBC page uniform (she only lasted in the program a few months before stealing the suit); the leather boots a North Carolina software executive was wearing as US Airways flight 1549 crash-landed on the Hudson River; and Elizabeth Taylor’s flashy Givenchy jumpsuit — pink and yellow and wine-stained, which Coco Rocha scored at a Christie’s Auction and wore to the Met Gala in 2012. In between are countless comical and bizarre little incidents that will leave you smiling to yourself and thinking, “Only in New York ...” $25, amazon.com — ALAINNA LEXIE BEDDIE

Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.

What’s the appeal of playing the jerk?

It’s just so damn fun. There’s jerks and there’s villains. Villains, I think, are very aware of who they are and what they’re doing and their effect on the world. Jerks tend to think they’re great guys. There’s something really funny about exploring all the things that we think are thoughtful and considerate, but that we actually have no clue how we’re affecting everybody around us. And because I tend to be a Frank Capra person who believes in the essential goodness of humankind, the jerks I play are somehow a little easier to live with. Because somewhere there’s the hope of a better person underneath that just can’t seem to make its way to the surface — and probably never will.

In real life, you seem like just a nice guy from Iowa.

In real life, I know to filter all my jerk opinions and my jerk thoughts and my jerk desires. And there’s a thing about the small-town Midwest where it’s set up to be a jerk-free zone — which doesn’t mean that it actually is. But everybody has to be nice there. Even when you’re being miserable to somebody you do it in a sort of underhanded way. We don’t have that New York thing where you can shout at people in the street and be fine with it at the end.

Speaking of small-town life, you recently appeared in “Lucky” with Harry Dean Stanton, who died last month.

That’s one of those where they call you up and they say, “There’s this little independent movie, you’re basically working for free, you’re going to do a couple scenes with Harry Dean Stanton and David Lynch, and John Carroll Lynch is directing it. We’re going to send you over the script” — and I just cut him off and go, “The answer is yes.” They want me to play a vacuum cleaner and I’m going to be in that movie, you know what I mean? Harry is so iconic, so utterly himself, so individual. It was extraordinary.

You turned 50 in June. Is that as traumatic for a man in Hollywood as it is for a woman, or are you still considered in your prime?

Ha! I wouldn’t say that you’re considered in your prime. Um, no. But it would be egregiously false to say that it’s the same thing for women. I’d say 50 on men is like 33 on women in Hollywood. The standards — it’s just the way we do our storytelling. And I hope it will change because I think it’s dumb. My wife is an actor, one of the greats — she’s not 50 yet — but it would be an absolute crime if I continued to work and she didn’t, given what we’ve all seen that she’s capable of bringing to the screen.

Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, a song from Beck’s new album, “Colors”; an international throwdown from Major Lazer (and guests); and a blippy tune from Kailee Morgue.

Mavis Staples, ‘Little Bit’

Mavis Staples has sung for civil rights since the 1960s , and she knows her work isn’t over. “Little Bit” is from her album due Nov. 17, produced and mostly written by Jeff Tweedy of Wilco and titled “If All I Was Was Black.” A lean, unsparing blues guitar riff carries her through “Little Bit,” envisioning young lives lost to deadly force: “Poor kid they caught him/without his license/That ain’t why they shot him/They say he was fighting,” she sings, bitter, tearful and determined. JON PARELES

Beck, ‘Seventh Heaven’

Beck’s new album, “Colors,” flaunts the infinite overdubbing and polishing of state-of-the-art digital recording. Working with a hitmaking producer, Greg Kurstin (Adele, Kelly Clarkson), he makes every track a glossy tour de force, with quick-changing arrangements and ever more encyclopedic pop allusions. “Seventh Heaven” juxtaposes thoughts of euphoric love and disillusionment — “We shoot for the empire/Land in the dust pile” — amid shimmering keyboards, skeins of intertwined guitars and ever more buoyant choruses. The romance in the lyrics doesn’t work out, but the studio is a paradise. J.P.

Major Lazer and DJ Maphorisa (featuring Nasty C, Ice Prince, Patoranking and Jidenna), ‘Particula’

Major Lazer and collaborators from South Africa (DJ Maphorisa, Nasty), Nigeria (Ice Prince, Patoranking) and Wisconsin (Jidenna) have concocted a sleek, amiable global come-on with a one-sentiment-fits-all hook — “I like you girl in particula” — delivered by Ice Prince in the Nigerian version of a Jamaican dancehall growl. The track meshes the 4/4 thump and four-chord cycle of international dance music with the syncopated percussion of South African kwaito and crucially, the lilt and tickle of countermelodies from African guitars. Not international enough? Jidenna goes bilingual: “Can I see your particulars?/I've been screening you like una pelicula.” J.P.

Sam Newsome and Jean-Michel Pilc, ‘Giant Steps’

A soprano saxophonist with a streamlined intensity and a flinty iconoclasm, Mr. Newsome is most often heard these days on his own solo-sax recordings . Here he adds just one more instrument, the piano of Mr. Pilc, who works in splashes of stark color and pushes a centrifugal momentum. “Magic Circle,” their new album, mostly includes reworkings of classic jazz repertory, saxophone and piano circling each other, fleeing comfort and terra firma. John Coltrane’s “Giant Steps” is all about harmony; the melody, now iconic, is really just a top note of each fast-changing chord. But Mr. Newsome and Mr. Pilc treat it as something like a dismembered line, a path of twisty illogic unto itself. It flows over and about the outlines of its harmonic riverbed, and freed of any set rhythm. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Rex Orange County featuring Benny Sings, ‘Loving Is Easy’

Rex Orange County’s lo-fi lounge music is soothing, sunny and slightly off-kilter. The British singer-songwriter worked with a kindred spirit, Tyler, the Creator, on his most recent album, but his own music has a meandering charm. “Loving Is Easy,” his latest single, is less barbed than his earlier songs — where he was once dubious about the world around him, here he finally opens up to its possibilities. JON CARAMANICA

Mallrat, ‘Better’

The 19-year-old songwriter from Brisbane who calls herself Mallrat has a sleepy delivery and a knack for singsong melodies that grow hypnotically familiar. “Better” seems to be about ephemeral comforts: “Everyone’s alive so everything’s all right but/Maybe when the summer ends I’ll drift away from all my friends.” While Mallrat circles through her melodies, the ingenious track finds endless variety in three chords, morphing imperceptibly from simple guitar strumming to three-chord rock to quasi-orchestral splendor; Mallrat isn’t as nonchalant as her voice might seem. J.P.

Sufjan Stevens, ‘Wallowa Lake Monster’

Sufjan Stevens stayed quiet and folky throughout “Carrie & Lowell,” his 2015 album about the death of his mother. On Nov. 24, he will release “The Greatest Gift,” a collection of demos and outtakes recorded in the same sessions, including this previously unreleased song. “Wallowa Lake Monster” starts out delicately, with wispy but restless picking behind Stevens’s whispery voice; he asks: “Have you heard the story of my mother’s fate?/She left us in Detroit in the rain.” But as he connects his mother to larger forces of Nature and myth, the music swells with electronics, crescendos of orchestral brass and female voices that eventually take over the track for wordless rapture and mourning. It might have upended the album, but it stands on its own. J.P.

Kailee Morgue, ‘Medusa’

Kailee Morgue’s debut single, “Medusa,” is an eerie, floating incantation that’s not as skeletal as it seems. A plinking six-note pattern recurs throughout the song, bolstered by sparse percussion and a few bass notes; harplike arpeggios and cooing voices waft in from above. Ms. Morgue’s breathy voice sketches an encounter with Medusa; in the moment she’s turned to stone, she’s “chosen” to join “ghosts of past heroes” and “fight until you’re hopeless,” and it sounds like bliss. J.P.

Kane Brown, ‘What’s Mine Is Yours’

A tender, determined song about romantic dedication from the promising young country singer Kane Brown, drawn from the recently released deluxe edition of his major label debut album. Mr. Brown isn’t a vocal powerhouse, but his voice is lithe, and he delivers with real shading here. This song cribs part of its melody from Toni Braxton’s “Un-break My Heart,” but Mr. Brown strips out the pomp and imbues it with modesty. J.C.

Kadawa featuring Adam O’Farrill, ‘Shades of a Happy Ending’

A guitar-bass-drums trio of young Israeli-American musicians, Kadawa has just released its first album, a self-titled effort featuring 12 original compositions. The sound is about joy and force in equal measure, full of hummable melodies and moments of proud combustion. On “Shades of a Happy Ending,” the trio is joined by the young trumpet lion Adam O’Farrill and the trombonist Matt Bumgardner. What begins as a giddy shuffle bursts into splayed reverie, the horns tangling and jousting with Tal Yahalom’s guitar, before the melancholy melody takes hold once again.

Downes won the title during their bruising rematch that July in London. But he was disappointed that it ended when Pender did not rise from his stool at the start of the 10th round.

“The fight wasn’t going Pender’s way,” Downes said to The Daily Mail. “And he wasn’t daft. He jacked it in because he knew he had a return fight in Boston. He was getting beat and did not want to take a battering.”

Back in Boston the next year for the last fight of their trilogy, Pender reclaimed the middleweight belt in a 15-round slugfest.

Downes faced Robinson, a five-time world middleweight champion and one of the greatest fighters in history, in 1962 five months after losing the title to Pender. But by then Robinson was 41 and past his prime.

“I didn’t beat Sugar Ray,” Downes said after beating him in 10 rounds on points. “I beat his ghost.”

Downes’s fighting career competed with the increasing attention he received for his part ownership of betting shops with Sam Burns, his manager. The British government legalized betting shops nationwide in 1961, and within two years Downes said he had sold a share of his shops for $728,000, although he and Burns retained control of them.

Later that year, Downes played down suggestions that he would retire to tend to the shops. “I got to fight so I can sleep nights, mate,” he said after ending a six-month layoff by fighting Rudolph Nehring as a light-heavyweight. “I’m too young to go to seed, but I haven’t slept properly since I stopped training. Now that I’m back in harness, I sleep like a baby.”

Downes fought three more times after knocking out Nehring, all as a light-heavyweight. In his final fight, in late 1964, he faced Willie Pastrano, the world champion. Downes pressed Pastrano with his swarming style until Pastrano sent Downes to the canvas twice in the 11th round and the referee stopped the bout.

Downes and Burns owned the betting shops until the early 1970s, when they sold them to the William Hill bookmaking chain.

Terence Richard Downes was born in the Paddington neighborhood of London on May 9, 1936. His father, Richard, was a mechanic, and his mother, the former Hilda Horwood, worked at a department store. His father taught him the basics of boxing, a skill he found useful in the streets.

“Every day of my life was a fight day,” he told The Telegraph. “You’d sock some kid on the nose and his big brother was round later to avenge the family name.”

He was having increasing success as an amateur, fighting for a local club, when his family left for Baltimore in 1952 to care for his sister, Sylvia, a trapeze artist who had lost her right arm in a traffic accident.

During his five years in the United States, Downes fought at a local Y.M.C.A. and joined the Marines, where he was among the 10 Eastern representatives scheduled to fight in the boxing trials for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Ultimately, he did not meet the residency requirement that would have allowed him to represent the United States.

“I was all right to be in the bloody Marine Corps, catching bullets in the front line,” he told The Guardian, “but with boxing gloves they said no, you can’t represent us.”

He returned to Britain in 1957 and began his professional career with two quick victories. But he lost his third fight on a fifth-round technical knockout to Dick Tiger, a future champion whose skills were greatly underestimated by the promoter.

Afterward, Downes said he had wondered why he had been matched with a giant — but “then I realized I was flat on my back looking up at him.”

In addition to his wife, the former Barbara Clarke, he is survived by his sons, Terry Jr., Paul and Richard; his daughters, Melanie Cooke and Wendy McNicholas; eight grandchildren; and his sister, Sylvia Haddaway.

After his boxing career, Downes acted onstage, on television and in movies like “A Study in Terror” (1965), a Sherlock Holmes film, and Roman Polanski’s 1967 horror comedy, “The Fearless Vampire Killers,” in which he portrayed the servant of Count von Krolock, a vampire played by Ferdy Mayne.

Mr. Polanski spotted Downes being interviewed on television and was aware of his lack of acting experience. But something about Downses’s face and physique led him to hire him to play the servant, Koukol.

“Maybe he didn’t like the look of me,” Downes told The Daily Mail. “He cast me as a bloody monster, a hunchback with a deformed face and a club foot.”",Terry Downes Dies at 81; Middleweight Champion Was Britain’s Pride,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/obituaries/terry-downes-dead-middleweight-champion-and-britains-pride.html

She admits that she’s no good at saving. She doles out money without hesitation to those in need. A dollar for the man by the side of the road. Nicole’s car payment. A $1,200 surgery for a pit bull she’d adopted that had swallowed steel wool.

Ricardo pecked at a calculator.

“Sixteen,” he announced. Rexnord could pay 16 Ricardos for the cost of one Shannon.

“But you don’t understand,” Shannon said. “They have the money. They just don’t want to give it to you.”

Shannon felt closer to the younger trainee, Tadeo. (His last name has been withheld due to his concerns about future job prospects.) He was 23, the same age as her son. Shannon called him “Tad” or “Kid.” He had a sparse goatee, and a habit of saying “yes, yes,” even when Shannon wasn’t sure he had understood.

Shannon never left him alone in the factory. He trailed behind her like a duckling when she went outside to smoke.

“Want some chips?” she’d ask him. “What kind of music do you like?”

He brought her cookies and showed her a video on his phone of his girlfriend receiving flowers he’d sent for her birthday.

Once, Shannon mentioned how long it took her to drive to work.

“You own a car?” he asked.

“You don’t?” she replied.

Shannon could have given Tad the bare minimum of training, answering a few questions and collecting her pay. But just as Stan Settles had passed on his knowledge to Shannon, Shannon trained Tad as if he were one of her own.

She showed him how to bolt in the coil and to make sure the steel rings spun without touching the sides. Affix the wrong bullnose and the shaft could break.

“O.K.,” Shannon said. “It’s your turn.”

Tad worked on the Tocco all afternoon. Shannon noticed water leaking from the hoses. A loose hose could shoot water clear across the factory.

“Tighten down your hoses,” she said.

He had also installed the copper piece backward. But that was no big deal. He had skillfully navigated the challenges of translating English to Spanish, inches to meters. She felt proud of Tad.

Before he returned to Mexico, Tad pulled Shannon aside. He put his hand over his heart.

“My friend tells me that the reason a lot of people don’t like us is because we’re taking their jobs,” he said, sounding distraught.

“I’m not mad at you,” she said. “I’m happy that you get the opportunity to make some money. I was blessed for a while. I hate to see it go. Now it’s your turn to be blessed.”

Shannon unclipped the barrette in her hair and tilted her head forward, revealing a bald spot the size of a silver dollar. Her daughter, Nicole, touched it gingerly, squinting.

In the midst of Carmella’s many surgeries, Shannon’s hair had fallen out in clumps. “Stress-related balding,” she said.

“I think it’s gotten smaller,” Nicole said. “Really.”

Shannon had fought bitterly for custody of Nicole, but she had run out of money for a lawyer. Nicole’s father won. After he died of a heart attack, Nicole moved in with his mother, Patricia Wynne. Shannon scraped together $5,000 for a down payment on a house nearby, in Whitestown, and Nicole spent some weekends there.

Shannon and Nicole had grown closer since the news of the factory’s closing. Shannon called often, weeping about her lost seniority and all the time she’d missed with her kids while she was at work. Nicole murmured, “We’ll make it through this,” as if she were the parent and Shannon the child.

Nicole, who had learned to call 911 by the age of 4 because of her parents’ fights, channeled her anxiety into timelines, budgets and lists. Now, she nudged her mother to think about the future.

“How many months do we have insurance?” Nicole asked.

“Six months,” Shannon replied. “After I lose my job.”

“What are we going to do when we don’t have health care?” Nicole asked. “What about Carmella?”

The questions hung in the spring air like a windsock, blowing this way and that.

An even bigger question loomed: Nicole had been accepted to Purdue University, but had no idea how she could afford to go. Nicole needed to let Purdue know that her mother was losing her job and could not help with tuition.

“I should be able to provide for you,” Shannon lamented. “I don’t even know what I’m going to do now. I will go back to school. I got to. Because it’s paid for. I need to take advantage of it.”

Shannon was eligible for up to two years of retraining under the federal government’s trade adjustment assistance program. But retraining for what? Nursing? She had taken a few nursing classes, years ago.

Nicole, who intended to study nursing herself, cocked her head to one side. “I’m not saying you’re old,” Nicole began.

Shannon laughed, as if conceding that nursing school was a wild idea.

A few weeks later, Shannon agonized about what to wear to Honors Night at Nicole’s school, when they would find out whether she had gotten any scholarships.

“I don’t want to embarrass my daughter, by no means,” she said.

She settled on a black dress with white stripes from J. C. Penney. She looked stately in it, and thought it would help her blend in with other mothers at the school. She’d picked up an outfit for her son, Bub, too: gray cargo pants and a blue shirt. He took them from her and retreated into the bathroom, past a pile of unwashed clothes.

Shannon sat in her front yard, wrapping strands of wet hair around yellow pencils, to make curls. She looked out across the country road at tilled fields of corn. In her yard, three dead cars and two dead trucks awaited resurrection. In the garage, her boyfriend, Larry Borer, cussed out an engine. Pit bulls barked in their pen.

Even without college, Nicole had already gone further than anyone else in Shannon’s house. Shannon and Larry both got their G.E.D., but Bub did not.",Becoming a Steelworker Liberated Her.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband.
With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect.
Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

The Kenyan Supreme Court’s decision on Sept. 1 to invalidate the country’s presidential election because of widespread irregularities was widely hailed at the time as an important first for African democracy and the rule of law. It may yet prove to be that, if a new poll is seen to be free and fair. That prospect, however, is looking increasingly and dangerously dimmer by the day.

The court’s ruling, made under new constitutional rules, appeared reasonably straightforward: nullify the disputed election and hold a new one within 60 days. Instead, the process has disintegrated into a bitter and confusing confrontation between the two major candidates, scions of rival political dynasties rooted in different ethnic groups.

Raila Odinga, the opposition leader, abruptly dropped out of the race on Tuesday after repeatedly charging that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission had failed to make any changes after bungling the August election. The rerun scheduled for Oct. 26, he declared, would be “worse than the previous one.” Though the Supreme Court made no clear recommendations on what the commission should do in the rerun, the fact that the court found enough irregularities to nullify the election clearly seemed to require at least technical changes in the complex electronic process of tallying and reporting votes. None have been made.

For his part, President Uhuru Kenyatta, who had been declared the winner in the Aug. 8 vote, further provoked the opposition by pushing controversial legislation through Parliament that will make it harder for the judiciary to nullify future elections.

Pleasant, clean-cut and “incongruously cheerful,” he chain smoked through the interview, offering a gripping biography with a “fluent command of language.”

“He smiles frequently, sometimes winningly, shows occasionally just a touch of ruefulness,” the psychiatrist, William B. McGrath, noted. “No despair, alarm or concern about his fate is manifest.”

“I get the impression he enjoys being an interesting subject of examination,” the doctor wrote. He concluded that Mr. Paddock was bright, with no history of “mental defect,” and was able to stand trial. But, the doctor added, Mr. Paddock had a “sociopathic personality.”

The portrait of Stephen Paddock that investigators have assembled stands in stark contrast: Reserved, even boring, he was an accountant and investor who liked to gamble only after calculating all the risks. Before the shooting, the authorities say, he had never broken the law. Among the many questions that are unanswered is what influence, if any, his father’s absence and infamy had on his life.

“We are establishing the timeline of the suspect’s life, his motivation and everybody else associated with him throughout time,” Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. The F.B.I. has hundreds of agents on the case and more than 1,000 pieces of evidence, said Aaron Rouse, the special agent in charge in Las Vegas.

A statement from the Clark County coroner’s office said that an autopsy on Mr. Paddock had been completed, and that “multiple forensic analyses” would be performed, including an examination of brain tissue.

Benjamin Paddock had boasted during his psychological evaluation that his run-ins with authority started early and rarely stopped. He was an only child, pampered by his mother and not disciplined by his father. “I got away with an awful lot,” he told his evaluator. “I went where I felt like it, disrupting everybody’s schedule.” By 12 he was driving his own car.

He quit high school almost as soon as he started, then joined the Navy at age 15, but was discharged a few months later, he said, when the Navy figured out, “I wasn’t going to do what they wanted me to.”

He drove buses in Los Angeles, but got fired for a game of bus tag with other drivers.

In 1946 he was caught stealing a car in Chicago and reselling it in “a fraudulent fashion.” He spent five years in prison, 70 percent of it, he said, “in the hole,” or solitary confinement, because he was “unable or unwilling to abide by rules.”

When he got out, he made good money selling used cars in Chicago, but quit because, he explained, “the thrill had gone out of it.”

During that time he got married and fathered Stephen, who was born in 1953. He also set up a fraud ring that he said passed $90,000 in bad checks. He was caught and sent back to prison.

When he was released in 1956, he moved with his wife and son to Tucson. The couple had three more sons, and Benjamin Paddock operated a service station, a nightclub and a garbage disposal franchise. He bought a house and car, and got involved in the local hot rod and ham radio clubs.

He also walked into the sheriff’s office and offered to counsel troubled youths.

“I only took the incorrigibles,” he told his evaluator. “I have a knack for social work with kids. I told them I had a degree in social psychology and nobody bothered to check up on it. They regarded me as a leading light on juvenile delinquency.”

He boasted that none of his charges had ever ended up back in court.

While Stephen Paddock was playing at the family’s white ranch house, his father was robbing banks with a snub-nosed revolver and getting away in the family station wagon. He said the ham radio equipment he kept in the car was ideal for a robber because he could listen in on the police.

Benjamin Paddock was caught in 1960. But the bank robbery charges, he insisted to the psychiatrist, were a case of mistaken identity. A criminal syndicate was forcing him to take the rap.

For years after Mr. Paddock was arrested, his sons were told he was dead. Later they learned the truth and some visited him, his son Eric Paddock said, but none seemed to form a close relationship. Eric Paddock cursed his father in an interview and said he was angry at him for being more interested in crime than his family.

But Mr. Bush’s post-Sept. 11 popularity instilled the administration with an arrogance that extended far beyond the war itself. The president’s inner circle became convinced that the Republican Party was destined for years of unbroken political domination; the ambition-spoiling concerns of the “reality-based community” no longer needed to be taken into account.

National security fear-mongering and culture war controversies, especially over same-sex marriage, were employed to rally the base and ensure its loyalty, even as dissatisfaction with Mr. Bush’s governance continued to grow.

The Bush presidency, then, was both a failure and a fraud. Instead of foreign policy restraint and modest conservative governance, the Bush administration delivered a pair of endless deficit-financed wars, cynical posturing over social issues, soaring federal spending and, eventually, a large-scale emergency intervention in the economy.

Arguably as important as the particular failures themselves, however, was the way the party infrastructure — its leaders and functionaries, its activists and operators — formed a partisan phalanx around the president, playing down his flaws, if not refusing to acknowledge them.

There is always some space between a party’s voters and its leaders, some difference between what the average supporter wants and what the elected representatives are willing to do. But by excusing Mr. Bush’s errors, Republicans radically expanded the trust deficit, creating a yawning gap between the party’s base and its elites, one that has persisted, and grown, in the years since.

In many ways the party’s hangups stem from its unwillingness to fully reckon with the Bush legacy.

Mr. Bush left many voters on the right angry, resentful and suspicious — of war, of policy, of ideology, of the very idea of political solutions and leadership.

The focal point for much of the post-Bush right’s anger and resentment was the Tea Party, a decentralized movement that variously mixed genuine desire for limited government with white resentment and flare-ups of outright paranoia. It attracted hucksters and manipulators, in the media and in the activist sphere, and embraced a cast of unconventional and unqualified candidates.

Republican Party elites were only too happy to exploit this inchoate energy as long as it was useful. This is how John McCain ended up selecting an untested firebrand like Sarah Palin as his presidential running mate and how Mitt Romney campaigned with sideshow characters like Kid Rock and, well, eventually Donald Trump.

The partisan push for the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama further amplified these frustrations, which helped Republicans take over the House in 2010.

The defeats of both Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney left the party leaderless, and Mr. Bush’s shredded reputation meant it could not follow the course he had laid out. So the party became defined by what was left: its resentments and suspicions, its antagonisms and obsessions, its anger and its differences. It retreated into tribalism and anti-intellectualism. Eventually, the sideshow became the main event.

Mr. Trump, of course, is the biggest sideshow of them all. He exploited the gap between the base and the elites, embodying the dysfunction and disarray that already existed.

Like all presidents, he serves an organizing function for his party, orienting it around broad goals. But Mr. Trump’s goals have more to do with Twitter feuds and personal aggrandizement than any particular policies. Under Mr. Trump, the party’s chief internal debate is not so much about which governing vision to pursue but whether there should be one at all.

This reality is not lost on all Republicans. Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, one of the party’s most libertarian members, recently said that when he realized that primary voters backed him and his fellow libertarians Rand Paul and Ron Paul, it wasn’t for their ideas. Instead, he said, “they were voting for the craziest son of a bitch in the race — and Donald Trump won best in class.”

Republican voters weren’t voting for any policy outcome. They were voting for chaos. And that, more than anything, is what the party has come to stand for.

A more conventional Republican president might have smoothed over some of these intraparty conflicts, and almost certainly would have managed passing legislation with more skill. But the essential divisions would still have existed.

For years before Mr. Trump was elected, Republicans lacked a consensus plan to replace Obamacare, and their tax reform plans were vague. Republicans blew up the deficit under Mr. Bush before complaining about it under Mr. Obama, and the party has fought bitter internal battles over immigration for decades.

Republican voters, meanwhile, were attracted to shallow political entertainers and obviously unqualified candidates long before Mr. Trump threw his hat in the ring.

Mr. Trump didn’t cause any of this. He just took advantage of it. He is the most successful huckster of the bunch.

While party leaders were quiet under Mr. Bush, some today seem willing to speak out, however haltingly, against Mr. Trump. Republicans would benefit from more of that sort of critical introspection, but it is not enough. Because someday, Mr. Trump will no longer be president.

“I’m about shifting the narrative. We can’t be distracted by what he is trying to do,” Okung said of the president. “We’re honing our voice. We’re not unified against Trump, we’re unified against social injustice.”

In his letter, Okung, an offensive lineman who was named to the Pro Bowl after the 2012 season, lamented that the original message of the protests, which were started last season by Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, had gotten muddled and had exposed divisions among players, fans and owners.

“As Kap’s message has now been distorted, co-opted and used to further divide us along the very racial lines he was highlighting, we as players have a responsibility to come together and respond collectively,” wrote Okung, 30, who is African-American and has Nigerian heritage.

The commissioner and the owners have been meeting small groups of players about the issue at the league’s headquarters and in various cities. About 10 players will also be attending the owners meeting.

Some players have reacted scornfully on social media to the suggestion they might be forced to stand. But Okung’s letter is a rare example of a player trying to unite all his peers in defiance of the league, and it sheds light on the frustration many athletes have only privately expressed regarding recent events.

“Things have clearly gotten out of control,” he wrote. “As a pragmatist, I will admit, I initially doubted the merits of Colin Kaepernick’s protest and questioned the strategy. I was wrong.

“There is now no doubt that what he started was a courageous, prophetic, self-sacrificial act that has captivated a nation and inspired a powerful movement,” he added. “If I had his cell phone number, I would tell him that.”

Players routinely speak to teammates and to friends on other teams. Last year, players on several teams coordinated via text messages how to approach the anthem on the first Sunday of the season, which fell on Sept. 11.

Broader conversations across multiple teams, though, have not been possible, Okung wrote, adding that the N.F.L. Players Association was ill-suited to facilitating larger discussions because the players are also competitors and “the system is designed to keep us divided and stifle our attempts to collaborate.”

Okung said in the phone interview that his immediate goal was to identify players across the league who want to do more, then discuss their next steps.

In his letter, Okung invited players to contact him on Twitter and when they do he will send them instructions on how to communicate as a larger group. He said he hoped that his letter reached as many players as possible, and that it “acts as a catalyst to convene a conversation among those of us who are uncomfortable having these important decisions made without us in the room.”

“While I don’t have all the answers as to how to ensure we are not robbed of this moment, I am convinced that we will never make progress if we do not find a way to come together and take action that represents the will of the players,’’ Okung wrote. “What we have is strength in numbers.”",Chargers’ Okung Issues Call to Action for N.F.L.

That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

That’s especially true when you consider the real origin of Wonder Woman, the warrior with the indestructible bracelets and slightly kinky magic lasso who burst into comics in 1941. As it happens, there was more kink to her story than suggested by that golden lasso, which she uses to force her captives to tell the truth and looks like something from a bondage emporium. “On Paradise Island where we play many binding games,” she says in an early comic while roping another woman, “this is considered the safest method of tying a girl’s arms!”

There are some exceedingly delectable questions posed in “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,” and a few frisky binding games on tap too. A sly and thoroughly charming Trojan horse of a movie, “Professor Marston” tells the story of the man who created Wonder Woman and the women who inspired him, both in and out of bed. The movie gleams and has all the smooth surfaces and persuasive detail of a typical period picture — the fedoras, the rides, the Katharine Hepburn trousers. All that luster, which too often in movies suggests polite manners and drowsily safe entertainment, proves to be a seductive, glossy way into something more satisfyingly complicated.

If nothing else, “Professor Marston” is another reminder that once upon a time people had sexual appetites and relationships as complex as those of today (or of 18th-century France), something else the movies don’t always like to admit. Occasionally, grandpa might have even visited a dusty, mysterious shop with sexy specialty items in front and something naughtier in back. Dr. William Moulton Marston (a winning Luke Evans) finds out just how special those items could be when he pops into a store where a man calling himself the G-string King (J.J. Feild) opens up a world of consensual power play and pleasure.

At that point, life has already become interesting for Marston. The writer-director Angela Robinson lays out just how, well, knotty it all is with wit, sympathy and economy. Spanning decades, the story takes flight in 1928 with Marston teaching young lovelies at Radcliffe. “Are you normal?” he asks of a beaming, receptive audience that serves as an amusing stand-in for the viewer. Marston has answers to that and other questions, along with a theory he calls DISC — for dominance, inducement, submission and compliance — which sounds terribly complex and slightly ridiculous. (“D, I, S and C,” the real Marston wrote, “represent nodal points in the integrative emotion series.”)

Ms. Robinson borrows Marston’s theory, using it as a clever if somewhat schematic framing device as she spins her story. There are moments of domination, psychological as well as physical. There are also interludes of inducement, submission and compliance mixed in with a sweet, soft-focus romance that initially involves Marston and his wife, a frustrated academic, Elizabeth Holloway Marston (Rebecca Hall, tart, brisk, essential), and soon includes a third, Olive Byrne (a very good Bella Heathcote). A student, Olive cracks open the Marstons’ marriage, but instead of destroying it helps it grow into a shared, liberating adventure that settles into something cozily domestic.","Review: ‘Professor Marston,’ With Kinks!

The Girl Scouts start in kindergarten: It’s a petal badge, for daisies, who are the youngest members.","Girls will soon be able to join the Boy Scouts. The group says it has a lot to offer girls. But it’s also worth considering what boys could learn from the Girl Scouts.

The organizations are different in many ways, starting with the badges they offer. Over all, the boys seem to have more chances to do things (with badges in activities like whitewater rafting, welding and bugling). The girls have more badges for caring for others (being a good neighbor, a voice for animals, a social butterfly).

The Girl Scouts, who allow only children who identify as girls, say they teach leadership and risk-taking, and are adding badges in outdoor skills, engineering and computer science. But what if the Boy Scouts also did more of what the Girl Scouts do? It could serve them well in their personal lives and their careers.

Boys are falling behind in school and in some parts of the economy. That’s in part because modern-day work relies less on physical labor and more on caregiving and collaboration. Jobs that involve these so-called feminine skills are the ones that are growing, in number and pay, according to research from Harvard.

Meanwhile, when girls are encouraged to do things that boys have traditionally done, but boys aren’t encouraged to do “girl” things, it’s a message that what’s masculine is superior and what’s feminine is inferior. That dynamic helps explain why jobs that are considered traditionally female pay less, and why pay goes down when women enter jobs that used to be done mostly by men.

Some Girl Scout badges promote stereotypical notions of femininity. Many are about helping others. Even the flowers badge asks girls to “find out how flowers help people.” There’s also a focus on appearance. The independence badge, for “striding down your path to changing the world,” includes learning how to “make your clothes look great.” The “eating for you” badge — recently called “eating for beauty” — emphasizes how nutrition helps with “smooth skin, shiny hair and strong nails.”

The Scout Law for each group includes similar virtues, like being honest, helpful and friendly. But girls might be better off, too, if more boys earned badges like those from the Girl Scouts for respect and fair play, and for taking responsibility for their actions, not to mention babysitting and making dinner. In that spirit, here are 10 Girl Scout badges that might benefit Boy Scouts:

Babysitter

Most of the fastest-growing jobs, like those for health aides and physical therapists, involve caring for others, so boys would benefit from learning these skills. Researchers say caring for younger children or pets is a good way to do so (both groups have pet badges.) Even in two-income families, women still do more child care, another reason to teach boys early.

Simple Meals

Women, on average, spend more than twice as much time as men each day preparing food and cleaning up afterward, according to the American Time Use Survey. But everyone needs to eat. The Boy Scouts recently made a badge for cooking a requirement of the Eagle Scout rank.

Scribe

“Words are powerful tools,” this badge’s instructions say. “Just writing down your feelings actually makes you feel better!” Girls are taught to have a larger emotional vocabulary than boys. As a result, many boys end up suppressing their emotions or letting them out in destructive ways, researchers say.

Coaching

This badge requires Girl Scouts to “motivate a team to accomplish its goals.” Teamwork is one of the most important skills in the modern economy. Jobs requiring social skills, like lawyer, nurse and financial manager, have grown much more than those that don’t, like machine operator and welder, research shows. Teamwork is a core part of Boy Scout activities too.

Making Friends

Another badge focuses on social skills, this one for Girl Scouts who “show friends you care” and “learn how to disagree” — skills that would surely be useful for boys in their personal lives and their jobs.

My Great Day

“Life is more fun when it’s running smoothly,” this badge’s instructions say. “Try out some great ways to get organized.” These include sorting, planning and doing homework. Schools reward skills like being organized, waiting one’s turn and following directions. Girls seem to develop self-control earlier, which might be one reason boys have more discipline problems and lower grades in school.

Respect Myself and Others

Respect for others is at the root of many problems today, whether political polarization or sexual harassment. Teaching it to children seems at least as important as woodworking and archery. The Girl Scouts start in kindergarten: It’s a petal badge, for daisies, who are the youngest members.

Responsible for What I Say and Do

Boys tend to have more discipline problems, but the problem, according to educators and researchers, comes when people dismiss them with the excuse that boys will be boys. Taking responsibility for their actions — another petal badge, for kindergarteners and first graders — is a valuable skill for children of either sex. The Boy Scouts emphasize ethical and moral choices in their mission statement.

Fair Play

This badge is for Girl Scouts who learn to “include everyone” and to “be part of a team,” with the idea that “everyone follows the same rules.” Research has shown that one reason women stall before reaching positions of power is that institutions aren’t inclusive. People tend to hire and promote others who look like them. When women offer ideas, they are often interrupted or considered to be too aggressive.

Russell that had previously received a two-season commitment and was estimated to cost $160 million.

“We support Amazon’s decision as in light of recent news and out of respect for all those affected we have decided together that it is best to not move forward with this show,” Mr. Russell said in a statement with two stars of the series, Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore.

Mr. Weinstein, who was fired by his company on Sunday, has responded to allegations of sexual misconduct with a mix of contrition and combativeness. He is contesting his firing and has emphatically denied all allegations of rape. His spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, has said that he is in therapy and “is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.”

Only one person is known to have been permanently pushed out of the academy. Carmine Caridi, a character actor, had his membership revoked in 2004 for violating an academy rule involving Oscar voting. He got caught lending DVD screeners of contending films; copies ended up online. (In the 1990s, a couple of people were suspended temporarily for selling their allotted tickets to the Oscar ceremony.)

Even so, many people in Hollywood think the academy only has one option when it comes to Mr. Weinstein: Kick him out.

Censuring Mr. Weinstein, a fixture on the Oscar circuit for two decades who lived for the validation the awards gave him, would also be a chance for Hollywood to reckon with a past that includes rampant mistreatment of women — all the way back to the days of Mayer and his fellow good-old-boy studio chiefs.

“The idea that anyone would give him a second chance or entertain that notion that he can change is beyond absurd,” Terry Press, the president of CBS Films, wrote on Facebook of Mr. Weinstein. “If the academy does not kick him out, I am resigning my academy membership.”

But ousting Mr. Weinstein would put the academy on a slippery slope, said Martin Kaplan, the director of the Norman Lear Center for the study of entertainment and society at the University of Southern California. “It would move them into adjudicating behavior,” Mr. Kaplan said. “There are plenty of other members with a history of abominable offscreen actions. What kind of bad behavior counts and what doesn’t? What is the red line?”’

If it does nothing, however, the academy risks looking like a shield for Mr. Weinstein — the embodiment of Hollywood aiding and abetting, if only by looking the other way. That is the last thing the academy needs, especially given the work it has done in recent years to address severe racial and gender imbalances in its membership. In January 2016, after two years of #OscarsSoWhite outrage, the academy vowed to double female and minority membership by 2020. As it now stands, the academy has about 8,400 members, with women constituting 28 percent and minorities 13 percent.

The academy declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein beyond a statement it released midweek.

“The academy finds the conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent and antithetical to the high standards of the academy and the creative community it represents,” the statement said.

Mr. Weinstein’s power in Hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the Academy Awards. He was at his height in the late 1990s, when he drove films like “Shakespeare in Love” to best-picture wins and huge ticket sales. Even in a diminished state more recently, he remained a player, prodding the tiny art film “Lion” to six nominations this year.

In total, Mr. Weinstein has overseen campaigns that have resulted in more than 300 Academy Award nominations and best-picture Oscars for “Shakespeare in Love,” “The English Patient,” “Chicago,” “The King’s Speech” and “The Artist.” In addition to his one Oscar win, Mr. Weinstein also holds one nomination, for producing “Gangs of New York.”

Seven months ago, Mr. Weinstein was in his element when he hosted the Weinstein Company’s annual pre-Oscars party at the Montage Beverly Hills hotel. The festivities included a performance of songs from “In the Heights” introduced by Mr. Miranda. When two latecomers – Jay-Z and Beyoncé – entered the ballroom, Mr. Weinstein asked that the songs be performed again.

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

Some observers say that, while the cost of the reserve is untenable, the city should find a better solution.

“As far as what would have been the best thing for the kids in New York City schools, it would have been to find a way to end the A.T.R. without placing those teachers in schools,” said Marcus A. Winters, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

Chicago and Washington, for instance, have put limits of roughly a year on how long a teacher without a permanent assignment can collect a paycheck.

“It’s one of those things that you would hope that even the union would understand — that if you’ve been in the A.T.R. for five years or so, it’s probably time to move on,” Mr. Winters said. As for the de Blasio administration, which is generally seen as close to the teachers’ union, he said, “I don’t know if they were aggressive enough to do it or not.”

Adam Ross, the general counsel for the teachers’ union, the United Federation of Teachers, said, “If an arbitrator finds, upon examining all the facts, that termination is not warranted, it is management’s responsibility to use the employee in question.”

A Question of Energy

Sara Dingledy, the former principal of Westchester Square Academy, a small high school in the Bronx, said that while about half of the reserve teachers who rotated through her school were capable and eager to be hired, “I had a whole bunch of people in who obviously had no interest in getting a job, who wanted to know where the staff room was so they could sit down, who just wanted to surf the computer all day.”

Mr. Blake said that he had applied for a number of jobs, and blamed his trouble in finding a permanent position on his salary. Both he and Ms. Alterescu were at the top teacher pay scale of $113,762 last year.

“It’s a matter of economics,” he said.

Mr. Blake said that he went on roughly two interviews a year, mostly for positions as a cluster teacher — an elementary-level teacher who teaches a subject like science or art to groups of students throughout the day. He said that at his age — about 60 — he didn’t think he would succeed as a regular classroom teacher, who is with the same group of students all day long and is responsible for keeping records on their academic progress and other matters.

“You basically have to be like Bartleby the Scrivener there to keep up with all the logs you have to do for 30 students,” he said of the paperwork.

The department moved to fire Mr. Blake in 2009. His supervisors at Public School 157, the Grove Hill School, in the Bronx, described his lessons as ineffective and his classroom management as poor.

The case was heard before an arbitrator, a process dictated by state law and the teachers’ union contract. The arbitrator, Alan Berg, wrote in his decision that Mr. Blake “appears to lack the energy and enthusiasm necessary to be a truly good teacher,” but imposed a fine rather than firing him. “Being boring alone does not warrant termination,” Mr. Berg said.

Ms. Alterescu worked at Junior High School 189, the Daniel Carter Beard School, in Queens, until 2010. She was twice disciplined for excessive absenteeism or lateness. While she was assigned to a reassignment center, or “rubber room,” in June 2010, she sought and received a doctor’s note saying that she was unable to work, then flew to Chicago for a family reunion, claiming sick time for the two days of work she missed.

The next year, after she had been assigned to the reserve, she was arrested and received desk appearance tickets on two occasions, for altercations with her mother and sister. She did not immediately report the arrests to the department. The department sought to remove her, but an arbitrator, citing her long tenure, imposed a fine instead. Ms. Alterescu said in an interview that she believed the principal of J.H.S. 189 disliked her and that she did not immediately report the desk appearance tickets because she did not think they were arrests. She said the charges in both cases were ultimately dismissed.

Mr. Williams, the former Bronx principal, who is now the vice president of education at Goodwill Central Texas, said that, while principals would no doubt be frustrated to have ineffective teachers forced on them, they weren’t the only ones who would be unhappy.

“No one dislikes a lazy or not-good teacher more than a good teacher,” he said.","Caught Sleeping or Worse, Troubled Teachers Will Return to New York Classrooms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/nyregion/troubled-teachers-back-in-classrooms-new-york.html

At the same point in this postseason, that figure had risen to nearly 51 percent: 171⅔ innings by relievers, just 165⅓ by starters.

Verlander was not a culprit, working six innings in his division series start against the Red Sox. He lasted at least seven innings in eight of his 11 postseason starts before that, for the Tigers from 2011 through 2014.

“This is what you work so hard in the off-season for, and throughout the season,” Verlander said, “so you’re strong mentally and physically at this time.”

The Astros were running away with the American League West when they acquired Verlander from the Tigers for three prospects on Aug. 31. It culminated a careful quest for another ace to join the left-hander Dallas Keuchel, who won the 2015 American League Cy Young Award. The Astros had resisted deals for other top starters last winter and before the nonwaiver deadline in July.

Even in August, they did not make a waiver claim on Verlander; every other American League team had passed before the Astros’ turn, and General Manager Jeff Luhnow guessed that all the National League teams would, too. When Verlander got through, the sides struck a deal with just minutes to spare for postseason eligibility.

“There were really a lot of calculated gambles along the way that worked out, and any one of them could have gone a different direction,” Luhnow said. “We could be here with no Justin Verlander. I don’t know if we would be in this same spot, though.”

For the Astros players, who were disappointed by the absence of a major move in July, the deal had overwhelming significance — symbolically for a city that had just been devastated by Hurricane Harvey, and on the field. Jose Altuve, the star second baseman, said it gave the Astros everything they needed.

“I was at home that day and my brother told me, ‘Hey, we got him!’ and I was like, ‘No, we didn’t,’ ” Altuve said. “I remember I saw my phone and MLB At Bat said, ‘Astros acquire Justin Verlander,’ and I couldn’t believe it. We had a day off the next day, and I was like: ‘I don’t want to have a day off. I want to go play. I want to see Justin with the Astros uniform.’ ”

For all of his riches (a $28 million annual salary) and celebrity (he is engaged to the supermodel Kate Upton), Verlander simply wants to fit in with his teammates, said Manager A. J. Hinch. He is a “continuous learner,” Hinch said, always seeking information to make himself better.

“We might have polar-opposite pitching tendencies, but the way our minds work are very similar,” said Keuchel, a soft-throwing left-hander. “So I’ve bounced hundreds of questions off him already, and he would probably say the same thing. It’s just been a joy to talk pitching in the dugout.”

Verlander said the contrast in styles helps both pitchers. If he is being too aggressive, Verlander said, that is something Keuchel might notice. Likewise, if Keuchel is not being aggressive enough, Verlander can remind him to adjust.

By evolving, Verlander hopes to keep pitching well into his 40s. He said this spring that his goals were to win the World Series and make the Hall of Fame. His favorite pitcher ever, Nolan Ryan, did all of those things, pitching through age 46, winning a championship and sailing into Cooperstown.

Ryan, now an executive adviser with the Astros, watched Verlander from a seat behind home plate last week.

“To see him back there and for me to be on a big-league mound in the playoffs in a Houston Astros uniform, man, it was pretty humbling and kind of a full-circle moment for me,” Verlander said.

Ryan won his title with the Mets in 1969, but could not quite lift the Astros to the World Series over nine seasons in Houston. Verlander has a chance to help do it now — and if he has his way, he would get every out on Saturday.

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

It is a dribbly, joyful mess.

In the Indian-American community in Cincinnati, where I grew up, we would frequently gather and eat pani puri until we were so full our stomachs seemed about to burst. (This is known within the community as consuming one serving size.) We didn’t need an occasion like the fall festival of Diwali, coming up next week, to gather, but the excuse of a holiday didn’t hurt.

The children would eat first and make a gigantic mess, laughing with our mouths wide open, our table manners sloppy enough to make any person with an average sense of etiquette clutch her pearls. Then we’d clean the mess, leave the table and let our parents recreate the chaos. I remember so vividly hearing, from the basement, the bellowing laughter of our moms and dads, uncles and aunties. Pani puri is not a dish for tense conversations. It is loud, funny and rich in flavor, and so are the conversations it inspires.

Moving from East to West often means conforming to Western standards and formalities. For my parents, that meant keeping up the appearance of adhering to American etiquette. Dinnertime could be a private affair: My parents didn’t want to be seen eating with their hands. They thought it would make them seem uncivilized, even though eating with one’s hands is considered perfectly civil — even the norm — where they come from.

Yet, with pani puri, it was different. They showed unquestionable pride in teaching my American friends how to eat it, and it would be wildly uncivil to eat pani puri with a fork and knife.

My Mother’s Pani Puri

Serves: 7-10

Time: About 35 minutes

Ingredients:

8 medium red potatoes

5 tablespoons chunky chat masala

5 tablespoons pani puri masala

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

1 tablespoon tamarind paste

Green chili peppers or serrano peppers, chopped, to taste

Cilantro, to taste

Salt, to taste

1 tablespoon ground roasted cumin seeds

1 29-ounce can of chickpeas, drained

About 60 pani puri shells

Step 1: Cook potatoes in a microwave, whole, skins on and pricked in several places with a fork, or peeled, quartered and boiled in salted water on a stove. (I like using the microwave because some have a “potato” button and I can absolve myself from responsibility.)

Step 2: While the potatoes cook until fork-tender, make the tamarind water: In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon of chunky chat masala, 1 tablespoon of pani puri masala, the tamarind paste and 2 cups of water. It should be the color of cough syrup (but smell confusingly appetizing). Add the green chili pepper, cilantro and salt to taste. It’s best to go for a little spicier than you can handle, and just keep some Pepto-Bismol on hand.

Step 3: Place the cumin seeds in a small pan over low heat and toast until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes, occasionally shaking the pan and being careful not to burn them. Remove from heat and grind in a spice grinder or using a mortar and pestle. Set aside.

Step 4: If you used a microwave, when the potatoes are cooked, peel the skins off before placing them in a large bowl. If your fingertips burn, give the potatoes to your mom or an auntie who may have a higher heat tolerance. If you boiled the potatoes on the stove, drain them before placing them in the bowl.

Step 5: Pour chickpeas into a medium bowl and heat in the microwave for 1 minute. Add them to the potatoes and mash together. Add the remaining chunky chat masala, the remaining pani puri masala, cumin, chili peppers and cilantro to taste. Mix well. Make your mom or auntie taste it. They can fix it behind your back so that you can still take all of the credit. Pour enough tamarind water, up to ½ cup, into the potato mix to make it a soft consistency that holds together.

Step 6: To eat, take a puri shell and crack open a hole in the middle with your fingernail. Stuff it with as much potato mix as you can, then dunk it into the tamarind water to fill any remaining space.

Step 7: Shove it in your mouth. Spoil your appetite.","Pani Puri: A Dribbly, Joyful Mess",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/sunday/diwali-pani-puri-indian-american.html

HEALY Watching the new “Dynasty,” I missed the old “Dynasty.” The new versions of both “Dynasty” and “Dallas” go young with their actors.
But the “Dallas” reboot still had J. R., Sue Ellen and Bobby, and they were up to their old tricks and in fine form.
If only Joan Collins wasreprising her role as Alexis in the “Dynasty” reboot, as a cougar to middle-aged Blake!","JACOBS A fig stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in prosciutto! As played by Pamela Sue Martin (familiar to me from a terrifying afternoon watching “The Poseidon Adventure”), Fallon was my favorite character on the show: intelligent, free-spirited and sexually liberated.

Yes, she was a spoiled brat with an Elektra complex, but also a feminist who wasn’t about to let any man tell her how to live her life, a working mother who single-handedly turns around Blake’s hotel, La Mirage. The chemistry between her and the staid, dependable Jeff Colby (John James) was intoxicating to my preadolescent self.

HEALY Fallon the working mother … hmmm … there are working mothers and then there are Carrington working mothers. And I’m not sure “feminist” is the first word I’d use for someone who was so demeaning and spiteful (at least at first) to other women.

For me, Fallon represented a central flaw of “Dynasty.” The show was a portrait of wealth, glamour, conspicuous consumption and narcissism — nothing more, really. Everyone wanted Blake’s love and money, and to a lesser extent Cecil Colby’s. The sexual politics became increasingly problematic, too: While the men schemed and sabotaged, the women fought over men in lily ponds and apartments.

“Dallas” felt richer for its focus on family and betrayal. (It was not above a pool fight, but those usually involved men.)

Both shows did have great villains. How would you rate J. R. and Joan Collins’s Alexis?

JACOBS No contest. J. R. felt irritatingly underplayed, with a rushed mumbling delivery. His predilection for the insults “slut,” “loser,” “drunk” and “saddle tramp” got old fast.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

HEALY Alexis called Krystle “you bitch!” a fair amount too. Those lines were juvenile, but I was juvenile, and they made me laugh.

JACOBS And she managed to make “whore” a two-syllable word! Alexis was over the top but she was both always herself and constantly changing — and not just outfits. She rolled with whatever crazy story line the writers came up with (quite literally, in the case of the infamous mud-wrestling scene). And she always committed 100 percent, whether it was to singing a rendition of Frank Loesser’s “The Boys in the Back Room” à la Marlene Dietrich or falling off a balcony with Dex in the last season’s final episode.

Which brings us to cliffhangers. Sashaying down memory lane with you made me realize how much the experience of watching television has changed, from once-a-week treat to isolated bingeing-and-tweeting. Who the heck shot J. R., anyway?

HEALY J. R. took it in the chest from his mistress Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby), Sue Ellen’s scheming sister. That guy was such a dirty dog, but he was also one of the first prime-time villains that viewers loved to hate. He was a forerunner to antiheroes like Tony Soprano, Walter White and Cersei Lannister.

The “Who Shot J. R.?” season finale of “Dallas” was, for me, the greatest TV cliffhanger of all time. It came in March 1980; it wasn’t until November that Kristin was unmasked as the shooter. During the intervening months, everyone from President Carter to Vegas oddsmakers weighed in on J. R. The watercooler energy was enormous. While other television shows had fan followings, “Dallas” demonstrated that you could keep viewers in thrall for much of a year without any new episodes.

“Dynasty” had its own cliffhangers. I’ll bet you a Dean & DeLuca coffee that we agree on the most memorable one.

JACOBS Well, it has deeply uncomfortable resonance right now, but the Moldavian Massacre was the most memorable to me. That was truly scary: terrorists, shattering glass, bloodied bodies. Better make it a martini.

HEALY Gruesome images — and then, cue the credits.

JACOBS It took place during a royal wedding, with the bride, Amanda Carrington, played by real-life royalty, Catherine Oxenberg. Somehow the “Dy” in “Dynasty” was all bound up in my head with Princess Diana, and her own royal wedding to Prince Charles (never mind that the English pronounced it “Din-asty”). Obviously this was a time of conservatism and convention and backlash to the progressivism of the ’60s and ’70s.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

HEALY The depiction of so many women on “Dallas” as sexual objects and playthings definitely ran counter to progressivism. But “Dynasty” and “Dallas” could be topical, too.

JACOBS “Dynasty” moved the national conversation forward on homosexuality. Steven Carrington is immediately introduced as being attracted to men, and despite tentativeness in how the show presented his orientation, one felt the creators were basically on his side — don’t you think? He was a likable and complex character, not a caricature.

Then, of course, Rock Hudson’s death shortly after appearing on the show provoked national hysteria that he might have infected Linda Evans with H.I.V. by kissing her, which led to important education about how the disease is actually transmitted.

It was dismissed for being superficial but was actually right on top of the issues! And it had a few African-American cast members, notably the great Diahann Carroll as the mega-glam Dominique Deveraux. Did “Dallas” have a single minority?

HEALY “Dallas” was an extraordinarily white show. For a state as racially and ethnically diverse as Texas, the series really failed by reducing people of color to servants and waitresses.

It did strive for some social relevancy, though, with its portrait of alcoholism. Sue Ellen struggled for years to get sober and stay sober: J. R. made serenity impossible, but it was really Sue Ellen’s battle with low self-esteem, betrayal, envy and self-loathing that proved painful to watch through her relapses — but ultimately pretty inspiring as she achieved stretches of sobriety.

With the stabs at realism came the fantastical. I speak, of course, about the Mortal Sin of “Dallas” — the entire season of episodes that was retroactively labeled a “dream” of Pam’s to explain Bobby’s death and subsequent reappearance in her shower. What was the best twist of “Dynasty”?

JACOBS I don’t recall anything as shocking as the gasp-inducing “scar” reveal by Marcia Cross on “Melrose Place,” but the return of regular-guy Matthew Blaisdel at the end of Season 7 was certainly unexpected. It was no surprise whatsoever to me, though, at that point, that he had elected to hold the Carrington family hostage.

And speaking of “Melrose,” that brings us to the current reboot, which stars Grant Show as Blake. How do you think it will stack up against the “Dallas” one a few years ago?

HEALY Watching the new “Dynasty,” I missed the old “Dynasty.” The new versions of both “Dynasty” and “Dallas” go young with their actors. But the “Dallas” reboot still had J. R., Sue Ellen and Bobby, and they were up to their old tricks and in fine form. If only Joan Collins wasreprising her role as Alexis in the “Dynasty” reboot, as a cougar to middle-aged Blake!

But in recent days, after saying he will not seek re-election next year, Mr. Corker has likened the White House to an “adult day care center” whose twittering inhabitant should “concern anyone who cares about our nation.” Mr. Trump has responded by mocking the 5-foot-7 Mr. Corker as “liddle,” misrepresenting his Senate record and inventing a story line that Mr. Corker had been duped into a tape-recorded interview with The New York Times.

Mr. Trump also said that Mr. Corker had “begged” for his endorsement (“I said ‘NO’ and he dropped out,” the president reported via Twitter). Mr. Corker has flatly denied this account, saying Mr. Trump had encouraged him to run and pledged his full support.

Those who know Mr. Corker best have viewed his unburdening as largely inevitable, the breaking point after a year of often pointed Trump critiques. Mr. Corker spoke out despite being one of the few establishment-aligned Republicans to develop a relationship with the president, who once weighed choosing him as secretary of state.

For Mr. Corker, whose surest path to re-election would most likely have involved hugging the president tight, the decision not to run has removed any electoral constraint against full candor. The choice also spares him the potential threat of a difficult primary challenge from his right.

All year, Mr. Corker has strained to maintain a careful balance. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he has forged close relationships with administration officials like Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state. And since last year, he and Mr. Trump had appeared to achieve something of a mutual respect themselves — the president finding in Mr. Corker another fortune-making builder and self-styled dealmaker in construction and real estate, who thrilled as much at the chase as at the profit.

“Do you think if we gave it back to them,” Mr. Corker once asked an associate, Michael Compton, moments after buying two of the largest real estate companies in town, “they’d let us try to buy it again?”

Before their latest flare-up, Mr. Corker and Mr. Trump were on semiregular speaking terms, golfing together this year with the retired N.F.L. quarterback Peyton Manning. “He is not like people think that he is,” Mr. Corker said of Mr. Trump at one point during the campaign, praising him as “courteous, kind, respectful.”

Yet after wrestling with how thoroughly to lash a president whose temperament he had come to doubt (he did, during the spring, suggest that the White House was in a “downward spiral”), Mr. Corker has turned to total bluntness, the logical extension of a professional life spent in near-permanent states of restlessness and cost-benefit analysis.

The evening before he said he would not seek re-election, Mr. Corker held a fund-raiser near the Capitol. One by one, guests raised questions about the Republican agenda, and what could reasonably be accomplished in Congress. Repeal-and-replace? Entitlement reform?

Not happening, Mr. Corker said on a loop.

He did not linger at the event. The next morning, he stepped into his Senate office with news.

The announcement went out that afternoon.

Days later, Mr. Corker’s other dilemma — how aggressively to lace into Mr. Trump — came into clearer view. He had set off on a risky investment, like the rest of the Republican Party, in standing with the president. He had labored furiously to make it work. And it was time, Mr. Corker concluded, to be honest about the dim returns.

“I thought he was extremely patient with President Trump,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and Mr. Corker’s friend and counterpart on the Foreign Relations Committee, “knowing how quickly he can respond to absurdities.”

Even in the short term, the conflict between Mr. Trump and Mr. Corker carries considerable policy ramifications. Mr. Trump’s decision to disavow the Iran nuclear deal, while declining to unravel it entirely, effectively kicks the issue to Congress, where Mr. Corker’s committee will be central to its fate.

This past week, Mr. Corker released a blueprint aimed at imposing an automatic return of sanctions if Iran was believed to be capable of producing a nuclear weapon within a year, or if it violated other restrictions. He worked with Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas and a close administration ally, suggesting that his feud with the president will not undercut cooperation on this score.

And if many Republicans — from fellow senators in his conference to zealous Trump supporters in his own state, which the president carried by more than 25 points last year — have questioned the wisdom of Mr. Corker’s searing public remarks, his hometown has generally greeted the moment with a collective shrug.

They know Bob Corker.

“Same person he’s always been,” said Brent Leatherwood, a former executive director of the Tennessee Republican Party.

“Corker’s right,” said Luke Morin, 76, a Trump voter and lifelong Chattanoogan who said he had socialized occasionally with Mr. Corker in the 1970s. “I’ve kind of turned against Trump now.”

Aides to Mr. Corker, who was vacationing with his family in Florida, did not make him available for an interview.

Getting His Hands Dirty

The son of a DuPont engineer, born in South Carolina and delivered to Chattanooga before seventh grade, Mr. Corker often seemed to prefer outdoor labor to classroom fare. He got a job collecting trash and lining off baseball fields, blossoming into a star (if undersize) player himself at his public high school.

He also worked construction, taking quickly to the rhythms and tangibility of a job site and opting for a degree in industrial management at the University of Tennessee. After a stint as a construction superintendent, Mr. Corker put aside $8,000 to start his own company, settling into a career spent amassing a small fortune building shopping centers and later investing in higher-end real estate.

His self-assurance translated to personal affairs. Before their first date, his future wife, Elizabeth, an interior designer, had resisted his calls, insisting she had no time. “Well, look,” he told her, “we know if I have time, you have time.” They were married in 1987.

Seven years later, the political itch first struck, when Mr. Corker unsuccessfully challenged Senator Bill Frist in a Republican primary. After his defeat, the governor at the time, Don Sundquist, another Republican, recruited Mr. Corker to Nashville as the state’s commissioner of finance and administration, a job in which he helped bring the N.F.L.’s Houston Oilers to Tennessee’s capital.

By 2001, after a brief return to business life, Mr. Corker hungered for a more public-facing role: mayor of his hometown, a long-fading manufacturing nexus where dismal air quality once compelled white-collar workers to pack a second shirt for the office to account for airborne soot stains.

Though the opening of an aquarium in 1992 helped jump-start the city’s revitalization, Mr. Corker is credited with seeing the task through, leading a push to overhaul the waterfront, develop a 1,200-acre industrial park that is now home to a Volkswagen assembly plant and helping to fashion Chattanooga — now nicknamed “Gig City” — into a technology hub of the South.

“He can’t stand people operating at non-Corker speed,” said Mr. Compton, who became his chief of staff in the mayor’s office. An editorial cartoonist captured Mr. Corker’s sartorial signature — a tie thrown over his shoulder — with a depiction of a Tasmanian devil-like governing blur with a tie tossed askew.

After four years in the job, a bigger stage beckoned. With Mr. Frist, then the Senate majority leader, retiring, Mr. Corker sought the seat in one of the most-watched races of 2006, facing down Harold E. Ford Jr., a Democratic congressman from Memphis.

The campaign’s most memorable flourish was a commercial, financed by the Republican National Committee, aimed at Mr. Ford, who is black. The ad included a white woman, bare-shouldered, declaring that she had met Mr. Ford at a “Playboy party” and looking into the camera to say, with a wink, “Harold, call me.”

Mr. Corker strained to distance himself from the spot, which was seen as an unsubtle bid to stir racial stereotypes about black men and white women as Mr. Ford tried to become the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction.

In the race’s final weeks, as Mr. Corker struggled to fight off his opponent, he phoned a top adviser, Tom Ingram.

“He called me, just almost on a tirade,” Mr. Ingram recalled. “He said: ‘Man, I’m tired of this. I may not be as good-looking, I may not be as smooth-talking, but I know the issues.’”

When Mr. Corker was through, Mr. Ingram, who had been scribbling notes on the call, dialed another campaign hand with an update: Mr. Corker had, inadvertently, just written their closing ad for them.

A Reliable Conservative

Since arriving in Washington, Mr. Corker has established himself as a dependably conservative but not overly partisan committee leader, eager to hold forth with reporters in the Senate bowels and occasionally grating on colleagues with his windiness and healthy self-regard in a chamber overstuffed with both. (Mr. Corker, a yoga enthusiast, is among the nimbler senators wending through the halls, though.)

His tenure has not been frictionless. Efforts to tackle entitlement spending and government-secured housing, among other causes, have often produced few immediate gains. While Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Corker of helping to enact President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, Mr. Corker opposed the agreement repeatedly. (He did not prevent it from proceeding to a vote on the Senate floor, exposing him to ferocious criticism from some conservatives.)

In recent years, Mr. Corker has also attracted the attention of the F.B.I. and the Securities and Exchange Commission over stock transactions involving a top developer of shopping centers and malls. He has denied any wrongdoing; his team noted that a leader of Mr. Trump’s vice-presidential vetting operation had called the concerns “baseless.”

If his next move remains unclear, once his term expires, friends say he is likely to anchor himself back home — in a mansion guarded on a recent weekday by two non-fearsome dogs on the lawn; at a favorite Italian restaurant, Il Primo, where the hostess has promised “Uncle Bob” a free limoncello pie on his next visit for confronting Mr. Trump; across a downtown that can skew almost bohemian in some patches, with a growing lot of Republicans joining the younger liberal demographic in questioning the president’s abilities.

“There’s nothing here that is accurate,” his Senate chief of staff, Todd Womack, marveled over hamburgers at Main Street Meats, scrolling through @realDonaldTrump’s handiwork on Mr. Corker.

But enough of that, he said, putting the phone away. The waterfront was just down the road.

Mr. Womack returned to his car — with its backside sticker, “Bob Corker for U.S. Senate,” nearly worn away for good — and invited his lunchmate to join him for a Chattanooga drive, to talk a little Bob Corker.","Back Home, a Unanimous Verdict on Corker vs. Trump: That’s Just Bob",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/us/politics/back-home-a-unanimous-verdict-on-corker-vs-trump-thats-just-bob.html

Standard condom circumferences were “just basically too big,” he said.","“The idea was it had to be long enough to fit most men, and excess length could just be rolled,” said Debby Herbenick, a sexual health expert at Indiana University. She and her colleagues published a study of 1,661 men living throughout the United States that found that 83 percent had penile lengths shorter than standard condoms. The average length was 5.57 inches.

In studies, some men have complained that “condoms tend to slip off,” said Ron Frezieres, a vice president for research and evaluation at Essential Access Health, a nonprofit. And sometimes larger condoms actually felt tight because ”shorter men had a big roll of latex at the base of the penis.”

The custom condoms, marketed under the brand name myONE Perfect Fit, come in lengths of 4.9 to 9.4 inches and circumferences of 3.5 to 5 inches. (Standard condoms are typically 6.7 to 8.3 inches long and 3.9 to 4.5 inches in circumference.) The template that men are given to measure themselves does not include inches or centimeters, instead using randomly ordered letters and numbers. One man might be E99, another Z22.

“If they bought a small condom before and it was still too big, it’s horrible for men to have that experience,” said Mr. Wedel, whose company owns myONE condoms. Within hours of going on sale, he said, customers had ordered condoms in all 60 sizes.

One customer, Shawn Reimund, 34, of Austin, Tex., ordered B17. With standard condoms, “the length was frustrating because you would get a lot of sliding,” he said, and excess latex would be “cutting off your circulation. I compare it to an anaconda wrapping around you.” Also, “sometimes the girth just wasn’t enough.”

Some other condom improvement ideas have been downright perplexing. The Galactic Cap, a polyurethane number that covers only the tip and attaches with medical adhesive, hasn’t been tested nearly enough to try for F.D.A. approval. But Charles Powell, its California inventor, nonetheless sells it for $20, “flying under the F.D.A. radar,” he said.

“If they do come after me, I’m going to move my operation across the border into Mexico,” he said. He contends the Galactic Cap allows more sensation because more skin is uncovered, but admits it won’t necessarily protect against sexually transmitted diseases and has prompted complaints that its Band-Aid-like adhesive makes it “painful coming off.”

Other ideas seemed feasible but stalled for financial reasons. Mark McGlothlin, awarded $100,000 by the Gates Foundation to develop natural-feeling collagen condoms from cow tendon or fish skin, said he lacks $2 million for the necessary clinical trials.

Origami condoms, pleated to allow movement inside, received fanfare and a Gates grant. But efforts to check its status with the inventor were unsuccessful, and its website appears defunct.

One Gates winner, Mahua Choudhury, a medical pharmacologist at Texas A&M Health Science Center, said condom companies were considering investing in her stretchy hydrogel condom. Her proposal also claims that embedding an antioxidant in the condom can promote blood flow and muscle relaxation to “stimulate and maintain erection.”

Mr. Frezieres’s organization, which won two Gates grants totaling $1.2 million for a clingy, polyethylene “ultra sheer wrapping condom,” has corporate partners and clinical trial results. Now it is “tweaking the material,” hoping to conduct final testing soon, he said.

The custom-fit company president, Mr. Wedel, 50, got into the condom game as a Tufts University undergraduate, when he and a classmate sold condoms in packages festooned with the university’s mascot, Jumbo the elephant.

AIDS was raging, he said, and “we put a fun slogan and a picture on a condom, and presto, we were changing condoms from something taboo.”

Soon, Mr. Wedel, who considered becoming a professional violinist, informed his mother, a church choir director in Crystal Lake, Ill., that he was going “all in on the condom career.” He co-created a glow-in-the-dark condom, helped open Manhattan’s Condomania store, and won a court battle to sell Pleasure Plus, a condom that balloons near the tip.

Still, “condoms have an enormous image problem,” acknowledged Mr. Wedel, whose company works closely with public health organizations. The new federal study found “condom non-use remained common,” and that nearly 7 percent of women using them said condoms “broke or completely fell off.”

Although custom condoms became available in Europe in 2011, sold by TheyFit, which Global Protection purchased, it took years of pressing the F.D.A. and two standards organizations, ASTM International and ISO, for the devices to reach the United States, Mr. Wedel said.

One hurdle: tests like the “hang-and-squeeze,” during which condoms are filled with water and squeezed to see if they leak, and the “airburst” exam, which checks whether condoms break when inflated. Both evaluations were designed for larger condoms.

“If you make a condom that’s less than half the volume of a standard condom, you’re not going to fill it with as much water, or it’s not long enough to stretch on the mandrel for airburst testing,” he said.

Eventually, the F.D.A. granted clearance for expanded sizes, and last year ASTM International devised new testing methods for a wider range of condoms.

On a Reddit page for men who consider their penises small, reaction to custom condoms was mixed.

One member, RatsSewer — who like other users declined to provide his real name — said non-latex materials “would be way more helpful than custom condoms,” adding, “If I want good sex, I don’t use a condom.”

Another, Thrown_away011235, seemed interested, citing “condoms rolling up and slipping off in the past.”

Monkeyfun14 said he had ordered custom condoms, and “while they fit well,” he considered standard cheaper ones sufficient. “It’s not like a pair of shoes or a brassiere that you have to wear all day.”

Yaforgot-my-password ordered them, too, saying regular condoms were too small. (“I know it doesn’t fit this subreddit,” he said pointedly, “but I browse here sometimes.”) The custom ones are “pretty good so far.”

Custom condoms cost 66 cents apiece in regular 24-pack shipments ($1.66 apiece in a single six-pack). Early purchasers were also sent the next larger and smaller sizes for free.

Michael Davis, 21, a college student in Waverly, Fla., said he preferred the M77, the size above the one he first ordered. Standard condom circumferences were “just basically too big,” he said. With custom-fit condoms, he has found “no slippage whatsoever.”

Dr. Herbenick said condom education, along with tips like adding lubricant, are more important than access to 60 sizes. She and colleagues published a study that found custom-fit condoms less likely to break but, for some men, more likely to slip.

Some men might “prefer a condom that they think fits their penis,” she said. “But for the most part, men and their partners are fine with existing condoms.”

Still, Mr. Frezieres said, even without “true benefit,” custom condoms might increase usage, simply by being “confidence boosters.”",A Condom-Maker’s Discovery: Size Matters,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/health/condoms-penis-size.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The loss to such a small, underdeveloped and outgunned nation was a tough pill for Americans to swallow, many still basking in post-World War II triumphalism.

The “war at home” phrase captured the idea that the war had been lost on the home front. It was a story line promulgated by Hollywood within which veteran disparagement became a kind of “war story,” a way of credentialing the warrior bona fides of veterans who may have felt insecure about their service in Vietnam. In “First Blood,” the inaugural Rambo film, the protagonist, John Rambo, flashes back to “those maggots at the airport, spittin’, callin’ us baby killers and all kinds of vile crap.” The series supported the idea that decisions in Washington had hamstrung military operations. “Apocalypse Now” fed outright conspiracy theories that the C.I.A.’s secret war run from Washington had undercut the military mission. “Coming Home” and “Hamburger Hill” played on male fears of unfaithful wives and girlfriends, a story line hinting that female perfidy and the feminist subversion of warrior morale had cost us victory.

Women had been prominent in the opposition to the war. Two organizations, Women Strike for Peace and the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, led early protests; Cora Weiss, Jane Fonda and Joan Baez lent their social and celebrity standing to the efforts to end the fighting. New Left organizations such as the campus-based Students for a Democratic Society intersected with the burgeoning women’s movement to boost young women into leadership roles in the antiwar movement. Placards reading “Girls Say Yes to Boys Who Say No” — no to the draft, that is — lent credence to the fears of conservatives who were pro-war and distraught over loosening strictures on premarital sex and believed that the rising of the women meant societal collapse.

The adoption of long hair, embroidered shirts and bell-bottom pants, and general rejection of military bearing by men in the movement evinced a softening of conventional sex-gender boundaries. By the late 1960s, troops in Vietnam were battling authorities over hair length, and the right to wear love-bead necklaces and draw peace symbols on their helmets.

Finger pointing for the loss of the war began even before it was over. The pacifists and radicals who stoked the antiwar movement were easy targets for the patriotic right wing looking for scapegoats, but the visibility of women in the resistance to the war made them suspects as well. After Ms. Fonda went to North Vietnam on a peace mission in 1972, she was denounced as a traitor in profanely sexist language and tarred as “Hanoi Jane.” Years later, the feminist author Susan Faludi wrote that fears of emasculation having cost America its victory in Vietnam were the basis of a backlash against women in the 1980s.

But, the reporter pressed, why spitting? Resisting the urge to plunge into the Freudian exegesis I wanted to take, I pointed to the long history of spitting imagery in legends of betrayal. In the New Testament, Christ’s followers spit on him in renunciation of their loyalty. Following Germany’s defeat in World War I, soldiers returning from the front claimed to have been spat on by women and girls. The German stories were studied by historians and found to be part of the “Dolchstosslegende,” or stab-in-the-back legend, that the military had been betrayed behind the lines, sold out at home.

Anticipating the question, I agreed that the presence of such stories in religious teachings and myths only pressed more questions to the fore about where the biblical Apostles and German folklorists got them, questions that will keep professors and students of cultural studies occupied for years.

But, I ventured, where the stories go — how they play out in the political culture — is more important than where they come from. The reporter seemed interested. In Germany, I recalled, the imagery of shellshocked World War I veterans became a stand-in for the nation’s lost pride and damaged sense of racial superiority. The riffs of betrayal in the photographs, films and news reports of veterans made victims by war kept alive the certainty that enemies outside the gates could never defeat a rearmed and unified Germany; the stories incited a dangerous witch hunt that led to the Holocaust.

Is the abiding American discomfort with the war it lost in Vietnam and the enduring allure of the spat-upon veteran stories indicative of betrayal preoccupations at work in our own culture? Is it the post-Vietnam lost-war narrative that feeds the back-to-the-future sentiments in campaign promises to restore and rebuild America? And are the recent public and political spectacles of nativism and gun-toting masculinity symptoms of a wounded people more than deviant personalities?

The deposits are near or under lakes and rivers that stream directly into the Boundary Waters.
The jobs may be seasonal or not pay as well as mining jobs; on the other hand, they are not as backbreaking and they foster a local creative class.","Now, mining supporters, among them Representative Rick Nolan, a Democrat who represents Ely’s district in Congress, are trying to undo the moratorium. The battle is being fought on both moral and economic grounds. Mining advocates stress the hundreds of tangible construction and mining jobs this copper-nickel operation could create in the coming decades. Boundary Waters activists argue that the very presence of mining — its disruption of this area’s natural character, not to mention the specter of pollution — could hamper the region’s “amenity-based” development in a multitude of tangible and intangible ways, from destroying property values to stripping away jobs that feed off this area’s natural beauty.

In the land of iron and water, opposition to copper-nickel mining is more than just a protect-the-wilderness stance; it also reflects a deeper desire to change the area’s character, from hardscrabble mining region to tourist destination that prioritizes protecting the wilderness over creating more mining jobs. Central to the debate between the two camps is a philosophical question: What is the right kind of economy for a place like the Boundary Waters?

For as far back as he can trace it, Dan Forsman’s family has lived here, where iron meets water. His great-great-grandfather migrated from Finland in the 1890s and homesteaded on a 474-acre lake. His great-grandfather, Emil Forsman, worked in the mines before opening a longtime Ely watering hole, Forsman’s Tavern. Emil’s son worked as a maintenance foreman in the crusher at an Ely mine. In 1947, Emil’s eldest grandchild was born above Forsman’s Tavern. That boy, Mike, grew up in Ely, worked for a canoe outfitter for $1.25 an hour, volunteered to join the Marines in the 1960s and worked in the mines for 34 years. His youngest son was Dan. Dan grew up in awe of the giant machines that his mechanic father worked to fix. When he turned 20, after training at a two-year community college to become a heavy-equipment mechanic, he got a job at the same mine as his father.

At 4:40 a.m. on a chilly late-spring morning, I pulled up to Dan Forsman’s house to drive with him to work. The diesel engine of his 2002 Chevy Silverado pickup was already growling. He had gotten up 12 minutes earlier, thrown on torn jeans, a T-shirt and a camouflage hunting jacket and packed a lunch: turkey and American cheese on white bread, a banana and a Little Debbie Cosmic Brownie. The 29-year-old tugged down on a cap that advertised the brand of nitrous oxide he uses to soup up car engines. A block away, he steered past his father’s house and the garage where he learned to tinker. His prized car is a 1979 Chevy Camaro; he can get it up to nearly 150 miles per hour on a nearby drag strip.

Forsman drove up the hill of Ely’s business district. Some people call this a mining town, others a tourist town, but East Sheridan Street shows it to be both. There’s the grilled-cheese shop frequented by tourists and the grocery store that stocks the hot smoked bologna local residents swear by. There are liquor stores that boycotted a local brewery after the brewery publicly sided with clean-water advocates, but down the street is a stylish new wine bar serving that same beer. More than a dozen local canoe outfitters that organize trips into the Boundary Waters are based here. Neighboring storefronts display yard signs: “We support mining. Mining supports us.”

“There are two Elys, two different realities, different visions,” Tom Coombe, the editor of The Ely Echo and a fourth-generation Elyite, told me.

As Forsman’s truck rumbled to the top of the hill, we passed a two-story building that used to be Forsman’s Tavern. Now it’s occupied by Piragis Northwoods Company, a successful canoe outfitter and outdoor store. Steve Piragis has run this shop a decade longer than Dan Forsman has been alive, but Forsman’s family still considers Piragis an outsider — a “packsacker,” the local term for people who moved here for wilderness instead of mining.

Past the city limits and into the heart of Minnesota’s Iron Range, fog lifted over white pine trees. A ring-necked pheasant strutted alongside Wolf Creek Pass. As Forsman parked in the same lot his father used to park in — 52 minutes door to door — steam poured from four chimneys.

Forsman is proud of his part in this 360-employee mining enterprise. He’s proud that his labor makes something tangible: Huge chunks of rock become tiny bits of rock, which are ground and baked into half-inch pellets containing 67.5 percent iron, which leave this processing plant on the rails at a rate of 8,500 tons a day. The pellets are loaded onto ships in Duluth, where they float along Lake Superior to the other Great Lakes. At the bottom tip of Lake Michigan, just east of Chicago, tons of these pellets are fed into the largest blast furnace in the Western Hemisphere and smelted into steel, eventually becoming cars or trucks or household appliances or plate steel for ships and armored vehicles.

Up a flight of metal stairs, Forsman entered the locker room, put on his blue coveralls and laced up his steel-toed boots. Everything in his workplace seems improbably enormous. The mining trucks, with their 12-foot-tall tires, can haul 240 tons of rock from the open-pit mines into the processing facility. Miles away, off a gravel road as wide as a six-lane highway, 280,000 pounds of explosives had been loaded into 132 16-inch-diameter holes in a mining pit — it was blast day. The explosions would shake the earth, breaking up rock for the processing facility. The pit looked like a gray moonscape.

“To make money, you have to make something that wasn’t there,” Forsman told me. “You dig it up or you grow it. Without those things, you’re just making nothing. Without the basic minerals to make a phone, you can’t make an app for the phone. Because there’s nothing there.”

Forsman says he loves and wants to protect the Boundary Waters. He also believes copper mining and clean water can coexist. Then again, the mine that Forsman works in is a taconite mine, not the type of copper-nickel mine that environmentalists decry as a threat to this watershed. But what matters most to Forsman is the need for jobs in this hollowed-out region. Ely’s population has shrunk 30 percent since 1980; school enrollment is a third of what it was in the late 1960s. “If they stop this new mine, what’s the draw to be up here if there’s no jobs?” Also, he notes, those who oppose new mining jobs — “elitists” and “hypocrites,” Forsman calls them — benefit from the same metals that blue-collar workers like him produce. “People don’t understand where things come from anymore,” he said.

When Forsman refers to these “people,” he’s often referring to one person in particular. Her name is Becky Rom, and she is the head of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters. What makes him most angry is Rom’s condescension, her moral certainty: “The way she comes off, her attitude and way of doing this, it’s part of the problem.”

“Danny Forsman drives to the mine in his truck, comes home and watches TV, and he doesn’t know this world exists,” says Becky Rom, a 68-year-old lawyer who returned to her childhood home after retirement and now leads the environmental campaign. One afternoon this spring, I stood on a dock with Rom and her husband, Reid Carron, as they lowered a canoe into the South Kawishiwi River. Rom dangled her feet over the water, which was a couple miles of portages, rivers and rapids from the southwestern border of the Boundary Waters. Chokecherry and juneberry trees were in bloom. Sometimes Rom sees moose, otters, timber wolves or black bears. Today a blue jay hopped along the shore near where a beaver had built a lodge of alder limbs. Rom guessed newborn beavers were inside.

Rom has an energy that can be difficult to keep up with, whether she’s channeling it into hourlong soliloquies about the history of the Boundary Waters or a breakneck march into the wilderness. Rom slid into the canoe, her husband in back and me in the middle. The water beneath us was nearly black, tannin-stained, jarringly cold. A few years ago, an environmental group cited the South Kawishiwi as one of America’s 10 most endangered rivers because of the possibility that Twin Metals would begin mining for copper-nickel nearby.

Rom has become the most prominent foe of copper-nickel mining near the Boundary Waters. She makes frequent lobbying visits to St. Paul and Washington to drum up support from administrative and elected officials. Her group commissions studies and opinion polls; she takes part in public debates. But even the miners who hate her most wouldn’t dare call her a packsacker. Rom’s family has lived in Ely as long as the Forsmans. Her grandfather, Caspar Rom, emigrated from Slovenia in the 1890s. In December 1917, three weeks after his ninth child was born, Caspar Rom was leaning over an ore car when a cave-in crushed his head. That newborn son was Bill Rom, Becky’s father. He hunted and fished with his brothers to help his mother put food on the table. In 1946, he opened Canoe Country Outfitters, soon one of the most successful outfitters around. Three years later, Becky was born.

Her father became a leader in the fight for the federal Wilderness Act, whose passage in 1964 helped create federally designated wilderness areas. During the battles over the tightening of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness regulations in the 1970s, Bill Rom became a symbol among local residents, who for generations had enjoyed this land with few restrictions, of environmentalism run amok. Under new rules, airplanes were banned, which meant no more flying seaplanes into remote lakes. Resorts were torn down. Motorboat use was limited. Resentful local residents harassed Rom. In 1975, logging trucks blockaded his business on two of the busiest weekends of the year. Snowmobiles buzzed around his house at night to keep the Roms from sleeping. Becky’s brother camped inside the family business with their dog and a gun. Eventually, Rom sold his business rather than endure protests from people he grew up with.

But his cause left a lasting imprint on his daughter. After Rom and her husband, Reid Carron, retired from the largest law firm in the Twin Cities — she was a commercial real estate lawyer, he a management labor lawyer — they moved north in 2012 to a modern log cabin they had built on land her father bought decades before on Burntside Lake. Today a copy of the 1964 Wilderness Act signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson hangs on Rom’s bedroom wall.

Rom maneuvered the canoe toward the other side of the river. Docks jutted into the water, evidence of homes hidden in the trees. She lifted her paddle and gestured toward some white pines: “This would be all mines,” she said. “The noise, the lights, the dust, it would be everywhere.” A woodpecker pounded its beak into a tree. A smallmouth bass hunting mayflies broke the river’s surface.

The edge of the Boundary Waters is several miles from three mineral deposits that Twin Metals hopes to develop and just a half-mile from a fourth one. The deposits are near or under lakes and rivers that stream directly into the Boundary Waters. Acid mine drainage could potentially flow past 30 resorts, outfitters and campgrounds, as well as hundreds of homes, before reaching the Boundary Waters at Fall Lake. From there, water enters Basswood Lake, a popular fishery that straddles the Canadian border, then Canada’s Quetico Provincial Park and then Voyageurs National Park and Rainy Lake. All told, polluted water could theoretically affect up to 2.3 million acres of American and Canadian public lands, according to a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Hydrology. Pollution could harm fish, wild rice and property values. (This sounds alarmist to those who support underground copper-nickel mining near Ely; the multiyear process of planning the mine and clearing it with regulators would, they believe, set up ample safeguards against pollution.)

Rom and her husband climbed out of the canoe. Back in town, they pointed out thriving enterprises. One family company makes outerwear, which nicely complements the family’s other business, a lodge that runs winter dogsledding trips. An outfit called Crapola makes cranberry-apple granola. An art gallery displayed prints from a nature photographer. A fancy new restaurant, a spa, a gift shop that also sells saunas, a renovated historic theater looking for a tenant — Rom regards all these small businesses as evidence that the future here will not replicate the mining past. The jobs may be seasonal or not pay as well as mining jobs; on the other hand, they are not as backbreaking and they foster a local creative class. Last year, National Geographic Adventure ranked Ely as one of the world’s nine best outdoor towns, citing its proximity to vast public lands. Only one other American community — Moab, Utah, near Arches and Canyonlands national parks — made the list.","In Northern Minnesota, Two Economies Square Off: Mining vs. Wilderness",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/magazine/in-northern-minnesota-two-economies-square-off-mining-vs-wilderness.html

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many.

In nearby Briarcliff Manor, they loved a home on Butternut Road, another cul-de-sac. A $1.2 million house, it had been fully renovated by a contractor, but it wasn’t configured to their liking.

Then they heard something intriguing from their agent, Hillary Landau of Houlihan Lawrence, whom they found through Suburban Jungle, a service that helps match home buyers with the right suburbs.

A building lot was available in Pocantico Hills, Ms. Landau told them. But unfortunately, “it was on a double-yellow-line” road, Mrs. Tortoso said, not a cul-de-sac.

Skeptical, the Tortosos drove up on a rainy weeknight and found they loved the location, next to a park. The contract came with an agreement to have the house built by ZappiCo, which they were already familiar with.

The advantages of buying a new, custom-built house included the choice of “more efficient appliances, heating and cooling,” said Jim Zappi, the owner of ZappiCo. “They are better insulated, so the cost of ownership is less.”

The Tortosos signed on for $1.12 million, for a two-story, 3,000-square-foot house with four bedrooms and four bathrooms. But the project was more complex than they had envisioned.

“You are making every decision — from knobs to hinges to countertops — and things you don’t necessarily think of when you find a house that is already built, like where do you put the windows and how many windows do you want,” Mrs. Tortoso said.

“You invariably upgrade,” she added, noting that they eventually chose nine-foot ceilings over eight-foot, and solid wood doors, with better soundproofing, over standard hollow doors.

Mrs. Tortoso’s main regret about their new home, she said, is not going with pocket doors in the bathroom that connects the children’s bedrooms. The doors swing inward, and when both are open they nearly touch.

As for Mr. Tortoso, he regrets that their new neighborhood is, in fact, “not a neighborhood — there’s not going to be a block party.”

The disembodied hand has a sinister cinematic reputation. In horror films, it can be seen scampering across the screen, enacting nefarious deeds — murder, usually. But on social media, the hand has been cast in a new role, as a symbol of artisanal craftsmanship and entrepreneurial zeal.

The online video hand is just as driven as the horror movie version — both appear to have minds of their own. But this time it’s a helping hand, channeling its energies toward cooking party foods and executing creative household hacks. And it’s extending its reach across the internet. A quarter of video views on the Facebook pages of media companies go to these sorts of instructional videos, according to the digital video analytics company Tubular Labs. No faces. No bodies. Just hands.

BuzzFeed’s food video juggernaut, Tasty, popularized a particular form of cooking video — camera pointed straight down onto the kitchen counter, point-of-view style, with cooks appearing exclusively from the wrist down — that has since taken over top Facebook and YouTube crafting and cooking channels like Blossom, 5-Minute Crafts and BuzzFeed’s own D.I.Y. channel, Nifty. (The New York Times Cooking section produces such content, too; they’re called “hands and pans” videos.) Now even the Food Network, which built its television brand by promoting fully realized human cooks, has started posting hand-focused cooking videos on its Facebook page.

The hand has also emerged as a star of a popular genre of YouTube children’s content: toy unboxing videos, where new playthings are removed from their packages and taken for a spin. One of YouTube’s most popular personalities is an anonymous unboxer known as Disney Collector, who appears exclusively as a set of playfully manicured hands. And on Instagram, the hand has come into its own as a beauty icon, thanks to Instagram-famous nail artists like Madeline Poole and Jin Soon Choi.

Second to the face, the hand is the most demonstrably human body part. Its opposable thumb allows it to wield tools, flash symbols and now, type out texts. It’s probably not a coincidence that the hand’s image has risen online just as mobile devices have taken over our social, work and creative lives. We’re living amid what the French philosopher Michel Serres has called the “Thumbelina Generation”: Instead of talking with our mouths, we’re creating vast and complicated visual and textual messages with finger taps and swipes. We shoot smartphone videos with the device in hand, thumb resting on the “record” button, then turn around and watch the video in our hands. The hand is the driver of modern communication, and now it’s the star of it, too.

“We’ve seen a re-enchantment of the hand,” James Leo Cahill, a cinema studies professor at the University of Toronto, told me. “It’s finally getting its due as an onscreen organ.”

For decades, instructional TV shows were built around celebrity chefs or crafters, filmed on sets with wide camera shots. These shows could make viewers feel as if they were hanging out with Rachael Ray or Martha Stewart, but they didn’t mimic the sensation of actually cooking or crafting themselves.

Pleasant, clean-cut and “incongruously cheerful,” he chain smoked through the interview, offering a gripping biography with a “fluent command of language.”

“He smiles frequently, sometimes winningly, shows occasionally just a touch of ruefulness,” the psychiatrist, William B. McGrath, noted. “No despair, alarm or concern about his fate is manifest.”

“I get the impression he enjoys being an interesting subject of examination,” the doctor wrote. He concluded that Mr. Paddock was bright, with no history of “mental defect,” and was able to stand trial. But, the doctor added, Mr. Paddock had a “sociopathic personality.”

The portrait of Stephen Paddock that investigators have assembled stands in stark contrast: Reserved, even boring, he was an accountant and investor who liked to gamble only after calculating all the risks. Before the shooting, the authorities say, he had never broken the law. Among the many questions that are unanswered is what influence, if any, his father’s absence and infamy had on his life.

“We are establishing the timeline of the suspect’s life, his motivation and everybody else associated with him throughout time,” Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. The F.B.I. has hundreds of agents on the case and more than 1,000 pieces of evidence, said Aaron Rouse, the special agent in charge in Las Vegas.

A statement from the Clark County coroner’s office said that an autopsy on Mr. Paddock had been completed, and that “multiple forensic analyses” would be performed, including an examination of brain tissue.

Benjamin Paddock had boasted during his psychological evaluation that his run-ins with authority started early and rarely stopped. He was an only child, pampered by his mother and not disciplined by his father. “I got away with an awful lot,” he told his evaluator. “I went where I felt like it, disrupting everybody’s schedule.” By 12 he was driving his own car.

He quit high school almost as soon as he started, then joined the Navy at age 15, but was discharged a few months later, he said, when the Navy figured out, “I wasn’t going to do what they wanted me to.”

He drove buses in Los Angeles, but got fired for a game of bus tag with other drivers.

In 1946 he was caught stealing a car in Chicago and reselling it in “a fraudulent fashion.” He spent five years in prison, 70 percent of it, he said, “in the hole,” or solitary confinement, because he was “unable or unwilling to abide by rules.”

When he got out, he made good money selling used cars in Chicago, but quit because, he explained, “the thrill had gone out of it.”

Photo

During that time he got married and fathered Stephen, who was born in 1953. He also set up a fraud ring that he said passed $90,000 in bad checks. He was caught and sent back to prison.

When he was released in 1956, he moved with his wife and son to Tucson. The couple had three more sons, and Benjamin Paddock operated a service station, a nightclub and a garbage disposal franchise. He bought a house and car, and got involved in the local hot rod and ham radio clubs.

He also walked into the sheriff’s office and offered to counsel troubled youths.

“I only took the incorrigibles,” he told his evaluator. “I have a knack for social work with kids. I told them I had a degree in social psychology and nobody bothered to check up on it. They regarded me as a leading light on juvenile delinquency.”

He boasted that none of his charges had ever ended up back in court.

While Stephen Paddock was playing at the family’s white ranch house, his father was robbing banks with a snub-nosed revolver and getting away in the family station wagon. He said the ham radio equipment he kept in the car was ideal for a robber because he could listen in on the police.

Benjamin Paddock was caught in 1960. But the bank robbery charges, he insisted to the psychiatrist, were a case of mistaken identity. A criminal syndicate was forcing him to take the rap.

For years after Mr. Paddock was arrested, his sons were told he was dead. Later they learned the truth and some visited him, his son Eric Paddock said, but none seemed to form a close relationship. Eric Paddock cursed his father in an interview and said he was angry at him for being more interested in crime than his family.

Travelers looking for a sense of where locals in Athens hang out should head to Kifissia, a leafy, upscale suburb north of the city center. While homegrown stores have long been a trademark here, eateries have been scarce. In recent years, that’s changed as it’s become easier to obtain restaurant licenses. Now, the neighborhood includes an enticing mix of stores and restaurants — both of which appeal to Athenians with good taste in fashion and food.

Amaryllis Cafe

Athenians come in the morning to get their fix of Greek coffee, which is traditionally served black and so strong that a glass of water accompanies each cup to help cleanse the palate. They’re here again midday for sandwiches, salads and desserts like the house-made chocolate cake with pieces of crushed biscuits. This local favorite also features a menu of Greek wines, and imbibing with a glass while sitting alfresco is a pleasurable way to pass an evening in the neighborhood.

This airy family-run bakery, dating to the late 19th century, is a wonderland for Greek food souvenirs. Bags of pistachios and almonds, jars of honeys and jams (the sour cherry is a best-seller) and packets of dried figs beckon, but the most tempting purchase may be an assortment of the 40 types of cookies, baked in-house daily. The butter and cinnamon varieties are house specialties.

_____

Social media plays a vital role in our journalism. On social platforms, our reporters and editors can promote their work, provide real-time updates, harvest and curate information, cultivate sources, engage with readers and experiment with new forms of storytelling and voice.

We can effectively pull back the curtain and invite readers to witness, and potentially contribute to, our reporting. We can also reach new audiences.

But social media presents potential risks for The Times. If our journalists are perceived as biased or if they engage in editorializing on social media, that can undercut the credibility of the entire newsroom.

We’ve always made clear that newsroom employees should avoid posting anything on social media that damages our reputation for neutrality and fairness. This memo offers more detailed guidelines.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Department heads will be responsible for ensuring that these guidelines are followed by all staff members in their departments. Violations will be noted on performance reviews.

How We Developed the Updated Social Media Guidelines

We sought extensive feedback across the newsroom in order to ensure that this was a collaborative process rooted in our journalists’ experiences. Several Times reporters who are prominent on social media reviewed the guidelines, offering very helpful input, and endorsed them.

Those reporters include: Yamiche Alcindor, Peter Baker, Rukmini Callimachi, Nick Confessore, Max Fisher, Maggie Haberman, Katie Rogers and Margot Sanger-Katz.

Here Are the Key Points

• In social media posts, our journalists must not express partisan opinions, promote political views, endorse candidates, make offensive comments or do anything else that undercuts The Times’s journalistic reputation.

• Our journalists should be especially mindful of appearing to take sides on issues that The Times is seeking to cover objectively.

• These guidelines apply to everyone in every department of the newsroom, including those not involved in coverage of government and politics.

Peter Baker says: “It’s important to remember that tweets about President Trump by our reporters and editors are taken as a statement from The New York Times as an institution, even if posted by those who do not cover him. The White House doesn’t make a distinction. In this charged environment, we all need to be in this together.”

• We consider all social media activity by our journalists to come under this policy. While you may think that your Facebook page, Twitter feed, Instagram, Snapchat or other social media accounts are private zones, separate from your role at The Times, in fact everything we post or “like” online is to some degree public. And everything we do in public is likely to be associated with The Times.

Nick Confessore says: “The reality is that my Twitter account is a Times account. The Times does not control it, but the Times is held accountable for what appears on my feed. Indeed, the casual reader interprets my social accounts as an extension of our digital platforms, for good and ill. I think all of us at the Times need to embrace this as the price of our employment by a major media institution. (And in fairness, to the extent my Twitter account is influential or widely read, it is largely because I am employed by The Times.)”

• On that same note, we strongly discourage our journalists from making customer service complaints on social media. While you may believe that you have a legitimate gripe, you’ll most likely be given special consideration because of your status as a Times reporter or editor.

• Avoid joining private and “secret” groups on Facebook and other platforms that may have a partisan orientation. You should also refrain from registering for partisan events on social media. If you are joining these groups for reporting purposes, please take care in what you post.

• Always treat others with respect on social media. If a reader questions or criticizes your work or social media post, and you would like to respond, be thoughtful. Do not imply that the person hasn’t carefully read your work.

• If the criticism is especially aggressive or inconsiderate, it’s probably best to refrain from responding. We also support the right of our journalists to mute or block people on social media who are threatening or abusive. (But please avoid muting or blocking people for mere criticism of you or your reporting.)

Rukmini Callimachi says: “I used to get really upset and respond to abuse — which only made it worse. What I finally discovered is that if I just aggressively block the abusive people, I can control the flow — and that’s, I think, because people who speak that way to women are generally followed by other people who think it’s O.K. to use crass words. By blocking anyone and everyone who uses abusive terms, I am able to halt the conversation. I think this is especially important as a strategy for women, at a time when people think that rape memes are a good way to respond to a story they don’t like by a female New York Times writer.”

• If you feel threatened by someone on social media, please inform your supervisors immediately. The Times has policies in place to protect the safety of our journalists.

• We believe in the value of using social media to provide live coverage and to offer live updates. But there may be times when we prefer that our journalists focus their first efforts on our own digital platforms.

• We generally want to publish exclusives on our own platforms first, not on social media, but there may be instances when it makes sense to post first on social media. Consult your supervisors for guidance.

• Be transparent. If you tweeted an error or something inappropriate and wish to delete the tweet, be sure to quickly acknowledge the deletion in a subsequent tweet. Please consult our social media corrections policy for guidance.

• If you are linking to other sources, aim to reflect a diverse collection of viewpoints. Sharing a range of news, opinions or satire from others is usually appropriate. But consistently linking to only one side of a debate can leave the impression that you, too, are taking sides.

• Exercise caution when sharing scoops or provocative stories from other organizations that The Times has not yet confirmed. In some cases, a tweet of another outlet’s story by a Times reporter has been interpreted as The Times confirming the story, when it in fact has not.

• We want our journalists to feel that they can use social media to experiment with voice, framing and reporting styles — particularly when such experiments lead to new types of storytelling on The Times’s platforms.

Margot Sanger-Katz says: “Part of what’s fun and interesting about these other platforms is that they are a little different from The Times’s article pages in tone and framing: You can ask questions about things you don’t know, make little jokes, express surprise, share others’ work, etc. Part of why I find Twitter useful, and a worthwhile use of my time, is that I find it helpful to engage in conversation with experts and readers and test out ideas in a less formal way and with less certainty than I would in an article. (That said, I am always conscious that any of my tweets can end up getting quoted elsewhere as the statements of a Times reporter.)”

• Of course, it’s worth emphasizing again that just because our journalists can try new things on social media, that does not mean they have a license to veer into editorializing or opinion.

If You’re Still Unsure About What You’re Posting

• If you don’t know whether a social media post conforms to Times standards, ask yourself these questions:

1. Would you express similar views in an article on The Times’s platforms?

2. Would someone who reads your post have grounds for believing that you are biased on a particular issue?

3. If readers see your post and notice that you’re a Times journalist, would that affect their view of The Times’s news coverage as fair and impartial?

4. Could your post hamper your colleagues’ ability to effectively do their jobs?

5. If someone were to look at your entire social media feed, including links and retweets, would they have doubts about your ability to cover news events in a fair and impartial way?

Maggie Haberman says: “Before you post, ask yourself: Is this something that needs to be said, is it something that needs to be said by you, and is it something that needs to be said by you right now? If you answer no to any of the three, it’s best not to rush ahead.”

As always, if you are unsure, please consult with your supervisor or other newsroom leaders about your social media practices.

In addition to these social media guidelines, staff members should be familiar with and follow the newsroom’s Ethical Journalism guidelines, which apply here as well.

And Finally …

As you can see, we have tried to strike a balance. We want our newsroom to embrace social media, which offers us so many opportunities to connect with readers, listeners and viewers (not to mention sources), extending the reach of The Times. But we also hope that our journalists will take to heart these social media guidelines — and especially the insights that we have collected from our colleagues about how to engage on these platforms.

On Oct. 14, Mata Hari was executed by firing squad. Newspaper reports described her as refusing to wear a blindfold and blowing kisses to the soldiers who raised their rifles against her.

Now, 100 years after the execution, the archives of her interrogation and trial have been opened to the public, and her complicated, extraordinary life is being reassessed and commemorated in the Netherlands, the country that she tried to leave behind at age 19. The Museum of Friesland in Leeuwarden is staging a biographical exhibition devoted to her life, while the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam is reprising a contemporary ballet, “Mata Hari,” which premiered in 2016 to great popular success. A theater piece focused on her mysterious life and performed by the singer and actor Tet Rozendal is also touring the country.

“Her story is still relevant in that she’s a woman who does not conform to society’s norms, and to anyone else’s ideas,” said Ted Brandsen, the managing director of the Dutch National Ballet. “She’s really about female transgression: She breaks through the limits of respectability.”

The commemorations in the Netherlands all attempt to separate the myth of Mata Hari from the truth of Margaretha Zelle’s life. But Zelle often presented herself as someone else from somewhere else — as Mata Hari, the exotic princess from the East — and her compatriots have had an uneasy relationship with her persona ever since.

“Almost everyone here knew that she got famous through exotic dancing, and people here didn’t like that,” said Klaas Zandberg, the coordinator of the Leeuwarden Historical Center, an archive in the city where Zelle was born in 1876 and lived until she was 18. He said many locals “still think that she’s some kind of whore who still gets too much attention.”

Mr. Brandsen said that she still commands fascination: “Ninety-eight to ninety-nine percent of the seats” for each performance of the ballet were sold in 2016, he said.

Although her childhood was spent in a prosperous household, her father, a hat merchant and speculator, lost all his money when she was 14. A series of tragic events followed: Her parents divorced, her mother died, her father left her with relatives and that didn’t go well. At 18, she answered a newspaper ad from a 39-year-old captain in the Dutch colonial army, met him for a date and married him five months later.

Zelle’s husband, Rudolph MacLeod, took her with him to the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), where she learned some Javanese dance and had two children. Her son died suddenly at age 3, possibly from mercury poisoning by a nanny. The couple divorced; when her husband refused to pay alimony, she left her daughter with him and found ways to support herself.

In 1903, she moved to Paris. Later, when asked why, she is reported to have said, “I thought all women who ran away from their husbands went there.” She was equally saucy and vague about her personal history once she transformed herself into Mata Hari.

Although today’s exotic dancers are associated with grimy clubs, Mata Hari’s sensational premiere took place at the Musée Guimet in Paris, an art institution where it was seen by upper-crust socialites, and her enormous and immediate success thrust her into their ranks. “She was at least a millionaire at one point,” said Hans Groeneweg, the curator of the Museum of Friesland exhibition.

Preparing for the exhibition took four years. Mr. Groeneweg and other curators researched Mata Hari’s past extensively and drew new conclusions about her history. It was not entirely clear that she ever spied for the Germans, for example, though she admitted to taking money from them, perhaps because she was broke at the time.

“When you read what information she gave to the Germans, you think it’s all very small,” Mr. Groeneweg said. “Like she’d tell that there was going to be an offensive in the spring, but everyone already knew that.”

The exhibition presents original documents from her trial — including her “confession” document — that were unsealed by the French authorities in January, along with personal letters and diary entries, on loan from Zelle’s family, that have never been shown to the public.

Artifacts of her life include a gold brooch she bought for her daughter, her prayer book and a portrait of her painted by Isaac Israels. The exhibit ends with a wall of posters from books and films that have focused on her life, including films in which she was played by Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. Femme fatale, fallen woman, brazen double agent — every generation has its own version of Mata Hari.

Today, Mr. Groeneweg said, there is a “bigger, broader picture” of the woman known as Mata Hari.

“We are trying to focus on more aspects of her life than only her dancing career or whether she was a spy,” he said. “When you focus on Margaretha as a mother or a spouse, you can relate to more aspects of her life.”

But the documents from the French archives have not filled in all of the gaps, Mr. Groeneweg said. “In some way, perhaps we have to be glad not knowing the complete story,” he added. “Something of the myth has to be preserved.”","Femme Fatale, Fallen Woman, Spy: Looking for the Real Mata Hari",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/arts/mata-hari-netherlands.html

For Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, the moment recalled the 1970s, when another government, this one in Washington, not Moscow, targeted black activists. She served as a community worker for the Black Panther Party as the F.B.I. used false information to go after its members.

“That actually got people killed and destroyed organizations,” Ms. Lee said. “Now look at Facebook allowing ads by the Russian government to create this kind of environment. That’s a problem. I don’t know if they’re even aware of the history and how dangerous allowing the promotion of division and racial animosity and racial hatred can be.”

And nearly a year after the election, black lawmakers say, little is being done to reverse the damage. Russia studied and exploited the “fault lines of racial tension,” said Representative Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York, and multiple investigations into Russia’s actions and the Trump’s campaign possible involvement have thus far offered no safeguards to stop Moscow’s efforts.

“Things are moving far too slow because we should be putting protective measures in place,” Ms. Clarke said. “We need to step up to the challenge.”

During the meeting, Ms. Sandberg frequently said she agreed as more than a dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus demanded action from the company. Several people in the meeting said Ms. Sandberg frequently said, “We will do better” and “You will get answers.”

But her answers fueled the anger of some black lawmakers who said for years that they have been pushing Facebook to add a black person to its all-white board of directors and to diversify its staff. Several members have also written letters to Facebook and other companies demanding answers related to the presidential election.

On Thursday, the company’s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, said in the meeting that Facebook had recently hired a record number of minority employees, and Ms. Sandberg promised that the company planned to add a black person to its board.

The issue of Russia exploiting already charged race relations in the United States hits especially home for many members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, Democrat of Missouri, who explained to Ms. Sandberg on Thursday that a man had attempted to bomb his office in 2014 in Kansas City based on false information and conspiracy theories. Mr. Cleaver, a cousin of Eldridge Cleaver, an early leader of the Black Panthers, said after the meeting that he was constantly on guard because many detractors falsely believe that his family member killed police officers.

“People get all worked up on the internet and do crazy things, and some of us are the recipients of their insanity,” Mr. Cleaver said. “It feels like the whole country is changing, and we’re having a national nervous breakdown.”

For others, the anger is more with Moscow than Silicon Valley. Already, they say, the United States has to deal with the remnants of slavery, institutional racism in schools and the criminal justice system, and now a foreign adversary is stirring a boiling pot.

Shortly after the meeting with Ms. Sandberg, Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he was concerned that the F.B.I. may have bought into Russia’s exploitation of African-Americans with its new class of threats called “Black Identity Extremists.” Mr. Richmond said that he feared that the F.B.I. may now go after black people who protest unfair policing practices and discriminatory policies based on false information peddled on social media.

“This is a very fragile moment in time for African-Americans across this country,” Mr. Richmond said. “What we needed Facebook to understand is that they play a role in the perception of African-Americans.”

Representative Robin Kelly, a Democrat of Illinois, said she often hears from constituents who want to know why the investigations have taken so long. Ms. Kelly is also the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on Information Technology and sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats. Neither panel has had a hearing on Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election, she said.

“I don’t know the intelligence process, and I’m sure they want to be thorough and all of that,” she said. But, she added, “people are anxious.”

At least some members of the caucus have started thinking about what ways Congress may have to step in and shield Americans from Russia’s influence.

Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, said lawmakers may need to come up with new ways to combat false information and fight back against Russia. That might mean Facebook would face new regulations.

(Ms. Chapman was not available for comment for this story.)

In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.”

For his part, Mr. Weinstein acknowledged, in a larger statement to The New York Post, that his actions could have a negative impact on Ms. Chapman’s company. Marchesa’s public profile depended largely on its connection to Hollywood — the label does not advertise — and, fair or not, Ms. Chapman and her line are now swept up in this unfolding story.

The refrain from major department stores in response to requests for comment? “We just don’t want to be part of this story.”

But that is unavoidable. Fashion is already deeply involved.

Not just because on Tuesday a petition was begun by Care2 asking Nordstrom to drop the Donna Karan and DKNY lines in response to Ms. Karan’s comments (though she herself is no longer involved with either label).

And not just because fashion has its own history with sexual harassment and the poor treatment of young women, including increasingly documented abuses of models and the many claims against the photographer Terry Richardson (who, after some time away, is still working in the industry).

Mr. Weinstein, more than perhaps any film executive of the modern era, seemed to understand the role fashion could play as he built an upmarket brand in which box office performance was important, but so were glitter and good reviews.

He introduced “Project Runway.” Along with the shoe designer Tamara Mellon he was instrumental in the revival of Halston, for which he corralled Sarah Jessica Parker, the celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe (who often dressed her clients in Marchesa) and the private equity firm Hilco as partners. He licensed the option to revive the Charles James brand the same year the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art featured a Charles James exhibition.

When actresses from his films campaigned for Oscars, there and elsewhere, guess whose dresses they often wore?

“We all knew celebrities were asked to wear Marchesa if they were in a Weinstein movie,” said the co-owner of a fashion communications company who asked not to be identified. “They were supposed to wear it at least once. We all knew that cycle.”

Going all the way back to his days at Miramax, the first of two studios Mr. Weinstein co-founded, he put out fashion-themed films.

In 1994, Mr. Weinstein released Robert Altman’s “Prêt-à-Porter.” In 2009, he acquired the North American distribution rights for “A Single Man,” the designer Tom Ford’s debut film. In 2011, he acquired Madonna’s “W.E.,” a period drama about Wallis Simpson in which the gowns were almost the only thing that got good notices.

Mr. Ford would never have held up Mr. Weinstein as the poster boy for how to treat women.

Still, Mr. Ford said Thursday, it was a far cry from what was revealed over the last week and a half, through two exposés in The New York Times outlining allegations of a pattern of sexual harassment and assault and a third from The New Yorker detailing accusations of rape.

“What Harvey has done is shocking, indefensible and disturbing on many levels,” Mr. Ford said. “I knew that Harvey certainly liked beautiful young women.” But, he added: “I had no idea of his predatory and abusive behavior or that he had paid settlements to anyone.” Mr. Ford noted that since he himself is a gay man, Mr. Weinstein’s “sex life would certainly not have been something that he would have felt the need to share with me.”

Ms. Parker collaborated with Mr. Weinstein at Halston. “Over the last two decades, through various projects, I’ve always maintained a relationship with him that I was, for the most part, comfortable with,” she said. “Now I feel he is a stranger, that I didn’t know him at all. And desperately sad to hear how so many women have suffered.”

And Ms. Mellon, referring to sexual predation, concurred: “I never saw anything like that. That behavior usually happens when no else is watching and in private. If I had seen it, I would have stopped it. I only ever witnessed raging and threats, but that was toward me and I pushed back when he did that.”

Mr. Weinstein’s increased presence on the fashion circuit seemed to coincide with his shrinking presence in the film world. Optics had always been essential to his prestige brand, so it made some sense that he leaned on an industry selling illusions to help maintain his myth. The razzle-dazzle of Harvey and his wife on red carpets all over the world was a good distraction when fewer awards were coming his way.

“Project Runway” helped, too. It made stars out of the designer Michael Kors, the model Heidi Klum and the editor Nina Garcia. Lauren Zalaznick, then the head of the Bravo network, where the show debuted, said: “On the surface, of course, it was a logical extension into TV. But what it really did was help build a firmer network within the fashion and publishing industries. It lent even more proximity to the power of relationships with designers, editors and models, and the scepter of magazine covers, more and different awards, political and socially minded fund-raisers, and the attendant money, glamour and even more power that comes along with that territory.”

A spinoff, “Project Runway All Stars,” which debuted in 2012, features Ms. Chapman as a judge; the next season has already been filmed.

Mr. Weinstein was a key fund-raiser for amfAR, whose gala during the Cannes Film Festival is the most fashion-centric event on the movie festival circuit. Ms. Klum was honored by the organization in 2013.

LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate, has a 1 percent stake in the Weinstein Company. In 2007, Mr. Weinstein wrote the profile of Mr. Arnault for the Time 100 most influential people list. In 2011, he told The Wall Street Journal, “When I wasn’t doing so well, Anna would give a party and put me next to Bernard Arnault.”

A person familiar with LVMH said the two men barely knew each other.

Mr. Weinstein was also a regular at the Met Gala, which has been co-chaired by Ms. Wintour since 1999, and at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards. (In 2016, there were plans for the Weinstein Company to produce a television special on the CFDA awards, but it fell through, Mr. Kolb said, when they realized that the event was not paced for television.) Mr. Weinstein appeared in front rows, including those of Marchesa, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Burberry.

It was at a fashion show that the actress Léa Seydoux met Mr. Weinstein, she wrote in The Guardian. He then requested a private meeting with her, she said, which quickly turned inappropriate. (She also wrote about watching him pursue another woman at the Met Gala.) The model turned actress Cara Delevingne recently accused Mr. Weinstein of pursuing her and repeating to her details of her personal life as reported in the tabloids.

Trish Goff, a model who was a regular in the pages of Vogue and appeared in campaigns for Chanel and Dior, said she met Mr. Weinstein at a cocktail party at Ms. Wintour’s house in 2003 when she was 25. “He came in and someone said, ‘Oh, there’s Harvey Weinstein,’ so I turned to look at him, and he was looking at me,” she said. Shortly thereafter her agent got a call from his office inviting her to lunch.

She recalled: “This was at a time in my career when I was starting to think about what’s next. I was nervous about it, because he had a reputation, but I was equally nervous about not going because I was a single mother, and what if he made it so I didn’t work anymore? So I said, ‘O.K., tell him I’ll have lunch.’”

They ended up at the Tribeca Grill. “When I arrived, I discovered we were seated in a private room,” she said. “I asked him why he had wanted to have lunch, and he said ‘You were looking at me’ — as if to imply I was interested. I said, ‘Yes, I was looking at you because you are Harvey Weinstein, and I had never seen you before.’

“Then he started asking me if I had a boyfriend, and if we had an open relationship. I said I wasn’t interested in an open relationship, but he was relentless, and I kept trying to shut that down and move on. Then he started putting his hands on my legs, and I said, ‘Can you stop doing that?’ When we finally stood up to go, he really started groping me, grabbing my breasts, grabbing my face and trying to kiss me. I kept saying, ‘Please stop, please stop, but he didn’t until I managed to get back into the public space.

“The horrible thing is, as a model, it wasn’t that unusual to be in a weird situation where a photographer or someone feels they have a right to your body.”

Ms. Hofmeister, Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, said he could not be reached for comment on Ms. Goff’s allegations and directed a reporter to a previous statement denying allegations of nonconsensual sex.

Now Marchesa has become yet another symbol of Mr. Weinstein’s abuse of power, a brand he helped mastermind and support. There is now a #boycottmarchesa hashtag on Twitter. Helzberg Diamonds, which held the license for Marchesa’s bridal jewelry, announced it had delayed the planned line.

“The relationship helped the business tremendously,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor of Town & Country. “Marchesa had such great success on the red carpet and became known for that.” (Ms. Chapman appeared on the cover of the magazine in 2009.)

The label, which was founded in 2004 by Ms. Chapman and Keren Craig, first received real attention that same year, when Renée Zellweger, the star of the Miramax film “Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,” appeared on the red carpet in a Marchesa dress. She was followed shortly thereafter by Cate Blanchett, who wore Marchesa to the Rome premiere of “The Aviator,” also produced by Miramax.

In recent years, Marchesa’s red-carpet magic has dimmed and its celebrity placements have lost a bit of their star power, yet the label’s princess-y dresses still found eager takers. In 2017, Octavia Spencer, who has appeared in movies produced by Mr. Weinstein, wore a custom Marchesa gown to the Academy Awards, when she was nominated for her role in “Hidden Figures.”

When stars did wear the label, there was often a connection to Mr. Weinstein. Jennifer Jason Leigh wore Marchesa to the Academy Awards in 2016, when she was a nominee for her role in “The Hateful Eight,” directed by Quentin Tarantino (and executive-produced by the Weinstein brothers).

But Hollywood stylists who work with such stars and fashion houses to find dresses for premieres, award shows and red carpet events, appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach on the label. Of a half-dozen top stylists who have used Marchesa, not one would comment on how the Weinstein revelations would have an impact on their use of Marchesa.

“There’s a mob mentality that has developed,” said Lauren Santo Domingo, a founder of Moda Operandi, an online fashion retailer, who said she was standing behind Marchesa. On Wednesday, the brand postponed a planned preview of its spring 2018 collection to an unspecified “later date.” The company is hunkering down, and could not be reached for comment.

“I think the issue is no one knows what to say to Georgina, or the words to use,” Mr. Kolb said. “But as a creative power and as a CFDA member, she is someone who deserves the industry’s support and backing.”

Indeed, said Julie Gilhart, a fashion consultant and the former fashion director of Barneys New York: “We are living in a time right now when we should try to find the words.”",Fashion Breaks Its Silence on Harvey Weinstein Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/style/harvey-weinstein-marchesa-georgina-chapman-anna-wintour.html

While the guidelines are voluntary, they are endorsed by all but three states, so manufacturers effectively must meet the new standards to sell their equipment in most of the nation.

Of course, threats to democracy and fair voting — such as gerrymandered election districts and disinformation campaigns on Facebook and other social media platforms — go well beyond election technology. And so far state and federal funds have often failed to match the scale and urgency of the problem. But in a time of widespread skepticism about the security of American elections, ensuring people that their votes have been counted accurately has become a pressing demand.

“What’s happening is a psy-ops operation,” said Mac Warner, the West Virginia secretary of state. “That’s what the Russians are running against us now, trying to erode confidence in our democratic process. We need to assure our citizens that we’re aware of these attacks, that we have assistance to counter them, and that when they do occur, don’t panic — there are resources to turn to.”

In an era of bitter political divisions and elections-rules disputes, the effort to make the vote more secure is notably bipartisan and relatively rancor-free. Republicans like Mr. Warner are largely aligned with Democrats on the need to act before the next presidential election in 2020, and there is some support in both parties in Congress for helping to finance changes.

Experts have warned for years that state and local election equipment and security practices were dangerously out of date, but state and local election agencies short of cash have often lagged in updating their systems. The 2016 election, however, laid bare the seriousness of the threat.

Federal officials have said they are confident that November’s election results were not tampered with. But federal intelligence and security officials were so shaken by Russian attempts to compromise the vote that the Department of Homeland Security designated election systems a critical national infrastructure, like banking and the electrical grid, that merit special protection.

The scope of the threat was underscored on Tuesday when a new report concluded not only that widely used voting systems can be breached by hackers — sometimes with almost trivial ease — but that they contain components manufactured in nations like China with a clear interest in undermining American democracy.

“It’s really important not to overstate the risk. There are lots of things that can be done to make sure machines are as secure as possible,” Lawrence Norden, the deputy director of the Democracy Project at the Brennan Center for Justice of the New York University School of Law. “But when you’re dealing with a nation-state, you have to assume that at some point they’re going to be successful in their efforts to breach things. The question then becomes resiliency and the ability to show people that you can fix things even if there is a breach.”

State officials, who zealously guard their control of elections, have greeted federal efforts to address voting security with wariness. But that, too, has changed. State election directors who were blindsided and angered by the Homeland Security department’s critical infrastructure designation will meet with department officials in Atlanta this month to discuss how they can share information about threats. The department also is working to give state election officials security clearances so they can view classified assessments of dangers to the election system.

The new guidelines for manufacturers of voting equipment — reduced to five pages from more than 200 — include for the first time principles as basic as a requirement that voting devices produce written records that can be verified, and that software or hardware errors cannot lead to undetectable changes in tallies. They are expected to spur the development of a new generation of cheaper and more secure equipment, said Matthew Masterson, the chairman of the federal Election Assistance Commission.

He said the shared guidelines would allow for the deployment of election software on products like tablets and iPads, which could be ready as soon as the 2020 election, rather than force 50 states to put together their own systems. “It’s going to drive innovation, hopefully save money for election officials, and allow us to test and certify equipment more efficiently,’’ Mr. Masterson said.

Foreign governments that regularly crack the computers of military contractors and federal agencies will not be daunted by the cyberdefenses of voter databases and electronic pollbooks. A determined adversary could compromise voting equipment at many points along the supply chain, from the factory assembler to the election software programmer to the technician who makes a repair or installs a software upgrade. And in an industry dominated by a handful of companies, malicious tinkering could have a broad impact.

“In computer security, you’re talking much more about the capabilities of local jurisdictions,” said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technology officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. “And they vary dramatically, from L.A., which has a small army of folks, to many jurisdictions that don’t even have a full-time person for their election work. To the extent they have an ability to defend against these attacks, it’s quite limited.”

Mr. Hall said election officials need to be even more vigilant, and impose a “zero-trust networking” policy on their agencies. “Don’t assume that because something is locked in a case that it’s safe,” he said. “Assume they’re already in your system, and set up things that will catch them — honey pots, fake data stores. If anyone hits them, then you know someone’s poking around.”

For all the expressions of resolve, money remains the biggest obstacle to a complete overhaul of the system. Many jurisdictions rely on equipment bought after the 2002 Help America Vote Act, Congress’s response to the problems exposed by the 2000 presidential election, allotted nearly $4 billion for new machines and other reforms. Many of those machines are at or past the end of their service lives; Georgia conducted November’s elections on voting machines running Windows 2000, and parts of Pennsylvania relied on Windows XP.

Most states still use paper ballots that are counted by hand or by machines. But four other states besides Delaware — Louisiana, Georgia, New Jersey and South Carolina — use paperless systems that leave no audit trail, as do large swaths of Pennsylvania and some other states. Virginia scrapped thousands of paperless voting machines in 2015 after discovering that even an amateur hacker could easily and secretly change vote tallies.

A number of states and jurisdictions are replacing old equipment, and Los Angeles County — with 5.3 million registered voters, the nation’s largest election district — has designed an election system from scratch, and is asking manufacturers to bid on supplying it.

Bipartisan legislation in both the House and Senate would provide a modest amount of federal money for new machines. But prospects for passage are uncertain, and many states are unable or unwilling to fill the breach.

The South Carolina Election Commission estimates that it could cost $40 million to replace the state’s antiquated voting equipment with machines that used auditable paper ballots. So far the State Legislature has come up with $1 million, said Chris Whitmire, a spokesman for the commission.

“We’re using the same equipment we’ve used since 2004,” he said. “If $40 million dropped into our hands today, we’d have a paper ballot trail, too.”

But even states that cannot afford more secure machines are taking steps to harden their election systems and bolster public confidence in the vote. South Carolina has accepted an offer of free “cyberhygiene” scans of its system by Homeland Security experts. Colorado is upgrading its voting equipment, but it has also begun to receive Homeland Security screenings, added national guard security experts to its election team and tacked a basic security measure onto its voter-registration database: two-step authentication for anyone seeking to log into the system.

State election officials are now in regular contact with federal security and intelligence agencies about threats to the vote, said Trevor Timmons, the chief information officer for Wayne W. Williams, the Colorado secretary of state.

“I’ve spent more time talking to three-letter agencies in the last year than I have in my entire career,” he said.","Wary of Hackers, States Move to Upgrade Voting Systems",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/us/voting-russians-hacking-states-.html

“I HAVE FOUND IT!” Mary Shelley remembered thinking when she awoke from a fateful nightmare in the summer of 1816 with a thunderclap of inspiration. “What terrified me will terrify others.” These terrors provided the raw material for “Frankenstein,” which she composed at 19 and published anonymously in London two years later, unleashing one of the great ogres of the imagination into the world. “I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out,” she wrote, “and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life.” To quote the mad doctor responsible for him in the 1931 Universal Pictures film: “It’s alive!” Now, as the 200th birthday of Shelley’s Monster — or, really, her monstrous allegory — fast approaches, he remains at large.

But a monstrous allegory for what, exactly? Like all great myths, Shelley’s tale shape-shifts to suit any number of freaky interpretations without sacrificing the original’s hellacious powers. It could be a 19th-century premonition about the dangers of biotechnology, or a fable about the possibilities of male birth and all the horror such transgressions of the so-called natural invoke. Though “Frankenstein” also remains one of the most savage tales about father-son dysfunction, the Monster is a daddy, too, responsible in some ways for fantastic creations including Marilyn Manson; “The Rise of the Planet of the Apes” (2011), which turns, like Shelley’s tale, on the education of an “uncivilized” beast; and Rei Kawakubo’s “bump” dresses (1997), recently on view at the Met, which distort the bodies of their wearers to throw monstrous shadows. Yet there’s something about this story of unhallowed arts that makes it darkly resonant for queer artists beyond any other group.

When you’re gay and grow up feeling like a hideous misfit, fully conscious that some believe your desires to be wicked and want to kill you for them, identifying with the Monster is hardly a stretch: A misunderstood beast finds solace in the solitude of the woods, but seems to endlessly face the wrath of the torch-bearing, small-minded inhabitants in the world beyond. There have been explicitly queer representations of Frankenstein’s creature at least since “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” the camp classic that has been screened more or less continuously since its release in 1975, in which the titular monster (created by transvestite Frank-N-Furter) is a lithe blond male in skimpy gold lamé. (The X-rated “Andy Warhol’s Flesh for Frankenstein,” a retelling of Shelley that gleefully chronicles the doctor’s attempt to create a “perfect” man, predates “Rocky Horror” by about a year.) More recently, on television, “Penny Dreadful” (2014) and “The Cleveland Show” (2011) have starred gay versions of Frankenstein or his Monster.

If vampires occupy a magical role in the erotic life of adolescents as cultivated loners (consider Robert Pattinson in the “Twilight” saga, 2008-12, or everybody in “Only Lovers Left Alive,” 2013), Frankenstein’s Monster is their nightmarish queer counterpart. He’s a misfit child spurned by his father who grows up to be a sensitive oddity, too strange to be accepted by society or reproduce naturally and forced to seek refuge in seclusion. The artist Richard Hawkins, whose oeuvre could be understood as a complex wrestling match with the meanings of the Monster, and who has painted stitched-together creatures alongside lusty young men, wisely pinpointed the reasons for this queer sympathy as well as whatever divides the zombie from the vampire in a 2009 interview in the book “Of Two Minds, Simultaneously.” As a child he fell for Frankenstein‘s Monster “because he’s clumsy, shy and misunderstood; Dracula because he’s dandyish, nocturnal and misunderstood.”

Bill Condon’s 1998 film “Gods and Monsters” created both a kind of queer origin story and creation myth for the Monster’s continuing presence in popular culture. An account of the last days of James Whale, director of the 1931 adaptation of “Frankenstein,” the film begins as a tame biopic but soon mutates into a very peculiar discursion about the seductions and strangeness of flesh. It features Ian McKellen as Whale fighting a naked handyman played by Brendan Fraser, his beefcake head obscured by a gas mask, steamy poolside shenanigans straight from a Honcho magazine dreamscape and evocations of a putrid soldier strobe-lit by lightning strikes. Whale’s unrequited lust for the hunk kinkily inverts the longing-loathing dynamics between Monster and Doctor, but a hint of romance still quivers through the proceedings and at its climax, the Monster (or Fraser?) escorts Whale over eldritch moorland to his death. (Condon has been enlisted to direct a new version of Whale’s “Bride of Frankenstein” in 2019.)

HOMOEROTIC SUBTEXT was haunting “Frankenstein” way before “Gods and Monsters,” though: Boris Karloff’s fond nickname for his favorite role was “the dear old monster.” Even in the book, the attacks on the Monster spoken by its creator mimic the rabid noise of a trans/homophobic chorus: “More hideous than belongs to humanity” or “some other species.” It’s also a chronicle of the electric fascination flowing between two men and the accompanying rumbles of repressed desire that destroy them.",Why Frankenstein’s Monster Haunts Queer Art,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/t-magazine/art/frankenstein-monster-queer-art.html

“I was thinking about that,” said Miranda Stone, 32, who said she had attended every Late Night With Roy since her freshman year here 14 years ago. “I was scared it might put a damper on things. The atmosphere would be different.”

Instead, the long North Carolina nightmare was over. And the fans were thrilled.

“We’re happy it’s over, and even more happy nothing bad happened,” said Matthew Kinlaw, 18, who drove from St. Pauls, N.C., after completing his application to the university the night before.

Outside the Dean Dome, as the Smith Center is known, a sandpaper-colored octagon that resembles a desert fortress, fans were lined up Friday afternoon two hours before the women’s volleyball match that preceded the tip-off event, and more than four before the basketball team finally took the court. They wanted the best seats for the free pep rally.

No sports arena is more dedicated to its home team’s hue than this one. Pantone 542 — here known as Carolina Blue — colors parts of the court, the padding behind the baskets, the seats, the seat cushions, the beams and vents in the rafters, even the overhead speakers. It is snowier than the regal azure of North Carolina’s archrival down Tobacco Road, Duke, yet sterner than powder blue.

This balance between dark and light might be said to fit North Carolina’s fan base, which is one of those in college sports that seems as if it genuinely wants to win the right way — even if, like many fans, it might sooner part with the right way than the winning. Many fans’ reactions to the scandal Friday were defiant when it came to the N.C.A.A., but chastened when it came to their own standards.

“I have to say, I’m not proud of what happened,” said Stone, “and there were some things that needed to change, and I’m glad it was brought to light.”

“You can say that the verdict was time served,” Chansky said, “because the last four to six years haven’t been fun at all.”

Returning for his third go-round as tip-off master of ceremonies was Kenny Smith, the former North Carolina and N.B.A. player who co-hosts TNT’s popular N.B.A. pregame show.

Smith was introduced as the Drake and Future song “Jumpman” played, which, as a nod to Nike and the university’s most famous alumnus, was a signal that business as usual had returned. (University of Kentucky fans attending Big Blue Madness that same evening got to see Drake in the flesh, wearing an instantly viral “Kentucky Dad” hoodie.)

The hour that followed might have been dreary if you were not a Tar Heels die-hard (or even if you were). There were dances and controlled scrimmaging. Kennedy Meeks, a since-graduated star of last season’s team, was acknowledged in the stands. The introduction of the junior Luke Maye, who made a crucial shot to beat Kentucky in the round of 8 last season, provoked the crowd to rapture.

Then the players lined up at center court as attention was drawn to the six championship banners hanging side by side on one side of the arena. As the end of last season’s title game played on the arena’s video screens, the years of the previous national titles, from 1924 to 2009, were counted off, and finally the 2017 banner was unfurled.

It was perhaps a trick, a hallucination produced by the outpouring of meaning from 21,000 fans invested in the moment, that it immediately felt as if the new flag had always been there, and that it would never go away.","At North Carolina, a Sigh of Relief and a New Championship Banner",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/sports/ncaabasketball/north-carolina-tar-heels-roy-williams.html

They left with bone fragments.

These were among the first steps in a painstaking process of finding the missing and the dead, under unusually difficult conditions. The fires were so hot that car wheels made of aluminum — which has a melting point of 1,221 degrees Fahrenheit — turned into puddles.

“People have been cremated, for lack of a better term,” said Sgt. Ray Kelly, a spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, which has more than 40 experts helping in the forensic investigation. “Any DNA that was on the bones is gone — it’s consumed,” Sergeant Kelly said.

At Journey’s End, technicians in bright orange and lemon yellow jackets raked through ash and fragments of household items. In the debris were the frame of a bed, the wire covering of a fan and magazines and books turned to ash that disintegrated when touched.

“This will be without a doubt the most complicated identification process this area has ever seen,” said Jim Wood, an expert in forensic dentistry who was helping identify bodies through dental records. Mr. Wood, who now represents the area in the State Assembly, also helped identify victims of the Sept. 11 attacks.

Officials have released names of about half of those confirmed killed; most were elderly, but not all. Christina Hanson, 28, who was disabled and used a wheelchair, died in her apartment in Santa Rosa. Kai Shepherd, 14, was killed in Mendocino County, trying to run from the fire.

By Friday morning, more than 221,000 acres statewide had burned in the spate of fires that started on Sunday, said Ken Pimlott, chief of Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, including more than 150,000 acres in Sonoma and Napa Counties, north of San Francisco. The causes of the fires are still unknown.

Some survivors told of being roused Sunday night or early Monday by friends, or by police officers or sheriff’s deputies driving down their streets, honking or shouting through loudspeakers. But many said they got no official warning, or that one came too late.

Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of emergency alert systems in telling people to evacuate. Sonoma, Napa and other counties have alert systems that send text messages to mobile phones, but those warnings generally go only to the people who have signed up to receive them, and the fires knocked out cellular service in many areas.

The more aggressive “Amber alert” system, with text messages and screeching alarms, can reach nearly every mobile phone in a region, but it was not activated on the night the fires broke out. Officials have said that they were concerned about setting off a panic and jamming roads.

The authorities described a chaotic scramble to evacuate residents from Santa Rosa amid thick smoke and flying embers.

“There wasn’t time to map out anything. There wasn’t time to make a plan,” said Sgt. Spencer Crum of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, one of a dozen officers on duty on Sunday night.

Sergeant Crum said he and his fellow officers drove up narrow driveways, blaring horns and sirens. He remembers repeatedly screaming, “Get out of here now!”

Some residents resisted. Some were in wheelchairs; he lifted them into his patrol car. “I said, ‘You are going to die if you stay here,’” Sergeant Crum recounted. “We did the best we could with the time we had.”

The sheer speed at which the fire spread and jumped that first night also made it impossible to keep track of what was burning.

One of those killed, Michael J. Dornbach, 57, who lives in Southern California, was visiting relatives and friends who live in the rugged, wooded hills near Calistoga, in Napa County. “He was saying how beautiful it was and how he wanted to move here,” said his sister, Laura Dornbach, who was with her brother an hour before the fire, and then drove to her own home.

When the fire came Sunday night, “he didn’t want to leave without his brand-new pickup truck, and he couldn’t find the keys,” she said, her voice catching. “They were searching frantically, and everyone was begging him to get out. My son said ‘Uncle Michael, this is serious, we have got to get out, please!’ But my brother was a stubborn man. I’m just so confused that he wouldn’t leave. And I don’t understand why everyone else didn’t just drag him out.”

The others drove away, but minutes later, she said, her son, Robert M. Lee, 18, “drove up the mountain again to get him, but he got stopped by authorities.” The next day, Ms. Dornbach got word that her brother was dead.

Farther north, Sara Shepherd called her parents at 1 a.m. Monday to say that nearby hills were burning, so she, her husband, and their two children were evacuating their house in a remote area of Redwood Valley. “They didn’t think their lives were in danger,” said Mindi Ramos, Ms. Shepherd’s sister.

But the conflagration advanced so fast that they could not make it down their mile-long driveway before the flames closed in. They abandoned their car and fled on foot, scattershot, unsure where to go. The Shepherds’ son, Kai — a shy 14-year-old who liked baseball, wrestling and playing saxophone — died.

Ms. Shepherd, her husband, Jon, and their daughter, Kressa, were all seriously injured and still hospitalized on Friday, Ms. Ramos said. It was unclear whether they knew that Kai was gone.

Carmen and Armando Berriz, Southern California residents, had rented a house just outside Santa Rosa for a wine country getaway with their daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter. Awakened by noise, the group ran out in their nightclothes and piled into three cars to flee through blinding smoke.

The Berrizes, in the third car, never made it, their escape apparently blocked by a fallen tree, a family member said. They returned to the house and took refuge in the swimming pool, the flames raging around them for hours. Ms. Berriz, 75, died; Mr. Berriz, 76, suffered burns and smoke inhalation.

Ms. Grant, the daughter of Arthur and Suiko Grant, said her father, 95, and mother, 75, apparently got into their car and tried to leave, but it appeared that a fallen telephone pole and downed power lines blocked the sole, narrow route to or from their home. They hid with their dog in their wine cellar, where they asphyxiated as the fire, which burned their house to its foundation, consumed all the available oxygen.

“The only thing that makes me feel any better is that they didn’t burn alive,” Ms. Grant said. “And they were at least together.”

Doug and Tracy Hugill, of Santa Rosa, woke to the smell of smoke around 1 a.m. on Monday, and got an alert on their phones at 1:37 a.m. warning of fire. The alert did not say to evacuate, but they loaded their children and some belongings into their car.

At 2:09 a.m., another alert came, saying “EVACUATE THAT AREA NOW.” By then, the house behind them was ablaze, the streets were thick with smoke, flaming embers were landing around them, and neighbors were banging on doors, telling people to leave.

“By the time we got the push alert, the fire had crossed the freeway to our house,” said Mr. Hugill, a systems engineer. “We had barely enough time to get out.”

On Friday more than 9,000 firefighters, using more than 1,000 fire trucks, more than 100 bulldozers and more than 100 aircraft — many of them supplied by other states and the federal government — were battling the fires, Chief Pimlott said.

Though crews made some progress containing the blazes on Thursday and Friday, they continued to spread, with new neighborhoods added each day to the list of evacuation orders. Officials warned that dry, windy conditions expected over the next few days meant the flames could blow out of control again.

“Everyone needs to be thinking right now,” Chief Pimlott said, “‘What is my evacuation plan? What am I going to take with me? How am I going to get out?’ And be prepared to do that literally on a moment’s notice. Not a half-hour, not an hour — you need to be thinking about that in minutes.”","In California, Fires So Fast Hesitation Proved Lethal",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/us/california-wildfires-victims.html

Devastating Fires Across California

4. I have a friend in Santa Rosa who was driving out of a burning neighborhood with his dog in the car and had to take an unfamiliar route due to fire on the road. He ran into a locked gate in a gated community and could not get out. Then a tree fell and blocked his retreat. He and his dog had to run on foot from a wall of fire. They hiked overland in active fires for several miles trying to get to the creek and/or down the hill into Santa Rosa, were trapped by several fences, and eventually my friend took shelter in a shed while fire raged all around. He was burned by embers, inhaled a lot of smoke, and was almost blinded by smoke and particles during this harrowing ordeal. My friend survived. His dog got lost and we fear the worst.

— James Stewart in New York, reacting to an article about Vice President Mike Pence leaving an Indianapolis Colts game after nearly two dozen players from the visiting San Francisco 49ers knelt during the national anthem.

6. Is it too much, Mr. Vice President, to ask that we also remember the now seemingly insignificant matter of why the protests began? Colin Kaepernick first knelt “to draw attention to racial oppression of African-Americans” (oh, *them* again). Speaking most particularly to police brutality. Heaven forbid we actually acknowledge and address that. How dare they? Better to shift focus to the ‘disrespect’ of flag, country, veterans and anthem while blatantly erasing the intention of the protests’ origins — leaving victimized, and/or dead African-American men, women and children to lie dismissed and irrelevant in their place.

Boy Scouts Will Welcome Girls

7. This is a bad move on behalf of the Boy Scouts, and it only creates divisiveness. The Boy Scouts would have done so much better to work more closely with the Girl Scouts to form cooperative programs where troops could come together if they were interested in involving girls. I’m been a Girl Scout all my life, and my relationships with other Girl Scouts are dearly important to me, just as I’m sure the same is true for lifelong Boy Scouts. These programs need to be friends, and it all works much better when they don’t poach kids from the other organization.

— Korinda in Chicago, reacting to an article about the Boy Scouts’ announcement that next year girls will be allowed into the Cub Scouts program.

Anxiety Among Teens

9. How are people struggling with this question? College students have never been more burdened by finances. Every young person I know is in roughly 4,000 after-school activities with hours of homework every night, plus many high schools are now requiring classes like calculus in order to graduate, and thanks to the magic of social media, bullying is something they live with 24/7. I feel terrible for the teenagers who are growing up in this crazy world right now.

Eminem Freestyles Against Trump

“Actors and actresses stick to acting.”

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’m going to do something a bit different today. I’ve spilled a few clues, but I want you to get through the puzzle yourself, mostly so you will appreciate the rest of the column. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to develop my Lewis Black impression, and this is it.

Sometimes, when I’m feeling like I haven’t yet had enough pain and humiliation in my life, I take a Zumba class. No, don’t write me letters about how I’m doing it wrong and if I would just relax I’d learn to enjoy it. No one on the entire planet has ever convinced another human being to do anything that way, especially when it comes to tripping over their own two feet. I’ve accepted my fate when it comes to Zumba.

At other times, I solve puzzles by Byron Walden. It has largely the same effect as the Zumba, minus the muscle pain. Mr. Walden, who is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, quietly takes his aggressions out by writing the kind of clues that make many solvers, myself included, feel a lot like this dog:

That’s called misdirection. Misdirection is when you look at a clue like 20D’s “One who tries to avoid being touched” and your brain starts to run through the names of disorders where people don’t like being touched because that’s got to be what the constructor is thinking, right, and then the answer winds up being an odd word like EPEEIST. (A “touch” is when your fencing opponent scores against you.)

It’s when you see a clue like “Fabulous speaker?” and think O.K., maybe it’s AESOP, because you’ve been trained, I mean trained, to think AESOP’s fables whenever you see the word “fabulous” in a clue, but the answer turns out to be LIAR. And he’s not wrong. Someone who tells tales is a LIAR.

It’s when you see a clue like 8D’s “Candy ass?” and, after fanning yourself and wondering what ever happened to the good old Gray Lady, you think that the answer has to have something to do with being weak. But it doesn’t, does it? No, the ass in this clue is a donkey, and Mr. Walden has once again taken us the long way around to realizing that he means PIÑATA.",Dystopian Backdrop,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2017-10-07.html

Doing it while preserving the neighborhood’s patchwork charms — the artist studios and craft-makers, the surviving heavy industry, the hypnotic, sulfur-scented quiet of the canal on a Sunday morning — might be impossible.

“There’s something compelling happening in this place, the mix is interesting and creative and we want to preserve it,” said Brad Lander, the city councilman for most of the canal zone, who led an earlier two-year public planning effort. “That’s never easy in planning and zoning.”

Whatever happens next on the canal, it is a safe bet that many people will hate it. This tradition goes back, at least, to the 1850s, when Gowanus Creek was walled in to create the canal, said Joseph Alexiou, author of the 2015 history “Gowanus: Brooklyn’s Curious Canal.”

“There’s the sense along the canal that the person who moved here discovered it,” he said, “and that their discovery is the truest one.”

The Gowanus has been here before. In 2009, the city proposed a rezoning of a smaller area that was projected to create 3,200 new apartments, setting off a land rush. But the next year, the canal was named a federal Superfund site. The future was thrown into uncertainty, and the city shelved its plan.

Since then, the Superfund cleanup has been mapped out, real estate prices have climbed higher and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who took office in 2014, chose Gowanus as one of several city neighborhoods where developers could build bigger if they created affordable housing.

Meanwhile, any questions about whether people will pay good money to live beside a national disaster area were answered with the June 2016 opening of the first high-rise, 365 Bond Street, a sleek, stepped box where a light-filled two-bedroom rents for $5,400.

The building filled within a year, said its owner, the Lightstone Group. More than 56,000 people applied for the 86 apartments (out of 430) priced affordably, with rents below $900. Another high-rise next door, which features a rooftop pool and “lifestyle concierge,” opened in July.

Those opposed to high-end housing along the canal remain unimpressed. Among them is Linda Mariano, a founder of Friends and Residents of Greater Gowanus. She was recently persuaded to take a stroll along the waterfront walkway, which is open to the public though largely hidden from the street.

“This is not Gowanus,” said Ms. Mariano, a retired art teacher who bought a fixer-upper on President Street in 1974.

While party leaders were quiet under Mr. Bush, some today seem willing to speak out, however haltingly, against Mr. Trump.","This meant that domestic policy, and the realm of domestic policy expertise, became an afterthought at best, an opportunity for cynical political maneuvering at worst.

But Mr. Bush’s post-Sept. 11 popularity instilled the administration with an arrogance that extended far beyond the war itself. The president’s inner circle became convinced that the Republican Party was destined for years of unbroken political domination; the ambition-spoiling concerns of the “reality-based community” no longer needed to be taken into account.

National security fear-mongering and culture war controversies, especially over same-sex marriage, were employed to rally the base and ensure its loyalty, even as dissatisfaction with Mr. Bush’s governance continued to grow.

The Bush presidency, then, was both a failure and a fraud. Instead of foreign policy restraint and modest conservative governance, the Bush administration delivered a pair of endless deficit-financed wars, cynical posturing over social issues, soaring federal spending and, eventually, a large-scale emergency intervention in the economy.

Arguably as important as the particular failures themselves, however, was the way the party infrastructure — its leaders and functionaries, its activists and operators — formed a partisan phalanx around the president, playing down his flaws, if not refusing to acknowledge them.

There is always some space between a party’s voters and its leaders, some difference between what the average supporter wants and what the elected representatives are willing to do. But by excusing Mr. Bush’s errors, Republicans radically expanded the trust deficit, creating a yawning gap between the party’s base and its elites, one that has persisted, and grown, in the years since.

In many ways the party’s hangups stem from its unwillingness to fully reckon with the Bush legacy.

Mr. Bush left many voters on the right angry, resentful and suspicious — of war, of policy, of ideology, of the very idea of political solutions and leadership.

The focal point for much of the post-Bush right’s anger and resentment was the Tea Party, a decentralized movement that variously mixed genuine desire for limited government with white resentment and flare-ups of outright paranoia. It attracted hucksters and manipulators, in the media and in the activist sphere, and embraced a cast of unconventional and unqualified candidates.

Republican Party elites were only too happy to exploit this inchoate energy as long as it was useful. This is how John McCain ended up selecting an untested firebrand like Sarah Palin as his presidential running mate and how Mitt Romney campaigned with sideshow characters like Kid Rock and, well, eventually Donald Trump.

The partisan push for the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama further amplified these frustrations, which helped Republicans take over the House in 2010.

The defeats of both Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney left the party leaderless, and Mr. Bush’s shredded reputation meant it could not follow the course he had laid out. So the party became defined by what was left: its resentments and suspicions, its antagonisms and obsessions, its anger and its differences. It retreated into tribalism and anti-intellectualism. Eventually, the sideshow became the main event.

Mr. Trump, of course, is the biggest sideshow of them all. He exploited the gap between the base and the elites, embodying the dysfunction and disarray that already existed.

Like all presidents, he serves an organizing function for his party, orienting it around broad goals. But Mr. Trump’s goals have more to do with Twitter feuds and personal aggrandizement than any particular policies. Under Mr. Trump, the party’s chief internal debate is not so much about which governing vision to pursue but whether there should be one at all.

This reality is not lost on all Republicans. Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, one of the party’s most libertarian members, recently said that when he realized that primary voters backed him and his fellow libertarians Rand Paul and Ron Paul, it wasn’t for their ideas. Instead, he said, “they were voting for the craziest son of a bitch in the race — and Donald Trump won best in class.”

Republican voters weren’t voting for any policy outcome. They were voting for chaos. And that, more than anything, is what the party has come to stand for.

A more conventional Republican president might have smoothed over some of these intraparty conflicts, and almost certainly would have managed passing legislation with more skill. But the essential divisions would still have existed.

For years before Mr. Trump was elected, Republicans lacked a consensus plan to replace Obamacare, and their tax reform plans were vague. Republicans blew up the deficit under Mr. Bush before complaining about it under Mr. Obama, and the party has fought bitter internal battles over immigration for decades.

Republican voters, meanwhile, were attracted to shallow political entertainers and obviously unqualified candidates long before Mr. Trump threw his hat in the ring.

Mr. Trump didn’t cause any of this. He just took advantage of it. He is the most successful huckster of the bunch.

While party leaders were quiet under Mr. Bush, some today seem willing to speak out, however haltingly, against Mr. Trump. Republicans would benefit from more of that sort of critical introspection, but it is not enough. Because someday, Mr. Trump will no longer be president. And the Republicans will probably still be the same dysfunctional and disappointing party it is today.",The G.O.P. Is a Mess.

As music acts go, it thus has more in common with Lena Horne’s revelatory “The Lady and Her Music” from 1981 than with a greatest-hits concert by the likes of Barry Manilow.

Call it a greatest anti-hits concert: Many of the songs Mr. Springsteen has chosen to sing are less familiar and more meditative than his chart-toppers, and those that were chart-toppers are almost unrecognizable.

That’s why the show’s version of “Dancing in the Dark” admits no clapping; sung at a slower-than-usual tempo, and accompanied only by Mr. Springsteen on acoustic guitar, it is no longer the casual invitation to sex it seemed to be in its first incarnation. It is instead a parable about the nihilism underlying such invitations.

Nor is “Born in the U.S.A.,” also from 1984, the jingoistic anthem it once sounded like on MTV, when the thrust engine roar of the E Street Band sent it into orbit. With its choruses now spat away quickly and its bleak verses about damaged veterans dwelt on, it is, as Mr. Springsteen says he always intended, a “protest song.”

This will not be news to fans who have been paying attention to him during the 30 years since his sleeveless T-shirt and bandanna heyday, or to anyone who has read his hair-raising 2016 memoir, “Born to Run.” There he outlined an ideal of rock music as a “culture shaper” and an ideal of himself as someone who would “collide with the times” in order to change them. “Springsteen on Broadway” distills the same daunting dream; its spoken portions, which make up about half of the two-hour show, are mostly taken from the book or build on its ideas.

Not that the music stops much even then; when telling stories about his chaotic upbringing in the “crap town” of Freehold, N.J., he is often picking at one of his guitars or vamping on the piano, his eyes half-shut. The same two-chord figure continues for what seems like hundreds of bars, making apt, trancelike accompaniments to a claustrophobic tale of “church, school, homework and string beans.” Songs like “Growin’ Up,” “My Hometown” and “My Father’s House” draw their expressivity from (or despite) a similar sense of confinement.

Admittedly, this is a well honed story, a self-portrait of a mask. There have been many such masks over the years — mama’s boy, loner, stadium stud, Woody Guthrie — each developed through songs that would seem to cancel each other out.

“Springsteen on Broadway” sets out to reconcile that contradiction by reshaping his glibber hits and personas along the lines of his mature, “Ghost of Tom Joad” vision. But first he acknowledges the contradiction, using words like “fraud” to describe himself: a bard of the working class who has “never held an honest job” and a rebel who despite his millions still lives 10 minutes from the house he grew up in. Even his five-decade career has been a “magic trick,” turning the unpromising tools of his cheese-grater voice and “hideous” appearance into a vehicle for the primal rock message that “fun is a birthright.”

That’s another mask: rock Dionysus. In any case, “fun” is not a word I’d use to describe “Springsteen on Broadway.” (How about “relentlessly serious” for the marquee?) On Heather Wolensky’s abandoned warehouse set, under Natasha Katz’s deeply shadowed lighting, Mr. Springsteen comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry. Fair enough. There is little left of the music business that could once breed and elevate a performer like him, whose ear is tuned to the whole world’s injustice.

At other times, in the startling intimacy of the 939-seat theater (Mr. Springsteen often plays stadiums that are vastly larger) and with the help of Brian Ronan’s you-are-there sound design, “Springsteen on Broadway” seems like a radio monodrama broadcast from the deepest interior of a single troubled soul. His voice, still quite capable of what he calls in the memoir his “Jersey-Pavarotti-via-Roy Orbison singing,” more often sounds like the howl of a dog caught in a barbed-wire fence. His guitar sounds like the barbed wire.

Are there any other artists of Mr. Springsteen’s stature who would choose to drive a show — on Broadway yet — so close and so often toward what he calls the “suicide watch”? (He is credited as both writer and director.) The opening grimness, unrelieved but for some self-lacerating jokes, does not let up until “Thunder Road,” about a half-hour along. The height of the evening’s high spirits is “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” a “boardwalk soul” dance tune whose first words are nevertheless “Teardrops on the city.”

More often we are in the strange, exalted precincts of “Long Walk Home” and the Sept. 11 psalm “The Rising.” Even the songs he sings with his wife — “Brilliant Disguise” and “Tougher Than the Rest” — question the possibility of fidelity, both to oneself and to others.

But he clearly knows where he’s headed and that he can get there; at any rate he has to keep this up five times a week through Feb. 3. (The run is sold out, except for some tickets available by digital lottery and those going for more than $1,000 each on the resale market.) Perhaps, like a priest, he enjoys the ritual. He does call music his “service,” his “long and noisy prayer.”

That’s another mask, of course, but the thing about his masks is that they’re all real, made with enough craft to see and be seen through. Indeed, as portraits of artists go, there may never have been anything as real — and beautiful — on Broadway.","Review: ‘Springsteen on Broadway’ Reveals the Artist, Real and Intense",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/theater/bruce-springsteen-on-broadway-review.html

As Chernow puts it, “It is sadly ironic that Grant’s presidency became synonymous with corruption, since he himself was impeccably honest.”

For all its scholarly and literary strengths, this book’s greatest service is to remind us of Grant’s significant achievements at the end of the war and after, which have too long been overlooked and are too important today to be left in the dark. Considered by many detractors to be, as a general, little more than a stoic butcher, Grant, in the written terms of surrender at Appomattox, showed the empathy he felt toward the defeated and downtrodden — conditions he knew from harsh personal experience. The terms presented to Robert E. Lee carried “no tinge of malice” and “breathed a spirit of charity reminiscent of Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address.” He notably allowed the exhausted and starving Confederate regulars to keep their mules and horses, knowing from the rough experience of his failed Missouri farm (Grant presciently named its log cabin “Hardscrabble”) that only by putting in a crop as soon as they returned home would these destitute farmers — and their families — have a chance to survive the coming winter. Grant also knew that if the country had any chance of being brought back together, it needed something other than a harsh peace. In making national healing a priority, he — like Lincoln — took the long view.

Grant’s tendency toward empathy with the downtrodden and defeated would return again and again, and not always to his advantage or credit. He didn’t hesitate to appoint family and friends far above their abilities, and to remember even the smallest favor done on his behalf while he was a struggling civilian. There’s a wonderful exchange in the book when Grant as president offers a political appointment to a friend from his prewar days in St. Louis, when he was broke and dependent on his slave-owning (and openly contemptuous) father-in-law. Grant reminded the friend that “when I was standing on a street corner ... by a wagon loaded with wood, you approached and said: ‘Captain, haven’t you been able to sell your wood?’ I answered: ‘No.’ Then you said: ‘I’ll buy it; and whenever you haul a load of wood to the city and can’t sell it, just take it around to my residence ... and I’ll pay you for it.’ I haven’t forgotten it.”

After Appomattox, and the assassination of Lincoln, Grant moved to what he then called Washington City to lead the Army through the war’s aftermath. Chernow notes that, as a general, Grant had nearly always fought on unfamiliar ground, which required a kind of concentration that could support a state of continuous reassessment. Washington was also unfamiliar ground, and continuous reassessment was just as vital to political success as it had been to victory on the field. Grant proved a quick study, even after he had professed to be “no politician.”

For example, he saw early on that the new president, Andrew Johnson, who many feared would be much harsher on the South than Lincoln would have been, had begun to lean hard — and dangerously — in the opposite direction. “Mr. Johnson,” Grant writes in his memoirs, “after a complete revolution of sentiment, seemed to regard the South not only as an oppressed people, but as the people best entitled to consideration of any of our citizens.” Needless for Grant to say, this favor of Johnson’s fell to white Southerners only. He began to bring the weight of the presidency down on the side of those who championed what became the infamous Black Codes, designed to force freed slaves to continue to work on plantations in conditions much like those before emancipation.

As Grant’s and Johnson’s political differences grew wider, Grant, as General of the Army and immensely popular, began to suffer the ire of the increasingly besieged Johnson, who demanded fealty and, when frustrated and convinced of disloyalties real or imagined, tended to lash out. “It grated on Johnson that Grant,” Chernow says, “a mere subordinate, had been endowed with … godlike powers over Reconstruction.”

Photo

Contrary to Johnson’s claim, the power Grant had to oversee the fate of the postwar South was hardly godlike. A former social club named for the Greek word kuklos, or circle, the Ku Klux Klan had begun “to shade into a quasi-military organization, recruiting Nathan Bedford Forrest as a leader” — and vowing “to ‘support a white man’s government’ and carry weapons at all times.” By the time of Grant’s election as president in 1868, the Klan was targeting black voters and their supporters with “murders and mutilations in a grotesque spirit of sadistic mockery.” The Union that Grant had been instrumental in saving as a general was splintering anew even before he took his oath of office. As Chernow writes, “If there were many small things Grant didn’t know about the presidency, he knew one big thing: His main mission was to settle unfinished business from the war by preserving the Union and safeguarding the freed slaves.”

And there was a very real chance Grant, and with him the country, would fail.

For that new mission, Grant needed cabinet members, staff and advisers every bit as masterful as his wartime lieutenants. His choices were notably hit-and-miss, but his very first appointee from a Confederate state proved to be one of his best. Amos T. Akerman of Georgia, Grant’s second attorney general, was “honest and incorruptible” and “devoted to the rule of law.” When Congress created the Department of Justice the same week as his appointment, the attorney general became overnight the head of “an active department with a substantial array of new powers.” Those powers were sorely needed to fight the Klan and what Chernow appropriately calls “the worst outbreak of domestic terrorism in American history.”

Grant signed three bills, collectively known as the Enforcement Acts, to strengthen federal powers in combating Klan terrorism, which had already claimed thousands of lives, the vast majority of them black. After the laws were in force, “federal grand juries, many interracial, brought 3,384 indictments against the K.K.K., resulting in 1,143 convictions.” Almost as important as the convictions was the message they sent. As Akerman told his district attorneys, “If you cannot convict, you, at least, can expose, and ultimately such exposures will make the community ashamed of shielding the crime.”

By the end of his first term, scandals had begun to take their toll, but at the same time the Klan — at least in its original incarnation — had been essentially destroyed. “Peace has come to many places as never before,” declared Frederick Douglass, an ally and admirer of Grant’s. “The scourging and slaughter of our people have so far ceased.” However short-lived, it was an important victory not only for an enlightened version of Reconstruction but also for the beneficial use of the powers of the federal government to promote the general welfare and safety of all Americans, not just some.

As president, Grant appointed a record number of African-Americans to government positions all across the board, including the first black diplomat. Douglass once noted “in one department at Washington I found 249” black appointees, “and many more holding important positions in its service in different parts of the country.” Early in his presidency and at the height of his popularity, Grant had also been a booster of the 15th Amendment, giving former slaves the vote, and many believe his support was key to its ratification by the states, which was far from guaranteed. Grant himself minced no words in describing the magnitude of the amendment’s passage, saying in a message to Congress upon its ratification, “The adoption of the 15th Amendment ... constitutes the most important event that has occurred, since the nation came into life.” He knew the right to vote is the heart of democracy and did not hesitate to defend it, a legacy today’s Supreme Court and Republicans in Washington and across the country should embrace, not abandon.

Chernow shows a fine balance in exposing Grant’s flaws and missteps as president, and the ill-fated turn that Reconstruction took after a promising start, while making it clear that Grant’s contributions after Appomattox were as consequential to the survival of our democracy as any that came before. As Americans continue the struggle to defend justice and equality in our tumultuous and divisive era, we need to know what Grant did when our country’s very existence hung in the balance. If we still believe in forming a more perfect union, his steady and courageous example is more valuable than ever.",President Clinton Looks Back at President Grant,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/books/review/ron-chernow-ulysses-s-grant-biography-bill-clinton.html

The most unnerving thing about Ali Land’s debut novel, GOOD ME BAD ME (Flatiron, $25.99), is that you can trust the word of Annie Thompson, the 15-year-old narrator, because she’s speaking to the mother she loves and misses. The anguished conversation is one-sided because her mother is about to go on trial for killing nine little boys — and Annie is the one who turned her in.

Under her new name, Milly, Annie is in the care of a psychologist, Mike Newmont, and his family, who are none too even-keeled themselves. Mike’s wife, Saskia, is emotionally fragile and his daughter, Phoebe, is a vicious brat. What’s more, Mike is secretly writing a book about Milly. Despite all this, the notion of masquerading as a normal kid is irresistible. If only Milly weren’t so terrified of turning into her mother, so “scared of finding out who and what I might be.”

Milly is intellectually and psychologically miles ahead of the grown-ups who keep underestimating her, but living in her head isn’t easy. When she isn’t analyzing herself for violent tendencies, she’s anxiously denying the guilty secrets that might slip out when she testifies against her mother. In her yearning to be good, she cuts her own flesh “to bleed out the bad.” But there are times when “it feels good to be bad,” and you really don’t want to be around for those times.

Land is a mental health nurse who has worked with traumatized children, and her portrait of Milly has a powerful sense of authenticity. Her excursions into the twisted psyche of Milly’s mother — or, rather, into Milly’s keen memories but conflicted feelings about her mother — are less realistic, but more distressing. The harrowing scene in which they meet in court, with only a screen between them, harks back to a disturbing exchange between Milly and her only friend. After mentioning a story about “a girl who was so scared she prayed to be given the wings of an eagle,” Milly is asked what the girl was so frightened of. Maybe, she thinks, “The person who was telling the story.”

As a wise old teacher notes in John Sandford’s DEEP FREEZE (Putnam, $29), “There is a lot of potential violence in class reunions.” But when someone murders the “Girl Most Likely to Succeed” in Trippton High School’s class of 1992, following a planning session of the 25th class reunion committee, no one suspects the “Funniest Boy in the Class of ’92” of being the killer. “I can’t believe it,” someone insists. “It’s like saying a duck did it.”

Virgil Flowers, the most laid-back agent in the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, arrives in midwinter, when everyone is either ice fishing or having illicit sexual adventures, aided by the naughty toys in the back room of Bernie’s Books, Candles ’n More. While people are happy to tattle on their friends and neighbors, no one will help Virgil find the “outlaw heroine” who’s supporting a lot of poor folks by making pornographic Barbie and Ken dolls.

Scandinavian crime novels don’t get much darker than Jussi Adler-Olsen’s Department Q police procedurals. In William Frost’s translation of THE SCARRED WOMAN (Dutton, $28), the Copenhagen detective Carl Morck and his eccentric colleagues in the cold case division are conducting two investigations, neither of them very interesting, when Rose, their normally efficient colleague, has a breakdown. Although the details of the childhood trauma that caused her crackup are impossibly lurid, Rose proves far more likable than the stock female victims in this noir series. Lest we think Adler-Olsen is getting soft, he also introduces us to Anne-Line Svendsen, a caseworker in the social security office who has developed a seething hatred for “those damn young women who totally cheated society” by drawing benefits they don’t deserve. Unfortunately for her, she commences to attack the most irritating of her clients, Michelle Hansen, at the precise moment when Michelle and another of Anne-Line’s clients are plotting to kill her.

Once upon a time, Peter May began a series of mysteries featuring Enzo Macleod, a forensics expert who took a bet with a Parisian journalist named Roger Raffin that he could use his modern-day skills to solve seven cold cases of homicide, including that of Raffin’s wife. CAST IRON (Quercus, $26.99) is the last book in this series and it ends Macleod’s quest with a flourish. I would have been happier with less flourish and more forensics, which seemed to taper off drastically after the early cases.

Science barely figures in the current book because the victim, Lucie Martin, wasn’t found until her bare bones were discovered in a lake bed that had been exposed during a severe drought. Macleod explores the possibility that Lucie was murdered by a man she met while doing social work with recently released felons. But the harried sleuth has so much personal baggage to wrap up — the vindictive ex-wife, the uncertain paternities, the infidelities, the new girlfriend — that he has little time for a proper investigation.","The Latest in Crime Novels: Bad Mothers, Bad Memories and Bad Sex Toys",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/books/review/ali-land-good-me-bad-me-crime-fiction.html

It’s systemic.”

What to do? After all, this was my health here. As a lifelong recreational athlete and fitness enthusiast, I’d entered my 60s healthy, but eventually – inevitably – my age would catch up with me. Was I going to risk my longevity to avoid hurting my doctor’s feelings? I needed a physician I respected and trusted. Should I stick with the status quo or take a hike?

“Your experience is more common than was the case even 20 years ago,” Dr. Michael Fleming, former president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, told me. “It can be very frustrating to be a patient nowadays. That’s why they’re more inclined to switch doctors than ever before.”

A 2001 study in the Journal of Family Practice showed that one-fifth of patients left their primary care doctors voluntarily over a three-year period. Patient satisfaction with the relationship often predicted loyalty, the research revealed. Indeed, patients with the poorest physician relationship were three times more likely to leave than those with high-quality relationships. Today, those figures might be even higher: With the upheavals in insurance coverage and physicians increasingly available at a pharmacy, urgent care center or via telemedicine, some people no longer even visit their own primary care doctors.

My most recent appointment with my doctor made reaching a decision much easier. For years, he discussed my health with me in his office while typing his observations into an electronic health record on his computer. He would turn sideways to talk with me, then look back at his screen. He typically looked at the computer more than at me, but at least I could see his face.

In my latest visit, that arrangement was no more. Instead, he sat at a computer in his examining room with his back to me. Yes, he literally turned his back on me. I could still hear his voice but now without seeing his face.

“The electronic medical record has turned physicians into data entry technicians,” Dr. Russell Phillips, director of the Center for Primary Care at Harvard Medical School, told me. “It inserts an interference between doctor and patient.” A study last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine painted a picture of this predicament. It showed that while physicians are in the examination room with patients, they spent only 53 percent of their time on face-to-face contact and 37 percent on medical records and other administrative chores.

Clearly I now had to turn my back on my doctor, too. The big question was, how? How do you go about firing your longtime doctor? Does the American Medical Association recommend a protocol? Do you just say, “Your services are no longer required?” Or “I’m sorry, but I’ve decided to take my health in a different direction?” Or “Forgive me, but I need to start seeing someone else?”

“So many patients have no idea about how to approach this struggle, and they feel bad about the idea,” George Blackall, associate professor at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and co-author of “Breaking the Cycle: How to Turn Conflict Into Collaboration When You and Your Patients Disagree,” told me. “You should reach out to talk to your doctor. That’s the key. Make clear how you feel. Say what you need.”

How physicians feel about themselves may actually translate into how patients feel about them. The more satisfaction internists take in practicing medicine the more satisfied their patients are likely to be, a study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine concluded. And the reverse also appears to be true. “Burnout and caregiver fatigue among physicians is a real and growing problem that impacts patients,” a spokesman for the American Medical Association told me.

In Mayo Clinic Proceedings last year, Dr. Tait Shanafelt, director of the Mayo Clinic’s program on physician well-being, said, “Research has shown that more than half of U.S. physicians are experiencing symptoms of burnout, and the rate is increasing.”

As I agonized over my decision, a Facebook friend who also goes to my doctor delivered a surprise: She posted a message saying that he would be retiring soon. So I called his office to verify. Yes, the receptionist told me, he would be retiring next month.

So I was spared having to tell him I was defecting, and I’ll soon be seeing another doctor anyway. Mine quit his job before my health went on me (and possibly before his did, too).

I used it to explore a neighborhood where I used to be a local (Astoria, Queens) to see if it could deliver. The fact that it included a wide assortment of suggestions in a borough not named Manhattan was impressive enough, compared to the other apps I tested, but the recommendations themselves were also spot on.

For example, Astoria’s popular Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden was rightfully featured, but so was SingleCut Brewery, a lesser-known, but worthwhile, beer spot.

Cool Cousin

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings. After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.

The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a “special tip” for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: “Come early because the restaurant’s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.”

You don’t have to sign up to use the app, so you can dig right in and explore — though if you want to use the app offline, you have to pay $1.99 per city.

There’s also an option to “ask locals,” which works like a message board. I asked for Upper East Side restaurant recommendations (it is a neighborhood not represented well on any of the apps) and after a week had yet to get a response.

What’s the appeal of playing the jerk?

It’s just so damn fun. There’s jerks and there’s villains. Villains, I think, are very aware of who they are and what they’re doing and their effect on the world. Jerks tend to think they’re great guys. There’s something really funny about exploring all the things that we think are thoughtful and considerate, but that we actually have no clue how we’re affecting everybody around us. And because I tend to be a Frank Capra person who believes in the essential goodness of humankind, the jerks I play are somehow a little easier to live with. Because somewhere there’s the hope of a better person underneath that just can’t seem to make its way to the surface — and probably never will.

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

The brief statement from Mr. Boyle only raised further questions about why the couple were in Afghanistan when they were abducted. Until Friday, their family had said they were backpacking.

But in his statement, Mr. Boyle said they had been in the country on a mission to help “the most neglected minority group in the world, those ordinary villagers who live deep inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.” He also described himself as a “pilgrim,” and said they had been in a region that government and aid agencies had failed to reach, suggesting that their effort was self-styled.

The Associated Press reported that on the plane from London to Toronto, Ms. Coleman sat in the aisle of the business-class cabin wearing a tan-color head scarf and nodded wordlessly to confirm her identity to a reporter onboard the flight. Their two oldest children sat next to her, while Mr. Boyle sat with their youngest child in his lap.

State Department officials accompanied them on the plane.

President Trump has praised the Pakistanis for their role in freeing the family. “This is a positive moment for our country’s relationship with Pakistan,” he said on Thursday.

During the flight, Mr. Boyle also gave a handwritten statement to The A.P. expressing disagreement with American foreign policy.

“God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination, and to allow that to stagnate, to pursue personal pleasure or comfort while there is still deliberate and organized injustice in the world would be a betrayal of all I believe, and tantamount to sacrilege,” he wrote.

He then nodded to one of the State Department officials and said, according to The A.P., “Their interests are not my interests.”",Canadian Held Hostage in Afghanistan Says Militants Killed His Child,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/world/canada/canadian-american-hostages-daughter.html

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

It was bad. For American soccer fans, Tuesday was a fiasco, a result so frustrating, embarrassing and preventable that it called into question everything we thought we knew about the way the game in this country is run.

What happened Tuesday is that the United States men’s team was knocked out of World Cup qualifying thanks to an almost surreally meek performance against Trinidad and Tobago, previously the worst team in the Concacaf conference for teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean. Needing only a draw to clinch their ticket to Moscow, the Americans politely self-asphyxiated en route to a 2-1 loss.

Christian Pulisic, the 19-year-old who’s currently the 357th anointed savior of American men’s soccer, played pretty well. The rest of the team? Well, I’d say it was like watching a group of vacationing dentists try organized sport for the first time, but there are reasons to fear dentists. Dentists know how to hurt people.

The worst part didn’t come during the match itself, lukewarm drizzle though it was, but after the match, when the leaders of United States soccer delivered their verdicts to the press. How did they, having just overseen the worst debacle in the last generation of their sport, plan to change things to ensure nothing like this would happen again?

“Nothing has to change,” Bruce Arena, the coach of the men’s team, declared.

“You don’t make wholesale changes based on the ball being two inches wide or two inches in,” Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, insisted.

Really? Your goal — the goal of every national soccer federation — is to win the World Cup. Don’t you make wholesale changes based on not making it into the World Cup?

Gulati was referring to the fact that Clint Dempsey had a shot hit the woodwork in the final minutes of the game. If it had gone in, the team would have qualified. So why panic? I might be sympathetic to this argument if I thought being two inches from disqualification were a reasonable goal for the men’s team to aspire to. In fact, had the shot gone in, qualification would only have masked the team’s pitiful state a little longer.

What Arena and Gulati don’t seem to understand is that fans of the United States men’s team have spent years in a state of excruciatingly patient optimism. We’ve worked hard to convince ourselves that each small sign of progress — a Gold Cup win here, a last-second goal there — meant the team was in good hands. That hasn’t always been easy. It often feels as though the national team is permanently on the threshold of a success it never quite reaches, as if it’s built to thrive on medium-size stages but fizzle on large ones.

The kind of progress Gulati seems to value most is corporate, institutional, political. He cares about sponsorships, shoring up organizational foundations. He has done wonders for the United States federation’s standing within soccer’s international body, FIFA. He’s had less success improving quality of play, both at the top of the game and at the youth level, where American men’s teams have missed consecutive Olympics under his watch.

For me, and I think for many American fans, the immortal flub of this qualifying campaign has driven home the fragility of my faith in the team’s path. For a long time I was willing to tell myself that the professionals knew what they were doing. Now I think we’ve given too much trust to leaders who’ve done a better job selling their own competence than demonstrating it.

The World Cup, with its thousand ethical shortcomings forever balanced against its capacity to deliver joy, is already dispiriting in too many ways to justify investing more hope in this brand of pseudo-technocracy.

It’s time for a change. Arena resigned on Friday. Gulati is up for re-election in February. He needs to go as well. The next thing I want to see from United States soccer is a jackhammer, not a news conference.

Mavis Staples, ‘Little Bit’

Mavis Staples has sung for civil rights since the 1960s , and she knows her work isn’t over. “Little Bit” is from her album due Nov. 17, produced and mostly written by Jeff Tweedy of Wilco and titled “If All I Was Was Black.” A lean, unsparing blues guitar riff carries her through “Little Bit,” envisioning young lives lost to deadly force: “Poor kid they caught him/without his license/That ain’t why they shot him/They say he was fighting,” she sings, bitter, tearful and determined. JON PARELES

Beck, ‘Seventh Heaven’

Beck’s new album, “Colors,” flaunts the infinite overdubbing and polishing of state-of-the-art digital recording. Working with a hitmaking producer, Greg Kurstin (Adele, Kelly Clarkson), he makes every track a glossy tour de force, with quick-changing arrangements and ever more encyclopedic pop allusions. “Seventh Heaven” juxtaposes thoughts of euphoric love and disillusionment — “We shoot for the empire/Land in the dust pile” — amid shimmering keyboards, skeins of intertwined guitars and ever more buoyant choruses. The romance in the lyrics doesn’t work out, but the studio is a paradise. J.P.

Major Lazer and DJ Maphorisa (featuring Nasty C, Ice Prince, Patoranking and Jidenna), ‘Particula’

Major Lazer and collaborators from South Africa (DJ Maphorisa, Nasty), Nigeria (Ice Prince, Patoranking) and Wisconsin (Jidenna) have concocted a sleek, amiable global come-on with a one-sentiment-fits-all hook — “I like you girl in particula” — delivered by Ice Prince in the Nigerian version of a Jamaican dancehall growl. The track meshes the 4/4 thump and four-chord cycle of international dance music with the syncopated percussion of South African kwaito and crucially, the lilt and tickle of countermelodies from African guitars. Not international enough? Jidenna goes bilingual: “Can I see your particulars?/I've been screening you like una pelicula.” J.P.

Sam Newsome and Jean-Michel Pilc, ‘Giant Steps’

A soprano saxophonist with a streamlined intensity and a flinty iconoclasm, Mr. Newsome is most often heard these days on his own solo-sax recordings . Here he adds just one more instrument, the piano of Mr. Pilc, who works in splashes of stark color and pushes a centrifugal momentum. “Magic Circle,” their new album, mostly includes reworkings of classic jazz repertory, saxophone and piano circling each other, fleeing comfort and terra firma. John Coltrane’s “Giant Steps” is all about harmony; the melody, now iconic, is really just a top note of each fast-changing chord. But Mr. Newsome and Mr. Pilc treat it as something like a dismembered line, a path of twisty illogic unto itself. It flows over and about the outlines of its harmonic riverbed, and freed of any set rhythm. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Rex Orange County featuring Benny Sings, ‘Loving Is Easy’

Rex Orange County’s lo-fi lounge music is soothing, sunny and slightly off-kilter. The British singer-songwriter worked with a kindred spirit, Tyler, the Creator, on his most recent album, but his own music has a meandering charm. “Loving Is Easy,” his latest single, is less barbed than his earlier songs — where he was once dubious about the world around him, here he finally opens up to its possibilities. JON CARAMANICA

Mallrat, ‘Better’

The 19-year-old songwriter from Brisbane who calls herself Mallrat has a sleepy delivery and a knack for singsong melodies that grow hypnotically familiar. “Better” seems to be about ephemeral comforts: “Everyone’s alive so everything’s all right but/Maybe when the summer ends I’ll drift away from all my friends.” While Mallrat circles through her melodies, the ingenious track finds endless variety in three chords, morphing imperceptibly from simple guitar strumming to three-chord rock to quasi-orchestral splendor; Mallrat isn’t as nonchalant as her voice might seem. J.P.

Sufjan Stevens, ‘Wallowa Lake Monster’

Sufjan Stevens stayed quiet and folky throughout “Carrie & Lowell,” his 2015 album about the death of his mother. On Nov. 24, he will release “The Greatest Gift,” a collection of demos and outtakes recorded in the same sessions, including this previously unreleased song. “Wallowa Lake Monster” starts out delicately, with wispy but restless picking behind Stevens’s whispery voice; he asks: “Have you heard the story of my mother’s fate?/She left us in Detroit in the rain.” But as he connects his mother to larger forces of Nature and myth, the music swells with electronics, crescendos of orchestral brass and female voices that eventually take over the track for wordless rapture and mourning. It might have upended the album, but it stands on its own. J.P.

Kailee Morgue, ‘Medusa’

Kailee Morgue’s debut single, “Medusa,” is an eerie, floating incantation that’s not as skeletal as it seems. A plinking six-note pattern recurs throughout the song, bolstered by sparse percussion and a few bass notes; harplike arpeggios and cooing voices waft in from above. Ms. Morgue’s breathy voice sketches an encounter with Medusa; in the moment she’s turned to stone, she’s “chosen” to join “ghosts of past heroes” and “fight until you’re hopeless,” and it sounds like bliss. J.P.

Kane Brown, ‘What’s Mine Is Yours’

A tender, determined song about romantic dedication from the promising young country singer Kane Brown, drawn from the recently released deluxe edition of his major label debut album. Mr. Brown isn’t a vocal powerhouse, but his voice is lithe, and he delivers with real shading here. This song cribs part of its melody from Toni Braxton’s “Un-break My Heart,” but Mr. Brown strips out the pomp and imbues it with modesty. J.C.

Kadawa featuring Adam O’Farrill, ‘Shades of a Happy Ending’

A guitar-bass-drums trio of young Israeli-American musicians, Kadawa has just released its first album, a self-titled effort featuring 12 original compositions. The sound is about joy and force in equal measure, full of hummable melodies and moments of proud combustion. On “Shades of a Happy Ending,” the trio is joined by the young trumpet lion Adam O’Farrill and the trombonist Matt Bumgardner. What begins as a giddy shuffle bursts into splayed reverie, the horns tangling and jousting with Tal Yahalom’s guitar, before the melancholy melody takes hold once again.

11A: Do you get confused as to whether the idiom is “TOE the line” or “tow the line”? A good way to remember that is to visualize a track event where athletes are required to put their toes on the starting line.

17A: I know what you’re thinking, and no, the answer is not the president of the United States. Note that the word “Sun” in the clue “One might stare at the Sun” is capitalized, which means that it’s a proper name. The answer is BALTIMOREAN, because someone from Baltimore is likely to “stare at,” or read, The Baltimore Sun newspaper. And while you are staring, please make sure to read John McIntyre’s blog “You Don’t Say,” an educational and often funny treatise on language, usage and journalism.

40A: When you have made and solved a lot of crossword puzzles, your brain tends to make interesting associations with answers that can be hard to break. For example, as soon as I see the name “Whitney,” I immediately assume that the answer is going to be ELI, the cotton gin inventor. But here’s no Eli Shasta as far as I know, so that’s not right. Today, the abbreviated answer is MTNS.

63A/24D: Wordplay would like to welcome HIS and HER Royal Highnesses to The New York Times.

4D: I’m all for guessing at an answer, but here’s what can happen when you try anticipate an entry based on its letter pattern: I had G_TSBY and was positive that the answer was going to be GATSBY, as in “The Great Gatsby.” That messed me up in the northwest for a while, until I realized that 14A was IVIED, which made 4d the still great GETSBY. Sorry, I meant GETS BY.

10D: Were you pojnted in the wrong direction by the “<—” clue? All you had to do is look at the number of the clue. The answer, like the clue, is TEN.

11D: I was surprised that THINK SMALL just made its debut today. While it’s clued today as “Set one’s sights low,” I always think of the famous Volkswagen advertising campaign from their agency Doyle Dane Bernbach. The campaign launched in 1959, but since I spent some time in the ad agencies of New York City in another lifetime, it’s a campaign I know well because of its effectiveness.

32D: For the most part, you are going to see PETRI clued as a vessel for growing bacteria, or its bacteriologist namesake, Julius PETRI. Alexandra Petri, the hilarious ComPost opinion writer at The Washington Post, has become very popular in recent years, and I hope to see her as an alternative clue soon.

46D: ‘The STRATA’ would actually make a really good name for a rock band, so it makes sense to me that the misdirected clue “Rock bands?” has that as its answer.

the look Looking for Surprises in Senegal On his first visit to Senegal, Jake Michaels was inspired by the “curated” looks of many of his subjects. As he took portraits on streets, in cafes and at beachside nightclubs, he sought to make the people shine, while also spotlighting the action in the background.

In July, Jake Michaels spent a week in Senegal, documenting contemporary and traditional styles. He was traveling with his girlfriend, Juliette Ballay, and Francine Awa Pipien, who helped them get to know people and places around Dakar, the capital.

As a photographer based in Los Angeles, Mr. Michaels knows the intricacies of his own city well, but he gets excited by the novelty of a new place. “One of the best things in life is being surprised, and this was one big surprise after another,” he said.

He met Milcos, above, a designer and the founder of the brand Nio Far , on a rainy day in the Grand Yoff neighborhood of Dakar.

Spontaneity is key for Mr. Michaels. When he took this photo, he wanted to capture the action in the background — the little girl peeking around the doorway. It helped give the photo context, he said, “and I think that that is just as valuable as the person in the photograph.”

Khadija Aisha Ba is a fashion designer and shop owner in Dakar. For her label, L’Artisane , she takes inspiration from the past, channeling her grandfather’s style.

“She puts a couple of new elements in fashion into her dress, but they’re not flashy things,” Mr. Michaels said. “It’s interesting seeing her blend the old and the new.”

This photo was taken in St.-Louis, a port city on the Senegal River, north of Dakar. The city was once the French colonial capital. “You can see the skeleton of the colonization,” Mr. Michaels said.

This scene reminded him of a movie set, and he was attracted to the color palette. “The blue dress jumps off the page in comparison,” he said.

St.-Louis, which is on the border with Mauritania, is just south of the Sahara. “When you go north of there, it just becomes desert,” Mr. Michaels said.

Saliou, above, is a member of the Baye Fall, followers of the Sufi Muslim brotherhood called the Mourid. They prize spirituality over material goods, Ms. Pipien said. Traditionally they have been known to wear clothing made from other pieces of fabric, creating “a patchwork we call ‘njaxass’ in Wolof,” she said.

Yoro sells gold jewelry at a market where people buy clothing and accessories in the Plateau neighborhood of Dakar. “The soccer jersey seemed to be a really present style of dress with a lot of the younger males in Senegal,” Mr. Michaels said.

Yoro was more than happy to pose. “He’s like, ‘Go right away, take my picture,’” Mr. Michaels said.

“We had gone down to the beach area over by the Mosque of the Divinity ,” Mr. Michaels recalled, describing this scene. “It’s kind of off the road, and it’s a beautiful mosque on the beach.”

As he and his group watched, three children started walking out to the ocean to wash two baby goats. “What you can’t see in this image is the mother goat trying to bite one guy the whole time,” he said.

“I wanted to see what a typical Senegalese photo shoot was like,” Mr. Michaels said. “It was interesting to see them going through the same process as the people I know who work with fashion labels.”

Here, Olivia Nd, a founder of the Instagram account @dakarlives , took a break between shots. She was modeling contemporary Senegalese designs.

Mr. Michaels was drawn to her fingertips, which are adorned with henna. Few young women in Senegal wear henna these days, Ms. Pipien said. “It’s her way of paying homage to this old tradition she used to see her grandmothers doing,” she said.

“Olivia is inspired by the old tradition,” she said, “and she really likes to rearrange it.”

This man, “a friend of a friend of a friend,” showed up while Mr. Michaels was on the campus of Cheikh Anta Diop University.

The velvet hat, he said, seemed to represent his happy-go-lucky mood. “Through this heat, he’s like: ‘I’ve got to wear this crushed velvet hat. This is who I am.’”

Toward the end of his trip, Mr. Michaels went to Sea Plaza, a mall in Dakar, after sunset. “These four skateboard kids came in and started skating,” he said.

The boys, who wore headphones, spoke English to one another. English, Mr. Michaels learned, is part of the skate culture in Dakar.

This young man worked at the mall and had taken a break to join his friends. “He was embarrassed because he’s not wearing skate shoes,” Mr. Michaels said.

Mr. Michaels photographed Nafissatou Diop, a screenwriter, at an open-air nightclub near the beach in Dakar. When he took this photo, it was only the beginning of the night. “The party starts at midnight and goes till the sunrise,” he said.

He wanted to capture Ms. Diop in this quiet moment — “the calm before the storm.” But in the end, he said: “It was such a different experience than I’ve had in any nightclub anywhere. Everyone there is having fun, and nobody’s judging anybody.”

Paco, a painter, lives in St.-Louis. When Ms. Ballay asked Paco if they could take his photo, he took them to his home, where he showed them his work.

“You can tell that is a traditional colonial courtyard,” Mr. Michaels said. “I thought it was interesting to see the shell of the past with the bright red outfit.”

He considered Paco’s handmade wardrobe to be the most “relaxed” of all of the looks he saw in Senegal, sneakers included.

Fatou, a student, on Route de la Corniche, a seaside road in Dakar, was pleased when Mr. Michaels asked to photograph her.

“The smile on her face when we said that we liked her style — her whole day was worth it,” he said. “She said it was the best thing she’d hear all day.”

Mr. Michaels and his group were in a quiet part of the Yoff neighborhood of Dakar when they spotted Racine Doye, a shaman, above. They ended up following him into his home, the concrete skeleton of an unfinished development.

Inside, it was “about 120 degrees,” Mr. Michaels recalled. Mr. Doye, who is part of the Lébou ethnic group, showed them a tarp covering some rocks that he’d used in a ceremony.

“He told me, ‘We just did an exorcism,’” Mr. Michaels said.

They didn’t spend a long time together, but Mr. Doye seemed happy to tell his stories. “I feel the energy from that place,” Mr. Michaels said.

Mr. Michaels noticed this woman early one morning. He didn’t take many street photographs in Dakar — most of the photos are portraits of people he spoke to — but he couldn’t resist capturing this scene.

“She’s listening to people’s conversations when she’s washing the window before the store, Salsa, opens,” he said.

To him, the image feels timeless. “I like the idea of having photographs that don’t have to be in a certain place,” he said.

This is another photo Mr. Michaels took from afar, in this case while he was eating lunch in a cafe.

“The people shine” in images like this one, he said. “They’re who I’m here to photograph.”

The trust, which was chaired by Mr. Smyth, was a part of a network of camps inspired by the Anglican clergyman E. J. H. Nash, who recruited boys from Britain’s elite schools in the hope of evangelizing them.

The report accused Mr. Smyth of subjecting at least 22 teenage boys to savage beatings in his garden shed, with the intent of purging them of perceived sins such as masturbation and pride.

Mr. Smyth, 75, who is keeping a low profile in South Africa, told Channel 4 news that the claims were ""nonsense"" and declined to comment further.

Although Mr. Ruston concluded that a criminal act had been committed, the trust decided not to refer Mr. Smyth to the authorities. Instead, he was banished first to Zimbabwe in 1982 and ultimately made his way to South Africa, where he faced new accusations in both countries about mistreated boys.

The report was filed away, and members of the trust, including Mr. Ruston, went on to assume influential positions within the Church of England and vowed, one trust insider said, never to speak about the matter publicly.

For decades, the victims suffered in silence, too ashamed to go public with their stories. All the while, they say, the main concern of officials was to protect the reputation of the trust rather than helping them.

“If this came out earlier, Iwerne would have been finished and its members wouldn’t have been able to rise up the ranks of the church in the way that they have,” said one of the victims, Andy Morse, who added that he attempted suicide twice because of the trauma he said was inflicted by Mr. Smyth.

Archbishop Welby, the principal religious leader in the Church of England, says it was not until one of the victims reached out to the church in 2013 that he learned of the accusations against Mr. Smyth. He said he was working in Paris between 1978 and 1982, when the alleged abuse was taking place, and had not kept in touch with his colleagues at Iwerne.

Although no one has produced proof that Archbishop Welby knew about the beatings at the time they were occurring, his account has been contested by several victims and former Iwerne members.

As an officer of the trust, they say, Mr. Welby was close to other senior members of the group and almost certainly would have been briefed on Mr. Smyth’s absence and the reason behind it when he came back to visit Iwerne after he graduated from Cambridge University.

While Archbishop Welby claims to have fallen out of touch with Iwerne members during his years abroad, an Iwerne event program shows that he came back to give a talk at the trust's library in 1979.

Moreover, the archbishop and the investigator, Mr. Ruston, were extremely close, as friends and colleagues, the victims and some church figures say, adding that it strains credulity to think that they would not have discussed the matter.

Mr. Ruston was the vicar of the Round Church in Cambridge, England, from the 1960s to the early 1980s, and the archbishop lodged there during his final year at the university in 1978.

Reflecting on their relationship in a magazine article in 2013, Archbishop Welby wrote that, “Mark was someone whose personal holiness shone out in every aspect of his life. We prayed together regularly, talked together a great deal, and I was continually inspired by him to seek to follow Christ more closely.”

A Church of England spokeswoman confirmed that Mr. Welby had paid for lodgings at Mr. Ruston’s rectory during his time as a student at Cambridge University, but denied that they had been close friends or that they had remained in contact after he left for Paris in 1978.

“He was certainly not aware of any report or the allegations surrounding it,” the spokeswoman said.

Yet a senior Church of England figure who has questioned the archbishop's account said that many people had heard about the accusations against Mr. Smyth at the time, but they knew to keep it “hushed up.” He withheld his identity because he was not permitted to comment on the issue while the police investigation was ongoing.

""It was a different time then,” he said. “Only recently has the church realized how crippling that silence was for the victims involved.”

The Iwerne insider, who was friends with Mr. Ruston during those years, said that all the senior members of the trust, including officers like Archbishop Welby, had been made aware of the allegations against Mr. Smyth, even those who had been abroad.

Another church figure, Alan Wilson, a Church of England bishop who is friends with former Iwerne members, said that he found it hard to believe the archbishop’s denials.

“I have no evidence, but I haven’t met a single Iwerne person who thinks it’s credible that Justin Welby didn’t know that Smyth had left the country under a cloud connected to his behavior toward boys who had been on Iwerne camps,” he said.

“Smyth was the chair of the trust, and just the fact that he suddenly dropped his law career and went to Africa would have raised questions,” he added.

The matter lay dormant until 2012, when Graham, one of the victims who withheld his last name to protect his privacy, came forward, demanding that the church provide him counseling.

“This whole affair has, I believe, cast a deep shadow over many aspects of my life, affecting my ability to do many things,” he wrote in an email to a member of the Church of England. “I have not worked now for 20 years. I want you, within the church, your circle, your elders, to find someone.”

In addition to counseling, he said, he was looking for justice, acknowledgment and assurance that Mr. Smyth was not committing the same abuses in South Africa that he is accused of in Britain.

It took six months before he received a response, which said there “might be someone who could help.” It was another 10 months before he received another email saying that the person they had in mind was “too busy.”

Graham said it was only after he accused Archbishop Welby of knowing about the abuse and threatened to go to the news media with his claims that he was assigned a therapist.

In response to his concerns over Mr. Smyth’s activities in Cape Town, Graham was told that the Bishop of Ely in Britain had written to the relevant bishop in South Africa but had not received a reply.

“I know this will be of no comfort to you and I’m sorry I have nothing more positive to say,” he was told. “I am hopeful that you may at last find a way to move on from that dreadful experience, in time.”

Many of the victims have asked why the archbishop did not reach out to them immediately after he says he learned of the abuse.

“The silence has been deafening,” Mr. Morse said.

While the victims acknowledge that the church has made progress in its understanding of abuse in recent years, they have labeled Archbishop Welby an “observer,” a term that denotes a person who knew about the abuse but did not report it appropriately.

After more than seven months of silence, Mr. Morse received a phone call from Mr. Welby's office last month asking what could be done for him and other Smyth victims.

Mr. Morse requested that the archbishop give a public interview on the matter and allow the victims to present him with evidence that shows the Titus Trust, which took over from the Iwerne Trust in 1997, lied to the police when the allegations were reported in 2013.

Return of the ’80s! Synth-Pop Bands Stage a Middle-Aged Comeback

Image Clockwise from top left, videos from Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark; Erasure; Depeche Mode; and Alphaville. Credit

“Dynasty” is back on television. “Blade Runner” is in theaters. And all your favorite synth pop bands from the 1980s, including Depeche Mode and New Order, have new albums.

As Generation X moves into wistful middle age, the new-wave hit makers of the MTV V.J. era are back and touring. Here are some new long-playing discs (also available for streaming!) that recall a time when all it took was an angular haircut and a Yamaha DX7 to rule the world.

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark

New release: “The Punishment of Luxury,” released Sept. 1, is the band’s 13th album (and its third since reforming in 2006). The 12-track album remains true to the band’s signature robo-pop sound and offers a rumination and indictment on have-it-all consumerism.

Synth Classics : “ Enola Gay ” (1980); “So In Love” (1985)

Liner notes: With their knack for infectious hooks, the founding members Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys have been called “the Lennon-McCartney of synth pop.” The hit single “ If You Leave ” is forever burned into Gen X consciousness, thanks to John Hughes’s Brat Pack film “Pretty in Pink.”

’80s fashion faux pas : Kraftwerk for the masses (skinny ties and black turtlenecks).

Reviews: “As returns to form go, this is like Roger Federer winning this year’s Wimbledon. No, forget that — it’s like John McEnroe or Bjorn Borg winning this year’s Wimbledon.” — God Is in the TV , a music fanzine based in Britain.

New Order

New release : Following its highly regarded 2015 album , “Music Complete,” the band released a live album in May, “NOMC15” on vinyl, CD and for download , featuring new tracks and ’80s classics. It comes after a bitter breakup with the original bassist, Peter Hook .

Synth classics : “Blue Monday” (1983), “Bizarre Love Triangle” (1986).

Liner notes: Formed by the surviving members of the seminal post-punk band Joy Division after the lead singer Ian Curtis’s suicide, this Manchester quartet fused angsty guitar rock, electronica and a little bit of disco to become one of the most influential bands of the last three decades.

’80s fashion faux pas: Schoolboy gone to seed (messy haircuts, rumpled button-down shirts).

Reviews: “Not the best way to experience New Order, but it nevertheless doesn’t take anything away from their timeless studio albums or their memorable live shows face to face.” — Under the Radar , an indie music magazine based in Virginia.

Depeche Mode

New release : Like other ’80s bands trying to navigate the Brexit and Trump era, Depeche Mode has gotten ever more woke. The band’s 14th studio album, “ Spirit ,” has fiery anthems like “Where’s the Revolution” and “ Going Backwards .”

Synth classics: “Just Can’t Get Enough” (1981), “Personal Jesus” (1989)



Liner notes : Depeche Mode turned synth pop into stadium rock with its 1988 show at the Rose Bowl that drew 65,000 people. It has been in a nonstop comeback in the three decades since. Currently packing arenas on a world tour, Depeche Mode sold out two shows at Madison Square Garden last month.

’80s fashion faux pas : Transylvania Leather Bar (goatees, slicked-back hair, black leather).

Reviews : “The music moves away from the club dance floor; it moves in six beats rather than four. And the lyrics are as bluntly political as old Depeche Mode songs like ‘New Dress,’ openly confronting a new propaganda regime.” — The New York Times .

Erasure

New release : “ World Be Gone,” the band’s 17th, was released in May and offers a more brooding Erasure, trading the disco frothiness for weighty social commentary on topics like political disenfranchisement on tracks like “Oh What a World.”

Synth classics: “Chains of Love ,” “A Little Respect” (1988)

Liner notes: After helping start Depeche Mode and Yaz, Vince Clarke put an ad in Melody Maker in 1985 for a singer. That led him to Andy Bell; the two spawned dozens of hits that became dance club staples and went on to sell more than 25 million albums .

’80s fashion faux pas: Glam goes electronic ( gold lamé , thigh-high boots ).

Reviews: “Whether you like Erasure’s 17th studio album will depend on how you feel about facing the world, in its current state, in the mirror.

Alphaville

New Release : Strange Attractor , the band’s first in seven years (and only its second in 20 years) was released in April, and goes beyond the band’s synthpop DNA to dabble in funk, industrial, and rockabilly. Marian Gold’s voice still sounds ethereal on haunting songs like “A Handful of Darkness.”

Synth classics: “Big in Japan ,” “Forever Young” (1984).

Liner notes : Along with Nena and Falco , this German outfit brought a Teutonic moodiness to the Day-Glo MTV era. Alphaville crossed over, however unintentionally, to a new generation when Jay-Z reinvented one of its biggest hits as “Young Forever” on his 2009 album, “The Blueprint 3.”

’80s fashion faux pas : Star Trek: Die Nächste Generation (military-style jumpsuits channeling the 23rd century).

Reviews : “Ultimately, ‘Strange Attractor’ is a take-it-or-leave-it Gold moment. After all, for an artist who has been operating with an array of sonispheric colors and hues for thirty-five years now, there is really nothing more to defy. Gold is simply making music the way he feels like it.” — Cryptic Rock , apparently your go-to site for music and horror coverage.

It looked like it had emerged from an ancient era, when the Mississippi River basin held great and wondrous animals – like the mastodons whose skeletons are still found everywhere.","That is why it felt especially cathartic to drive along the Mississippi’s wide, lazy expanse the next morning and pass the green pilot wheel sign in the Quad Cities indicating the Great River Road. Had it just been the two of us, Nancy and I might have mused over what it all meant – the arc of our marriage seen through the prism of the river. But our youngest, Sylvie, was annoyed at being in her car seat, so we rushed to our first stop, Arsenal Island, the largest island on the Mississippi.

Our guide during the entire trip was a surprisingly useful – and free – foldout map of the Great River Road, published by the Mississippi River Parkway Commission. It identified interpretive centers connected to the byway in each state along the river. These were a mix of museums, historic sites, nature centers and other attractions. Iowa was an overachiever with 16. We chose to stop at the places that interested us the most, and we were never disappointed.

On this first stop, though, the map probably should have indicated that the blandly named Mississippi River Visitor Center Lock and Dam 15 was within a heavily guarded military base. Arsenal Island is headquarters of the First Army and a weapons manufacturing facility that dates back to the Spanish-American War. To gain access, we had to talk to an armed security guard standing behind bulletproof glass, get our picture taken, and undergo an instant background check.

It was worth it. At the visitor center, we watched the lock at work, lowering boats from one portion of the river to the next. We learned that the first bridge to span the Mississippi was built on the island. Completed in April 1856, it was destroyed soon after, rammed by the steamboat Effie Afton. Abraham Lincoln defended the bridge company in a legal case that followed, a trial that elevated him to national prominence.

From the visitor center, we walked past the sole remaining stone pillar from that first bridge, and then stopped to throw rocks and sticks into the water. Our children sat on the generous, bowing limb of a shoreline oak tree and reveled in their climbing abilities. We were totally alone. It felt like something out of Mark Twain’s childhood.

Arsenal Island, like other subsequent stops along the Great River Road, lacked tourists but held many layers of history. Originally the site of a wooden fort that extended American control into the upper Mississippi, it also contained a Confederate cemetery, a National Cemetery, a U.S. Army museum, and 19th-century stone buildings that give the base the feel of a college campus.

We could have stayed there for a while, but the Quad Cities were only 160 miles west of Chicago, and we had a lot more of the Mississippi River to see. Over the next two days, we wandered down through Iowa and Missouri and the southern tip of Illinois, where the river’s unmolested banks were marked by transport and industry. Sometimes the Great River Road ran within a stone’s throw of the Mississippi. However, when the road swerved away, I could always find the river again by searching for the cooling towers of factories that lined the banks. Some of the factories looked abandoned, others were grimy with work. They processed corn, phosphate, meat, stone and sand, the base materials of our world.

The wild Mississippi was nonetheless easy to find. Hawks flew everywhere, over fields just beginning to blossom, over forests and water. My son asked if they were playing tag. We stopped at little river towns and threw more rocks into the river. As we drove further south, the budding trees looked fuzzy and newly born.

Sometimes traveling is filled with annoyances – missing the turn off a highway or negotiating between three children and only two pretzel sticks. But other moments are so unexpectedly profound that they make the entire trip worthwhile. We had one of those in Southern Illinois.

Our Great River Road map led us to Fort de Chartres, a mostly reconstructed French fort that dates back to the 18th century, when the French claimed sovereignty over large portions of the Mississippi River basin. As we neared the site, I realized that the markings on the road had disappeared. It was nothing more than a ribbon of asphalt. Insects rose thickly from the fields and we opened the windows to let in the afternoon sun. Everything in this little corner of the world seemed happy.

The parking lot at Fort de Chartres was nearly empty. Acres of luminescent grass surrounded us, dotted by tall cottonwood trees. An ancient playground set, rust-streaked but still functional, tantalized our children. I climbed the levee that stands between the fort and the Mississippi’s floodplains. On the other side, an abandoned mailbox and driveway lay under several feet of water.

Walking back, I approached three people dressed in French colonial attire. One of them was a middle-aged woman so perfectly outfitted that I was momentarily surprised that she spoke English. They were members of “Les Amis du Fort de Chartres,” a volunteer organization dedicated to the upkeep of the fort. She showed me around – the small but excellent museum, and an intact powder magazine, the oldest structure in Illinois. Afterward, my 6-year-old daughter spent a half-hour trying to pet suspicious cats. As I watched her, my mind flashed back to a memory so old it seemed more like a dream. I was the child searching for cats, and my father was watching me, grinning happily, just like I was grinning at my daughter.

We left Fort de Chartres and passed an old cemetery with a memorial that read, “Here lie buried the remains of Michigamea Indians, early French adventurers, black slaves, victims of wars, massacres, floods and plagues.” We got lost afterward, and drove along a tiny road built on top of the levees. In the distance, something sat in the middle of the road. I slowed down and stopped nearby.

Nancy ran to check it out, followed by our children. It was a huge snapping turtle, its shell covered with a mix of mud and dried prairie grass. It looked like it had emerged from an ancient era, when the Mississippi River basin held great and wondrous animals – like the mastodons whose skeletons are still found everywhere. Another car hurtled by and almost hit the turtle. Quickly, we lifted it into the grass.

The levee road ended at the Mississippi River, next to a man fishing and a faded sign indicating that the area used to be the landing point of a ferry. Our car and phone GPS gave us conflicting instructions, but it didn’t matter. We were in no rush for the moment to pass. With the windows still open, we drove into the setting sun.

We kept heading south, through the boot of Missouri on the way to Memphis. By design, we stayed on the western side of the river, far away from Dyersburg and the site of our honeymoon crash.

In Memphis, the midway point of our trip, we stayed at the Peabody Hotel, where our children spent nearly two days splashing in the pool and watching the hotel’s famous duck residents. Finally, we set off for the town of Helena, Ark., to visit the Delta Cultural Center. It turned out to be another excellent museum that highlighted the music of the delta as a response to slavery. There were a few exhibits for children, but mainly they loved listening to recordings of gospel and blues musicians.

Leaving town, we visited Helena River Park and walked along a wooden pier that soared through trees and stopped at the river’s edge. The muddy water ran fast. Everything from twigs to branches the size of trees floated by. Dozens of birds sat in the treetops and chattered loudly to each other. It was around here that the Mississippi started to expand into the land around it. The Great River Road tiptoed around countless oxbow lakes, formed when the river meanders elsewhere and leaves behind trapped water.",Along the Mississippi,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/travel/along-the-mississippi.html

She encouraged me to be myself in audition rooms, and I followed my mother’s strong example to not put up with anyone calling me “baby” or demanding hugs on set. I was always aware that I was out of step with the expected norm for girls and women in Hollywood.

I eventually left the business when I was 19 to pursue a doctorate in neuroscience at the University of California, Los Angeles. I craved being around people who valued me more for what was inside my brain than what was inside my bra. After 12 years away from Hollywood, I returned to acting, largely because I had no health insurance and missed performing and making people laugh.

As a “nontraditional”-looking woman, I came back to an industry that had me auditioning for the “frumpy friend” or the “zaftig secretary,” though I eventually landed a role that has earned me four Emmy nominations. Is it a surprise that I play an androgynous, awkward, late bloomer?

I am grateful to bring Amy Farrah Fowler to life on the No. 1 sitcom in America. I am honored to depict a feminist who speaks her mind, who loves science and her friends and who sometimes wishes she were the hot girl.

I can relate. I’ve wished that, too.

And yet I have also experienced the upside of not being a “perfect ten.” As a proud feminist with little desire to diet, get plastic surgery or hire a personal trainer, I have almost no personal experience with men asking me to meetings in their hotel rooms. Those of us in Hollywood who don’t represent an impossible standard of beauty have the “luxury” of being overlooked and, in many cases, ignored by men in power unless we can make them money.

I still make choices every day as a 41-year-old actress that I think of as self-protecting and wise. I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with. I dress modestly. I don’t act flirtatiously with men as a policy.

I am entirely aware that these types of choices might feel oppressive to many young feminists. Women should be able to wear whatever they want. They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want. Why are we the ones who have to police our behavior?

In a perfect world, women should be free to act however they want. But our world isn’t perfect. Nothing — absolutely nothing — excuses men for assaulting or abusing women. But we can’t be naïve about the culture we live in.

I believe that we can change our culture, but it won’t be something that happens overnight. We live in a society that has treated women as disposable playmates for far longer than Mr. Weinstein has been meeting ingénues in luxury hotel rooms.

One major bright spot: We are seeing more women taking on prominent roles behind the camera. Women like Jenji Kohan and Jill Soloway are showing the kinds of female characters on their shows that we all know in real life but never got to see on TV. And more women and men are waking up to the fact that it is on us all to sound the alarm on unacceptable behavior.

In the meantime, I plan to continue to work hard to encourage young women to cultivate the parts of themselves that may not garner them money and fame. If you are beautiful and sexy, terrific. But having others celebrate your physical beauty is not the way to lead a meaningful life.

And if — like me — you’re not a perfect 10, know that there are people out there who will find you stunning, irresistible and worthy of attention, respect and love.

At eight weeks old, they are two feet from nose to tail and must weigh seven or eight pounds. They growl and snap over possession of a much-chewed piece of deer skin. They lick my face like I’m a long-lost friend, or a newfound toy. They are just like dogs, but not quite. They are wolves.

When they are full-grown at around 100 pounds, their jaws will be strong enough to crack moose bones. But because these wolves have been around humans since they were blind, deaf and unable to stand, they will still allow people to be near them, to do veterinary exams, to scratch them behind the ears — if all goes well.

Yet even the humans who raised them must take precautions. If one of the people who has bottle-fed and mothered the wolves practically since birth is injured or feels sick, she won’t enter their pen to prevent a predatory reaction. No one will run to make one of these wolves chase him for fun. No one will pretend to chase the wolf. Every experienced wolf caretaker will stay alert. Because if there’s one thing all wolf and dog specialists I’ve talked to over the years agree on, it is this: No matter how you raise a wolf, you can’t turn it into a dog.

In non-theme news, I really liked Mr. Mahnken’s fill, which I’m told was a collaboration between the puzzle maker and the editors. Any puzzle that can debut both BROWNIE MIX and SONIC YOUTH is O.K. by me, and I GOT NEXT and DARE I SAY next to each other was a lot of fun.

Tricky Clues

10A: It’s midweek, so read those clues carefully. “It’s found by the radius” sounds like it might be a math question, but it’s not; what other kind of “radius” exists? The radius we’re looking for today is a bone in the forearm. It is parallel to the ulna, a fabulous piece of osteocrosswordese (Yes, I made that up).

15A: A clue like “Brought home” evokes the childhood habit some of us might have had for bringing home stray animals and begging our parents to let us keep them. Not me, of course. But some of us. In a midweek puzzle, however, tricks are afoot, and today the clue is referring to how much money you’ve EARNED.

30A: #TIL the word MANUMIT, and it’s very interesting. To manumit is not merely to SET FREE, but to set someone free from slavery. It’s derived from the Latin manus, or hand, and means to “set forth from one’s hand,” or release from control.

2D: I had REFILL before REFUEL.

26D: “Glam rock?” is some nifty misdirection. You were thinking of a bunch of longhaired, bespangled musicians in heavy eyeliner, weren’t you? Not today. Another type of glamorous rock would be a GEM.

Let’s say hello to Evan Manhken:

Constructor Notes

I’m 20 years old, a junior at Brandeis University, majoring in Chemistry and American Studies. I started writing crosswords my freshman year of college. My school newspaper, the Justice, was using some very underwhelming syndicated crosswords, and I said to myself, “I could write better crosswords than that!” I couldn’t. At least, not at first. I still shudder to think of some of my very early crosswords. But, as I got more and more practice, I started to get decent at it. I continue to write a crossword for them each week. But when I write what I think is a really good puzzle, I send it off to The Times instead. This time, it seems Will agreed with me, and I got in. Not without a number of revisions beforehand, though. It’s a real honor to be in The New York Times for the first time, and I hope it won’t be the last! As for this puzzle’s construction, I don’t have all that much to say about it. The idea had been rattling around in my brain for a while before I got around to making it. I ended up brainstorming by thinking of all the spatial words I could muster, seeing which ones had phrases associated with them, and then seeing what I could come up with for words that fit those phrases. BENEATH ME was by far the answer I was most pleased with. I really learned a lot from the revision process, but I know I’ve got a lot left to learn about making crosswords.

Welcome to the party, Mr. Mahnken. I hope we get to see more from you soon, and 100 percent on your debut.

Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

So what’s the case for supporting decertification?

The architects of the nuclear deal make three dubious claims on its behalf. They say it concerns Iran’s nuclear dossier alone, and does not prevent us from thwarting Tehran’s regional bids in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza or the Gulf. They claim the deal is working because Iran is abiding by its terms, as certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

And they add that since the agreement permanently enjoins the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons, the United States maintains the military option to stop them from doing so.

Yet Iran’s regional behavior has become worse since the nuclear deal came into effect, not least because it provided the regime with a huge new income stream — $10 billion in cash and gold in 2016 alone, plus more than $100 billion in additional sanctions relief — to fund its work. Tehran also operates on the assumption, well justified during the Obama years, that the United States would not risk the nuclear deal for the sake of rolling back Iranian gains in Syria and elsewhere.

As for the point that the Iranians are generally (if not quite entirely) honoring their end of the bargain — why shouldn’t they? “Iran doesn’t want a bomb today,” one senior Israeli official told me. “It wants a bomb tomorrow.” That is, it wants a robust nuclear base that puts it within a screw’s twist of a sizable nuclear arsenal without the economic and security risks of actual possession.

And if it does choose to go for a bomb once the agreement has run its course, our military options will be slight. If we couldn’t prevent Pakistan or North Korea from going nuclear in the 1990s, why should we think we’ll be able to stop Iran in the nick of time?

My critics will claim that a distant prospect of a nuclear Iran is still vastly preferable to an exit from the deal that allows Iran to bring its centrifuges out of storage and start spinning its way to a bomb once again, this time without the monitoring of United Nations inspectors.

Maybe. But Iran still wants the economic benefits of the deal — benefits Washington alone can bestow through waivers, permits, relief from secondary sanctions and control over dollar transactions. The American Goliath needn’t be helpless against a Middle Eastern state with a gross domestic product only slightly larger than that of metropolitan Atlanta.

We are living through a nuclear nightmare on the Korean Peninsula after more than two decades of optimistic diplomacy. That’s a fate we ought to do everything possible to avoid with Iran. As Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies points out, “decertification isn’t a sufficient condition to break the paralysis of our Iran policy, but it is a necessary one.”

Then there was the Ad Council, the same industry organization that turned Smokey Bear into a cultural icon. The council sponsored the crusade as a public service, arranging for broadcasters to run ads without charge. The Ad Council’s sponsorship translated into as much as $2 billion worth of free advertising over the campaign’s history, in 2017 dollars.

The message was simple: Russia was aggressive; Communism was awful. The enemy couldn’t be trusted. Typical ads conveyed a brutalized vision of life behind the Iron Curtain: “a strip of Communist-controlled hell-on-earth,” one read. Donating a few bucks would save Czechs, Poles, Hungarians and others from this tyranny. Many thousands of Americans took the bait. They dutifully wrote checks to Radio Free Europe, and their contributions were magnified by gifts from many of the country’s biggest corporations, yielding, on average, about $1 million annually.

It wasn’t enough: The donations barely covered the cost of running the “fund-raising drives,” to say nothing of Radio Free Europe’s $30 million annual budgets. But that wasn’t the point.

Declassified documents reveal that almost from the start, the C.I.A. saw that it could exploit the fund-raising campaign as a conduit for domestic propaganda. It was a way to rally public support for the Cold War by dramatizing Communist repression and stoking fears of a worldwide menace. The plight of Eastern Europe brought moral clarity to the Cold War, and it cemented the region as a vital national interest in American domestic politics.

Its impact outlived the campaign itself. Even though the pleas for donations ended in 1971, when the C.I.A. was exposed and stopped funding the station, they cemented anti-Communist hostility that animated conservative opposition to détente in the 1970s. It provided the leitmotif for Reagan’s denunciations of the “evil empire” in the 1980s. One can even hear echoes in Donald Trump’s recent speech to the United Nations: His long digression on the evils of socialism seems drawn from the heated rhetoric of ads gone by.

So, too, does our post-truth media environment carry voices from this past. The crusade blasted all information from enemy sources as lies and deceit — fake news, we could say. This counter-propaganda sought to inoculate the public from being receptive to anything said by the other side. It’s a tactic we’ve seen play out in real time on the president’s Twitter feed.

And almost certainly, Radio Free Europe itself — which continues to operate out of its headquarters in Prague — has shaped Vladimir Putin’s worldview. Russia has long tried to claim Eastern Europe as its sphere of influence. Moscow hated the station for its meddling. As a K.G.B. officer, Mr. Putin no doubt spent many hours fretting over its activities in the Soviet bloc. It was a major irritant. He may even see the 2016 election hack as a way to even the score.

The disembodied hand has a sinister cinematic reputation. In horror films, it can be seen scampering across the screen, enacting nefarious deeds — murder, usually. But on social media, the hand has been cast in a new role, as a symbol of artisanal craftsmanship and entrepreneurial zeal.

The online video hand is just as driven as the horror movie version — both appear to have minds of their own. But this time it’s a helping hand, channeling its energies toward cooking party foods and executing creative household hacks. And it’s extending its reach across the internet. A quarter of video views on the Facebook pages of media companies go to these sorts of instructional videos, according to the digital video analytics company Tubular Labs. No faces. No bodies. Just hands.

BuzzFeed’s food video juggernaut, Tasty, popularized a particular form of cooking video — camera pointed straight down onto the kitchen counter, point-of-view style, with cooks appearing exclusively from the wrist down — that has since taken over top Facebook and YouTube crafting and cooking channels like Blossom, 5-Minute Crafts and BuzzFeed’s own D.I.Y. channel, Nifty. (The New York Times Cooking section produces such content, too; they’re called “hands and pans” videos.) Now even the Food Network, which built its television brand by promoting fully realized human cooks, has started posting hand-focused cooking videos on its Facebook page.

The hand has also emerged as a star of a popular genre of YouTube children’s content: toy unboxing videos, where new playthings are removed from their packages and taken for a spin. One of YouTube’s most popular personalities is an anonymous unboxer known as Disney Collector, who appears exclusively as a set of playfully manicured hands. And on Instagram, the hand has come into its own as a beauty icon, thanks to Instagram-famous nail artists like Madeline Poole and Jin Soon Choi.

Second to the face, the hand is the most demonstrably human body part. Its opposable thumb allows it to wield tools, flash symbols and now, type out texts. It’s probably not a coincidence that the hand’s image has risen online just as mobile devices have taken over our social, work and creative lives. We’re living amid what the French philosopher Michel Serres has called the “Thumbelina Generation”: Instead of talking with our mouths, we’re creating vast and complicated visual and textual messages with finger taps and swipes. We shoot smartphone videos with the device in hand, thumb resting on the “record” button, then turn around and watch the video in our hands. The hand is the driver of modern communication, and now it’s the star of it, too.

“We’ve seen a re-enchantment of the hand,” James Leo Cahill, a cinema studies professor at the University of Toronto, told me. “It’s finally getting its due as an onscreen organ.”

For decades, instructional TV shows were built around celebrity chefs or crafters, filmed on sets with wide camera shots. These shows could make viewers feel as if they were hanging out with Rachael Ray or Martha Stewart, but they didn’t mimic the sensation of actually cooking or crafting themselves.

The South Carolina Election Commission estimates that it could cost $40 million to replace the state’s antiquated voting equipment with machines that used auditable paper ballots.","Last month, a panel of state, federal and private election experts completed a sweeping revision of guidelines for manufacturers of new voting equipment, the first major overhaul in a dozen years. While the guidelines are voluntary, they are endorsed by all but three states, so manufacturers effectively must meet the new standards to sell their equipment in most of the nation.

Of course, threats to democracy and fair voting — such as gerrymandered election districts and disinformation campaigns on Facebook and other social media platforms — go well beyond election technology. And so far state and federal funds have often failed to match the scale and urgency of the problem. But in a time of widespread skepticism about the security of American elections, ensuring people that their votes have been counted accurately has become a pressing demand.

“What’s happening is a psy-ops operation,” said Mac Warner, the West Virginia secretary of state. “That’s what the Russians are running against us now, trying to erode confidence in our democratic process. We need to assure our citizens that we’re aware of these attacks, that we have assistance to counter them, and that when they do occur, don’t panic — there are resources to turn to.”

In an era of bitter political divisions and elections-rules disputes, the effort to make the vote more secure is notably bipartisan and relatively rancor-free. Republicans like Mr. Warner are largely aligned with Democrats on the need to act before the next presidential election in 2020, and there is some support in both parties in Congress for helping to finance changes.

Experts have warned for years that state and local election equipment and security practices were dangerously out of date, but state and local election agencies short of cash have often lagged in updating their systems. The 2016 election, however, laid bare the seriousness of the threat.

Federal officials have said they are confident that November’s election results were not tampered with. But federal intelligence and security officials were so shaken by Russian attempts to compromise the vote that the Department of Homeland Security designated election systems a critical national infrastructure, like banking and the electrical grid, that merit special protection.

The scope of the threat was underscored on Tuesday when a new report concluded not only that widely used voting systems can be breached by hackers — sometimes with almost trivial ease — but that they contain components manufactured in nations like China with a clear interest in undermining American democracy.

“It’s really important not to overstate the risk. There are lots of things that can be done to make sure machines are as secure as possible,” Lawrence Norden, the deputy director of the Democracy Project at the Brennan Center for Justice of the New York University School of Law. “But when you’re dealing with a nation-state, you have to assume that at some point they’re going to be successful in their efforts to breach things. The question then becomes resiliency and the ability to show people that you can fix things even if there is a breach.”

State officials, who zealously guard their control of elections, have greeted federal efforts to address voting security with wariness. But that, too, has changed. State election directors who were blindsided and angered by the Homeland Security department’s critical infrastructure designation will meet with department officials in Atlanta this month to discuss how they can share information about threats. The department also is working to give state election officials security clearances so they can view classified assessments of dangers to the election system.

The new guidelines for manufacturers of voting equipment — reduced to five pages from more than 200 — include for the first time principles as basic as a requirement that voting devices produce written records that can be verified, and that software or hardware errors cannot lead to undetectable changes in tallies. They are expected to spur the development of a new generation of cheaper and more secure equipment, said Matthew Masterson, the chairman of the federal Election Assistance Commission.

He said the shared guidelines would allow for the deployment of election software on products like tablets and iPads, which could be ready as soon as the 2020 election, rather than force 50 states to put together their own systems. “It’s going to drive innovation, hopefully save money for election officials, and allow us to test and certify equipment more efficiently,’’ Mr. Masterson said.

Foreign governments that regularly crack the computers of military contractors and federal agencies will not be daunted by the cyberdefenses of voter databases and electronic pollbooks. A determined adversary could compromise voting equipment at many points along the supply chain, from the factory assembler to the election software programmer to the technician who makes a repair or installs a software upgrade. And in an industry dominated by a handful of companies, malicious tinkering could have a broad impact.

“In computer security, you’re talking much more about the capabilities of local jurisdictions,” said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technology officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. “And they vary dramatically, from L.A., which has a small army of folks, to many jurisdictions that don’t even have a full-time person for their election work. To the extent they have an ability to defend against these attacks, it’s quite limited.”

Mr. Hall said election officials need to be even more vigilant, and impose a “zero-trust networking” policy on their agencies. “Don’t assume that because something is locked in a case that it’s safe,” he said. “Assume they’re already in your system, and set up things that will catch them — honey pots, fake data stores. If anyone hits them, then you know someone’s poking around.”

For all the expressions of resolve, money remains the biggest obstacle to a complete overhaul of the system. Many jurisdictions rely on equipment bought after the 2002 Help America Vote Act, Congress’s response to the problems exposed by the 2000 presidential election, allotted nearly $4 billion for new machines and other reforms. Many of those machines are at or past the end of their service lives; Georgia conducted November’s elections on voting machines running Windows 2000, and parts of Pennsylvania relied on Windows XP.

Most states still use paper ballots that are counted by hand or by machines. But four other states besides Delaware — Louisiana, Georgia, New Jersey and South Carolina — use paperless systems that leave no audit trail, as do large swaths of Pennsylvania and some other states. Virginia scrapped thousands of paperless voting machines in 2015 after discovering that even an amateur hacker could easily and secretly change vote tallies.

A number of states and jurisdictions are replacing old equipment, and Los Angeles County — with 5.3 million registered voters, the nation’s largest election district — has designed an election system from scratch, and is asking manufacturers to bid on supplying it.

Bipartisan legislation in both the House and Senate would provide a modest amount of federal money for new machines. But prospects for passage are uncertain, and many states are unable or unwilling to fill the breach.

The South Carolina Election Commission estimates that it could cost $40 million to replace the state’s antiquated voting equipment with machines that used auditable paper ballots. So far the State Legislature has come up with $1 million, said Chris Whitmire, a spokesman for the commission.

“We’re using the same equipment we’ve used since 2004,” he said. “If $40 million dropped into our hands today, we’d have a paper ballot trail, too.”

But even states that cannot afford more secure machines are taking steps to harden their election systems and bolster public confidence in the vote. South Carolina has accepted an offer of free “cyberhygiene” scans of its system by Homeland Security experts. Colorado is upgrading its voting equipment, but it has also begun to receive Homeland Security screenings, added national guard security experts to its election team and tacked a basic security measure onto its voter-registration database: two-step authentication for anyone seeking to log into the system.

State election officials are now in regular contact with federal security and intelligence agencies about threats to the vote, said Trevor Timmons, the chief information officer for Wayne W. Williams, the Colorado secretary of state.

“I’ve spent more time talking to three-letter agencies in the last year than I have in my entire career,” he said.","Wary of Hackers, States Move to Upgrade Voting Systems",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/us/voting-russians-hacking-states-.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

All the Films of Studio Ghibli, Ranked As a new DVD series makes an influential animation studio’s films easier to find, we look back at the entire catalog.

When the New York Times’s chief film critics ranked the best movies of the century so far , many readers were surprised by the work at No. 2: Hayao Miyazaki’s animated “Spirited Away.” The rest of us wondered why it wasn’t No. 1.

Spoiler alert: Spirited Away” is first on my list, a personal ranking of all the feature films (including a few outliers) of Mr. Miyazaki’s production company, the legendary animation house Studio Ghibli. The 32-year-old company’s output has been modest but its influence is profound. Some of its biggest fans routinely copy Ghibli’s moves for their work at Pixar and DreamWorks.

The occasion for the list is a new, handsomely packaged edition of nearly all the Ghibli films by the distributor Gkids. It’s particularly significant because Ghibli is opposed to streaming video for aesthetic and commercial reasons. So beyond occasional screenings — like a series showing “Spirited Away” in select theaters around the country Oct. 29 to Nov. 1 — and a handful of titles streaming legally , discs are the only way to go.

Here’s my list. From top to bottom, it’s full of worlds you’ll want to get lost in.

1. ‘Spirited Away’ (2001)

A family takes a wrong turn on its way to a new home and a young girl is plunged into a dark adventure with a hauntingly drawn collection of spirits, witches, monsters and other fantastic creatures. It’s Mr. Miyazaki’s most expansive and mesmerizing film ever.

2. ‘Princess Mononoke’ (1997)

A gorgeously imagined fantasy, a forceful plea for living in balance with nature, and a riveting adventure that recalls the classic samurai films of Kurosawa — what’s not to like? Perhaps “Mononoke,” the Miyazaki film that first brought Studio Ghibli wide attention in America, is not quite as mysteriously transporting as “Spirited Away,” but that’s not saying much.

3. ‘My Neighbor Totoro’ (1988)

The sisters Satsuki and Mei move into a ramshackle country cottage while their mother convalesces at a nearby hospital, and they overcome their fears with the help of some possibly imaginary new friends, including a slyly grinning cat that doubles as a bus and the huge, furry, unflappable Totoro. From Mr. Miyazaki, this is deceptively simple and childlike but enormously moving, a direct portal to the joys and terrors of childhood.

4. ‘Porco Rosso’ (1992)

Not as well known as the other great Miyazaki films, this homage to vintage Howard Hawks-style aerial thrills is as beautifully drawn and colored as anything he’s done. And it’s tremendous fun. The adventures of the seaplane ace Porco Rosso (the Crimson Pig) combine Saturday-matinee exuberance with 1930s Hollywood romance.

5. ‘Castle in the Sky’ (Laputa) (1986)

The first official Studio Ghibli movie, this Miyazaki production isn’t as complex or finely polished as the movies above it on this list, but it’s a near perfect action-adventure. A girl chased by merry airborne pirates and power-hungry government officials tries to save the floating castle of Laputa from destruction, a task that involves steampunk-style airships, a harrowing train ride and a few giant robots.

6. ‘Howl’s Moving Castle’ (2004)

This dark fable isn’t a hit with some Miyazaki fans — the story takes eccentric turns, and the connections have to do with emotion, characterization and image rather than plot. But what images they are. The unconventional love story pairs Howl, a half-man, half-bird magician who wanders the countryside in the grinding, puffing domicile of the title, and Sophie, a young milliner who’s been turned into an old woman by a witch’s curse.

7. ‘Pom Poko’ (1994)

The best film by Isao Takahata, who started the studio with Mr. Miyazaki, this is a comic allegory about battling packs of tanuki (Japanese raccoon dogs) joining forces to fight human real estate developers. It’s earthy and rollicking in a way that his co-founder’s films aren’t.

8. ‘Kiki’s Delivery Service’ (1989)

The coming–of-age story of a mischievous, clumsy witch who leaves home at 13 to find a town and a job, as witches must. A conventional but delightful tale of self-discovery and heroism from Mr. Miyazaki, it feels like Disney one moment, Truffaut the next.

9. ‘My Neighbors the Yamadas’ (1999)

Mr. Takahata’s broad, cartoony family comedy whose smeary watercolor washes and “Peanuts”-like line drawings don’t follow Ghibli’s house style. The family’s misadventures are standard stuff, but the art is continuously inventive.

Image Credit GKIDS

10. ‘Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind’ (1984)

A Ghibli film in all but name — it was Mr. Miyazaki’s last movie before the studio’s founding — “Nausicaa” was a formative work for him and his first collaboration with the composer Joe Hisaishi, who has scored all his movies since. A forerunner of the more ambitious ecofable “Princess Mononoke,” it’s a postapocalpytic tale about an Earth where pockets of humans hide from gigantic, marauding insects.

Image Credit GKIDS

11. ‘The Tale of the Princess Kaguya’ (2013)

The story of a high-spirited princess who sprouts from an enchanted bamboo grove, and the bamboo cutter and his wife who raise her, eventually taking her away from her beloved mountains to turn her into a proper noblewoman. Rendered in a calligraphic style with a watercolor palette, this fairy tale from Mr. Takahata has a large reputation, though it’s more simple than profound and, at 2 hours, 17 minutes, overly long.

Image “Ponyo” Credit GKIDS

12. ‘Ponyo’ (2008)

Mr. Miyazaki’s take on “The Little Mermaid,” about a spunky, proud little fish who befriends a human boy and tries to live on land, is often visually ravishing. Its phosphorescent underwater scenes and Hokusai -like waves are as lovely as anything he’s done. The story, though, is less intense and more sentimental than his best work.

Image Credit GKIDS

13. ‘Only Yesterday’ (1991)

A 27-year-old office worker takes a trip to the countryside where she spent her 10th summer. Known in the United States primarily for the long delay in its American release, this memory play from Mr. Takahata is smart, poignant and kind of ordinary.

Image Credit GKIDS

14. ‘The Wind Rises’ (2013)

Mr. Miyazaki’s last movie so far is also his most straightforward and probably his least involving, though its images of life in 1930s and ’40s Japan and of early aviation are beautiful and interesting in their own right. (And there’s a terrifically kinetic earthquake.) Based on the life of an airplane designer whose pure love of flight resulted in deadly fighter planes for the Japanese air force, it continues the fascination with soaring motion that Mr. Miyazaki has indulged in several films beginning with “Nausicaa.”

Image Credit GKIDS

15. ‘The Cat Returns’ (2002)

If you’d never seen a Miyazaki film, Hiroyuki Morita’s amusing cross of talking animals with teenage (human) angst would look even better. As it is, it’s the best non-Miyazaki, non-Takahata Ghibli feature. A girl prevents a cat from getting crushed by a truck and gains favor with a nocturnal kingdom of hipster felines, in a story with echoes of “Alice in Wonderland” and the novels of Haruki Murakami.

16. ‘Grave of the Fireflies’ (1988)

The story of a brother and sister surviving on their own amid firestorms and famine during World War II, Mr. Takahata’s parable of Japanese nationalism and the high cost of pride is often cited as one of the Ghibli masterpieces. It’s seamlessly told, but it’s also a shameless, morbid tear-jerker.

Image Credit GKIDS

17. ‘Whisper of the Heart’ (1995)

Yoshifumi Kondo was considered the heir apparent to Mr. Miyazaki and Mr. Takahata at Ghibli, but died after making this one feature. Mr. Miyazaki wrote the screenplay for a love story about a shy girl and an aspiring violin maker (and a talking cat), but the result looks like a lot of non-Ghibli anime.

Image Credit GKIDS

18. ‘From Up on Poppy Hill’ (2011)

Hayao Miyazaki developed and co-wrote the screenplay for this bouncy period piece, set in early-1960s Yokohama and revolving around a boardinghouse that overlooks the city’s busy harbor. It’s a story of young love and secret family entanglements, with a bit of the era’s social ferment in the background, competently brought to the screen by Mr. Miyazaki’s son Goro.

19. ‘The Secret World of Arrietty’ (2010)

An adaptation of “The Borrowers” was a longtime goal for Mr. Miyazaki and Mr. Takahata, but when Ghibli finally undertook it, it was the directing debut of Hiromasa Yonebayashi. A teenage boy visits his mother’s childhood home and finds tiny people living under the floorboards, in a slight story with animation that’s lovely in a generic way.

Image Credit GKIDS

20. ‘Ocean Waves’ (1993)

A pedestrian romance about a bittersweet school days love triangle, this television movie from Tomomi Mochizuki was an experiment in letting younger members of the Ghibli team make their own film. It wasn’t repeated.

Image Credit GKIDS

21. ‘When Marnie Was There’ (2014)

A fussy, complicated (but very nice looking) ghost story about isolation and friendship, Hiromasa Yonebayashi’s “Marnie” demonstrates that working at the same studio as Mr. Miyazaki doesn’t mean you can bring his kind of magic to a female coming-of-age story.

Hotel dispatchers also received multiple calls with conflicting information, according to a person familiar with the security response inside the hotel.

The sheriff said on Friday that he was “absolutely offended” by allegations of incompetence within the department, and said that the shifting timeline was a result of the vast scope of the investigation and not an attempt to mislead anyone about the circumstances of the attack.

“This is a very dynamic event,” he said. “A very big event. Thousands of people involved — humans involved — in documentation.”

The announcement caps almost two weeks of confusion about the chronology of the shooting, in which Mr. Paddock, a high-stakes gambler, hauled powerful weapons into the gold-paneled hotel and casino, pointed them out the window of his suite and shot at thousands of people below.

Mr. Paddock killed 58 people before killing himself.

Sheriff Lombardo also announced Friday a revised number of injured people, 546, from fewer than 500. He added that 45 people were still in hospitals, some in critical condition, and that the number of dead could rise. “By the grace of God it doesn’t,” he said.

The back-and-forth is a sign of the complexity of the case and the amount of information investigators are sifting through as they try to unravel what happened. Sheriff Lombardo said that his team was examining thousands of pieces of evidence, patching together information from hotel cameras, private cameras, police body cameras, police dispatch and witness interviews. He said repeatedly at the news conference that information about the case would change as the investigation continued.

Officials said the F.B.I.’s Counterterrorism Division was handling the investigation because of its experience dealing with mass shootings and terrorism attacks. More than 200 F.B.I. agents and support staff have worked the case. So far, the F.B.I. has conducted hundreds of interviews and investigated 2,000 tips or leads.

The police have said that investigators found several bullets in aviation fuel tanks near the concert grounds, and on Friday Sheriff Lombardo said that his team believed Mr. Paddock had fired at them “with intent.” He noted that there was “very low probability” that gunfire could have ignited the fuel.

On the day of the shooting, Mr. Campos had been dispatched to the 32nd floor to investigate an alarm indicating that a room door was ajar, according to police officials.

Sheriff Lombardo said on Friday that while an initial written report of the night showed that Mr. Campos had been shot at 9:59 p.m., further examination revealed something different: Mr. Campos had tried to access the 32nd floor at that time, but found a door barricaded. He ascended to another level in order to get to the 32nd floor.

He went to the door that was ajar, Sheriff Lombardo said, “mitigated the situation and subsequently received fire from the suspect.” That happened around 10:05 p.m., which is also when Mr. Paddock began to shoot at the concert.

Sheriff Lombardo said on Friday that Mr. Campos notified the hotel both by radio and cellphone shortly after he had been shot. But he did not say when Mandalay Bay notified the police department.

The sheriff, alluding to allegations of a conspiracy between his department, the F.B.I., and MGM — supposedly in an effort to establish a legal case — said, “there is no conspiracy.”",Another Shift in Las Vegas Timeline Caps Days of Confusion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/us/las-vegas-timeline.html

Some observers say that, while the cost of the reserve is untenable, the city should find a better solution.

“As far as what would have been the best thing for the kids in New York City schools, it would have been to find a way to end the A.T.R. without placing those teachers in schools,” said Marcus A. Winters, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

Chicago and Washington, for instance, have put limits of roughly a year on how long a teacher without a permanent assignment can collect a paycheck.

“It’s one of those things that you would hope that even the union would understand — that if you’ve been in the A.T.R. for five years or so, it’s probably time to move on,” Mr. Winters said. As for the de Blasio administration, which is generally seen as close to the teachers’ union, he said, “I don’t know if they were aggressive enough to do it or not.”

Adam Ross, the general counsel for the teachers’ union, the United Federation of Teachers, said, “If an arbitrator finds, upon examining all the facts, that termination is not warranted, it is management’s responsibility to use the employee in question.”

A Question of Energy

Sara Dingledy, the former principal of Westchester Square Academy, a small high school in the Bronx, said that while about half of the reserve teachers who rotated through her school were capable and eager to be hired, “I had a whole bunch of people in who obviously had no interest in getting a job, who wanted to know where the staff room was so they could sit down, who just wanted to surf the computer all day.”

Mr. Blake said that he had applied for a number of jobs, and blamed his trouble in finding a permanent position on his salary. Both he and Ms. Alterescu were at the top teacher pay scale of $113,762 last year.

“It’s a matter of economics,” he said.

Mr. Blake said that he went on roughly two interviews a year, mostly for positions as a cluster teacher — an elementary-level teacher who teaches a subject like science or art to groups of students throughout the day. He said that at his age — about 60 — he didn’t think he would succeed as a regular classroom teacher, who is with the same group of students all day long and is responsible for keeping records on their academic progress and other matters.

“You basically have to be like Bartleby the Scrivener there to keep up with all the logs you have to do for 30 students,” he said of the paperwork.

The department moved to fire Mr. Blake in 2009. His supervisors at Public School 157, the Grove Hill School, in the Bronx, described his lessons as ineffective and his classroom management as poor.

The case was heard before an arbitrator, a process dictated by state law and the teachers’ union contract. The arbitrator, Alan Berg, wrote in his decision that Mr. Blake “appears to lack the energy and enthusiasm necessary to be a truly good teacher,” but imposed a fine rather than firing him. “Being boring alone does not warrant termination,” Mr. Berg said.

Ms. Alterescu worked at Junior High School 189, the Daniel Carter Beard School, in Queens, until 2010. She was twice disciplined for excessive absenteeism or lateness. While she was assigned to a reassignment center, or “rubber room,” in June 2010, she sought and received a doctor’s note saying that she was unable to work, then flew to Chicago for a family reunion, claiming sick time for the two days of work she missed.

The next year, after she had been assigned to the reserve, she was arrested and received desk appearance tickets on two occasions, for altercations with her mother and sister. She did not immediately report the arrests to the department. The department sought to remove her, but an arbitrator, citing her long tenure, imposed a fine instead. Ms. Alterescu said in an interview that she believed the principal of J.H.S. 189 disliked her and that she did not immediately report the desk appearance tickets because she did not think they were arrests. She said the charges in both cases were ultimately dismissed.

Mr. Williams, the former Bronx principal, who is now the vice president of education at Goodwill Central Texas, said that, while principals would no doubt be frustrated to have ineffective teachers forced on them, they weren’t the only ones who would be unhappy.

“No one dislikes a lazy or not-good teacher more than a good teacher,” he said.","Caught Sleeping or Worse, Troubled Teachers Will Return to New York Classrooms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/nyregion/troubled-teachers-back-in-classrooms-new-york.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

On Friday, a researcher at the Institute for American Studies at the North Korean Foreign Ministry warned that the joint exercise, as well as a flight by two American B-1B bombers over South Korea on Tuesday, would compel the North to “take military counteraction.”

The researcher, Kim Kwang-hak, did not elaborate but recalled North Korea’s warning in August that it could launch missiles near Guam, home to the United States air base from which the B-1B long-range bombers took off on Tuesday. Kim Jong-un has said he would watch the Americans before deciding when to launch an “enveloping fire” around Guam.

“We have already warned several times that we will take counteractions for self-defense, including a salvo of missiles into waters near the U.S. territory of Guam,” Mr. Kim, the North Korean researcher, told the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Friday. “The U.S. military action hardens our determination that the U.S. should be tamed with fire and lets us take our hand closer to the ‘trigger’ for taking the toughest countermeasure.”

North Korea has made similar threats against the United States for decades. But Mr. Trump has added to tensions in recent weeks by employing similarly tough talk, threatening to “totally destroy” or rain down “fire and fury” on North Korea. He has said Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korea.

Despite Mr. Trump’s words, John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, said on Thursday that North Korea’s nuclear threat was “manageable” for now.

Mr. Kelly added that Americans should be concerned that the North is getting closer to being able to hit the mainland United States with its missiles. He said there was already “great concern” about Americans living in Guam.

Also on Friday, South Korea’s meteorological authorities said that they detected a small quake near the North’s underground nuclear test site, but that it was not caused by a man-made explosion. They have detected three similar tremors from near the test site since the North’s nuclear test on Sept. 3, in which North Korea said it detonated a hydrogen bomb.

Some earthquake experts have attributed the recent tremors to underground cave-ins caused by that powerful test. Commercial satellite images have also found evidence of landslides near the North Korean site, raising fears of radioactive fallout if the North conducts another nuclear test there.

The previous test compelled Washington to accelerate its global campaign to exert economic pressure on North Korea.

New technologies like electric and autonomously driven vehicles are forcing major changes while the center of gravity in the car business is shifting toward Asia. “There is a lot of fluidity in the entire industry space, which is what these players see,” Mr. Wells said.

In an interview at a pub called The Grenadier in London, Mr. Ratcliffe explained that terminating the much-loved Defender would create demand for a replacement because it “had left quite a hole in the marketplace.” He criticized the many SUVs still being sold as “jelly molds” that all look alike.

Mr. Ratcliffe owns two versions of the Defender — one from 1955 and a so-called Heritage model made near the end of its production run. He said he wants to preserve the Defender’s boxy, military-style ruggedness.

Toby Ecuyer, a yacht designer, has the job of turning Mr. Ratcliffe’s ideas into drawings. “What we are trying to design is something extremely utilitarian,” not a luxury vehicle, he said.

Mr. Ratcliffe conceded that the new vehicle will need updates to meet global safety and emission standards, including in the United States, where its sales stopped in 1997. He said he planned to make about 25,000 vehicles a year — about the number of Defenders sold in 2015, the year before its production was halted.

Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Tata, an India-based conglomerate, has found success with luxury models like the Range Rover. The company said in a statement that it had plans for the Defender and would pay close attention to any actions regarding its “proprietary rights.”

Mr. Ratcliffe built a $40 billion per year petrochemical empire called Ineos by buying chemical plants that other companies wanted to discard and then running them more efficiently. He said he can also find cheaper ways to operate a car company as well.

According to his team, for instance, European manufacturers had already expressed an interest in either building his car on contract or selling him a fully equipped plant. Either way, that would help limit upfront investment and risk. He said he did not want to put in more than 600 million pounds — less than the $1 billion analysts estimate that development and production of a new model typically costs.

Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the CAR center at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, said he doubted that an updated version of an old concept would have appeal beyond a dwindling group of enthusiasts. A few would buy Mr. Ratcliffe’s car, he said, but it would “become a niche which gets smaller over time.”

Mr. Dyson has been much more guarded about his plans. “It’s not a sports car and not a very cheap car,” he told reporters at his company store on London’s bustling Oxford Street in late September. He recounted that in the 1990s he had designed a device for cleaning truck exhaust but received a cool reception from vehicle manufacturers. Instead, he focused his efforts on electric motors and batteries, hoping that one day he could step up to cars.

Photo

He has reached that point. Mr. Dyson has purchased a World War II-era airfield near his company’s headquarters in Malmesbury, in southern England, where the development work will continue. He said the new vehicle will offer a “radical” electric motor design that he said would be more efficient than those available on the market now.

Mr. Dyson has proved himself a dogged inventor, designing high-end vacuum cleaners and other products like hair dryers. His technological savvy gives him a chance of scoring a hit in the much more complex and costly global car industry, analysts said. In 2015, he bought Sakti3, an American start-up that is working with solid state batteries. Mr. Dyson said he could be on track to commercializing a so-called solid state battery, which analysts say might be more powerful and safer than the lithium ion devices now used in electric cars and cellphones. He said both the start-up and his own team were working on the project.

“The edge that Dyson have if they do have an edge is to possibly be ahead of the game in solid state batteries,” said Philippe Houchois, an auto analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank.

As nascent as they are, the plans Mr. Dyson has laid out will be expensive, particularly for a medium-size company like Dyson. Mr. Dyson said he would spend £1 billion on the car and another £1 billion on the battery — a lot of money for a company that reported £2.5 billion in revenue last year.

He may need to spend more. Tesla, for instance, has already spent about $6 billion, according to analysts’ estimates.

Mr. Dyson said he planned to develop not only a new motor but a new chassis. “We are starting from scratch,” he said. “There isn’t one that is suitable.”

Electric cars are clearly a high-risk venture. Mr. Houchois said none of the vehicles on the market, including those made by Tesla, which recently reported disappointing production numbers on its new Model 3, are making money for their owners. Dyson may seek to bring costs down by manufacturing in Asia, where it already makes appliances.

Still, whatever his reputation, Mr. Dyson has set himself a formidable task. “It is one thing to design and manufacture a household item,” said R. A.

Q: I’ve heard conflicting advice whether to reveal my current salary when asked. How should I answer such question when asked during an interview?

-Sandy W.

A: Sandy, the reason you’ve heard conflicting advice is that, well, there is always a danger in a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach. If you’re making good money in your current job and want to set the bar at a decent minimum for any discussions, I think it makes sense to go first and say, “This is what I’m making now.” Implicit in that is that you expect a premium above what you’re making to switch jobs.

If you think you’d be coming in at the low end, it can be smart to ask them what they typically pay for someone in that role.

From that point on, the negotiation will depend on the leverage of each side. It’s also up to you how hard you want to negotiate. As long as you can build a clear and factual case for why you deserve X, that’s a fine conversation to have. Any work you can do ahead of time to get a sense of what the company pays is also useful for such discussions.

The final point is about your temperament.

Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October.
They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying.
“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

And now Republicans control the governor’s office, the Legislature, both Senate seats and three of four in the House.","CLINTON, Iowa — The Clinton County Democratic Party headquarters is wedged in a nondescript brick building with an unpaved, dusty parking lot. The dated computers, mismatched furniture and portable fan suggest another era. The office is dotted with party mementos, a phone from the 1996 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and framed photographs of Democratic presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Barack Obama.

There is little to suggest a future for the party here in this once reliable Democratic stronghold, at least in races on the national level. President Trump easily carried this county in the 2016 election, and Iowa as a whole; the only counties Hillary Clinton won were in metropolitan areas or university towns.

Iowa’s dramatic change has been both abrupt and a long time in coming. In 2008, the state propelled Mr. Obama to the White House. A year later, it was the first in the Midwest to legalize same-sex marriage. But last November, Mr. Trump won Iowa by a larger margin than he won Texas. And now Republicans control the governor’s office, the Legislature, both Senate seats and three of four in the House.

“Is Iowa still a swing state?” said J. Ann Selzer, who has conducted polling here for 30 years and was almost alone in forecasting the size of Mr. Trump’s victory. She took a moment to answer and seemed skeptical. “You know, potentially. Pundits will probably treat it that way for another cycle.”",Iowa’s Swing to Republicans Is a Matter of (Lacking a) Degree,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/us/politics/iowa-democrats-republicans.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

“No, sir,” Mr. Tate said, and Mr. Jones offered his own pair but whacked one of his hands with them.
Emboldened, Mr. Tate asked Mr. Davis if he could sit in for one number.
He went to a rehearsal, where Mr. Jones “seemed to call all the tunes that I knew,” he recalled.
Working with Mr. Jones led Mr. Tate to decades of studio work.","Peggy Lee, whom he accompanied on tour and on recordings, was a favorite of his. Mr. Tate told one of her biographers, Peter Richmond, that the real shows began after their nightclub gigs had ended, when the band jammed with her in her hotel suite.

“There were some performances you wouldn’t believe,” he was quoted as saying in “Fever: The Life and Music of Miss Peggy Lee” (2006). One night, he recalled, “I heard this voice, and the song that she was singing, whatever it was, she sounded more like Billie Holiday than Billie ever sounded.”

Miss Lee encouraged Mr. Tate’s desire to sing publicly. She had him sing “The Windmills of Your Mind” in 1968 as part of her set at the Copacabana in Manhattan.

“You know, that was not only a great thing Peggy did for me, it was also unprecedented,” Mr. Tate told Downbeat magazine in 1971. “Singers are a funny lot. The stage is all theirs and as a result, quite often they don’t want anything that has the remotest chance of upstaging them. That’s why the music is geared just so, the lights just so. But Peggy is a beautiful lady.”

He released several albums as a vocalist, starting in 1968 with “Windmills of My Mind.” He also sang “I Got Six” and “Naughty Number Nine” on “Schoolhouse Rock,” ABC’s long-running series of short educational cartoons.

“When you’re playing as a drummer, everybody’s playing and nobody cares a thing about you,” he told the pianist Marian McPartland on her NPR show “Piano Jazz” in 2009. “Everybody’s out front and the drummer’s in the back and you don’t get the play you should get.”

In contrast, he said, singing “is something that gets directly to the person.”

Grady Bernard Tate was born on Jan. 14, 1932, in Durham, N.C. His father, also named Grady, was a stonemason. His mother, Elizabeth, was the dean of women at a local business school. He played drums and sang, but when his voice changed he stopped singing.

At 13, he had an odd if inspiring experience watching the jazz drummer Jo Jones perform at the Durham Armory, he told the website All About Jazz in 2008.

He recalled being mesmerized as Mr. Jones, “the craziest man I’ve ever seen in my life,” played with unalloyed joy. Afterward, Mr. Jones invited him onto the stage and asked if he had brought his drumsticks with him.

“No, sir,” Mr. Tate said, and Mr. Jones offered his own pair but whacked one of his hands with them. “That’s just a tiny bit of the pain that you’re going to get,” Mr. Jones said, “if you’re gonna pick these damn things up and use ’em.”

In the Air Force, Mr. Tate played in a 21-piece stateside band, where he worked with the trumpeter and arranger Bill Berry. After his discharge, he graduated from North Carolina Central University with a bachelor’s degree in English and drama and then moved to Washington, where he briefly taught at a high school and worked in the post office.

One musician he knew in Washington, the saxophonist Herschel McGinnis, took him to see the organist Wild Bill Davis play. Emboldened, Mr. Tate asked Mr. Davis if he could sit in for one number. It proved to be an epiphany.

“I hadn’t played drums in so long,” Mr. Tate said in a 2005 interview with the newspaper Port Folio Weekly. “I just exploded. When we finished, it was like the cleansing of my life, everything was out.

“The next day the phone rang. My wife said, ‘It’s Wild Bill Davis!’ He said: ‘I was wondering. Would you like to work with my band? We’re opening in Pittsburgh Tuesday night. Are you in?’”

He stayed with Mr. Davis for a few years and then took a detour, moving to New York City to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Ultimately, he said, although he loved acting, he did not pursue it because he felt that the instructors and other actors were insincere.

In 1962 another saxophonist, Jerome Richardson, intervened to bring Mr. Tate back to music; he was with Quincy Jones’s big band, which had lost its drummer as it prepared to go on tour. Would Mr. Tate play with the band for a while? He went to a rehearsal, where Mr. Jones “seemed to call all the tunes that I knew,” he recalled.

Working with Mr. Jones led Mr. Tate to decades of studio work. He was also a member of the “Tonight Show” band for several years before the show moved from New York to California in 1972.

In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Grady Jr.

In his later years, Mr. Tate sang more and played the drums less.

“I had never thought of singing as a career, which it is for me now,” he said in 2005. “I don’t know how it happened; I just go with the flow. And I find that to be totally acceptable.”","Grady Tate, Jazz Drummer Turned Vocalist, Dies at 85",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/obituaries/grady-tate-dead-jazz-drummer-turned-vocalist.html

FRIDAY PUZZLE — People don’t believe me when I tell them that there is always a way into a puzzle, even the late week ones, but it’s true. What seems to happen is that some solvers quickly scan the list of clues on, say, a Friday puzzle,, see nothing that they know on the first pass, and decide that they can’t solve it. Many times, they give up and walk away.

But take a moment to think about this logically: What would be the point of making and editing a puzzle that no one can solve? It would be like building a house with no door or windows. It might be an interesting feat, but it’s ultimately unwelcoming. So the constructor and the editors always make sure that a porch light is left on for solvers, even if that light is in a different spot for different people.

Altuve then stole second and scored when Correa lined a 2-1 slider, which Tanaka left up, into left field to put the Astros ahead, 1-0.
The pitch was a fastball that catcher Gary Sanchez wanted inside, but Tanaka left it over the outer half of the plate.
It was a rare mistake, but with Keuchel on the mound the Yankees can’t seem to afford any.","In an era of hard and harder throwers, Keuchel, a left-hander with a House of David beard, is a throwback of another sort — a pitcher who cuts, fades and darts the ball in and out, living on the edges of the plate and rarely in the center of it. His fastball is a misnomer, barely eclipsing 90 miles per hour, but when it arrives it is accompanied by late, darting movement.

“He just lives on the corner,” Judge said. “He doesn’t miss his spot. If you go throughout the whole game, there wasn’t too many pitches over the heart of the plate and he just likes to live on the edges.”

And no matter whom the Yankees put in their lineup — only three hitters remained from the Yankees’ wild-card defeat two years ago — Keuchel baffles them.

On Friday night, rarely using his devastating changeup, he allowed four hits and one walk, and struck out a season-high 10 batters.

“He’s got so many plans out there,” said Correa, the Astros’ shortstop. “When Plan A is working, he sticks with it. When the sinker is moving and the gun is hitting 90, I know he’s going to be lights out.”

Keuchel said he could not pinpoint why he had so consistently thwarted the Yankees, but acknowledged getting fired up to pitch against them.

“It’s such a storied franchise and they have so much rich history that you almost don’t even have to get up for the game, you’re already up for it,” he said. “That’s what they bring. They have a lot of talented players, and this was supposed to be the bridge year for them and they weren’t supposed to be here. But they are because they are good and they are the Yankees.”

The Yankees’ best chance to get to Keuchel came in the fifth, when second baseman Jose Altuve uncharacteristically made a mistake to give New York an opening.

With Bird having led off the inning with a single, Altuve bobbled and booted Matt Holliday’s almost certain double-play grounder, leaving runners at first and second with none out. But Keuchel retired Todd Frazier on a soft liner to center and struck out Brett Gardner. That brought up Judge, who had walked and struck out in his first two at-bats.

Judge, who was 1 for 20 with 16 strikeouts in the division series against Cleveland, lined a slider to left for a base hit, but Gonzalez charged and fired a one-hop strike to catcher Brian McCann, who slapped the tag on Bird just before he reached home plate with his feet-first slide. Gonzalez, the Astros’ super-utility player, carried so much momentum into the throw that he tumbled to the turf on his follow-through.

“When I rounded the bag, I saw Mac and he didn’t just give up on the play,” said Bird, referring to McCann, a former Yankees teammate. “I could tell there was going to be a throw, there was going to be a play. I just slid straight in.”

Asked if he had any regrets, Bird smiled.

“I’m too slow,” he said. “I wish I was a little faster.”

Though there seemed to be little doubt that Bird was out, Manager Joe Girardi — who had been upbraided for not challenging a call in the first round of the playoffs — used one of his two challenges, just in case.

“Well, we thought he was out, but God knows I’m not doing that again,” Girardi said of not passing up the chance for a review.

The next best chance for the Yankees came when Keuchel departed. Gardner drew a one-out walk against Chris Devinski in the top of the eighth, prompting Giles to enter. After Gardner advanced to second on a wild pitch, Judge grounded out to third. Gary Sanchez followed with a walk and was replaced by pinch-runner Ronald Torreyes.

That brought up Didi Gregorius, who hit two home runs in the Yankees’ series-clinching win over Cleveland. But after fouling off a pair of 0-2 sliders, Gregorius swung through another one in the dirt.

Masahiro Tanaka had the unfortunate task of opposing Keuchel, just as he did in the 3-0 wild-card defeat in 2015. Though Tanaka had an up-and-down season, he recently rounded into top form, striking out a career-high 15 in his final regular-season start and delivering seven shutout innings in a 1-0 Game 3 victory that had kept the Yankees alive against Cleveland.

Still, there had to be some trepidation about sending him against the Astros.

No team has punished Tanaka like the Astros over the course of his career. He entered Friday night winless in five starts against them and having allowed 22 runs in 23⅓ innings. In his only start against the Astros this season, Tanaka gave up eight runs — and four homers — and lasted just one and two-thirds innings, the worst start in his four seasons in New York.

“His slider is going to have to have good break, his split is going to have to have that good downward plane like it did his last two starts,” Girardi said before the game. “If he does that, he’s going to be able to compete.’’

The Astros were intent on hitting the ball up the middle, and though they hit the ball hard in the first three innings, they had little to show for it. Altuve, Gonzalez and Alex Bregman all hit liners that ended up in the glove of center fielder Aaron Hicks.

But in the fourth their approach was rewarded. With one out, Altuve hit a grounder up the middle that second baseman Starlin Castro backhanded, but Altuve beat the throw. Altuve then stole second and scored when Correa lined a 2-1 slider, which Tanaka left up, into left field to put the Astros ahead, 1-0.

Correa advanced to second on Gonzalez’s groundout, then scored when Gurriel lined a single up the middle to put the Astros ahead, 2-0. The pitch was a fastball that catcher Gary Sanchez wanted inside, but Tanaka left it over the outer half of the plate.

Ms. Shroff cast aside the standard script of a defense lawyer, one that includes pleading the innocence of her client or trying to paint a sympathetic portrait of the man on trial.

“You can despise Mr. Rahimi for doing something so heinous as to leave a bomb on 27th Street,” she said. But, she maintained, jurors should not convict him of attempting to use that bomb. “The fact that the 27th Street bomb did not go off tells you Mr. Rahimi had no such intent,” she said.

Prosecutors, following her statement with their own rebuttal before jurors, called the defense theory “ridiculous” and “a cover story right out of the Al Qaeda playbook.”

“If the defendant had his way, there would have been bodies in the street,” Andrew J. DeFilippis, a prosecutor, told jurors. “A bank robber who goes into a bank and holds up a teller and his gun doesn’t work is still a bank robber.”

Mr. Rahimi was recorded on video leaving his second suitcase on West 27th Street, and a short while later, at 8:51 p.m., two men passing by stopped and opened the suitcase. They unknowingly removed the bomb — a pressure cooker connected to a cellphone with wires — and left with the suitcase. The alarm on the phone, which was designed to act as a trigger for the bomb, was set for 9 p.m., an F.B.I. agent testified, and in the government’s closing arguments on Thursday, a prosecutor said the men’s jostling of the device quite likely dislodged a wire.

Ms. Shroff countered with her own theory, and reminded jurors of a police detective’s testimony that when he arrived at the scene that night, the wires from the phone to the cooker were “taut,” and the bomb squad used a robot to sever them. Ms. Shroff said it was Mr. Rahimi who disabled the device.

The arguments might appear almost trivial — the night in question is not, after all, remembered as the night a bomb did not go off on West 27th Street. Several victims of the bombing on West 23rd Street described injuries both physical and psychological that they said still linger a year later.

But of the eight charges against Mr. Rahimi, two of them are for using an explosive in furtherance of a crime of violence — one charge for the West 23rd Street bomb, one for the one on West 27th Street. If convicted of both of those charges, Mr. Rahimi faces a mandatory life sentence. In arguing for an acquittal on the West 27th Street charges, Ms. Shroff hopes to avoid that outcome.

Convictions of other charges could lead to sentences as long as life, but that sentence would not be mandatory.

The day after the bombings, Mr. Rahimi left a backpack at a train station near his home in Elizabeth, N.J., containing six pipe bombs that could be ignited by lighting a traditional fuse. Ms. Shroff said he could have caused more harm with those bombs, but chose not to, which she said was more evidence that he meant no harm on West 27th Street.

Ms. Shroff seemed to ask jurors for nothing more than the narrow consideration of the second bomb.

Russell that had previously received a two-season commitment and was estimated to cost $160 million.

“We support Amazon’s decision as in light of recent news and out of respect for all those affected we have decided together that it is best to not move forward with this show,” Mr. Russell said in a statement with two stars of the series, Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore.

Mr. Weinstein, who was fired by his company on Sunday, has responded to allegations of sexual misconduct with a mix of contrition and combativeness. He is contesting his firing and has emphatically denied all allegations of rape. His spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, has said that he is in therapy and “is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.”

Only one person is known to have been permanently pushed out of the academy. Carmine Caridi, a character actor, had his membership revoked in 2004 for violating an academy rule involving Oscar voting. He got caught lending DVD screeners of contending films; copies ended up online. (In the 1990s, a couple of people were suspended temporarily for selling their allotted tickets to the Oscar ceremony.)

Even so, many people in Hollywood think the academy only has one option when it comes to Mr. Weinstein: Kick him out.

Censuring Mr. Weinstein, a fixture on the Oscar circuit for two decades who lived for the validation the awards gave him, would also be a chance for Hollywood to reckon with a past that includes rampant mistreatment of women — all the way back to the days of Mayer and his fellow good-old-boy studio chiefs.

“The idea that anyone would give him a second chance or entertain that notion that he can change is beyond absurd,” Terry Press, the president of CBS Films, wrote on Facebook of Mr. Weinstein. “If the academy does not kick him out, I am resigning my academy membership.”

But ousting Mr. Weinstein would put the academy on a slippery slope, said Martin Kaplan, the director of the Norman Lear Center for the study of entertainment and society at the University of Southern California. “It would move them into adjudicating behavior,” Mr. Kaplan said. “There are plenty of other members with a history of abominable offscreen actions. What kind of bad behavior counts and what doesn’t? What is the red line?”’

If it does nothing, however, the academy risks looking like a shield for Mr. Weinstein — the embodiment of Hollywood aiding and abetting, if only by looking the other way. That is the last thing the academy needs, especially given the work it has done in recent years to address severe racial and gender imbalances in its membership. In January 2016, after two years of #OscarsSoWhite outrage, the academy vowed to double female and minority membership by 2020. As it now stands, the academy has about 8,400 members, with women constituting 28 percent and minorities 13 percent.

The academy declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein beyond a statement it released midweek.

“The academy finds the conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent and antithetical to the high standards of the academy and the creative community it represents,” the statement said.

Mr. Weinstein’s power in Hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the Academy Awards. He was at his height in the late 1990s, when he drove films like “Shakespeare in Love” to best-picture wins and huge ticket sales. Even in a diminished state more recently, he remained a player, prodding the tiny art film “Lion” to six nominations this year.

In total, Mr. Weinstein has overseen campaigns that have resulted in more than 300 Academy Award nominations and best-picture Oscars for “Shakespeare in Love,” “The English Patient,” “Chicago,” “The King’s Speech” and “The Artist.” In addition to his one Oscar win, Mr. Weinstein also holds one nomination, for producing “Gangs of New York.”

Seven months ago, Mr. Weinstein was in his element when he hosted the Weinstein Company’s annual pre-Oscars party at the Montage Beverly Hills hotel. The festivities included a performance of songs from “In the Heights” introduced by Mr. Miranda. When two latecomers – Jay-Z and Beyoncé – entered the ballroom, Mr. Weinstein asked that the songs be performed again.

WASHINGTON — Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke vowed Friday that there would be “no quarter” for employees who sexually harass or discriminate against colleagues. He said he would dismiss anyone found guilty of harassment and supervisors who sweep such charges under the rug.

“I have no problem removing manager after manager until there are none left,” Secretary Zinke, a former member of the Navy SEALs, told employees at Grand Canyon National Park, according to prepared remarks made public earlier in the day. “Intimidation, harassment and discrimination are viruses within an operation, and we’re going to eradicate them.”

After Secretary Zinke’s remarks, he and the acting National Park Service director, Michael T. Reynolds, answered questions from park employees in a closed meeting, which primarily focused on how agency managers would deal with reports of bullying and intimidation. The park was rocked by scandal after Sally Jewell, who was Interior Secretary under President Obama, received a request for investigation from 13 former and current employees in the Grand Canyon River District, citing an “intimidating, hostile, or sexually offensive work environment.”

The district was shut down after the Office of the Inspector General found what it called a 15-year-failure to address numerous reports of abuse and harassment, including male workers trying to take intimate photos of female colleagues, groping and physical assault, and withholding food on river trips after sexual advances were rejected.

Q: I’ve heard conflicting advice whether to reveal my current salary when asked. How should I answer such question when asked during an interview?

-Sandy W.

A: Sandy, the reason you’ve heard conflicting advice is that, well, there is always a danger in a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach. If you’re making good money in your current job and want to set the bar at a decent minimum for any discussions, I think it makes sense to go first and say, “This is what I’m making now.” Implicit in that is that you expect a premium above what you’re making to switch jobs.

If you think you’d be coming in at the low end, it can be smart to ask them what they typically pay for someone in that role.

From that point on, the negotiation will depend on the leverage of each side. It’s also up to you how hard you want to negotiate. As long as you can build a clear and factual case for why you deserve X, that’s a fine conversation to have. Any work you can do ahead of time to get a sense of what the company pays is also useful for such discussions.

The final point is about your temperament. I’ve seen some people negotiate so hard that it adds a real sour note to the start of a working relationship.",What’s the Best Approach to Negotiating Your Salary?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/smarter-living/career-advice-negotiating-salary.html

“When people say, ‘Don’t worry about the Jerry Robbins,’” Ms. Tanowitz said, choking on a horrified laugh.
“I try to breathe a lot when I’m playing,” Ms. Dinnerstein said, “and I try to think a lot about singing, or other instruments.
Aaron Greenwald, the executive director of Duke Performances, which commissioned the piece with Peak Performances, recommended Ms. Tanowitz to Ms. Dinnerstein.
After watching one of her programs, Ms. Dinnerstein was struck by the connection between the choreography and the music.","As usual, intricate steps are bountiful in her choreography for “New Work.” But there is also space and air between them. “This piece has been an exercise in restraint,” she continued. “I’m allowing myself to do things that I haven’t done in the past: to let certain things flow.”

Ms. Tanowitz’s dances brim with inventive footwork and rigorous, often stringent choreography, in which the influence of Merce Cunningham is often apparent, yet the Bach has unleashed a more humane lushness in her approach.

Growing up in New Rochelle, N.Y., Ms. Tanowitz studied modern dance at the Steffi Nossen School of Dance. She was never a member of a major dance company, but when she attended graduate school at Sarah Lawrence College, she met Viola Farber, the former Merce Cunningham dancer, who became a mentor.

“She loved dancing, just dancing,” Ms. Tanowitz said, “And she gave me that love of dancing back.”

Ms. Tanowitz is passionate about dance history, like her mentor was; she frequently includes references to works by an older generation in both ballet and the modern vernacular. That’s another reason she was intimidated by Bach. His music has been used by many choreographers over the years, but most nail-bitingly for her, by Jerome Robbins, whose celebrated “The Goldberg Variations” was made for New York City Ballet in 1971.

“When people say, ‘Don’t worry about the Jerry Robbins,’” Ms. Tanowitz said, choking on a horrified laugh. “I’m like, no — I’m worried about the Jerry Robbins.”

But in watching the Stephen Petronio Company perform Steve Paxton’s “Excerpt From Goldberg Variations” (1986) as part of the company’s Bloodlines series earlier this year, she had a realization: “Not everything’s been done,” she said. “I feel energized in a way that I haven’t in a long time, because I actually see more possibility, not less.”

In many ways, that has to do with Ms. Dinnerstein’s approach to the Bach, one that Ms. Tanowitz described as “holistic.” Her idea to collaborate with a choreographer came from imagining the music through breathing and movement and steps — perhaps not surprising for a musician who discovered the piano through her dance classes. (She studied ballet when she was a child and living in Rome.)

“I try to breathe a lot when I’m playing,” Ms. Dinnerstein said, “and I try to think a lot about singing, or other instruments. Actually any instrument other than the piano. The piano’s such a mechanical instrument that you have to use your imagination to create these breaths, because you don’t need to breathe when you play.”

Aaron Greenwald, the executive director of Duke Performances, which commissioned the piece with Peak Performances, recommended Ms. Tanowitz to Ms. Dinnerstein. After watching one of her programs, Ms. Dinnerstein was struck by the connection between the choreography and the music.

In “New Work,” the dancers — one man and six women, including the stellar veterans Maile Okamura, Melissa Toogood and Netta Yerushalmy — perform around Ms. Dinnerstein’s piano, which is in the center of the stage. As she plays, she can feel the dancers moving. “Playing that piece requires an enormous amount of focus and concentration,” she said. “Without dancers, it’s a hard piece to perform.”

But when they’re running around her, she looks at them. She wants to interact. “I’m trying to have the freedom to play it differently each time so that I can be in dialogue with them,” she said. “At the same time, I can’t lose my place.”

Ms. Dinnerstein laughed: “It’s really complicated because I don’t want to get them confused if I get confused. I want to be solid for them and at the same time I want to be free — and for all of us to be free when I’m playing.”

While Ms. Dinnerstein has been present at many rehearsals, she has also spent time with Ms. Tanowitz in private talking her through the music. At one point, early in the process, Ms. Tanowitz’s confidence wavered; Ms. Dinnerstein said Ms. Tanowitz felt the need to completely understand the music — in both its construction and its history.

“I have similar kinds of fears,” Ms. Dinnerstein said. “I’m not an intellectual musician — I don’t think from the point of a historian or a theoretician, but more in terms of aesthetics. I think that’s how Pam is too. She is extremely smart, but she really listens to her instincts.”

In that moment, Ms. Tanowitz had been intimidated by the sweeping scale of the Goldberg; she feared that she didn’t have enough dancers to express its architecture. But she has come to realize that because the music is so structured, she has more space to express her personality.

“I thought it was going to be the opposite,” she said. “When I have more freedom, I actually feel like I’m covering my tracks more. I have to have more of a mask. I don’t need to do that with the Bach.”

Because it’s so revered, she can be herself. And as far as setting her movement to Bach? “I’ve been fighting against it my whole life,” she said. “Maybe it’s that I have new confidence. I wanted to push against the formal structure of Bach. To me, this feels risky.”",Who’s Afraid of ‘Goldberg Variations’?

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

Then there was the Ad Council, the same industry organization that turned Smokey Bear into a cultural icon. The council sponsored the crusade as a public service, arranging for broadcasters to run ads without charge. The Ad Council’s sponsorship translated into as much as $2 billion worth of free advertising over the campaign’s history, in 2017 dollars.

The message was simple: Russia was aggressive; Communism was awful. The enemy couldn’t be trusted. Typical ads conveyed a brutalized vision of life behind the Iron Curtain: “a strip of Communist-controlled hell-on-earth,” one read. Donating a few bucks would save Czechs, Poles, Hungarians and others from this tyranny. Many thousands of Americans took the bait. They dutifully wrote checks to Radio Free Europe, and their contributions were magnified by gifts from many of the country’s biggest corporations, yielding, on average, about $1 million annually.

It wasn’t enough: The donations barely covered the cost of running the “fund-raising drives,” to say nothing of Radio Free Europe’s $30 million annual budgets. But that wasn’t the point.

Declassified documents reveal that almost from the start, the C.I.A. saw that it could exploit the fund-raising campaign as a conduit for domestic propaganda. It was a way to rally public support for the Cold War by dramatizing Communist repression and stoking fears of a worldwide menace. The plight of Eastern Europe brought moral clarity to the Cold War, and it cemented the region as a vital national interest in American domestic politics.

Photo

Its impact outlived the campaign itself. Even though the pleas for donations ended in 1971, when the C.I.A. was exposed and stopped funding the station, they cemented anti-Communist hostility that animated conservative opposition to détente in the 1970s. It provided the leitmotif for Reagan’s denunciations of the “evil empire” in the 1980s. One can even hear echoes in Donald Trump’s recent speech to the United Nations: His long digression on the evils of socialism seems drawn from the heated rhetoric of ads gone by.

So, too, does our post-truth media environment carry voices from this past. The crusade blasted all information from enemy sources as lies and deceit — fake news, we could say. This counter-propaganda sought to inoculate the public from being receptive to anything said by the other side. It’s a tactic we’ve seen play out in real time on the president’s Twitter feed.

And almost certainly, Radio Free Europe itself — which continues to operate out of its headquarters in Prague — has shaped Vladimir Putin’s worldview. Russia has long tried to claim Eastern Europe as its sphere of influence. Moscow hated the station for its meddling. As a K.G.B. officer, Mr. Putin no doubt spent many hours fretting over its activities in the Soviet bloc. It was a major irritant. He may even see the 2016 election hack as a way to even the score.

Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.
“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote.","To those among us fortunate enough to have known old-timers who regaled us with tales of tabloid derring-do, New York was once a place of outrageous characters both in front of and behind the camera. Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Do you ever feel your jaw immediately hit the ground the moment you look at a grid for the first time? Well, that was certainly the case for me today. Joe Krozel has been known to create some inventive puzzles in the past, and this one was no exception.

There’s a black square pattern resembling an animal in the grid’s center, and yet, the triple-stacked, nine-letter answers in the top-left corner make it appear to be themeless. And those orphaned five letters at 35A? What exactly is going on?

Today’s Theme

Turns out that Mr. Krozel wants us to put on our blindfolds to understand this theme. The revealer, 44D, indicates that the figure in the center is a PIÑATA. This also explains the black squares that connect to it; they represent the piñata’s thread.

Yet how are we supposed to nail 35A without any crossings to check? Take a look at the notepad accompanying the puzzle:

“Two letters of the alphabet are missing from the main, connected portion of the completed grid. What are they? The answer goes, appropriately, at 35-Across.”

A thorough scan of the grid conveys that every letter of the alphabet has been used at least once except for C and Y. Hold up. C. AND. Y. CANDY!

Signs of Rigidity

Our society is, in my opinion, well above average when it comes to rigidity compared to other Western democracies. We set rules and associated punishments for any wrongdoing we can predict.

You only have to look at driving signs in Sydney to see that. It takes a minute to read them. I think it might even be illegal to read them, such are the risks to your health and other road users’ health.

Who decides the rules, and who are the ‘risky’ subjects? You mentioned those of overseas cultures, but I would add Indigenous Australians and drug addicts to the mix. So often rules are made that make middle-class mums and dads feel safer and more assured, even though they and their families were rarely, if ever, affected by the activities the rules limit or outlaw.

— Ned Cooper

Larrikins United

I’m really surprised at your impression re. rule breakers versus rule followers. I break every rule under the sun, have done so all my life (I’m 66) and I think that pretty much all my peers do the same. So I guess it’s a matter of perception.

— Neil Bolton

Say No to Pregnancy

I had a two-month job as a visiting professor in the United States a couple of years back. The rules to get in for a non-American were astounding. As as woman of more than 70 years I had to insure myself against pregnancy, among other things, in order to be approved. I raised this as a patent absurdity and was told, don’t worry, it’s not discrimination, men have to get the same insurance.

The rule under no condition could be waived.

Personal Responsibility

I’m Australian and I’ve lived in Sydney for all 27 years of my life, though I like to think I am well traveled — don’t we all? I’m also a lawyer.

The reason Australians are sticklers for the rules, and the reason they are so hesitant to stray, is that they absolutely abhor the concept of personal responsibility in a way few other countries do.

If something goes wrong, it’s not the person’s fault. Rather, it’s that the regulatory framework for that arena of human behavior isn’t effective enough. More laws! Won’t someone please think of the children.

The best example I can think of was when, following a drunken man drowning in Circular Quay, the government proposed a fence. People actually agreed! Because of one drunk man. More mundane examples abound.

Freedom!

I was in the butterfly house at the Melbourne Zoo with my daughter a few months ago admiring the elegant little creatures as they landed on the arms and shoulders of visitors. The beautiful delicate wings so full of colour when all of a sudden an Indian man grabbed a butterfly by the wings and starting waving the poor creature in front of his elderly mother’s face.

Maybe she was blind and he was just trying to let her see it close up but before I knew it I was saying “NO, NO, you cannot do that. You will hurt the poor creature.” Of course they didn’t really understand English that well so just thought I was scared of the butterfly until I started waving my finger disapprovingly like a butterfly lover in distress.

Afterward I did feel really bad, I felt terrible for making someone feel bad when they were just appreciating nature’s wonders, especially a visitor. Maybe it was the closet zoologist in me, who completed the degree but never worked a day in the field, trying to do my bit for animal conservation.

I found myself being extra polite as we passed each other many more times in the tight confines of an overcrowded butterfly house, insisting the elderly mother go before me as we both approached the exit.

I think next time I’ll try to resist the impulse and leave it to natural selection; the butterfly did fly off unharmed of course.

Immigrants Seeking Guidance

I think your daughter was right.

You should have, with the greatest of courtesy, drawn their attention to the “no feeding” rule. If they had been reasonable people they would have been grateful to you for pointing it out.

Speaking as a long-term immigrant to Britain, I can say through personal experience that often it is not a case of (usually newly arrived) immigrants not following the rules. It’s a case of not knowing what the rules are: standing in a queue, not throwing litter out of a car, not interrupting while someone is speaking, remembering to top and tail requests with “please” and “thank you.”

It is not that we have some fundamental objection to doing (or not doing) these things: It’s more that often we don’t know what needs to be done. Somebody please tell us — we want to learn, and through learning save ourselves some embarrassment!

— Vani K. Borooah

Rules and Images

Another interesting quandary I have encountered in my career as a teacher is of migrant families requesting a school for a white Australian blue-eyed blonde teacher for their child over a “brown” teacher — it makes for a proud display of the class photo to relatives back home, signaling they have finally “arrived” in Australia and raising their prestige in society.

Would this classify as a hangover of colonization, discrimination or market forces in the independent education sector, where if you are paying exorbitant school fees you can bend the rules to get what you want?

— Ipshita Nair

Don’t Rock the Boat

In not calling someone out on breaking the rules, it’s because it’s much less hassle and it’s being “too serious” and the rule being broken is “harmless.”

It’s just bread. It’s just food. It’s not a big deal. It’s just a couple of kilometers over the limit, it’s just some paper with your name signed on it and a label of “married.”

This extends from all manner of interpersonal interaction on the social and professional level all the way into our politicians — who are too busy calling each other names for a laugh than being serious for five minutes.

The problem is, we don’t really draw a line.

That’s because we can’t help but want to fit into the way our society runs — the casual, hands-off, “nah, she’ll be right mate” approach to everything that is so deeply ingrained in our culture that we struggle to care enough to change anything for fear of being called out — not for breaking the rules, but for disturbing the peaceful, carefree status quo we’ve established.

‘Compliance Nation’

I am not suggesting that we become a nation of rule breakers but Australia is truly a “Compliance Nation” progressively getting worse. And unfortunately a general ambivalence by the population is letting it happen.

A New York Times investigation that chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein continued to ripple through Hollywood all week. By Sunday evening, his entertainment company fired him. Then new accusations emerged.

Several actresses have now come forward and spoken to or emailed my colleagues about their own experiences with Mr. Weinstein. “We’re at a point in time when women need to send a clear message that this is over,” Gwyneth Paltrow said. “This way of treating women ends now.”

Wondering what kind of work to pursue? Or how to design the life you want?

Millie Tran, our global growth editor, recently shared a presentation she had put together on that topic, pulling from her own life and unorthodox career path. Many of her friends and colleagues (me included) found it valuable and insightful — and so rather than keep it private, someone smarter than me adapted it for the Smarter Living newsletter (sign up here).

P.S. — On a related note, we just announced a new gender editor: Jessica Bennett, the author of “Feminist Fight Club.” I’ll be back at some point with more on Jess in this newsletter and in our Facebook group for subscribers, but here’s an interview with her that lays out what lies ahead.",Aussie Rules: Readers Respond,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/australia/letter29-aussie-rules-readers-respond.html

It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units.
ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months.
According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.
“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint.","Two levels of charging are typically available in residential settings. Level 1 is a standard AC outlet that provides between 1 and 1.5 kilowatts of electricity. It takes a Level 1 charger about 30 hours to fully charge the electric version of the Ford Focus, which has a range of 115 miles. Level 2 uses a professionally installed charger connected to a 240-volt AC outlet — the kind used by some large appliances — and delivers between 7 and 9 kilowatts, lowering the charge time to about 5.5 hours.

Some commercial charging locations offer more advanced technology, employing so-called fast chargers. These offer about 50 kilowatts of DC power, enabling the same Ford Focus to reach 90 miles of range in 30 minutes (battery chemistry causes charging to go more slowly after a battery is 80 percent full). The electric carmaker Tesla has a proprietary “supercharger” for its vehicles that provides 120 kilowatts of power, adding 300 miles of range in 75 minutes.

A new generation of charging points, the first of which are being installed in Europe this year, offer 350 kilowatts of power. Such a jump would slash charging times to 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the vehicle’s range, according to Charlie Yankitis, director of business development for the German manufacturer Bosch’s electric vehicle unit. Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder, has hinted that charging at even faster rates was being studied.

Several companies are making big bets on the technology.

Electrify America, the Volkswagen subsidiary, is planning on installing such high-capacity chargers along highway corridors throughout the United States. It is investing $2 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and education nationwide, $800 million of which is earmarked for California alone.

By the end of 2020, Electrify America plans to have built 350 Level 2 charging sites in urban areas in California, like workplaces and apartment buildings. It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units. A further 540 are to be built elsewhere in the country in that time.

ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months. But its chief executive, Pasquale Romano, did not specify how many.

Similar pushes are being made elsewhere. In Europe, the German automotive giants BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen have joined with Ford in a joint venture to install 350-kilowatt chargers across the Continent. They will start installing them this year, initially planning to get 400 fast-charging sites up and running, with “thousands” in place by 2020.

“We’re looking for similar solutions across the globe,” said Mike Tinskey, Ford’s global director of electrification and infrastructure.

There are, however, hurdles that need to be overcome.

For one, standards differ across manufacturers and regions. Today’s commercial chargers use three different kinds of plugs that are not entirely compatible. In practice, a Chevrolet, Nissan or Volkswagen cannot be charged at a Tesla charger. A Tesla, however, can use an adapter plug to charge at standard commercial stations, and Electrify America says its charging stations will be compatible with a variety of plugs.

Another issue: No vehicle on the road today is able to use the 350-kilowatt fast-charging stations. It is not a simple upgrade: High-speed charging requires thicker cables that won’t get too hot.

No automakers have indicated when they will sell cars equipped to accept such fast charges. Porsche’s Mission E electric vehicle is expected to be available by 2020, and will be able to charge to a 250-mile range in 15 minutes, according to the carmaker. Electrify America and ChargePoint say they expect vehicles capable of accepting 350-killowatt chargers to be available by 2019.

Utilities will also have to upgrade their infrastructure, a change for which California is already preparing.

Under the state’s zero emission regulations, every manufacturer must sell a certain number of emission-free vehicles, calculated as a proportion of overall sales. Consequently, California has become the hub for the mass installation of fast charging points. One of the state’s utility companies, Southern California Edison, estimates that 25 percent of its network must be upgraded to support new chargers.

“We hope we’ll be ready for fast charging when Electrify America is ready to install it,” said Caroline Choi, the utility’s senior vice president of regulatory affairs.

For now, the number of charging stations remains relatively low. According to the Department of Energy, there are just over 16,000 public electric vehicle charging points in the United States, offering about 44,000 individual outlets of varying charging speeds. By comparison, there are 120,000 gas stations nationwide, many of which have 10 or more pumps.

So customers will have to stick to charging an electric vehicle whenever it’s not being used, much as they already do with smartphones and tablets.

According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.

“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint.

Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area.","Privacy is also good, particularly for tasks that require intense concentration, the thinking goes. That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

His left-coiled shell wasn’t the only thing making it hard to find him a mate. His organs, including his genitals, also turned counterclockwise. Mating with righty snails was impossible. Last November, two potential partners (Lefty of Ipswich, England and Tomeu of Majorca, Spain) were brought to Nottingham.

All of the babies were born with a right-handed shell. This means the gene causing a snail’s directional twist (and body asymmetry in other animals), described last year in Current Biology, could take more than a generation for its recessive form to appear.

Once it does, Dr. Davison hopes genetic studies will reveal why the snails are so rare — and what sort of genetic switches may drive their bodies to turn one way instead of the other. The knowledge he gains studying the slimy shell-dwellers will also provide insight about body asymmetries that develop in other animals, including humans. About one in 10,000 people (like Catherine O’Hara, Enrique Iglesias and Donny Osmond) have situs inversus, a rare disease, that flips their internal organ arrangement like an image in a mirror.

Jeremy had been sluggish since February, and had hibernated in the fridge, on and off since. He was fine last Friday, Oct. 6, the day the hatchlings were born; by the time Dr. Davison returned to check on him Wednesday, he was dead. He had likely been decomposing for a couple days.

“I should have put Jeremy in the freezer to preserve his DNA on Friday, but I thought so many people will be sad if Jeremy is no longer,” Dr. Davison said. “I didn’t do that, and it was a mistake.” His DNA degraded from the state it was in on Friday, so genetic analyses will be tougher.

In a video made during their captivity, Ms. Coleman, who is from Pennsylvania, said that she had been “defiled.” Visibly angry, Mr. Boyle said on Friday that his wife had been raped by a guard with the assistance of the guard’s superiors. He demanded action against “criminal miscreants” for their actions against his family.

Ms. Coleman and the three children did not appear. The Toronto Star reported that they were being taken by a police van for a four-hour drive to the home of Mr. Boyle’s parents in Smiths Falls, Ontario.

The brief statement from Mr. Boyle only raised further questions about why the couple were in Afghanistan when they were abducted. Until Friday, their family had said they were backpacking.

But in his statement, Mr. Boyle said they had been in the country on a mission to help “the most neglected minority group in the world, those ordinary villagers who live deep inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.” He also described himself as a “pilgrim,” and said they had been in a region that government and aid agencies had failed to reach, suggesting that their effort was self-styled.

The Associated Press reported that on the plane from London to Toronto, Ms. Coleman sat in the aisle of the business-class cabin wearing a tan-color head scarf and nodded wordlessly to confirm her identity to a reporter onboard the flight. Their two oldest children sat next to her, while Mr. Boyle sat with their youngest child in his lap.

State Department officials accompanied them on the plane.

President Trump has praised the Pakistanis for their role in freeing the family. “This is a positive moment for our country’s relationship with Pakistan,” he said on Thursday.

During the flight, Mr. Boyle also gave a handwritten statement to The A.P. expressing disagreement with American foreign policy.

“God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination, and to allow that to stagnate, to pursue personal pleasure or comfort while there is still deliberate and organized injustice in the world would be a betrayal of all I believe, and tantamount to sacrilege,” he wrote.

He then nodded to one of the State Department officials and said, according to The A.P., “Their interests are not my interests.”",Canadian Held Hostage in Afghanistan Says Militants Killed His Child,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/world/canada/canadian-american-hostages-daughter.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.”

For his part, Mr. Weinstein acknowledged, in a larger statement to The New York Post, that his actions could have a negative impact on Ms. Chapman’s company. Marchesa’s public profile depended largely on its connection to Hollywood — the label does not advertise — and, fair or not, Ms. Chapman and her line are now swept up in this unfolding story.

The refrain from major department stores in response to requests for comment? “We just don’t want to be part of this story.”

But that is unavoidable. Fashion is already deeply involved.

Not just because on Tuesday a petition was begun by Care2 asking Nordstrom to drop the Donna Karan and DKNY lines in response to Ms. Karan’s comments (though she herself is no longer involved with either label).

And not just because fashion has its own history with sexual harassment and the poor treatment of young women, including increasingly documented abuses of models and the many claims against the photographer Terry Richardson (who, after some time away, is still working in the industry).

Mr. Weinstein, more than perhaps any film executive of the modern era, seemed to understand the role fashion could play as he built an upmarket brand in which box office performance was important, but so were glitter and good reviews.

He introduced “Project Runway.” Along with the shoe designer Tamara Mellon he was instrumental in the revival of Halston, for which he corralled Sarah Jessica Parker, the celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe (who often dressed her clients in Marchesa) and the private equity firm Hilco as partners. He licensed the option to revive the Charles James brand the same year the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art featured a Charles James exhibition.

When actresses from his films campaigned for Oscars, there and elsewhere, guess whose dresses they often wore?

“We all knew celebrities were asked to wear Marchesa if they were in a Weinstein movie,” said the co-owner of a fashion communications company who asked not to be identified. “They were supposed to wear it at least once. We all knew that cycle.”

Going all the way back to his days at Miramax, the first of two studios Mr. Weinstein co-founded, he put out fashion-themed films.

In 1994, Mr. Weinstein released Robert Altman’s “Prêt-à-Porter.” In 2009, he acquired the North American distribution rights for “A Single Man,” the designer Tom Ford’s debut film. In 2011, he acquired Madonna’s “W.E.,” a period drama about Wallis Simpson in which the gowns were almost the only thing that got good notices.

Mr. Ford would never have held up Mr. Weinstein as the poster boy for how to treat women.

Still, Mr. Ford said Thursday, it was a far cry from what was revealed over the last week and a half, through two exposés in The New York Times outlining allegations of a pattern of sexual harassment and assault and a third from The New Yorker detailing accusations of rape.

“What Harvey has done is shocking, indefensible and disturbing on many levels,” Mr. Ford said. “I knew that Harvey certainly liked beautiful young women.” But, he added: “I had no idea of his predatory and abusive behavior or that he had paid settlements to anyone.” Mr. Ford noted that since he himself is a gay man, Mr. Weinstein’s “sex life would certainly not have been something that he would have felt the need to share with me.”

Ms. Parker collaborated with Mr. Weinstein at Halston. “Over the last two decades, through various projects, I’ve always maintained a relationship with him that I was, for the most part, comfortable with,” she said. “Now I feel he is a stranger, that I didn’t know him at all. And desperately sad to hear how so many women have suffered.”

And Ms. Mellon, referring to sexual predation, concurred: “I never saw anything like that. That behavior usually happens when no else is watching and in private. If I had seen it, I would have stopped it. I only ever witnessed raging and threats, but that was toward me and I pushed back when he did that.”

Mr. Weinstein’s increased presence on the fashion circuit seemed to coincide with his shrinking presence in the film world. Optics had always been essential to his prestige brand, so it made some sense that he leaned on an industry selling illusions to help maintain his myth. The razzle-dazzle of Harvey and his wife on red carpets all over the world was a good distraction when fewer awards were coming his way.

“Project Runway” helped, too. It made stars out of the designer Michael Kors, the model Heidi Klum and the editor Nina Garcia. Lauren Zalaznick, then the head of the Bravo network, where the show debuted, said: “On the surface, of course, it was a logical extension into TV. But what it really did was help build a firmer network within the fashion and publishing industries. It lent even more proximity to the power of relationships with designers, editors and models, and the scepter of magazine covers, more and different awards, political and socially minded fund-raisers, and the attendant money, glamour and even more power that comes along with that territory.”

A spinoff, “Project Runway All Stars,” which debuted in 2012, features Ms. Chapman as a judge; the next season has already been filmed.

Mr. Weinstein was a key fund-raiser for amfAR, whose gala during the Cannes Film Festival is the most fashion-centric event on the movie festival circuit. Ms. Klum was honored by the organization in 2013.

LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate, has a 1 percent stake in the Weinstein Company. In 2007, Mr. Weinstein wrote the profile of Mr. Arnault for the Time 100 most influential people list. In 2011, he told The Wall Street Journal, “When I wasn’t doing so well, Anna would give a party and put me next to Bernard Arnault.”

A person familiar with LVMH said the two men barely knew each other.

Mr. Weinstein was also a regular at the Met Gala, which has been co-chaired by Ms. Wintour since 1999, and at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards. (In 2016, there were plans for the Weinstein Company to produce a television special on the CFDA awards, but it fell through, Mr. Kolb said, when they realized that the event was not paced for television.) Mr. Weinstein appeared in front rows, including those of Marchesa, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Burberry.

It was at a fashion show that the actress Léa Seydoux met Mr. Weinstein, she wrote in The Guardian. He then requested a private meeting with her, she said, which quickly turned inappropriate. (She also wrote about watching him pursue another woman at the Met Gala.) The model turned actress Cara Delevingne recently accused Mr. Weinstein of pursuing her and repeating to her details of her personal life as reported in the tabloids.

Trish Goff, a model who was a regular in the pages of Vogue and appeared in campaigns for Chanel and Dior, said she met Mr. Weinstein at a cocktail party at Ms. Wintour’s house in 2003 when she was 25. “He came in and someone said, ‘Oh, there’s Harvey Weinstein,’ so I turned to look at him, and he was looking at me,” she said. Shortly thereafter her agent got a call from his office inviting her to lunch.

She recalled: “This was at a time in my career when I was starting to think about what’s next. I was nervous about it, because he had a reputation, but I was equally nervous about not going because I was a single mother, and what if he made it so I didn’t work anymore? So I said, ‘O.K., tell him I’ll have lunch.’”

They ended up at the Tribeca Grill. “When I arrived, I discovered we were seated in a private room,” she said. “I asked him why he had wanted to have lunch, and he said ‘You were looking at me’ — as if to imply I was interested. I said, ‘Yes, I was looking at you because you are Harvey Weinstein, and I had never seen you before.’

“Then he started asking me if I had a boyfriend, and if we had an open relationship. I said I wasn’t interested in an open relationship, but he was relentless, and I kept trying to shut that down and move on. Then he started putting his hands on my legs, and I said, ‘Can you stop doing that?’ When we finally stood up to go, he really started groping me, grabbing my breasts, grabbing my face and trying to kiss me. I kept saying, ‘Please stop, please stop, but he didn’t until I managed to get back into the public space.

“The horrible thing is, as a model, it wasn’t that unusual to be in a weird situation where a photographer or someone feels they have a right to your body.”

Ms. Hofmeister, Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, said he could not be reached for comment on Ms. Goff’s allegations and directed a reporter to a previous statement denying allegations of nonconsensual sex.

Now Marchesa has become yet another symbol of Mr. Weinstein’s abuse of power, a brand he helped mastermind and support. There is now a #boycottmarchesa hashtag on Twitter. Helzberg Diamonds, which held the license for Marchesa’s bridal jewelry, announced it had delayed the planned line.

“The relationship helped the business tremendously,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor of Town & Country. “Marchesa had such great success on the red carpet and became known for that.” (Ms. Chapman appeared on the cover of the magazine in 2009.)

The label, which was founded in 2004 by Ms. Chapman and Keren Craig, first received real attention that same year, when Renée Zellweger, the star of the Miramax film “Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,” appeared on the red carpet in a Marchesa dress. She was followed shortly thereafter by Cate Blanchett, who wore Marchesa to the Rome premiere of “The Aviator,” also produced by Miramax.

In recent years, Marchesa’s red-carpet magic has dimmed and its celebrity placements have lost a bit of their star power, yet the label’s princess-y dresses still found eager takers. In 2017, Octavia Spencer, who has appeared in movies produced by Mr. Weinstein, wore a custom Marchesa gown to the Academy Awards, when she was nominated for her role in “Hidden Figures.”

When stars did wear the label, there was often a connection to Mr. Weinstein. Jennifer Jason Leigh wore Marchesa to the Academy Awards in 2016, when she was a nominee for her role in “The Hateful Eight,” directed by Quentin Tarantino (and executive-produced by the Weinstein brothers).

But Hollywood stylists who work with such stars and fashion houses to find dresses for premieres, award shows and red carpet events, appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach on the label. Of a half-dozen top stylists who have used Marchesa, not one would comment on how the Weinstein revelations would have an impact on their use of Marchesa.

“There’s a mob mentality that has developed,” said Lauren Santo Domingo, a founder of Moda Operandi, an online fashion retailer, who said she was standing behind Marchesa. On Wednesday, the brand postponed a planned preview of its spring 2018 collection to an unspecified “later date.” The company is hunkering down, and could not be reached for comment.

“I think the issue is no one knows what to say to Georgina, or the words to use,” Mr. Kolb said. “But as a creative power and as a CFDA member, she is someone who deserves the industry’s support and backing.”

Indeed, said Julie Gilhart, a fashion consultant and the former fashion director of Barneys New York: “We are living in a time right now when we should try to find the words.”",Fashion Breaks Its Silence on Harvey Weinstein Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/style/harvey-weinstein-marchesa-georgina-chapman-anna-wintour.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

But the trajectory from mostly black clubs to more mainstream venues to even more mainstream TV and movies is a familiar one to almost any breakout African-American comic, Mr. Pharoah noted.

“Jamie Foxx, Tommy Davidson, Chris Rock, Bernie Mac, even Eddie Murphy,” he said. “We know the chitlin circuit very well.”

A gifted mimic from a young age, Mr. Pharoah began performing standup as a teenager near his hometown, Chesapeake, Va., before being introduced to the comic Charlie Murphy (“Chappelle’s Show”), who took him on the road for several years. That led to appearances on BET and a spot in the cast of “Saturday Night Live” in 2010. That stint lasted until he was fired from the show last fall, a surprising move that Lorne Michaels has said was part of an effort to refresh the cast.

In an interview with the radio station Hot 97 in April, Mr. Pharoah complained that producers tried to pigeonhole him as an impressionist and took issue when he refused certain proposals, like wearing a dress in a sketch. (The first episode of “White Famous” includes a dilemma over a cross-dressing role, a charged issue among African-American comics.) But these days he’s more diplomatic. He declined to revisit his departure from “Saturday Night Live,” calling the show a key step in a career that is “finally starting to break open” with film roles in Steven Soderbergh’s “Unsane” and the animated “The Adventures of Drunky.”

Over scrambled eggs and veggie sausage, Mr. Pharoah discussed “White Famous,” awkward culture gaps and his grandmother’s meatloaf. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Did you know Jamie Foxx before this?

When he came to ‘S.N.L.’ in 2012, he was just like [goes into frenetic Foxx impersonation], ‘You are so talented. I know what you got, you got something special.’ We’ve kept in contact over the years but we hadn’t done any projects together.

[Affects a classic uptight Caucasian voice] ‘He’s talking like that? And who does he hang around?’ So you’ll see both sides: You’ll see me with my best friend, Ron Balls (Jacob Ming-Trent), and we’ll be talking real neighborhood. Then you’ll see me go into a place and be a little toned down, a little cautious. That’s how it is for me. I’m talking to you right now and I’m like, ‘Ah this is The New York Times …’

This could be a scene in the show.

Yeah, really. [In the white accent] ‘So it all started when I was conceived, I was a twinkle in my father’s eye …’ Or my mother’s. I don’t know where the twinkle goes.

Have there been awkward moments that arise from that culture gap?

Maybe with people trying too hard. People you interact with on productions might try to do some weird handshake — ‘Yo, yo’ [slaps his hands together in an elaborate routine]. You’re like, ‘Oh, I don’t — I just shake like this. You’ve been watching BET too long.’

My cousins might try to hit me up for more. On my Instagram some of them, they’re like ‘Hey, how you doing, cuz?’ And you know what that means: ‘How you doing, cuz?’ is ‘I need something.’ I never get hit up where it’s just, ‘How are you doing?

We have the input. I’ll be like, ‘Wait a minute, black folks wouldn’t say that. Let’s change it to this.’ It’s a collaborative effort. They’re good about that: You can talk and get your point of view across. If something needs to be changed, it’ll be changed.

So it’s not surprising that we humans are unable to make something like time or the marking of time bend to our collective wills. For centuries, different countries used different calendars, and even the old Julian calendar had its problems.

That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar. Even then, the later a country switched over, the more days had to be dropped in order to stay in sync with the vernal equinox and the winter solstice. This resulted in a lot of confusion for a while, including the month of September 1752 in North America, which looked like this and which children across the continent still whisper about as “The Best Start to the School Year Ever.”

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yesterday, we compared solving crosswords to breaking into a house, because it’s the end of the week and my mind tends to drift. Today, we are going to compare solving to tiptoeing delicately through a minefield, also because it’s the end of the week. But also because it’s now Saturday, and Sam Ezersky is back.

I’m not entirely sure what happened to Mr. Ezersky on his way from the University of Virginia to his new job as an assistant editor working with Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano, but clearly he has an ax to grind with us. Today’s puzzle is tough. And make no mistake, he takes great pleasure in putting entries like TRAP QUEEN in his puzzles, just to mess with people who have never heard of Fetty Wap. If you can imagine such a thing.

Step carefully over the cross-referencing as well. At 39A, the “question after an interruption,” along with 39D, turns out to be WHERE WAS I, which totally makes sense together but is fairly unnerving when you try to solve each on its own.

We’re nearing the season for ghost stories — or, in the case of William Alexander’s new middle-grade novel, “A Properly Unhaunted Place,” un-ghost stories, cautionary tales about what happens when we try too hard to put our history behind us. Eleanor Henderson’s “The Twelve-Mile Straight” and Josephine Rowe’s “A Loving, Faithful Animal” wrestle with the enduring trauma of violence over generations, and Alice McDermott’s “The Ninth Hour” draws narrative power from that perennial burden of Catholicism, shame. Two finalists for the National Book Awards appear on this week’s list: Frank Bidart’s collected poems, “Half-Light,” and Carmen Maria Machado’s debut collection of stories, “Her Body and Other Parties.” You have until the awards are announced on Nov. 15 to finish them. Go!

FRESH COMPLAINT: Stories, by Jeffrey Eugenides. (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $27.) Eugenides’s first collection of short stories is his first book since “The Marriage Plot” in 2011. “Line by line, paragraph by paragraph, Eugenides writes like a man who is enjoying himself. The feeling is contagious,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “The comedy in these stories derives from the fact that these people are not quite ready for this world — or at least not ready for what this world has become. Innocence everywhere has been trampled.”

ADMISSIONS: Life as a Brain Surgeon, by Henry Marsh. (Thomas Dunne Books, $26.99.) Like “Do No Harm,” Marsh’s previous memoir, “Admissions” is “wandering and ruminative, an overland trek through the doctor’s anxieties and private shames,” our critic Jennifer Senior writes. Marsh once again recounts his miscalculations and surgical catastrophes; rails against the constraints of an increasingly depersonalized British health care system; and describes his operating theater in all of its Grand Guignol splendor.

HER BODY AND OTHER PARTIES: Stories, by Carmen Maria Machado. (Graywolf, $16.) The eight fables in Machado’s book, a finalist for the National Book Award, all depict women on the verge. The collection is “a love letter to an obstinate genre that won’t be gentrified,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “It’s a wild thing, this book, covered in sequins and scales, blazing with the influence of fabulists from Angela Carter to Kelly Link and Helen Oyeyemi, and borrowing from science fiction, queer theory and horror.”

THE NINTH HOUR, by Alice McDermott. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) In McDermott’s novel, the cause of a young Irish widow and her daughter is taken up by the nuns of a Brooklyn convent. But as the years pass, this struggling pair can’t banish worldly temptation, with possibly dire consequences for their faith. Writing about nuns is a risky business, but McDermott situates their lives exactly where they belong: in the difficult, often conflicting world that embraces practical competence, a commitment to extreme generosity and a lived belief not only in goodness but in the fairness of God.",10 New Books We Recommend This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/books/review/10-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Then there was the Ad Council, the same industry organization that turned Smokey Bear into a cultural icon. The council sponsored the crusade as a public service, arranging for broadcasters to run ads without charge. The Ad Council’s sponsorship translated into as much as $2 billion worth of free advertising over the campaign’s history, in 2017 dollars.

The message was simple: Russia was aggressive; Communism was awful. The enemy couldn’t be trusted. Typical ads conveyed a brutalized vision of life behind the Iron Curtain: “a strip of Communist-controlled hell-on-earth,” one read. Donating a few bucks would save Czechs, Poles, Hungarians and others from this tyranny. Many thousands of Americans took the bait. They dutifully wrote checks to Radio Free Europe, and their contributions were magnified by gifts from many of the country’s biggest corporations, yielding, on average, about $1 million annually.

It wasn’t enough: The donations barely covered the cost of running the “fund-raising drives,” to say nothing of Radio Free Europe’s $30 million annual budgets. But that wasn’t the point.

Declassified documents reveal that almost from the start, the C.I.A. saw that it could exploit the fund-raising campaign as a conduit for domestic propaganda. It was a way to rally public support for the Cold War by dramatizing Communist repression and stoking fears of a worldwide menace. The plight of Eastern Europe brought moral clarity to the Cold War, and it cemented the region as a vital national interest in American domestic politics.

Its impact outlived the campaign itself. Even though the pleas for donations ended in 1971, when the C.I.A. was exposed and stopped funding the station, they cemented anti-Communist hostility that animated conservative opposition to détente in the 1970s. It provided the leitmotif for Reagan’s denunciations of the “evil empire” in the 1980s. One can even hear echoes in Donald Trump’s recent speech to the United Nations: His long digression on the evils of socialism seems drawn from the heated rhetoric of ads gone by.

So, too, does our post-truth media environment carry voices from this past. The crusade blasted all information from enemy sources as lies and deceit — fake news, we could say. This counter-propaganda sought to inoculate the public from being receptive to anything said by the other side. It’s a tactic we’ve seen play out in real time on the president’s Twitter feed.

And almost certainly, Radio Free Europe itself — which continues to operate out of its headquarters in Prague — has shaped Vladimir Putin’s worldview. Russia has long tried to claim Eastern Europe as its sphere of influence. Moscow hated the station for its meddling. As a K.G.B. officer, Mr. Putin no doubt spent many hours fretting over its activities in the Soviet bloc. It was a major irritant. He may even see the 2016 election hack as a way to even the score. If so, it’s payback indeed.",The C.I.A.’s Fake News Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/cia-fake-news-russia.html

The research “dispels a biological concept of race,” Dr. Tishkoff said.

Humans develop color much as other mammals do. Special cells in the skin contain pouches, called melanosomes, packed with pigment molecules. The more pigment, the darker the skin.

Skin color also varies with the kind of pigments: Melanosomes may contain mixtures of a brown-black called eumelanin and a yellow-red called pheomelanin.

To find the genes that help produce pigments, scientists began by studying people of European ancestry and found that mutations to a gene called SLC24A5 caused cells to make less pigment, leading to paler skin. Unsurprisingly, almost all Europeans have this variant.

More Reporting on Human Origins

“We knew quite a lot about why people have pale skin if they had European ancestry,” said Nicholas G. Crawford, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the new study. “But there was very little known about why people have dark skin.”

Since the early 2000s, Dr. Tishkoff has studied genes in Africa, discovering variants important to everything from resistance to malaria to height.

African populations vary tremendously in skin color, and Dr. Tishkoff reasoned that powerful genetic variants must be responsible.

Studying 1,570 people in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Botswana, she and her colleagues discovered a set of genetic variants that account for 29 percent of the variation in skin color. (The remaining variation seems tied to genes yet to be discovered.)

One variant, MFSD12, was particularly mysterious: No one knew what it did anywhere in the body. To investigate its function, the researchers altered the gene in reddish lab mice. Giving them the variant found in darker-skinned Africans turned the mice gray.

As it turned out, MFSD12 can affect the production of brown-black eumelanin, producing a darker skin color.

The eight gene variants that Dr. Tishkoff and her colleagues discovered in Africans turned out to be present in many populations outside the continent. By comparing the DNA of these people, the researchers were able to estimate how long ago the genes appeared.

They turned out to be immensely old. A variant for light skin — found in both Europeans and the San hunter-gatherers of Botswana — arose roughly 900,000 years ago, for example.

Even before there were Homo sapiens, then, our distant forebears had a mix of genes for light and dark skin. Some populations may have been dark-skinned and others light-skinned; or maybe they were all the same color, produced by a blend of variants.

Neanderthals split off from our own ancestors an estimated 600,000 years ago, spreading across Europe and eastern Asia. While they became extinct about 40,000 years ago, some of their DNA has survived.

Living humans come packaged in a wide range of hues — from pale and freckly in Ireland to dark brown in southern India, Australia and New Guinea. Researchers have argued that these varying colors evolved partly in response to sunlight.

The idea is that people who live with intense ultraviolet light benefited from dark color, pigments that shielded important molecules in their skin. In places with less sunlight, people needed lighter skin, because they were able to absorb more sunlight to make vitamin D.

The new genetic evidence supports this explanation, but adds unexpected complexity. The dark-skinned people of southern India, Australia and New Guinea, for example, did not independently evolve their color simply because evolution favored it.

They inherited the ancestral dark variants Dr. Tishkoff’s team found in Africans. “They had to be introduced from an African population,” said Dr. Tishkoff.

Yet the same is true for some genes that produce light skin in Asia and Europe. They also originated in Africa and were carried from the continent by migrants.

As Africans moved into Europe and Asia, they interbred with Neanderthals on several occasions. Last week, Michael Dannemann and Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany reported that people in Britain still carry a number of Neanderthal variants that color skin.

Some of the newly discovered genes appeared relatively recently in our evolution.

The pale-skin variant of SLC24A5 that’s overwhelmingly common in Europe, for example, is a recent addition to the genome, arising just 29,000 years ago, according to the new study. It became widespread only in the past few thousand years.

Dr. Tishkoff and her colleagues found it frequently not just in Europe, but also in some populations of lighter-skinned Africans in East Africa and Tanzania. Studies of ancient DNA recently discovered in Africa point to an explanation.

Several thousand years ago, it seems, a migration of early Near Eastern farmers swept into East Africa. Over many generations of interbreeding, the pale variant of SLC24A5 became common in some African populations.

In all, the new study provides “a deeper appreciation of the genetic palette that has been mixed and matched through evolution,” said Nina Jablonski, an expert on skin color at Pennsylvania State University.","Genes for Skin Color Rebut Dated Notions of Race, Researchers Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/science/skin-color-race.html

“First of all: We try not to use anonymous sources,” Mr. Baquet said.
“And I feel very strongly that anonymous sources should not be able to have quotations,” and should only state facts, he said.
As to the charge that The Times has a liberal bias, Mr. Baker drew a distinction between the paper’s news report and its opinion pages.
“It just so happens that the best media, the most powerful media, are on the coasts,” Mr. Baquet said.","“He’s a 71-year-old man,” she said, adding that she doesn’t expect him to change.

2. This might be the most transparent presidency ever.

All three panelists agreed: Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed offers a remarkably transparent window into the president’s thinking.

“In this way, at least,” Mr. Baker said, “it’s the most transparent presidency we have had in our lifetime — and maybe ever.”

“It’s like watching Robert Caro unfold in real time,” Mr. Baquet added.

And while we’re on the subject of Twitter ...

3. No, ignoring the president’s tweets is not an option.

“Oh come on,” Mr. Baker said, responding to a question from the Facebook Live audience. “So, if The New York Times didn’t write about the tweets, the 40 million people reading them — and the other millions more who would be retweeting — would suddenly not pay attention, or not care?” he asked.

“He’s the president of the United States,” Mr. Baker continued. “What he does, for good or bad, is the most central part of our coverage of the government.”

Ms. Haberman added: “That’s the definition of bias: If we decided not to cover the president of the United States.”

(Ms. Haberman, usually prolific on Twitter, is in the middle of a weeklong hiatus from the platform. “It’s a cleanse,” she said. “I’m doing the Twitter juice diet.”)

4. When it comes to anonymous sources, transparency with readers is paramount.

Anonymous sourcing has been a key component to The Times’s coverage of the Trump administration, which has been plagued by a steady flow of internal leaks.

But, as one audience member noted, readers often feel ambivalent about articles that use anonymous sources — especially readers who are not familiar with The Times’s guidelines for the practice.

“First of all: We try not to use anonymous sources,” Mr. Baquet said. “And I feel very strongly that anonymous sources should not be able to have quotations,” and should only state facts, he said.

For the most consequential White House stories, Mr. Baquet himself has to approve the use of anonymous sources. “And when we do more routine anonymous source stories, whether it’s from the White House or not,” he explained, “senior editors have to know the names of sources, and the circumstances.”

The protocol is strict “because we can’t afford to get it wrong,” he added. “And I think we should probably be transparent with people about that.”

(Interested in learning more about our guidelines regarding anonymous sources? Read on.)

5. Leak investigations are a real threat.

For journalists who cover the president, his heated rhetoric against the press — while sometimes alarming — is generally tolerable. “I don’t care about the name calling,” Mr. Baker said. “We’re big boys and girls; we can take it.”

“What would be disturbing,” he added, “is if that then trails into actual changes in our ability to do our job.”

One such potential change? The threat of leak investigations, which Attorney General Jeff Sessions has reported are increasing dramatically.

It would be “beyond the pale,” Mr. Baquet said, if the Trump administration had subpoenaed phone records, or had gotten secret warrants for phone records, of New York Times reporters — or if they were wiretapping phones.

But it’s not out of the question, Mr. Baquet conceded.

“The previous administration did things that made us very uncomfortable, despite their saying more positive things about the press,” he said. “So this administration makes me nervous in that regard.”

6. Personal opinions have no place in the news report.

Fun fact: Mr. Baker hasn’t voted since he first joined the White House beat, four presidencies ago. “I stopped doing anything that could be perceived as taking a personal position,” he said.

As to the charge that The Times has a liberal bias, Mr. Baker drew a distinction between the paper’s news report and its opinion pages.

“If it were up to me, we wouldn’t have editorials, because I think it confuses readers into thinking we’re a liberal paper,” Mr. Baker said.

“I don’t consider myself to be a liberal,” he added. “I don’t think that most people I work with consider themselves to be particularly ideological.”

“The only editorial page I read is The Wall Street Journal,” Ms. Haberman, “and it’s because I just want to understand what is in the mind of Rupert Murdoch, who advises the president.”

“I think we try to play this straight down the middle,” she added.

7. The media bubble is real, and it’s important to step outside of it.

What to make of the so-called “media bubble”? Is it a legitimate threat to understanding and reporting on the Trump administration?

In short, yes.

“I think we spend too much time in New York,” Mr. Baquet said, adding that, after the election, The Times increased the number of reporters in the Midwest and set about hiring reporters with a broader range of backgrounds and experiences.

“It just so happens that the best media, the most powerful media, are on the coasts,” Mr. Baquet said. “And we have to be careful.”

“I think it’s a myth, by the way,” he added, “that we’re all New York elites.”

“I grew up in Louisiana. I think my late mother — who did not graduate from junior high school — would be shocked to hear that people think of me as a leader of the media elite.”

So what’s the case for supporting decertification?

The architects of the nuclear deal make three dubious claims on its behalf. They say it concerns Iran’s nuclear dossier alone, and does not prevent us from thwarting Tehran’s regional bids in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza or the Gulf. They claim the deal is working because Iran is abiding by its terms, as certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

And they add that since the agreement permanently enjoins the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons, the United States maintains the military option to stop them from doing so.

Yet Iran’s regional behavior has become worse since the nuclear deal came into effect, not least because it provided the regime with a huge new income stream — $10 billion in cash and gold in 2016 alone, plus more than $100 billion in additional sanctions relief — to fund its work. Tehran also operates on the assumption, well justified during the Obama years, that the United States would not risk the nuclear deal for the sake of rolling back Iranian gains in Syria and elsewhere.

As for the point that the Iranians are generally (if not quite entirely) honoring their end of the bargain — why shouldn’t they? “Iran doesn’t want a bomb today,” one senior Israeli official told me. “It wants a bomb tomorrow.” That is, it wants a robust nuclear base that puts it within a screw’s twist of a sizable nuclear arsenal without the economic and security risks of actual possession.

And if it does choose to go for a bomb once the agreement has run its course, our military options will be slight. If we couldn’t prevent Pakistan or North Korea from going nuclear in the 1990s, why should we think we’ll be able to stop Iran in the nick of time?

My critics will claim that a distant prospect of a nuclear Iran is still vastly preferable to an exit from the deal that allows Iran to bring its centrifuges out of storage and start spinning its way to a bomb once again, this time without the monitoring of United Nations inspectors.

Maybe. But Iran still wants the economic benefits of the deal — benefits Washington alone can bestow through waivers, permits, relief from secondary sanctions and control over dollar transactions. The American Goliath needn’t be helpless against a Middle Eastern state with a gross domestic product only slightly larger than that of metropolitan Atlanta.

We are living through a nuclear nightmare on the Korean Peninsula after more than two decades of optimistic diplomacy. That’s a fate we ought to do everything possible to avoid with Iran. As Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies points out, “decertification isn’t a sufficient condition to break the paralysis of our Iran policy, but it is a necessary one.”

“I was thinking about that,” said Miranda Stone, 32, who said she had attended every Late Night With Roy since her freshman year here 14 years ago. “I was scared it might put a damper on things. The atmosphere would be different.”

Instead, the long North Carolina nightmare was over. And the fans were thrilled.

“We’re happy it’s over, and even more happy nothing bad happened,” said Matthew Kinlaw, 18, who drove from St. Pauls, N.C., after completing his application to the university the night before.

Outside the Dean Dome, as the Smith Center is known, a sandpaper-colored octagon that resembles a desert fortress, fans were lined up Friday afternoon two hours before the women’s volleyball match that preceded the tip-off event, and more than four before the basketball team finally took the court. They wanted the best seats for the free pep rally.

No sports arena is more dedicated to its home team’s hue than this one. Pantone 542 — here known as Carolina Blue — colors parts of the court, the padding behind the baskets, the seats, the seat cushions, the beams and vents in the rafters, even the overhead speakers. It is snowier than the regal azure of North Carolina’s archrival down Tobacco Road, Duke, yet sterner than powder blue.

This balance between dark and light might be said to fit North Carolina’s fan base, which is one of those in college sports that seems as if it genuinely wants to win the right way — even if, like many fans, it might sooner part with the right way than the winning. Many fans’ reactions to the scandal Friday were defiant when it came to the N.C.A.A., but chastened when it came to their own standards.

“I have to say, I’m not proud of what happened,” said Stone, “and there were some things that needed to change, and I’m glad it was brought to light.”

“You can say that the verdict was time served,” Chansky said, “because the last four to six years haven’t been fun at all.”

Returning for his third go-round as tip-off master of ceremonies was Kenny Smith, the former North Carolina and N.B.A. player who co-hosts TNT’s popular N.B.A. pregame show.

Smith was introduced as the Drake and Future song “Jumpman” played, which, as a nod to Nike and the university’s most famous alumnus, was a signal that business as usual had returned. (University of Kentucky fans attending Big Blue Madness that same evening got to see Drake in the flesh, wearing an instantly viral “Kentucky Dad” hoodie.)

The hour that followed might have been dreary if you were not a Tar Heels die-hard (or even if you were). There were dances and controlled scrimmaging. Kennedy Meeks, a since-graduated star of last season’s team, was acknowledged in the stands. The introduction of the junior Luke Maye, who made a crucial shot to beat Kentucky in the round of 8 last season, provoked the crowd to rapture.

Then the players lined up at center court as attention was drawn to the six championship banners hanging side by side on one side of the arena. As the end of last season’s title game played on the arena’s video screens, the years of the previous national titles, from 1924 to 2009, were counted off, and finally the 2017 banner was unfurled.

It was perhaps a trick, a hallucination produced by the outpouring of meaning from 21,000 fans invested in the moment, that it immediately felt as if the new flag had always been there, and that it would never go away.","At North Carolina, a Sigh of Relief and a New Championship Banner",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/sports/ncaabasketball/north-carolina-tar-heels-roy-williams.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The Broadway musical “War Paint” has changed its closing date to Nov. 5 so that Patti LuPone can undergo immediate hip replacement surgery. The show was scheduled to run until Dec. 30.

“For several months I have been performing in a great deal of pain,’’ Ms. LuPone explained in a statement on Friday. “My producers David Stone and Marc Platt have provided an incredible team who, through physical therapy, chiropractic and acupuncture, have enabled me to continue on stage. But the pain has now become too intense and I have no other choice but to leave.”

The musical, which opened April 6 at the Nederlander Theater, chronicles the 50-year rivalry between the cosmetics moguls Helena Rubinstein, played by Ms. LuPone, and Elizabeth Arden, played by Christine Ebersole. Both performers, winners of two Tony Awards apiece, were nominated again for the show, but came home empty-handed.

And in a highly competitive season for new musicals, “War Paint” never broke out to be a hit; during the week ending Oct. 8, it grossed $605,011, 48 percent of its potential earnings.

In a statement Mr. Stone and Mr. Platt expressed understanding for Ms. LuPone’s decision. “We all know Patti is strong, and she has proven to have even more strength than we imagined,’’ they said. “At this point, however, she needs to have hip replacement surgery sooner rather than later.”

Mr. Erdogan’s government quickly shut down the investigations and released Mr. Zarrab and Mr. Aslan.
But four years on, court filings in Manhattan show, these same recordings have become a part of the United States case.
In a conversation two weeks later, on Oct. 3, 2013, Mr. Caglayan told Mr. Aslan that Mr. Erdogan had directly demanded an increase in exports.","And in recent days, as tensions between the countries grew worse amid a diplomatic dispute over Turkey’s detention of a United States Embassy employee, Turkish officials justified their actions by equating them to the embargo charges in New York.

“You will arrest my bank’s deputy general manager for no reason, and will try another citizen of mine for two years, and want to use him as an informant,” Mr. Erdogan said in speech on Thursday in which he defended the American employee’s arrest.

A close reading, however, of a lengthy summary of the Turkish investigation, which prosecutors have filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan and which includes excerpts from transcripts of the wiretap recordings, suggests that Mr. Erdogan’s objections may involve more than just patriotism. In several of the conversations, the records show, three of the men now charged discuss meeting with Mr. Erdogan and acting, as one puts it, on “the prime minister’s order” to increase Turkish trade.

Photo

The excerpts, a copy of which has been translated independently by The New York Times, do not suggest that Mr. Erdogan was aware of any illegal activity, and he is neither named nor referred to in an American indictment filed last month. But they offer evidence that Mr. Erdogan, back in 2013, was meeting regularly with several of the men at the height of their suspected sanctions busting.

One question now is whether one or more of the defendants — two of whom are jailed in New York and scheduled for trial on Nov. 27 — might still plead guilty and cooperate with the United States authorities in the hope of winning leniency in sentencing.

“I’m sure Erdogan worries about that, and I’m sure he worries about what could come out at trial,” said Eric S. Edelman, a former United States ambassador to Turkey. “Either one could be very damaging to him.”

The case currently centers on three men, all of whom knew Mr. Erdogan personally. Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, is suspected of having helped the Turkish government bypass United States sanctions on Iranian trade by using gold and other nonmonetary goods to pay for Iranian gas. American prosecutors say that Mr. Zarrab was helped by Zafer Caglayan, then Turkey’s economy minister, and Suleyman Aslan, at the time the chief executive of a state-owned Turkish bank.

Mr. Caglayan and Mr. Aslan are not in custody of either the United States or Turkey; Mr. Zarrab has been jailed in the United States since March 2016, after being arrested during a family trip to Disney World.

Mr. Zarrab has enlisted a team of high-profile lawyers to assist in his defense, among them Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump, and Michael B. Mukasey, a former United States attorney general. They have met with Mr. Erdogan and senior Trump administration officials in an effort to resolve the case as a diplomatic matter.

Mr. Zarrab’s lead lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, declined to comment. Mr. Zarrab has pleaded not guilty.

The case has been largely ignored by the public in the United States. But it has been widely reported and discussed in Ankara, where many of the government’s supporters see it as a continuation of a December 2013 attempt by parts of the Turkish judiciary to unseat Mr. Erdogan’s administration.

Photo

At that time, prosecutors in Turkey announced investigations into Turkish officials suspected in several corruption scandals. Mr. Caglayan and two other ministers quickly resigned, and Mr. Aslan and Mr. Zarrab were arrested, in what was the biggest challenge to Mr. Erdogan’s reputation since his party came to power in 2002.

Mr. Erdogan presented the investigations as a de facto coup attempt, mounted by followers of the same Islamist sect — the Gulen movement — that Mr. Erdogan would later say led a failed military putsch in July 2016. Mr. Erdogan’s government quickly shut down the investigations and released Mr. Zarrab and Mr. Aslan. Many of the police officers and prosecutors involved in the cases were later purged from their jobs.

The 2013 allegations, and the wiretaps on which they were based, were denounced as fiction — claims that many Turks found credible because of the Gulen movement’s problematic history. Gulenist prosecutors had been found to have fabricated evidence in earlier trials of secular army officers. (This week, Turkey’s state-run news agency said the American Embassy employee whose detention had fanned tensions had links to one of those prosecutors.)

But four years on, court filings in Manhattan show, these same recordings have become a part of the United States case.

The court records show that Mr. Erdogan’s voice was not captured on any of these particular recordings. But in the fall of 2013, he is referred to frequently by his office in conversations among some of the people suspected of conspiracy.

In June 2013, the Obama administration had closed the loophole that had allowed Turkey to pay for Iranian gas with gold. That fall, two of the alleged conspirators discussed finding an alternative method to evade the sanctions, according to transcripts of the recordings cited in the case.

The method the men are accused of settling on had problematic side effects for the Turkish economy. Since large quantities of gold were no longer being channeled through Turkey, the country’s trade deficit looked set to increase.

Mr. Erdogan was alarmed by this development, according to statements captured by the wiretaps. With local elections looming, Mr. Erdogan may have feared damage to his reputation as a savvy manager of the Turkish economy. According to the recordings, Mr. Erdogan spoke with Messrs. Zarrab, Caglayan and Aslan about the need to restore Turkish export figures to the record high of the previous year.

Photo

There is no evidence that Mr. Erdogan demanded or expected this to be achieved through illegal means. But the result he sought had previously been accomplished only through a method that was now outlawed under American sanctions. And the defendants charged in the United States are accused, in part, of returning to a version of the gas-for-gold scheme — a course of action Turkish investigators say the men took after they had spoken with Mr. Erdogan.

In one of the conversations, on Sept. 19, 2013, Mr. Zarrab claimed that he had personally spoken to Mr. Erdogan about the trade deficit, and had assured the leader he would help increase Turkish exports by $4 billion. “We have to do our best to achieve this $4 billion goal,” Mr. Zarrab is quoted as telling the bank chief, Mr. Aslan, “because I promised the prime minister.”

In a separate conversation on the same day, Mr. Zarrab told another associate that a smaller increase would be better than nothing. “Even two billion is important because I will go to meet the prime minister directly,” Mr. Zarrab said, according to the transcript.

In a conversation two weeks later, on Oct. 3, 2013, Mr. Caglayan told Mr. Aslan that Mr. Erdogan had directly demanded an increase in exports. “Turkey needs at least $2 to $4 billion in exports,” Mr. Caglayan said. “Last night we had a two-hour meeting with the prime minister in Istanbul and explained to him that there is a lot of pressure.”

Turkish investigators concluded from another conversation, on Sept. 16, 2013, that Mr. Aslan had spoken to Mr. Erdogan, who told him to “do something, whatever the method” to increase exports. The transcripts do not show that Mr. Erdogan was told how Mr. Zarrab, Mr. Aslan and Mr. Caglayan intended to increase exports — or that Iran was the ultimate beneficiary of Mr. Zarrab’s alleged scheme.

“My reading of the transcripts, as someone who has been covering Turkish politics for 27 years, leads me to say that Erdogan fully understood what was going on,” said Atilla Yesilada, an Istanbul-based consultant at Global Source Partners, an analysis firm, and a political commentator.

Mr. Yesilada acknowledged that nothing in the transcripts showed that the issue of sanctions busting had been brought to Mr. Erdogan’s attention.

Mr. Erdogan himself, however, has spoken publicly in the past about his willingness to break the United States sanctions on Iran.

“When we are approached on that matter — ‘You should obey the sanctions, you should obey’ — we cannot obey,” Mr. Erdogan said in December 2012 at a news conference in Istanbul. “This is strategically important for us.”",Why a New York Court Case Has Rattled Turkey’s President,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/world/europe/turkey-new-york-case.html

That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.","Thodoris Nikolaou has spent the last three years — and counting — crisscrossing the Balkan Peninsula to create a visual mosaic of the region’s people and their stories. But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

She admits that she’s no good at saving. She doles out money without hesitation to those in need. A dollar for the man by the side of the road. Nicole’s car payment. A $1,200 surgery for a pit bull she’d adopted that had swallowed steel wool.

Ricardo pecked at a calculator.

“Sixteen,” he announced. Rexnord could pay 16 Ricardos for the cost of one Shannon.

“But you don’t understand,” Shannon said. “They have the money. They just don’t want to give it to you.”

Shannon felt closer to the younger trainee, Tadeo. (His last name has been withheld due to his concerns about future job prospects.) He was 23, the same age as her son. Shannon called him “Tad” or “Kid.” He had a sparse goatee, and a habit of saying “yes, yes,” even when Shannon wasn’t sure he had understood.

Shannon never left him alone in the factory. He trailed behind her like a duckling when she went outside to smoke.

“Want some chips?” she’d ask him. “What kind of music do you like?”

He brought her cookies and showed her a video on his phone of his girlfriend receiving flowers he’d sent for her birthday.

Once, Shannon mentioned how long it took her to drive to work.

“You own a car?” he asked.

“You don’t?” she replied.

Shannon could have given Tad the bare minimum of training, answering a few questions and collecting her pay. But just as Stan Settles had passed on his knowledge to Shannon, Shannon trained Tad as if he were one of her own.

She showed him how to bolt in the coil and to make sure the steel rings spun without touching the sides. Affix the wrong bullnose and the shaft could break.

“O.K.,” Shannon said. “It’s your turn.”

Tad worked on the Tocco all afternoon. Shannon noticed water leaking from the hoses. A loose hose could shoot water clear across the factory.

“Tighten down your hoses,” she said.

He had also installed the copper piece backward. But that was no big deal. He had skillfully navigated the challenges of translating English to Spanish, inches to meters. She felt proud of Tad.

Before he returned to Mexico, Tad pulled Shannon aside. He put his hand over his heart.

“My friend tells me that the reason a lot of people don’t like us is because we’re taking their jobs,” he said, sounding distraught.

“I’m not mad at you,” she said. “I’m happy that you get the opportunity to make some money. I was blessed for a while. I hate to see it go. Now it’s your turn to be blessed.”

“I think it’s gotten smaller,” Nicole said. “Really.”

Shannon had fought bitterly for custody of Nicole, but she had run out of money for a lawyer. Nicole’s father won. After he died of a heart attack, Nicole moved in with his mother, Patricia Wynne. Shannon scraped together $5,000 for a down payment on a house nearby, in Whitestown, and Nicole spent some weekends there.

Shannon and Nicole had grown closer since the news of the factory’s closing. Shannon called often, weeping about her lost seniority and all the time she’d missed with her kids while she was at work. Nicole murmured, “We’ll make it through this,” as if she were the parent and Shannon the child.

Nicole, who had learned to call 911 by the age of 4 because of her parents’ fights, channeled her anxiety into timelines, budgets and lists. Now, she nudged her mother to think about the future.

“How many months do we have insurance?” Nicole asked.

“Six months,” Shannon replied. “After I lose my job.”

“What are we going to do when we don’t have health care?” Nicole asked. “What about Carmella?”

The questions hung in the spring air like a windsock, blowing this way and that.

An even bigger question loomed: Nicole had been accepted to Purdue University, but had no idea how she could afford to go. Nicole needed to let Purdue know that her mother was losing her job and could not help with tuition.

“I should be able to provide for you,” Shannon lamented. “I don’t even know what I’m going to do now. I will go back to school. I got to. Because it’s paid for. I need to take advantage of it.”

Shannon was eligible for up to two years of retraining under the federal government’s trade adjustment assistance program. But retraining for what? Nursing? She had taken a few nursing classes, years ago.

Nicole, who intended to study nursing herself, cocked her head to one side. “I’m not saying you’re old,” Nicole began.

Shannon laughed, as if conceding that nursing school was a wild idea.

A few weeks later, Shannon agonized about what to wear to Honors Night at Nicole’s school, when they would find out whether she had gotten any scholarships.

“I don’t want to embarrass my daughter, by no means,” she said.

She settled on a black dress with white stripes from J. C. Penney. She looked stately in it, and thought it would help her blend in with other mothers at the school. She’d picked up an outfit for her son, Bub, too: gray cargo pants and a blue shirt. He took them from her and retreated into the bathroom, past a pile of unwashed clothes.

Shannon sat in her front yard, wrapping strands of wet hair around yellow pencils, to make curls. She looked out across the country road at tilled fields of corn. In her yard, three dead cars and two dead trucks awaited resurrection. In the garage, her boyfriend, Larry Borer, cussed out an engine. Pit bulls barked in their pen.

Even without college, Nicole had already gone further than anyone else in Shannon’s house. Shannon and Larry both got their G.E.D., but Bub did not.",Becoming a Steelworker Liberated Her. Then Her Job Moved to Mexico.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/us/union-jobs-mexico-rexnord.html

Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.
PhotoMr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers.
Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography.
While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.","Thirty years ago, Tim Rasmussen wore a mullet to the photojournalism version of Woodstock on a small upstate New York farm. He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

I’m not sure why, but that experience really piqued my interest in cryptic crosswords. I spent the summer reading “how to” books (including Mr. Greer’s), trying to solve cryptic crosswords and am now a big fan of these puzzles. That’s a good thing, because I’ve been told there will be a fairly large number of British people making the crossing on the Times Journeys trans-Atlantic crossword cruise in December, so I can say that I am conversant. Or at least sound like I am.

Am I an expert? Not at all. But it’s a vastly different mental tug-of-war between the solver, setter and editor than the American-style crosswords I’m used to, and it’s a very pleasurable break for me. More important, as much as I would love to be an expert right this very minute, learning takes time, patience and practice, and I am loving the journey.

Richard Silvestri is back with a cryptic crossword for us, and it’s not one of the easier ones I’ve solved.

The Soviets we loved. When printing technology in India was restricted to black and white, Russia bamboozled us with colorful comics and magazines. Russian ballets and circuses performed in Indian cities and were broadcast frequently on Indian state television.

Soviet cultural centers were active social hubs in Indian cities, offering lessons in music, dance and chess. Russians loved Bollywood. Raj Kapoor, who made and starred in musicals about simple-hearted characters smiling in the face of adversity, would be greeted with rousing receptions in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Book Exhibition would cram a vast ground in the center of town with stalls selling books and magazines, for all ages, in English and various Indian languages. Sovietland magazine was published in 13 Indian languages. It carried pictures of Soviet life, of collective farming, and Indo-Soviet collaborations on projects like the Bhilai steel plant.

Soviet books were inexpensive and beautifully produced on glossy art paper. Their low cost and great production value matched the preferred phrase of socialist India: “cheap and best.”

The comparatively meek American cultural effort was largely restricted to sending complimentary copies of Span magazine to university professors. My father, a poet who taught English literature at Allahabad University, received a copy of Span. It had pictures of cheeseburgers studded with sesame seeds and of geometry-box corn fields.

A typical issue would have Ronald Reagan on the cover, a short story by John Gardner, photographs by Ansel Adams, a debate on America’s nuclear strategy, and a long piece on America’s search for natural gas.

“The Russians are way ahead of the Americans in their hide-and-seek game... They strike at the grass roots,” an essay in The Christian Science Monitor noted in 1982. “They are in touch with the masses, not with the elite.”

After the book exhibitions, a traveling van stocked with Russian classics would snake its way through the lanes of Allahabad and other small towns across India.

Russian children’s literature is believed to have blurred the lines between propaganda and art, perhaps like no other children’s literature. I don’t remember any disreputable titles that glorified electrification and agriculture. I read numerous folk tales and children’s books printed by Moscow publishers — Raduga and Progress.

I had begun to read The Hardy Boys series, Nancy Drew and Enid Blyton by the time the Soviet books arrived. Even as a kid, one could make out that the American and English books were written to a formula. After a while one wasn’t reading these for the story but for the salivating descriptions of food — the exotic buttered scones and ginger beer in Blyton’s family-farm dramas; the ice cream sodas in Archie comics.

Food and propaganda were curiously missing from the Russian books. Alexander Raskin’s “When Daddy Was a Little Boy” was first published in 1966. It is a quietly funny, comically grotesque memoir of growing up: a boy gets bitten by a dog on both cheeks.

I found some echoes of my Indian childhood in the Russian tales. Reading obsessively, even under the blanket; disliking and not eating bread; going for piano or sitar lessons, even when you had no talent; the emphasis on good handwriting; making silly verses and reciting them unbidden to every visitor. Arrogance was to be avoided at all costs.

The couples in the folk tales were either childless, or aging with beautiful unmarried daughters. Some stories centered on grandmothers living with granddaughters. There was a touch of the macabre: two sisters kill their third sister out of malice before the redemptive power of magic revives her. I came across words I didn’t understand: sarafans, kavach. It didn’t matter.

In those throbbing, feral stories, I encountered Baba Yaga, the quintessential Russian witch. At times, she lived in the middle of the forest in a rotating cabin; at others, in “a great house of white stone with forty-one pillars at the gate.”

Not all folk tales ended with a neat moral. Many were about the constantly varying kaleidoscope of human nature. The miser borrows a kopeck from a peasant to give to a beggar. The dogged peasant keeps after the miser; he wants his kopeck back. Both keep outwitting the other. By the end of the tale, both men are richer due to the peasant’s cleverness. The naïve and yet not-so-naïve peasant still worries about the kopeck he lent the miser.

The Russians came to India and distributed their stories virtually for free. If this was propaganda, no one has bad memories of imbibing it.

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

Erik Agard: Music and wordplay are but two of Alex’s superpowers (you can see some of her punny drawings on her Instagram), so when this puzzle’s then-half-formed theme needed rescuing, I knew who to shine the Bat Signal for. Through a couple revisions and upwards of a hundred emails, the collaboration was always fun, and I’m looking forward to her next puzzle. Alex Briñas: Erik was the true superhero here — he zipped nimbly through the bulk of the work and picked up after all my snafus. I’m a super-newbie to everything in the crossword world, but I do enjoy myself a good pun every now and then, so this was fascinating and foreign and exciting and daunting all at once. And I owe much thanks to Erik for inviting me to sidekick this mission in the first place. For your enjoyment (we hope), here are some of the theme answers from the cutting room floor: [Human Torch’s favorite band?] (3,7,4) [Blade’s favorite band?] (7,7) [Wonder Twins’ favorite band?] (5) [Storm’s favorite rapper?] (6) [Beast’s favorite singer?] (6) [Wolverine’s favorite guitarist?] (5) [Lady Deathstrike’s favorite band?] (13) [Banshee’s favorite band?] (5,5)

(Anyone? Anyone? Gertrude Jekyll?) But I had no idea that “flame” in Greek meant PHLOX. This is a great crossword word, no? Also a pretty plant if you can see beyond the mildew.

53A: Since this puzzle was solving fairly straight, I wasn’t at sufficient goofball level to see how “become lightheaded” could mean GO BLONDE. I figured it out after a few crosses but I think this is also a total gem of a clue.

58A: The first challenge for some of us when encountering “Dress-up at a comic con” might be figuring out the ol’ comic con part. Is this term widely known at this point? New York’s goes back to 2006 and it looks like the San Diego Comic Convention started in 1971. The art of dressing as featured characters is COSPLAY, a term coined in Japan in the ’80s. I would say something about nothing new under the sun, as we’ve been playing masquerade as a species for millenniums, but these costumes are really something else. New York’s con is in less than a week, guys! Come to think of it, maybe Sam has sequestered himself in his sewing room.

23D: Like the above example, this clue, “Secondary personas in role-playing game lingo” called for some knowledge of the way the kids talk. I knew this had to be “avis,” in this case pronounced with a short a, cute and short for “avatars,” and I was wrong. This grid calls for ALTS, and uses a new clue for a chestnut entry.

37D: Who’s been on the cover of British Vogue more than anyone else? One of their brand new contributing editors, natch, and Naomi Campbell didn’t fit. KATE MOSS did.

39D: I couldn’t really wrap my head around the grammar and meaning of “Track prize” for the longest time. At first I was looking for a verb, something like following one’s dream. Then I switched to a trophy or some such award, and it took forever to realize that in this case track was a racetrack, and we were talking about horse races, which get run as STAKES. This seems to be a grande olde worde from when betting folks in the Middle Ages stuck their wager, maybe a fat chicken or cute child, onto a stick and tried their luck.

Constructor Notes

From Crack Teammate #1, M.L.G.:

My seed entry for this themeless was the RIJKSMUSEUM, a place I hope to see in person someday. It was inspired by my visit to a special exhibit at the Dayton Art Institute, Rembrandt and the Golden Age of Dutch Art: Treasures from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. My first themeless grid with this seed entry was submitted in July of 2016. I received a rejection in August noting that Will really liked some of the grid fill including this seed entry, but there was too much crosswordese. I asked Jeff for his assistance in reworking the grid. He pointed out I had too many three letter entries. He noted it was best not to go above 12 for a themeless grid. After numerous back and forths using a grid of Jeff’s design we submitted a revised grid a few weeks later. We received an email in November accepting the revised grid. Jeff worked the NYT debut words COSPLAY, MAMA BIRD, BEER BRAT and GO BLONDE into the grid and my contribution in addition to RIJKSMUSEUM, was OBAMA ERA. I was surprised to see the clue we had for TOMY, “Big name in toys headquartered in Japan”, was replaced by the partial TO MY. I did like the edited change of clues for EARS and DJS to “Reception figures” as well as the clue change for HARRY from a name to “Badger”. I hope you’ve enjoyed your Saturday solving experience.

And, from Crack Teammate #2, J.C.:

I like trying multiple dozens of versions of every region within a themeless. Luckily, ML graciously puts up with my OCD about exploring the entire solution space. We saved so many versions that I didn’t remember which one we finally submitted. Thankfully, ML has a good eye for what’s the best trade-off between strong entries and gluey short ones. Looking back on it, I would have tried to open up the NW and SE corners, which feel more disconnected from the rest of the puzzle than I like. It did let us easily try many dozens of versions in each area, but with so few entries connecting everything up, hopefully solvers don’t get stumped on LAKSHMI or RIJKSMUSEUM.

For those of us wondering where the time went this week, here is a little video of a mama robin:

The trust, which was chaired by Mr. Smyth, was a part of a network of camps inspired by the Anglican clergyman E. J. H. Nash, who recruited boys from Britain’s elite schools in the hope of evangelizing them.

The report accused Mr. Smyth of subjecting at least 22 teenage boys to savage beatings in his garden shed, with the intent of purging them of perceived sins such as masturbation and pride.

Mr. Smyth, 75, who is keeping a low profile in South Africa, told Channel 4 news that the claims were ""nonsense"" and declined to comment further.

Although Mr. Ruston concluded that a criminal act had been committed, the trust decided not to refer Mr. Smyth to the authorities. Instead, he was banished first to Zimbabwe in 1982 and ultimately made his way to South Africa, where he faced new accusations in both countries about mistreated boys.

The report was filed away, and members of the trust, including Mr. Ruston, went on to assume influential positions within the Church of England and vowed, one trust insider said, never to speak about the matter publicly.

For decades, the victims suffered in silence, too ashamed to go public with their stories. All the while, they say, the main concern of officials was to protect the reputation of the trust rather than helping them.

“If this came out earlier, Iwerne would have been finished and its members wouldn’t have been able to rise up the ranks of the church in the way that they have,” said one of the victims, Andy Morse, who added that he attempted suicide twice because of the trauma he said was inflicted by Mr. Smyth.

Archbishop Welby, the principal religious leader in the Church of England, says it was not until one of the victims reached out to the church in 2013 that he learned of the accusations against Mr. Smyth. He said he was working in Paris between 1978 and 1982, when the alleged abuse was taking place, and had not kept in touch with his colleagues at Iwerne.

Although no one has produced proof that Archbishop Welby knew about the beatings at the time they were occurring, his account has been contested by several victims and former Iwerne members.

As an officer of the trust, they say, Mr. Welby was close to other senior members of the group and almost certainly would have been briefed on Mr. Smyth’s absence and the reason behind it when he came back to visit Iwerne after he graduated from Cambridge University.

While Archbishop Welby claims to have fallen out of touch with Iwerne members during his years abroad, an Iwerne event program shows that he came back to give a talk at the trust's library in 1979.

Moreover, the archbishop and the investigator, Mr. Ruston, were extremely close, as friends and colleagues, the victims and some church figures say, adding that it strains credulity to think that they would not have discussed the matter.

Mr. Ruston was the vicar of the Round Church in Cambridge, England, from the 1960s to the early 1980s, and the archbishop lodged there during his final year at the university in 1978.

Reflecting on their relationship in a magazine article in 2013, Archbishop Welby wrote that, “Mark was someone whose personal holiness shone out in every aspect of his life. We prayed together regularly, talked together a great deal, and I was continually inspired by him to seek to follow Christ more closely.”

A Church of England spokeswoman confirmed that Mr. Welby had paid for lodgings at Mr. Ruston’s rectory during his time as a student at Cambridge University, but denied that they had been close friends or that they had remained in contact after he left for Paris in 1978.

“He was certainly not aware of any report or the allegations surrounding it,” the spokeswoman said.

Yet a senior Church of England figure who has questioned the archbishop's account said that many people had heard about the accusations against Mr. Smyth at the time, but they knew to keep it “hushed up.” He withheld his identity because he was not permitted to comment on the issue while the police investigation was ongoing.

""It was a different time then,” he said. “Only recently has the church realized how crippling that silence was for the victims involved.”

The Iwerne insider, who was friends with Mr. Ruston during those years, said that all the senior members of the trust, including officers like Archbishop Welby, had been made aware of the allegations against Mr. Smyth, even those who had been abroad.

Another church figure, Alan Wilson, a Church of England bishop who is friends with former Iwerne members, said that he found it hard to believe the archbishop’s denials.

“I have no evidence, but I haven’t met a single Iwerne person who thinks it’s credible that Justin Welby didn’t know that Smyth had left the country under a cloud connected to his behavior toward boys who had been on Iwerne camps,” he said.

“Smyth was the chair of the trust, and just the fact that he suddenly dropped his law career and went to Africa would have raised questions,” he added.

The matter lay dormant until 2012, when Graham, one of the victims who withheld his last name to protect his privacy, came forward, demanding that the church provide him counseling.

“This whole affair has, I believe, cast a deep shadow over many aspects of my life, affecting my ability to do many things,” he wrote in an email to a member of the Church of England. “I have not worked now for 20 years. I want you, within the church, your circle, your elders, to find someone.”

In addition to counseling, he said, he was looking for justice, acknowledgment and assurance that Mr. Smyth was not committing the same abuses in South Africa that he is accused of in Britain.

It took six months before he received a response, which said there “might be someone who could help.” It was another 10 months before he received another email saying that the person they had in mind was “too busy.”

Graham said it was only after he accused Archbishop Welby of knowing about the abuse and threatened to go to the news media with his claims that he was assigned a therapist.

In response to his concerns over Mr. Smyth’s activities in Cape Town, Graham was told that the Bishop of Ely in Britain had written to the relevant bishop in South Africa but had not received a reply.

“I know this will be of no comfort to you and I’m sorry I have nothing more positive to say,” he was told. “I am hopeful that you may at last find a way to move on from that dreadful experience, in time.”

Many of the victims have asked why the archbishop did not reach out to them immediately after he says he learned of the abuse.

“The silence has been deafening,” Mr. Morse said.

While the victims acknowledge that the church has made progress in its understanding of abuse in recent years, they have labeled Archbishop Welby an “observer,” a term that denotes a person who knew about the abuse but did not report it appropriately.

After more than seven months of silence, Mr. Morse received a phone call from Mr. Welby's office last month asking what could be done for him and other Smyth victims.

Mr. Morse requested that the archbishop give a public interview on the matter and allow the victims to present him with evidence that shows the Titus Trust, which took over from the Iwerne Trust in 1997, lied to the police when the allegations were reported in 2013.

Tricky Clues

49A: “Strands in a cell?” looks like it refers either to the microscopic type of cell or a jail cell, although strands in a jail cell doesn’t make much sense. The answer refers to microscopic cells and the strands of genetic material within. If you are not sure whether the answer is RNA or DNA, fill in the “NA” and work that first crossing. 40D is AUDI, so the answer is DNA. See? You don’t have to be a scientist to do the crossword.

59D: I thought this one might bring out some of my fellow vegetable gardeners, because I’m sure I’m not the only one who believed that yams were tubers, not ROOTs. Apparently, “all tubers are root crops, but not all root crops are tubers,” and there are many ways to distinguish the part of a plant that grows underground. The main point you should take away from all this is that they’re good for you and you should eat your vegetables.

Constructor Notes

This idea for this theme came from thinking about Schrödinger puzzles, and wondering if I could potentially create one so that entries that contain more than one distinct stand-alone letter, for example, VITAMIN which can be followed by A, B, C, D, E, or K, intersect another such entry. Ideally, the shared possible letters for each pair of theme entries would be some combination of A, B, C and D, so that the revealer MULTIPLE CHOICE could be used. This didn’t end up panning out, but it did lead me, through a somewhat stream-of-consciousness manner of contemplating crossword themes, to come up with the one you see here. The first version of this puzzle had the theme entries VITAMINS, MUSICAL NOTES, CHEMICAL SYMBOLS, GREEK LETTERS and ALPHABET, and was rejected on the basis that ALPHABET was too obvious, and GREEK LETTERS was inconsistent. It was tough to find a new set of symmetrical theme entries, but I’m pleased with the current set. In each case, the category contains other members besides the ones that are composed of a single letter, and the letters are the members of the category themselves rather than being abbreviations, unlike something such as L M S for SHIRT SIZES. I spent a decent amount of time trying to remove the black square between TILE and GREEK and its symmetrical partner to allow for two pairs of long parallel downs, but I didn’t like the compromises on the fill, so I decided to stick to 78 words. Given that this ended up as a Monday (I had expected it to be a Tuesday) and the importance of smooth fill for Monday puzzles, I stand by this decision, and though there aren’t a ton of bonuses here, I’m fond of SHOT TO HELL and some of the mid-length fill like U.S. NEWS and HANSEL (he’s so hot right now). I don’t have a lot to say as far as the clues go, but a few of mine I’m glad to see survive the edit are 49-Across, 9-Down, 31-Down and 56-Down. Though I’m not sure it will be particularly applicable to this puzzle, I like the inside nod in the clue that Will and Joel came up with for AHA. In any case it’s great to be back, and I hope (fingers crossed) that my puzzle will be a pleasant start to everyone’s week.

Today’s Theme

The GUNFIGHT AT / THE O.K. CORRAL (28D and 62A) took place in October 1881, and was a 30-second shootout between the lawmen of Tombstone, Ariz., and a group of outlaws called the Cowboys (in those days, it was considered an insult to call a law-abiding cattleman a “cowboy”). Mr. Kahn was able to get only one law man (DOC HOLLIDAY) and one bad guy (IKE CLANTON) into his grid for space reasons.

In addition, we have four entries forming a circular “corral” of sorts (31A, 37D, 52A and 35D). All of them are synonyms for the word “O.K.,” but all are clued as something different, neatly hiding the connection to the theme in plain sight. That’s a pretty nice bonus.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had MACAU and MACAW (wrong, Deb! That’s a bird) before MACAO.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

The Soviets we loved. When printing technology in India was restricted to black and white, Russia bamboozled us with colorful comics and magazines. Russian ballets and circuses performed in Indian cities and were broadcast frequently on Indian state television.

Soviet cultural centers were active social hubs in Indian cities, offering lessons in music, dance and chess. Russians loved Bollywood. Raj Kapoor, who made and starred in musicals about simple-hearted characters smiling in the face of adversity, would be greeted with rousing receptions in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Book Exhibition would cram a vast ground in the center of town with stalls selling books and magazines, for all ages, in English and various Indian languages. Sovietland magazine was published in 13 Indian languages. It carried pictures of Soviet life, of collective farming, and Indo-Soviet collaborations on projects like the Bhilai steel plant.

Soviet books were inexpensive and beautifully produced on glossy art paper. Their low cost and great production value matched the preferred phrase of socialist India: “cheap and best.”

The comparatively meek American cultural effort was largely restricted to sending complimentary copies of Span magazine to university professors. My father, a poet who taught English literature at Allahabad University, received a copy of Span. It had pictures of cheeseburgers studded with sesame seeds and of geometry-box corn fields.

A typical issue would have Ronald Reagan on the cover, a short story by John Gardner, photographs by Ansel Adams, a debate on America’s nuclear strategy, and a long piece on America’s search for natural gas.

“The Russians are way ahead of the Americans in their hide-and-seek game... They strike at the grass roots,” an essay in The Christian Science Monitor noted in 1982. “They are in touch with the masses, not with the elite.”

After the book exhibitions, a traveling van stocked with Russian classics would snake its way through the lanes of Allahabad and other small towns across India.

Russian children’s literature is believed to have blurred the lines between propaganda and art, perhaps like no other children’s literature. I don’t remember any disreputable titles that glorified electrification and agriculture. I read numerous folk tales and children’s books printed by Moscow publishers — Raduga and Progress.

I had begun to read The Hardy Boys series, Nancy Drew and Enid Blyton by the time the Soviet books arrived. Even as a kid, one could make out that the American and English books were written to a formula. After a while one wasn’t reading these for the story but for the salivating descriptions of food — the exotic buttered scones and ginger beer in Blyton’s family-farm dramas; the ice cream sodas in Archie comics.

Food and propaganda were curiously missing from the Russian books. Alexander Raskin’s “When Daddy Was a Little Boy” was first published in 1966. It is a quietly funny, comically grotesque memoir of growing up: a boy gets bitten by a dog on both cheeks.

I found some echoes of my Indian childhood in the Russian tales. Reading obsessively, even under the blanket; disliking and not eating bread; going for piano or sitar lessons, even when you had no talent; the emphasis on good handwriting; making silly verses and reciting them unbidden to every visitor. Arrogance was to be avoided at all costs.

The couples in the folk tales were either childless, or aging with beautiful unmarried daughters. Some stories centered on grandmothers living with granddaughters. There was a touch of the macabre: two sisters kill their third sister out of malice before the redemptive power of magic revives her. I came across words I didn’t understand: sarafans, kavach. It didn’t matter.

In those throbbing, feral stories, I encountered Baba Yaga, the quintessential Russian witch. At times, she lived in the middle of the forest in a rotating cabin; at others, in “a great house of white stone with forty-one pillars at the gate.”

Not all folk tales ended with a neat moral. Many were about the constantly varying kaleidoscope of human nature. The miser borrows a kopeck from a peasant to give to a beggar. The dogged peasant keeps after the miser; he wants his kopeck back. Both keep outwitting the other. By the end of the tale, both men are richer due to the peasant’s cleverness. The naïve and yet not-so-naïve peasant still worries about the kopeck he lent the miser.

The Russians came to India and distributed their stories virtually for free. If this was propaganda, no one has bad memories of imbibing it.

The grapevine is one of the oldest plants in cultivation, and grapes are still the world’s largest fruit crop. Much of it goes into the rich and various world of winemaking. But, for all my delight in drinking wine, here I’m writing about the grapes that I use in the kitchen.

Luckily, the characteristics that make wine so complex — they can be tart, sweet, fresh, earthy and fruity — also come into play when cooking and baking with grapes. There are times when the distinction between wine grapes and kitchen grapes is pleasantly blurred and a recipe calls for the use of both.

Grapes don’t continue to ripen once picked, so they stay as sour or as sweet as when they’re harvested. Taste an unripe grape, and it will be mouth-puckeringly sour. Leave that same grape on the vine in the sun, and it will become incomparably sweet. The joy, though, is how much can be done with grapes in the kitchen at both ends of the spectrum, whether they’re left whole or turned into juice or syrup to be bottled.

I first experienced the power of unripe grapes a few years ago in Istanbul. I was spending the day with Musa Dagdeviren, a wonderfully inspiring chef. Musa’s mission is to reconnect those who eat at one of his restaurants in the modern city with traditional food from the land. In that tradition, meat is often paired with a tart fruit like sour cherries, green plums or unripe grapes. This is the food many people in Turkey grew up eating; reports of diners starting to cry as memories of their grandmothers’ cooking flood back follow Musa around.

With tissues in my pocket just in case, we drove out of town at dawn one morning, heading east to Musa’s small farm. We arrived just as his zucchini flowers were opening up with the morning sun. At the base of the pot the flowers were to be cooked in, Musa placed layers of grape leaves, sliced tomatoes, fresh mint and parsley, some kaymak (a Turkish product similar to clotted cream) and a small bunch or two of unripe grapes. After baking, the sharpness released from the grapes had suffused everything with an irresistible contrast of tart and richness. I didn’t cry, but, standing on the soil where grapevines have grown for so many centuries, I felt a real connection between food and place, history and memory.

Return of the ’80s! Synth-Pop Bands Stage a Middle-Aged Comeback

Image Clockwise from top left, videos from Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark; Erasure; Depeche Mode; and Alphaville. Credit

“Dynasty” is back on television. “Blade Runner” is in theaters. And all your favorite synth pop bands from the 1980s, including Depeche Mode and New Order, have new albums.

As Generation X moves into wistful middle age, the new-wave hit makers of the MTV V.J. era are back and touring. Here are some new long-playing discs (also available for streaming!) that recall a time when all it took was an angular haircut and a Yamaha DX7 to rule the world.

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark

New release: “The Punishment of Luxury,” released Sept. 1, is the band’s 13th album (and its third since reforming in 2006). The 12-track album remains true to the band’s signature robo-pop sound and offers a rumination and indictment on have-it-all consumerism.

Synth Classics : “ Enola Gay ” (1980); “So In Love” (1985)

Liner notes: With their knack for infectious hooks, the founding members Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys have been called “the Lennon-McCartney of synth pop.” The hit single “ If You Leave ” is forever burned into Gen X consciousness, thanks to John Hughes’s Brat Pack film “Pretty in Pink.”

’80s fashion faux pas : Kraftwerk for the masses (skinny ties and black turtlenecks).

Reviews: “As returns to form go, this is like Roger Federer winning this year’s Wimbledon. No, forget that — it’s like John McEnroe or Bjorn Borg winning this year’s Wimbledon.” — God Is in the TV , a music fanzine based in Britain.

New Order

New release : Following its highly regarded 2015 album , “Music Complete,” the band released a live album in May, “NOMC15” on vinyl, CD and for download , featuring new tracks and ’80s classics. It comes after a bitter breakup with the original bassist, Peter Hook .

Synth classics : “Blue Monday” (1983), “Bizarre Love Triangle” (1986).

Liner notes: Formed by the surviving members of the seminal post-punk band Joy Division after the lead singer Ian Curtis’s suicide, this Manchester quartet fused angsty guitar rock, electronica and a little bit of disco to become one of the most influential bands of the last three decades.

’80s fashion faux pas: Schoolboy gone to seed (messy haircuts, rumpled button-down shirts).

Reviews: “Not the best way to experience New Order, but it nevertheless doesn’t take anything away from their timeless studio albums or their memorable live shows face to face.” — Under the Radar , an indie music magazine based in Virginia.

Depeche Mode

New release : Like other ’80s bands trying to navigate the Brexit and Trump era, Depeche Mode has gotten ever more woke. The band’s 14th studio album, “ Spirit ,” has fiery anthems like “Where’s the Revolution” and “ Going Backwards .”

Synth classics: “Just Can’t Get Enough” (1981), “Personal Jesus” (1989)



Liner notes : Depeche Mode turned synth pop into stadium rock with its 1988 show at the Rose Bowl that drew 65,000 people. It has been in a nonstop comeback in the three decades since. Currently packing arenas on a world tour, Depeche Mode sold out two shows at Madison Square Garden last month.

’80s fashion faux pas : Transylvania Leather Bar (goatees, slicked-back hair, black leather).

Reviews : “The music moves away from the club dance floor; it moves in six beats rather than four. And the lyrics are as bluntly political as old Depeche Mode songs like ‘New Dress,’ openly confronting a new propaganda regime.” — The New York Times .

Erasure

New release : “ World Be Gone,” the band’s 17th, was released in May and offers a more brooding Erasure, trading the disco frothiness for weighty social commentary on topics like political disenfranchisement on tracks like “Oh What a World.”

Synth classics: “Chains of Love ,” “A Little Respect” (1988)

Liner notes: After helping start Depeche Mode and Yaz, Vince Clarke put an ad in Melody Maker in 1985 for a singer. That led him to Andy Bell; the two spawned dozens of hits that became dance club staples and went on to sell more than 25 million albums .

’80s fashion faux pas: Glam goes electronic ( gold lamé , thigh-high boots ).

Reviews: “Whether you like Erasure’s 17th studio album will depend on how you feel about facing the world, in its current state, in the mirror. Musically it is not their strongest, but this is one such occasion where the lyrics overpower almost everything.” — musicOMH , a Britain-based indie music site.

Alphaville

New Release : Strange Attractor , the band’s first in seven years (and only its second in 20 years) was released in April, and goes beyond the band’s synthpop DNA to dabble in funk, industrial, and rockabilly. Marian Gold’s voice still sounds ethereal on haunting songs like “A Handful of Darkness.”

Synth classics: “Big in Japan ,” “Forever Young” (1984).

Liner notes : Along with Nena and Falco , this German outfit brought a Teutonic moodiness to the Day-Glo MTV era. Alphaville crossed over, however unintentionally, to a new generation when Jay-Z reinvented one of its biggest hits as “Young Forever” on his 2009 album, “The Blueprint 3.”

’80s fashion faux pas : Star Trek: Die Nächste Generation (military-style jumpsuits channeling the 23rd century).

Reviews : “Ultimately, ‘Strange Attractor’ is a take-it-or-leave-it Gold moment. After all, for an artist who has been operating with an array of sonispheric colors and hues for thirty-five years now, there is really nothing more to defy. Gold is simply making music the way he feels like it.” — Cryptic Rock , apparently your go-to site for music and horror coverage.

Cobb salad, paired with ‘Trick or Treat’ (Season 2, Episode 3)

Who invented the Cobb salad? According to Larry’s dinner companion in this episode, Cliff Cobb, it was invented by his grandfather at the Drake Hotel in Chicago. Larry, as well as our food writer Alison Roman, are a bit more skeptical about the salad’s origins. As Ms. Roman explains in the instructions for this classic, there are a few ingredients that you absolutely must include: “tender chicken breast, tangy tomatoes, perfectly hard-boiled egg and, perhaps most important, crispy bacon.” Larry’s take on the Cobb — sans bacon and eggs, with the blue cheese on the side — may not, ultimately, pass the test.",4 Things to Cook While Watching ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/smarter-living/curb-your-enthusiasm-recipes.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The fund began the year after Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times, gave money to a homeless man for shelter and new clothes on Dec. 25, 1911. The campaign last year raised $6,177,625 — over half a million dollars more than the year before.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Contributions to this campaign will be collected into January, and like last year, online donations can be made through GoFundMe. Ms. King cited the ease of donating through GoFundMe as a reason for her first donation, in December.

The Times pays the fund’s overhead costs, with all donations going directly to the beneficiary organizations: Brooklyn Community Services, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, Children’s Aid, the Community Service Society of New York, FPWA, the International Rescue Committee and UJA-Federation of New York. The organizations spend the money at their discretion, often to cover gaps in public assistance.

The career of Mr. Lippmann, now 81 and living in Hudson, Fla., was informed by poverty issues and the plight of the less fortunate. Before moving behind the bench, he was a lawyer for 17 years at the Legal Aid Society in the Bronx. Early in his judicial career, he ruled that a mentally disturbed homeless woman who had been involuntarily hospitalized should be released and allowed to return to the streets. In the decision, Mr. Lippmann wrote, “It is my hope that the plight she represents will also offend moral conscience and rouse it to action.” He later told The Times, “I believe that society’s role is a major part of the problem.”

That belief partly stemmed from the influence of a beloved high school teacher, William J. Nagle, who taught Latin and Greek at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx in the first half of the twentieth century. Each year Mr. Nagle collected donations from students for the fund, some years accruing about $4,000 — the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars today.

Among the students who were influenced was Mickey J. Littmann, who graduated in 1952 and is now a managing director of investments in Manhattan. Mr. Littmann said he had donated to the fund since he was 16, though that first time, he admitted, “I donated money I got from my parents.”

Giving annually, he adds a dollar each year, one for every year since he graduated high school. “The idea is just to give something for the organizations who benefit from it, and certainly to the people who need it,” Mr. Littmann said.

For some donors, the tradition comes from family. Margaret Boorstein, who grew up in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan, said her mother read aloud articles about recipients of Neediest Cases funds when the family gathered in the parlor.

In the early 1960s, one story about a girl close in age tot Ms. Boorstein at the time inspired her own fund-raising efforts. Around age 8, she began selling small soap bars with her younger sister, Elizabeth, for 2 cents a bar, donating the earnings to the fund. She has given almost every year since.

“I think I’m lucky,” Ms. Boorstein said. “I can afford it. I don’t go overboard. I don’t give millions upon millions of dollars, not that I have millions upon millions of dollars. I understand that people struggle.”

Ruth Queen, whose father grew up in the Bronx in the Depression era, started giving to the fund in the late 1950s. “I was taught there’s always someone poorer than you, and you have to give back,” she said.

Ms. Queen of Old Bridge, N.J., said she saw taking part in the fund-raising campaign as an important part of the Jewish tradition of charitable giving. “It’s part of who we are,” she said. “Tikkun olam: You give back. I’ve done what my parents always did, and my children will follow us.”

As pivotal as tradition has been to donations, often it is empathy or a personal connection to a story that motivates readers to give. During last year’s campaign, Jackie Syrop of Lawrenceville, N.J., was moved by the plight of a Syrian boy whose family, refugees in Jordan, struggled to afford medicine to treat his Type I diabetes.

“When we saw this kid, we said, this is our nightmare,” Ms. Syrop said. “That this would have been us.” The story mirrored her own life. Her 26-year-old son, Joe Beckett, was given a diagnosis of Type I diabetes at age 5. As a middle-class family, it was a challenge to afford the necessary medical care.

“A lot of stories tug at your heartstrings, but in this case I felt, you could suddenly be this kid’s mother,” Ms. Syrop said. “And it’s so sad. This is how it is. You can’t protect your kid, you can’t do anything.”

Photo

Likewise, Eleanor Seepes of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, has long understood the complications of being a single mother with a sick child. She raised her daughter, who has brittle bone disease, on her own after the death of her husband more than 30 years ago.

“My own personal life is so strained — I read these stories and it really gets to me,” she said. “I have to help and show that I’m grateful it wasn’t worse.”

Every year, she gives $25 to $35 from her fixed Social Security income to a person or family featured.

“A lot of times, it’s where a parent is trying and trying for so many years to stay ahead and make a meaningful life,” Ms. Seepes said. “It really appeals to me.”

Three years ago, that connection was deeply personal. Ms. Seepes came across an article about a single mother caring for a child with the same disease as her daughter.

Ms. Seepes is celebrating her 80th birthday next month by hosting a party at a bar, and instead of presents, she is asking guests to donate to a charity. She has compiled a two-page list of suggestions, and the Neediest Cases Fund is among them.

你的智能手机

智能手机是我们每天都会长时间使用的物件，但你最后一次因为手机屏幕脏到啥也看不清而擦拭它是什么时候？事实上，考虑到我们使用手机有多频繁，又是在什么地点（没错，我们会坐在马桶上查看Facebook上的信息），我们真应该时不时更加彻底地清洁一下自己的手机。

当然了，来自你手部的一点儿油脂并不能毁灭世界，但一堆肮脏的细菌在你的手机上欣欣向荣地生长，绝不是令人愉悦的事。保持手机的清洁还会带来其他好处——这样做能让手机屏幕清清爽爽，方便你查看信息，能让尘埃和污垢远离扬声器格栅、充电端口和耳机插口（如果你的手机上还有这些东西的话）。

你的电脑键盘

你的遥控器

请老实回答：一直以来你清理过遥控器吗？不论用的是普通的电视遥控器，还是更复杂的来自有线电视公司的那种，每当你倒在沙发上，大约都会拿起它调台，然后放松一下。但你擦拭按钮间的污垢和灰尘的频率绝对没有那么高，对吧？

你的枕头

你或许不知道，但大多数枕头都被设计成了可机洗产品。把枕头从洗衣机（或干洗机，如果生产商建议干洗的话）里拿出来的时候，你必须抖一抖它们，让它们变得蓬松；不要洗得太勤，以免变形。

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

Emily Naismith, an Australian writer and co-host of the food podcast Ingredipedia, said that she, like many Australians, had eaten the salty, savory spread her entire life.

“I feel like Vegemite is the great equalizer through all of Australia,” she said. “I don’t know who they’re trying to service — which type of market.”

Anthony Agius, a Melbourne resident who says he has eaten Vegemite for 32 years, purchased the new product out of curiosity. “I eat a lot of Vegemite, so I figured, Why not try a new flavor? Maybe I’d like it more than original Vegemite.”

Mr. Agius said he could not easily distinguish the new blend from the original. “Really couldn’t tell the difference,” he said. “It’s maybe a bit more salty, if I think about it, but that’s it.”

Other customers took to Twitter to review the new version.

“Some people spread their Vegemite on lightly; some lather it on,” said Mr. Hill, the Vegemite marketer. “I particularly say for those who lather it on to try this special edition. The higher intensity of the Vegemite taste means they can use less and savor the jar for longer.”

When asked whether the new product may be a cynical, short-lived marketing ploy to draw attention and stoke lighthearted controversy, Mr. Hill simply encouraged Australians to “embrace the taste.” The company, he said, did not plan to reissue the product after its initial run of 450,000 units.

225,"['germanys', 'prophet', 'right', 'kubitschek', 'germany', 'country', 'volk', 'west', 'political', 'way', 'german', 'party']","Until recently, though, New Right thinking mostly remained on the fringes of German society, lacking grass-roots expression or a viable manifestation in party politics.
But the German New Right has other influences as well.
“The old structures are to be kept intact.”Kubitschek was born in Ravensburg, a wealthy southern town in what was then West Germany.
He now speaks of the former West Germany in derisive terms.
This seemed like the right moment to ask him about a concept often discussed in New Right circles: thymos — an ancient Greek word use to signify a sense of prideful, righteous indignation.","The human being, he told me as he took a restrained sip, is a “very difficult type.” It is not in our nature to adhere to some strict political ideology like communism or Nazism, he said; rather, human beings ought to be raised according to their inclinations. “There’s something the human being can achieve, something he can be. It’s in this direction that he ought to be raised. And we ought never to pull him away from that.” Is this a dark knight or a Montessori schoolteacher, I asked myself, but Kubitschek had already moved on to the topic of Germanness. “The idea that there is such a thing as a pure German is wholly absurd,” he said — populations migrate and absorb other influences. Naturally, he said, an immigrant could also become a German, just as long as that person “is willing to give everything for this country and is ready to identify with it.”

I asked Kubitschek to define “Germanness” for me. He seemed eager to discuss the subject. Few other people, he said, are so thoroughly preoccupied with the question of who they are: Germany is both Catholic and Lutheran, he said, both Prussian and Bavarian; Germany is the sensitive, cultured nation that produced poets like Goethe and Schiller and the historically militaristic one that produced the Waffen-SS. “Germanness is a fissure,” he said. “Germanness is a question without an answer.”

This, I thought, was hardly the kind of positivist vision of German greatness upon which you might build a right-wing nationalist movement. I was, for the moment, having a bit of difficulty conjuring the version of Kubitschek who had, with an almost apocalyptic fervor, warned of the looming demise of the German Volk (literally the “folk,” but often used to indicate a national identity in ethnic terms), the man who had argued at an anti-immigration rally that Germans are being “replaced and exchanged” by migration, the man who had suggested that the “pathological” manner with which Germany processes the crimes of the Nazi past leads to a corrupting strain of national self-hatred. Kubitschek promulgates these ideas not only through books and in seminars but also through his connections to some of the most radical politicians in Alternative for Germany, or the AfD, a far-right party that won nearly 13 percent of the national vote in September, making it the most successful nationalist party to sit in the German Parliament since the Second World War. Alternative for Germany has become ever more radical since it was founded in 2013 — increasingly portraying itself as the defender of the Volk and of German identity — a transformation that Kubitschek, behind the scenes, has been instrumental in bringing about.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

As Kubitschek nursed his beer at the table, however, he was sounding pretty measured. Before I got around to asking him about his connection to Alternative for Germany, a young girl in a white dress, the daughter of a visitor, approached our table. She had been outside playing with some of Kubitschek’s younger children (he has seven). “Mr. Kubitschek!” she said. “One of the rabbits got out and is running around the garden.”

“What?” replied Kubitschek with feigned, playful drama. “Then catch it and put it back in the cage!”

“O.K.!” the girl said, hurrying back out.

A few minutes later, a young woman quietly informed Kubitschek of another problem. A newborn baby goat was “very agitated.” Kubitschek, who decries modern man’s disconnectedness from the sources of his food, promptly excused himself and rushed out, returning a few minutes later to explain that his newborn goats sometimes have trouble digesting their mother’s milk. He rubbed the distressed newborn’s belly, he said, and it passed a stool. All was well at the manor again.

Kubitschek does not officially belong to the AfD — he and his wife applied and were rejected as too radical in 2015, when the party’s leadership was more moderate — and he doesn’t see party politics as his domain. (His wife has since joined the party.) He prefers to promote his ideas in what he calls the meta-political realm, where he can sway a culture that, in his view, is dominated by leftist thinking. Kubitschek does not hesitate to provoke in the service of his New Right cause, but he also has a talent for couching his illiberal ideology in innocuous-seeming, even liberal-sounding precepts that keep him within the bounds of acceptable discourse even as he expands them. The idea, for instance, that no one should be forced to abide by a strict ideology sounds wholly unobjectionable. But for Kubitschek and his fellow New Right thinkers, the roster of strict ideologies includes liberalism, multiculturalism, egalitarianism and feminism, all of which are “social experiments” (as Kubitschek puts it) imposed by the political elite on the unwilling Volk.

Kubitschek’s views are reaching a growing audience. Despite the unique cultural taboos arising from the historical memory of Nazism, Germany has joined a long list of European countries — Austria, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Slovakia among them — where far-right, sometimes explicitly racist political parties command significant minorities in national elections. This ethno-nationalist renaissance presents an odd paradox. European nationalists who at one time might have gone to war with one another now promote a kind of New Right rainbow coalition, in which sovereign states steadfastly maintain their ethnic and cultural identities in service of some larger “Western” ideal. This “ethno-pluralism,” as New Right activists call it, is not based on Western liberal notions of equality or the primacy of individual rights but in opposition to other cultures, usually nonwhite, that they say are threatening to overtake Europe and, indeed, the entire Western world by means of immigration. The threat to the West is also often cast in vague cultural terms as a kind of internal decay. When President Trump visited Poland, he argued in a speech that the United States and Europe were engaged in a common cultural battle. “The fundamental question of our time,” he said, “is whether the West has the will to survive.”

That question has deep roots in Germany. In 1918, the German philosopher Oswald Spengler published the first volume of “The Decline of the West,” arguing that cultures decline as regularly and predictably as any other organic entity — and that Western civilization was near the end of its cycle. Germany had just lost a war, and Spengler’s book struck a chord with disillusioned Germans looking to explain their sense of downfall. Spengler belonged to a loosely defined group of German thinkers called the Conservative Revolutionaries, who argued that Western decline was the inevitable result of materialism and soulless democracy. They opposed the fractious parliamentary democracy of the time, the liberal values of the French Revolution and ultimately modernity itself. They called for national revival by way of an authoritarian leader who could bring about an almost-mystical regeneration of the Volk — in part by pitting them against the Volk of other nations. “A people is only really such in relation to other peoples,” Spengler wrote, “and the substance of this actuality comes out in natural and ineradicable oppositions, in attack and defense, hostility and war.”

The German New Right portrays itself as the contemporary reincarnation of the Conservative Revolution. Kubitschek regularly echoed Spengler in our conversations and on more than one occasion told me that Germany was a “tired” nation in its twilight years. The New Right’s efforts to reclaim this dated political and intellectual movement serve a purpose. Despite their unmistakable ideological overlap with the National Socialists, many Conservative Revolutionaries were ambivalent toward them and rejected Hitler as a proletarian brute. That apparent distance provides New Right thinkers not just with a nationalist, antiparliamentary tradition rooted in German history but also with a useful argument: National Socialism is a deviation from their chosen ideology, not its inevitable conclusion.

The ideas of the Conservative Revolutionaries, however, cannot be separated from the rise of Hitler. In 1923, one of the movement’s most prominent thinkers, Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, published “The Third Reich” — another critique of Western liberalism. As the title suggests, Moeller van den Bruck had some influence on the Nazis (Goebbels said his book was “very important for the history of National Socialist political ideas”), though they later repudiated the author himself. The Conservative Revolutionaries’ more consequential influence, however, was on the wider population. Their despair over modernity contributed to the “debility of democracy” and fueled a “politically exploitable discontent,” the historian Fritz Stern wrote in “The Politics of Cultural Despair.” In other words, their ideas helped pave the way for the arrival of a Führer, even though the one who arrived was not necessarily to their liking.

After World War II, Armin Mohler, a Swiss-born writer who had tried unsuccessfully to join the Waffen-SS, took on the project of disentangling the Conservative Revolutionary ideology from Nazism. Mohler, a self-described fascist who had an early and profound influence on Kubitschek, sought to create a more palatable tradition for the postwar era, and he is considered the father of the German New Right. Until recently, though, New Right thinking mostly remained on the fringes of German society, lacking grass-roots expression or a viable manifestation in party politics. But the German political climate changed in 2015, when Angela Merkel allowed nearly a million refugees and migrants to enter the country over the Bavarian border. While many Germans celebrated their arrival, others were angered, feeling that their worries about “Islamization,” criminality and the erosion of German identity were being ignored by the political establishment. For New Right activists, that anger is good. It is the ineradicable opposition that will bring about the political transformation they seek.

But the German New Right has other influences as well. Nils Wegner, a young writer who translates English-language books into German for Kubitschek’s publishing house, follows the American alt-right scene with great interest — listening, for example, to podcasts by Richard Spencer, the white-supremacist leader who once declared before a crowd of acolytes: “Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!” Wegner told me that the American idea of a “racially defined ethno-state” would “come across as pretty weird over here,” because Europeans are not comfortable putting identity matters in racial terms. I asked him if this discomfort was substantive or merely semantic, and his answer was surprisingly forthright. “I would say that the main difference is the semantic difference,” he said. “Also, the modus operandi is not really the same.” Unlike alt-right activists in the United States, he went on to explain, activists on the European New Right tend to avoid appearing alongside “orthodox” right groups — neo-Nazis — because “the look” would impede their effort to appear as a “new kind of postmodern” patriotic movement.

Wegner said another difference was a matter of intensity. The Americans, he said, see their country as collapsing, and therefore they advocate revolutionary action — the creation of a white ethno-state in the Pacific Northwest, for example. European New Right activists don’t see their circumstances as that dire, he continued. They would be content with a “roll back” on immigration.

“It’s not yet a revolutionary situation,” he said. “The old structures are to be kept intact.”

Kubitschek was born in Ravensburg, a wealthy southern town in what was then West Germany. It was a traditional society, he recalls, one where women stayed home and raised children and people voted for the center-right Christian Democratic Union, currently the party of Angela Merkel. He and his friends learned Latin and Greek in high school, and they preferred fencing or horseback riding to soccer, which was considered a “prole” activity. This halcyon way of life was gone, he told me — a victim of society’s leftward progression.

He now speaks of the former West Germany in derisive terms. He sees “Wessis” — the people who live there — as having been indoctrinated into a form of hyper-moralistic mass thinking. Its cities, he believes, are “lost” to immigrants. His wife, Ellen Kositza, who writes polemics against what she calls “hyper-feminism,” also hails from the West — from a working-class city near Frankfurt that, she said, has become almost completely “foreignized.” The former East Germany, where they’ve made their new home, has experienced comparatively less immigration; it’s the place where, as Kubitschek put it, “Germany is still Germany.”

Kubitschek told me his political awakening came in high school, when a group of classmates put together a presentation about the Nazi period in their state. Kubitschek loathed the presentation, he said, because it unjustly placed guilt for the Nazi crimes on his grandparents’ entire generation. Kubitschek, who was an editor at the school newspaper, wrote an article criticizing the presentation, and it set off a community debate. The younger teachers, products of 1960s counterculture, took the side of the students who put on the presentation. The older teachers, including the rector, who helped operate an antiaircraft gun in the war, sided with him. One sympathetic teacher suggested that Kubitschek read the work of the historian Ernst Nolte, known for a controversial essay he wrote around that time titled “The Past That Won’t Go Away.” Nolte portrayed Nazism as a reaction to the “existential threat” posed by Bolshevism and suggested Bolshevik “class murder” was comparable to the Holocaust, calling it the “logical and factual predecessor to the Nazi ‘racial murder.’ ” Nolte’s revisionism sparked a divisive debate in Germany known as the “historians’ dispute,” and though Nolte was denounced as a Hitler apologist, several conservative German historians and journalists supported him. For Kubitschek, Nolte’s work has been a lifelong influence.

After high school, Kubitschek joined the German Army, becoming part of a special reconnaissance unit, and later joined the reserves. His company was “very right,” he said. It drew from an “unbroken historical tradition” that reached back at least as far as the Brandenburgers, a Nazi covert-intelligence unit, and symbols like the “swastika and so on” hung on the company walls. Several of the men I met in Kubitschek’s circle also served in the military; in postwar pacifist Germany, one of them told me, it is attractive to a lot of rightists who saw German demilitarization as an emasculating development. In 2001, Kubitschek himself was discharged from the reserves for “right-wing-extremist endeavors,” but the decision was later revoked after supporters petitioned the Army.

Kubitschek now keeps close contact with a faction of Alternative for Germany politicians who refer to themselves as der Flügel, or “the Wing.” It is led by some of the most extreme politicians in the party, including a former history teacher named Björn Höcke, a head of the party in the eastern state of Thuringia. Kubitschek and Höcke have known each other for nearly two decades, and Kubitschek speaks very highly of the party leader, calling him an “idealist” and a “romantic.” But in Germany, few politicians have done more to blur the already-fuzzy line between the New Right and the old right. In March 2015, it was Höcke who initiated an internal party revolt against the party’s founder, an economist named Bernd Lucke, releasing a resolution that accused the party’s leadership of unduly embracing the “establishment” and failing to resist “the further erosion of Germany’s sovereignty and identity.”

The resolution, which set into motion Lucke’s downfall as party leader, read like something Kubitschek could have written. In fact, Kubitschek told me, he drafted it in his library in Schnellroda. What Lucke had failed to grasp, Kubitschek said, was the degree to which Alternative for Germany represented an emotional “outbreak” that went way beyond the economist Lucke’s “technocratic dissatisfaction” with the euro.

Flügel politicians are now ascendant within the party — and they are increasingly mixing their nationalism with the antiliberalism agenda of the New Right. Before the election, I attended an Alternative for Germany rally in Artern, a depressed-looking town not very far from Schnellroda. There, I was struck by how Flügel politicians devoted much of their speeches to a number of economic issues traditionally though of as leftist — low wages, poverty in old age, insufficient social benefits, rhetoric designed to shift the party away from its roots in economic liberalism. One of the politicians, a man named Jürgen Pohl, who was subsequently elected into Parliament, denounced the claim that Germany is doing “better than ever” economically. Should Angela Merkel and “our new African citizens” come to the former East Germany, he said, they’d see the “poor house of Germany.” Another speaker, André Poggenburg, the head of the party in Saxony-Anhalt, declared Alternative for Germany to be “the new party of social justice.” The message was simple enough: more benefits for the Volk, and fewer foreigners to take those benefits away. In the former East, where unemployment remains higher and salaries remain lower than in the former West, that message seems to resonate, helping the party peel away hundreds of thousands of voters from die Linke, the descendant of the East German Communist Party.

The shift is not entirely surprising. New Right thinkers often entertain the idea of establishing a querfront, or a “cross front” that would unite opponents of liberalism on both extremes of the political spectrum. During my talks with Kubitschek, I often found myself detecting what at first seemed to me a perplexing leftist bent, an aversion to American-style materialism. You had only to go the shopping center on a Saturday morning, he once told me, and observe people in their “consumption temple” to see how there is “nothing at all there, spiritually.” For Kubitschek and other New Right thinkers, American liberalism — with its emphasis on individual rights and the individual pursuit of happiness — is perhaps the most corrosive force eating away at the identity of the Volk, replacing a sense of “we” with individualism and profit-seeking self-interest.

One evening, as we sat in the gloaming dimness of his library, Kubitschek delivered a long lament about what he perceived to be the ills of modernity: banal consumption, the decline of Christian belief (Kubitschek is a Catholic), mechanization that is making workers superfluous. These forces were undermining the Volk, he told me, and there was very little that could be done to stop it.

I asked him then what was left for him to do. Despair?

I was half joking, but he nodded in all seriousness.

“You’re desperate?” I asked.

“Yes,” he said.

What, I asked, does political victory look like for a movement of despair?

The best that could be done, he said, was “to prevent the worst.”

On the Monday after my first visit to Schnellroda, I went to see Kubitschek speak at a demonstration in Dresden. The event had been organized by “Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West” — known by the German acronym Pegida — which had been holding rallies in Dresden on Monday evenings since 2014. By the following year, as the global refugee crisis arrived in Germany with full force, the demonstrations often drew more than 10,000 people, but attendance has since dwindled, and on this night only a few thousand people were expected.

The rally took place in a central square near an unostentatious memorial marking the spot where thousands of corpses were burned after the 1945 Allied bombing that destroyed the city. Before the event began, I found a group of demonstrators — mostly men and women of retirement age — huddled around an accordion player. They were singing folk songs like “Holy Fatherland,” a tune once favored by the Hitler Youth. “In dangerous times, your sons cluster around you. Surrounded by danger, Fatherland, we all stand hand in hand.” One silver-haired man who placed a bellowing emphasis on the word “Fatherland” every time it came up handed me a lyric sheet so I could follow along. I asked him what kind of songs they were.

“Forbidden songs!” he said, almost hollering.

“Really?” I asked.

“Almost,” he said more gently. “People don’t listen to German folk songs.” Raising his voice again, he added, “Nationalism is out!”

In that moment, I was reminded that before the fall of the Iron Curtain, while West Germans were still struggling to comprehend and expose Nazi crimes, East Germans were taught a different version of World War II history, one that depicted them as heroes in the global fight against fascism. Some scholars suggest that the East German deflection of blame reverberates today in the form of a greater willingness to accept far-right nationalism. It’s perhaps no coincidence, then, that Pegida demonstrations are more prominent in the former East Germany, and that Alternative for Germany won 22 percent of the Eastern vote in the recent election.

After enough demonstrators gathered, they went on a short march around the town hall, with its soaring clock tower, and back to the square. Anti-fascist counterdemonstrators, most of them young, many of them university students, held a banner that said “Make Borders History” and yelled, “Nazis out!” Pegida demonstrators, many of them old enough to be the counterdemonstrators’ grandparents, retorted: “You’re the Nazis!”

Soon after the Pegida demonstrators returned to the square, Kubitschek hopped onto a makeshift stage and clutched a microphone. The center of his speech was an extended metaphor featuring a cat and its avian prey, a dove that can’t get away because it has a broken wing.

“Now, it is dragged down the stairs,” he said, staring into the crowd. “It does not flutter anymore. It does not defend itself. Its head bangs against every step, and there’s a long way to go until we reach the cellar.”

The dove with the broken wing was, of course, the Volk, while the cat was the “political class.”

“Actually, we are way too big for this cat that is dragging us behind it,” Kubitschek continued, “and yet for some reason, we do not get on our feet. But we must get back on our feet ... and climb up again step by step.”

The crowd cheered and chanted: “Resistance! Resistance!”

Kubitschek paused, as if to collect his thoughts. There was a way for the Volk to escape the cat’s paws — it must demand the re-institution of “law and order” through the sealing of the German border, and it must demand that the political parties putting their own interests above the country’s be reined in by restricting their public financing. He mocked Angela Merkel. She presides over a party called the Christian Democratic Union, he said, but would have gladly opened Vienna’s city door to Ottoman Muslim invaders in 1683. “Why does our establishment despise its own people?” he asked.

The source of the contempt, according to Kubitschek, was Germany’s “memory politics,” the effort by Germans to confront their Nazi past, which involves tempering any nationalist urges. New Right thinkers see that restraint not as a virtue but as a symptom of a deeply ingrained self-hate — a hatred that must be overcome for Germany to be great again.

In January, Björn Höcke, the AfD leader, voiced a similar lament in a speech at a beer hall in Dresden, and much more caustically. Germans are “the only people in the world who have planted a monument of disgrace in the heart of their capital,” he said, referring to the Holocaust memorial near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. German history was being made “rotten and ridiculous,” he said. “It cannot and must not go on like this! There is no moral duty to dissolution!” The speech provoked a national uproar, and even some politicians within AfD criticized it.

Kubitschek saw it as a tactical error. Höcke’s comments, he said, were “correct in substance but wrong in tone.”

Kubitschek has had greater success advancing the “self-dissolution” theme in the meta-political realm. Recently, he published a book called “Finis Germania,” written by Rolf Peter Sieferle, an environmental historian. Sieferle warned that shame over Nazi crimes is driving a neurotic German belief that the “Earth will be cleansed from the shameful mark of the eternal Nazis only when the Germans have completely disappeared.”

In June, “Finis Germania” was selected for a prominent book-of-the-month list, an entry into the mainstream of public opinion that itself stoked another major controversy. How could such a book, deemed anti-Semitic and extremist by many within the media and literary establishments, be so readily accepted into the public discourse? Kubitschek called the reaction a “panic.” Expanding the boundaries of discourse was precisely what Germany needed, precisely what the Volk required. This was the way to heal its broken wing.

My last visit to Kubitschek’s home was on a Saturday evening, some hours after he had hosted a book reading. We sat in a room next to the offices of his publishing house, joined by several of his friends, all men. Kubitschek lit several candles, and a warm breeze from the open window whipped the flames. The other men popped open bottles of beer; Kubitschek stuck to juice. In the company of his friends, he spoke more openly than he had in our previous talks. The topic of the night was mostly the refugee influx since 2015.

Kubitschek casually mentioned that he would not mind at all if a strongman came to replace Merkel, if that was the only way to correct her decision to allow the migrants to enter Germany. In a time of great peril, he noted soberly, a leader must act beyond the law. He cited Carl Schmitt, the conservative political theorist who criticized parliamentary democracy and aligned with the Nazis after they took power: “Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” Merkel herself had acted outside the law by opening the border, Kubitschek said, and that proved she was sovereign. And yet, he continued, “I’d have absolutely nothing against it if someone came along and with the same sovereignty did the opposite. Someone who would say: ‘The experiment is over. The Parliament won’t be consulted. I will prop up with my power the administration, the organs of the state, the police’ — who would in any case be supportive — ‘the border patrol, the military, and we will end this experiment.’ That means: borders shut. Test to see who can be assimilated; they can stay. Those who can’t be assimilated, they’ve got to go.”

It was clear the Kubitschek considers “refugee” a misnomer. These were not, for the most part, refugees fleeing persecution or war, but opportunists — mostly “hungry young men,” as he put it — acting “very rationally” to improve their lot. These migrants arrived in an “insecure” country, he said, where the people “don’t know who they are or what belongs to them.” The migrants, he said, therefore begin to think, Doesn’t everything here belong to everyone? “And then the waves are set into motion, and they say: ‘All right, here we have a country, a fallow country, and it’s a country that must be conquered, and it can be conquered. And it won’t be conquered with ladders for storming fortresses or with machetes, but with sheer presence.’ ” Everyone at the table seemed to agree that the consequences of this conquering were dire. Crime, they argued, was on the rise; women could no longer feel safe walking alone outside at night. “We all know the dystopian stories,” Kubitschek said. Matters might get “supercharged in a hyper-identitarian way,” he added. “If it once again becomes really brutal or cruel, we don’t know. It can also transition over into a country that is no longer Germany.”

Kubitschek put a few new candles in the candelabrum, pressing them into the molten red wax of the old ones. This seemed like the right moment to ask him about a concept often discussed in New Right circles: thymos — an ancient Greek word use to signify a sense of prideful, righteous indignation. Marc Jongen, a philosopher and Alternative for Germany functionary who was once an assistant to one of Germany’s best-known contemporary philosophers, Peter Sloterdijk, argues that Germany lacks the thymos necessary to defend itself from cultural erosion. Kubitschek addresses Jongen’s idea in his own writing, referring to lacking German thymos — which Kubitschek has defined more simply as “rage” — as tantamount to the “emasculation of our Volk.” Kubitschek writes that it is valid to question whether a revolt, an eruption of mass rage, can be controlled. Yet, he writes, the consequences of a revolt are less troubling than the threat of what would happen if the Volk’s thymotic energy became insufficient to fuel the “successful defense of what belongs to it.”

I asked Kubitschek about the sharp rise of right-wing violence in Germany since the refugee influx. “It’s a reaction that someone can have who really has the feeling that his country is being taken,” Kubitschek said, “that everything he knows and what he grew up in is changing, and who sees that something totally alien is spreading and he doesn’t want it.”

“Is violence justified?” I asked.

“I don’t see it as justified,” he said. The migrant is “ultimately only the figure that we can see, so to speak, but behind him is much bigger development.” He said that the young male migrants who come to Germany as asylum-seekers must be frustrated — they are being treated like kindergarten kids, given enough to eat and a place to sleep, but they have no real chance to become part of the society. “They want to work,” he said. “They want to meet a few women. They simply want to take their lives into their own hands. And it’s not at all possible here,” he said. “This country doesn’t need these people.”

Kubitschek mentioned an article he read about a small village in Saxony-Anhalt where a large number of asylum seekers had been settled. “That is also a form of violence,” he said.

“Clearly!” said one of the men at the table.

“The village is being changed in its substance,” said Kubitschek. “Or perhaps even being destroyed.” The question, he added, is: “Why must we be O.K. with that?”

“Why then isn’t violence justified?” I asked. If these refugees were conquerors, and their presence was destroying a way of life, couldn’t a person justifiably claim self-defense?

“The refugee is the false opponent,” Kubitschek said.

After a pause, he added an amendment. “Actually, if it’s going to come to violence, we ought to storm the Parliament. We have no replacement to offer, but this woman can’t govern any longer. We must go on from here in a different way.”

Then Kubitschek announced that there had been too much talking. “Everything is clear, isn’t it?” he said, inspiring a round of laughs from the table.

He and a friend picked up guitars, and they began to sing old German folk songs, some of them with beautiful, baroque melodies. The first was a martial homage to Georg von Frundsberg, a German mercenary who fought for the Holy Roman Empire and was famed for his brilliant infantry maneuvers. Von Frundsberg hailed from a town not far from where Kubitschek grew up, and in 1525 he helped Emperor Charles V secure the imperial throne with a decisive victory at Pavia, in what is today Italy. Everyone at the table sang along.

“Georg von Frundsberg, lead us, tra la la la la la,” the men sang, their voices deep. I sank back into my chair and listened.

Some worry that ending the subsidies would hurt their constituents. Others are loath to do anything that could be seen as propping up the health law that they had promised to tear down.

For their part, Democrats are convinced that any blame for rising premiums and shrinking choices will fall on Republicans, who now control the White House and Congress. After spending the year trying to preserve the Affordable Care Act, Democrats did not appear ready on Friday to make major concessions.

“Unless our Republican colleagues act, the American people will know exactly where to place the blame when their premiums shoot up and when millions lose coverage,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.

The uncertainty over the payments to insurers has loomed over Congress for months, but Mr. Trump’s action is forcing lawmakers to confront the issue head on less than three weeks before the start of the annual open enrollment season under the Affordable Care Act.

Even with the president’s move, it was far from clear whether lawmakers could agree on steps to continue the payments. The negotiations between Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray had stalled over how much latitude to give states seeking waivers from requirements of the Affordable Care Act.

Still, Ms. Murray expressed optimism and called on Republican leaders to support the efforts.

About seven million people benefit from the cost-sharing subsidies. The president’s decision, by destabilizing insurance markets and driving up premiums, could adversely affect millions of others who buy insurance on their own and do not receive federal subsidies, health policy experts said.

Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and co-chairman of a bipartisan group of lawmakers called the Problem Solvers Caucus, said Mr. Trump’s decision “increased the stakes” for Congress. More than two months ago, Mr. Reed’s group offered a series of proposals to shore up insurance markets, including funding the subsidies.

“It’s only going to get worse as this marketplace continues to destabilize,” Mr. Reed said. “If we stay where we are and do nothing, I think this is going to be a pox on all of our houses.”

Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he had been in discussions with other Republicans over proposals to drive down premiums that could be tied to a continuation of the subsidies for insurers.

“The fundamental question is, what do you get in terms of relief for insurance premiums and health care costs, broadly, in exchange for continuing a bailout to the insurance companies in the short run or long run?” Mr. Meadows said.

As lawmakers mulled how to move forward, doctors, hospitals, insurers, state insurance commissioners and advocates for patients denounced Mr. Trump’s decision.

“Our patients will ultimately pay the price,” said Dr. David O. Barbe, the president of the American Medical Association. “We urge Congress to accelerate its efforts to reinstate these payments before further damage is done.”

Governors also weighed in, expressing alarm at the termination of the subsidies. “We are deeply concerned that the administration has declined to continue these payments, further increasing uncertainty for state marketplaces,” the National Governors Association said.

Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, a Republican, told The Nevada Independent that the president’s decision was “going to hurt kids.” He continued: “It’s going to hurt families. It’s going to hurt individuals. It’s going to hurt people with mental health issues. It’s going to hurt veterans. It’s going to hurt everybody.”

The attorneys general of 18 states, including California, Massachusetts and New York, filed suit on Friday to prevent any interruption in the payments.

But the Trump administration insisted that a federal district judge was right in ruling last year that the payments were unconstitutional because Congress never explicitly provided money for them.

“Congress has the power of the purse, and it is up to Congress to decide which programs it will and will not fund,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a legal opinion, adding: “The executive branch cannot unilaterally spend money that Congress has not appropriated.”

The cost-sharing subsidies are available to people with incomes of 100 percent to 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $12,060 to $30,150 a year for an individual.

“Cost sharing reductions are critical to low income Americans,” Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, wrote on Twitter. “Congress should guarantee their funding through the appropriations process.”

In fact, the consequences of the president’s action would ripple through the individual market. The premium increases would be felt most by middle-class consumers who do not qualify for federal aid with either their premiums or their out-of-pocket costs.

The government’s costs are also likely to rise, since subsidies to purchase insurance through the marketplaces increase as premiums rise. The Congressional Budget Office said in August that if the cost-sharing subsidies were cut off, premiums would shoot up 20 percent next year, and federal budget deficits would increase by $194 billion in the coming decade.

Yet conservative Republicans made clear they have no appetite for providing billions of dollars to insurers.

“Under no circumstance should Congress attempt to expand Obamacare by cutting a check for President Obama’s bailout of insurance companies,” said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee.

Representative Dave Brat, a conservative Republican from Virginia, said Mr. Trump was simply correcting a “constitutional error” made by the Obama administration.

Mr. Brat said he did not want to provide money for the subsidies because they would just “prop up a failing system in which the government coerces people to buy gold-plated insurance policies that no one can afford.”

The showdown increased tensions over a fiscal deadline facing lawmakers. Mr. Trump and Democrats struck a deal in September that included a stopgap spending measure to keep the government funded through Dec. 8.

Now, the fate of the cost-sharing reduction payments could wind up intertwined in the negotiations over a spending measure to avert a government shutdown. Already, the contentious issue of immigration could become part of those spending talks, as Democrats are determined, in the coming months, to secure protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.

But separatism has century-old roots in Catalonia, a region with its own culture and language.

For seven years, I have been monitoring the slow-motion train crash between politicians in Madrid and Barcelona — I even wrote a recently published book on the struggle over Catalonia. But nothing could have prepared me for the twists and turns of a day that ended in utter confusion.

On Tuesday, Mr. Puigdemont was due to address lawmakers at 6 p.m. He held a cabinet meeting in the morning, after which the government spokesman, Jordi Turull, gave a drab news conference in which he promised that Mr. Puigdemont would make everything “perfectly clear” before Parliament.

Around 4 p.m., I walked down the promenade that leads to the Catalan Parliament, where a crowd of separatists, including some farmers on their tractors, was already cracking open beers and looking forward to Catalan independence.

Once inside Parliament, I took a pew in the upstairs gallery of the hemicycle, reserved for the press and some dignitaries. Mr. Kingsley was stationed in a downstairs press room, from which he prepared draft articles for three possible outcomes, from “a surprisingly direct” declaration of independence to an improbable U-turn on secessionism by Mr. Puigdemont.

I asked Ferran Mascarell, a separatist politician and historian, whether Mr. Puigdemont was set to reshape Catalan history. “Well, for a historian, it’s always tricky to define ahead what is historic,” he said, with a wry smile.

Shortly before 6 p.m., some opposition lawmakers took their seats. They soon walked out, however, after being told that the session would be adjourned for an hour.

The delay prompted a frenzy by the news media, especially after some outlets alerted that Mr. Puigdemont had received a last-minute offer of international mediation. Our photographer, Samuel Aranda, who had spent the day following Mr. Puigdemont, confirmed that the Catalan leader took an important phone call around lunchtime, after which he appeared more agitated.

I walked into a meeting room with an open door to find a group of conservative Catalan lawmakers huddled around a table. “Don’t worry, you’ll be hearing the declaration soon enough,” one of my parliamentary acquaintances told me. In a corridor, I then bumped into Josep Antoni Duran i Lleida, a veteran of Catalan politics who negotiated some of the region’s most important agreements with Madrid. The delay, he said, reflected international tensions between moderate and hard-line separatists. “Don’t expect anybody to bring out a mediator like a rabbit out of the hat,” he warned.

After conferring with Mr. Kingsley and our Europe editor, Jim Yardley, we decided to sit tight. That was a good call, because Mr. Puigdemont then delivered a perplexing speech in which he appeared to declare independence, before immediately suspending that decision to allow for “dialogue” with leaders in Madrid.

So what had just happened? Mr. Puigdemont’s closing statement left lawmakers muttering to themselves in bewilderment, while our team of reporters and editors scrambled to adjust the wording of our article on a shared document.

Second-guessing the moves of politicians caught in a game of chicken has never been easy. A year ago, Mr. Puigdemont told me over dinner that his one and only purpose as leader of Catalonia was to lead his region to independence and to fulfill a goal pursued since his student years. After that, he said, he hoped to leave Barcelona and return to the quieter life that he had enjoyed before, in his hometown, Girona. Similarly, Spain’s ever-so-cautious prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, stunned many observers with his crackdown on Catalan voters on Oct. 1, led by police wearing riot gear and, in some places, firing rubber bullets. But the fact is, with each and every round of this conflict, the stakes have been ratcheted up and the positions have hardened.

Shortly before midnight, Mr. Kingsley and I left Parliament, having filed a final version headlined, “In Catalonia, a Declaration of Independence From Spain (Sort Of).” Mr. Horowitz had already left the promenade, after sending us his account of how the supporters of independence were “kicking beer cans in frustration” after not hearing the magic break-up words they had expected from Mr. Puigdemont. It was the end of another long reporting day, but clearly not the turning point in Spain’s territorial conflict that had been anticipated. Mr. Horowitz made us all laugh with his good-night tweet. At least, he wrote, we had discovered that Mr. Puigdemont could also be “Fudgemont.”",I Was in the Room When Catalonia Made History. Or Didn’t?

It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work — and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake “much more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,” his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.

He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.

Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake’s father wrote: “Jake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.” A week later, though, Jake couldn’t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse’s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. “It was the depth of hell,” his mother told me.

That summer, after two more hospitalizations, Jake’s desperate parents sent him to Mountain Valley in New Hampshire, a residential treatment facility and one of a growing number of programs for acutely anxious teenagers. Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services. In its annual survey of students, the American College Health Association found a significant increase — to 62 percent in 2016 from 50 percent in 2011 — of undergraduates reporting “overwhelming anxiety” in the previous year. Surveys that look at symptoms related to anxiety are also telling. In 1985, the Higher Education Research Institute at U.C.L.A. began asking incoming college freshmen if they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do” during the previous year. In 1985, 18 percent said they did. By 2010, that number had increased to 29 percent. Last year, it surged to 41 percent.

Those numbers — combined with a doubling of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers over the last 10 years, with the highest rates occurring soon after they return to school each fall — come as little surprise to high school administrators across the country, who increasingly report a glut of anxious, overwhelmed students. While it’s difficult to tease apart how much of the apparent spike in anxiety is related to an increase in awareness and diagnosis of the disorder, many of those who work with young people suspect that what they’re seeing can’t easily be explained away. “We’ve always had kids who didn’t want to come in the door or who were worried about things,” says Laurie Farkas, who was until recently director of student services for the Northampton public schools in Massachusetts. “But there’s just been a steady increase of severely anxious students.”

For the teenagers who arrive at Mountain Valley, a nonprofit program that costs $910 a day and offers some need-based assistance, the center is usually a last resort after conventional therapy and medications fail. The young people I met there suffered from a range of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Though OCD and PTSD are considered anxiety disorders at Mountain Valley and other treatment centers, they were moved into separate categories in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)

Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing — and learning to talk back to — their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That’s an easy exercise for anxious young people (“Only three?” one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a “strong and powerful response” to each negative thought.

She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.

Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. “I’m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,” Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, “then I’ll get a bad grade in the class, I won’t get into the college I want, I won’t get a good job and I’ll be a total failure.”

At Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake’s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn’t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down — and that his value as a person didn’t depend on where he went to school.

Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn’t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.

Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn’t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.

Jillian listened as Jake and other peers — who, in reality, liked her very much — voiced her insecurities: “I can’t believe how insignificant Jillian is.” “I mean, for the first three weeks, I thought her name was Susan.” “If she left tomorrow, maybe we wouldn’t even miss her.”

At the last one, Jillian’s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. “I don’t want to do this,” she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.

“If it’s too much, you can stop,” the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. “No, I feel like I need to do this,” she announced. “I have a week and a half left. If I can’t get through something like this here ...”

Her voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing — and much less forgiving.

Anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But unlike depression, with which it routinely occurs, anxiety is often seen as a less serious problem.

“Anxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,” explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.

But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center’s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: “The overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.”

“The fears can be very real for our kids,” explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic’s medical director. “Oftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there’s a history of trauma and abuse.” The contemporary political climate can also feel “incredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,” Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.

And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who “act out” are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves — anxiety specialists call them “silent sufferers” — are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. “If you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,” Kendall says. “When you start to talk about anxiety, they’re like, ‘Oh, those are the kids we like!’ ”

Teenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. “These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,” she says, but there’s “contempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.”

Photo

For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they “never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop,’ ” Luthar says. “There’s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.”

It’s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. “Teenagers used to tell me, ‘I just need to get my parents off my back,’ ” recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. “Now so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.”

Though there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there’s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. “They wonder about whether it’s safe to go to a movie theater,” she said.

When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn’t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.

Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids’ digital habits — round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers — were partly to blame for their children’s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation’s relationship to social media. “I don’t think we realize how much it’s affecting our moods and personalities,” he said. “Social media is a tool, but it’s become this thing that we can’t live without but that’s making us crazy.”

In his case, he had little doubt that social media made him more self-conscious. “In high school, I’d constantly be judging my self-worth online,” he told me, recalling his tortured relationship with Facebook. “I would think, Oh, people don’t want to see me on their timeline.”

While smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. “It was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,” he said. Jake’s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.

At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the “illusion of control and certainty” that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. “Teens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who’s checked in online,” Ashworth told the parents. “But life doesn’t always come with that kind of certainty, and they’re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.”

Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. “It seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn’t much evidence for it,” she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is “all wrong,” she said. “The economy was improving by the time the increase started.”

The more she looked for explanations, the more she kept returning to two seemingly unrelated trend lines — depression in teenagers and smartphone adoption. (There is significantly more data about depression than anxiety.) Since 2011, the trend lines increased at essentially the same rate. In her recent book “iGen,” and in an article in The Atlantic, Twenge highlights a number of studies exploring the connection between social media and unhappiness. “The use of social media and smartphones look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues,” she told me. “It’s enough for an arrest — and as we get more data, it might be enough for a conviction.”

Last fall, at a high school near the New Hampshire-Vermont border, I watched Lynn Lyons, a psychotherapist and author, deliver bad news to a packed auditorium of teachers and counselors. “We’re not getting the job done,” she said, pacing the stage at Fall Mountain Regional High School, where she had been asked to lead a professional-development training session about anxiety.

More than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. “We don’t have to convince them anymore,” she told me. “Schools are coming to us, eager for help.”

A gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety “the cult leader” — for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves — and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. “Anxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,” Lyons explained. “When we play along, we don’t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.”

She pointed to the increasing use of “504 plans,” a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door — to avoid the chaos of the main entrance — and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.

Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are “avoidance-based and teach zero skills.” She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager “can go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,” she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student “externalize his worry,” similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.

“If anxiety could talk, it would say, ‘You know, let’s just get out of here. We don’t have to do this!’ ” Lyons said from the stage. “But in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I’m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they’re so frail, like they can’t handle things.”

Lyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces — and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. “Kids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can’t handle being triggered, that they shouldn’t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,” she told me.

Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word — “resiliency” — kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren’t “equipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,” a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety — and as more of those “stop coming to school, because they just can’t.”

Some schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called “our more fragile students.” At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream.” These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck — not that anyone was keeping score.

I couldn’t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs’ teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?

“Some will say that this feeds the monster,” concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. “But you’ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We’ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don’t come to school if they have to spend all day in” general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury’s regular classes — and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.

Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program’s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program’s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to “sacrifice the anxious kid” in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.

Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. “What’s the issue today?” I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a “Hail Mary,” as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone “right next to his face,” he rarely responds when he’s feeling anxious. “I appreciate you picking up — you don’t normally do that,” Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.

Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to “hide from, control and avoid” their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.

Critelli looked at him incredulously. “Dude, you’re failing physics,” Critelli said. “What do you mean you don’t have anything to do?”

“There’s nothing I can do — I’m going to fail,” the student mumbled.

“So you’re just accepting that you’re going to fail?” The boy looked at his hands. “Here’s an idea,” Critelli continued. “You can email your teacher and say, ‘What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?’ ”

Critelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. “I’d love to see you advocate for yourselves!”

Jake is a remarkably minimalist emailer and texter, eschewing exclamation points and emojis in favor of an almost old-fashioned formality. It can be challenging to gauge his moods that way, so I checked in with him regularly by phone in the months after he left Mountain Valley. He usually sounded content when we spoke, an impression confirmed by his parents, who were relieved by the changes they saw in him. In the fall of his senior year, Jake was regularly attending school — on some days he “even enjoyed it,” he told me with a laugh.

While he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. “That was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn’t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,” he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.

Jake also confessed to some worry about his application to attend U.N.C. He had decided to be transparent with the school about his anxiety disorder, partly because it helped explain his junior-year absences and grades and partly because the months he had spent challenging his beliefs and ideas at Mountain Valley perfectly fit the application essay prompt: Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.

In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had “aced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.” But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. “Just being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,” he wrote. “College is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.”

The doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn’t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a “Walking Dead” costume contest at a local car dealership.

While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series’s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. “I’d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,” she said. “Most of them were like, ‘Just kill yourself.’ ”

Nothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn’t want to open up and be known as “the anxious girl.” There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression — “It’s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,” the headmaster told me — but Jillian didn’t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and “I don’t want to go backward,” she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.

Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. “There’s feeling a weight on your chest, and there’s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,” she said. “As soon as I’d wake up, it was absolute dread.”

Needing to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother — who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support — could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn’t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn’t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was “manipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn’t feel like doing,” she said.

“The million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she’s going to have a panic attack?” Allison told me. “I feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.”

Allison sometimes wondered how her own anxiety issues might have genetically predisposed her daughter to anxiety. Allison had done enough Google searches to know that anxious teenagers tend to come from anxious parents. Research points to hereditary genes that predispose children to an anxiety disorder, and studies have found that an overbearing or anxious parenting style can induce anxiety and risk-aversion in kids. In the parents’ workshop I attended in Oregon, Ashworth, the therapist, spent a lot of time urging family members to work on their own anxiety issues.

He also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children’s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they’ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they’re afraid to. “So many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,” Ashworth said.

While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a “let’s not take life — and ourselves — too seriously” approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, “you’ve just made his day,” Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.

Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn’t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn’t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. “We basically said, ‘O.K., anxiety, you win.’ ”

Jillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. “I’m just a lot more relaxed now,” she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with “Star Wars” posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of “Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.” Near her bed were two prescription bottles — one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be “a lot worse if I wasn’t taking them.”

Though she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule — including yoga, studying and cleaning her room — that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at “Star Wars” conventions or on social media.

At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.

“O.K., I’m going to go mingle,” she announced.

On a busy weekday morning last May, a new crop of Mountain Valley residents were discovering that a key component of their treatment would involve repeatedly making fools of themselves. On the Dartmouth College campus, eight teenagers wore hand-painted white T-shirts that read “Ask Me About My Anxiety” and “I Have OCD.” They were encouraged by the therapy team to come up with scenarios that would make them uncomfortable. One teenager considered approaching random guys on campus and saying, “You must be a Dartmouth football player.” Later that afternoon, a second group of teenagers arrived. One feigned a panic attack at Starbucks. Another ordered nonsensically at a restaurant.

“What do we need to do to make your anxiety higher?” McCallie-Steller, the therapist, asked several teenagers as they prepared for their morning of exposure therapy. First developed in the 1950s, the technique is an essential component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety, which a vast majority of researchers and clinicians believe is the most effective treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. In a large 2008 study of anxious youth published in The New England Journal of Medicine, more improved using CBT (60 percent) than the antidepressant Zoloft (55 percent), though the most effective therapy (81 percent) was a combination of the two.

But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. “We’re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,” says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. “And when we do give them therapy, it’s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we’re not treating people with what actually works best.”

Part of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren’t typically eager to feel more anxious. “It’s also uncomfortable for many therapists,” Whiteside told me. “Most people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you’re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It’s not much fun for anybody. It’s much easier to sit in a therapist’s office and talk about feelings.”

Researchers are trying to better understand how exposure works in the brain and to fine-tune its application for anxiety treatment. At U.C.L.A., scientists at the school’s Anxiety and Depression Research Center discovered that the more anxious a person feels going into an exposure exercise, and the more surprised he or she is by the result, the more effective it is at competing with an original negative association or traumatic memory. (That’s why McCallie-Steller did her best to ramp up the teenagers’ anxiety before they began their exposure work.) Other researchers are focused on virtual-reality-aided exposure therapy, which allows people to encounter the sources of their anxiety in a therapist’s office.

For two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.

Earlier, another Mountain Valley teenager took part in a similar exercise, during which the stranger opened up about his own struggles with anxiety. The teenagers were sometimes surprised that others could relate to their issues. As one girl handed out fliers about anxiety on campus, she sometimes asked people, “Can I tell you about anxiety?” More than a few students — including one who looked as if he might actually be a Dartmouth football player — responded with some version of “Trust me, I know all about it.”

The brown-haired boy was highly anxious about his exposure. He bombarded the therapist, Bryan Randolph, with questions in a seeming attempt to run out the clock until they had to return to Mountain Valley. “Can I just sit on the bench for a minute?” he asked Randolph. “And can I sit down and then start talking? I mean, do I need to ask, ‘Do you mind if I sit there?’ It’s weird to just sit there, have a conversation, then get up and come running back to a group of people.”

“Even better — let’s make it weird,” Randolph told him.

The boy shook his head. “Maybe the guy’s on break and doesn’t want to be bothered.”

“Maybe,” Randolph said. “He might hate you. He might get real mad at you.”

“That’s terrifying,” the teenager confessed. “And what if we’re so close on the bench that we’re touching?”

“That would be awkward,” Randolph said with a half-smile.

The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. “Is he sitting in the middle of the bench?”

“I don’t know — he might be,” Randolph told him. “But are you going to ‘what if’ this to death, or are you going to do it?”

He eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: “I’ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.” The “Ask Me” was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including “B*tch,” “F*ggot,” “Ur Fat” and “Kill Yourself.” Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas’s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.

Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas’s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.

Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. “Oh, my God, that was the greatest,” Thomas announced upon his return.

I asked him what they’d talked about. “The muscular dude said he’s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,” Thomas told us. “Then the girl said, ‘You’re really brave. Can I give you a hug?’ ”

“That’s not what you were expecting, huh?” Randolph said. “Instead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.”

“Yeah, it was awesome,” he said. “I feel so good!”

The brown-haired boy, meanwhile, returned from his brief visit to the bench: “It was sooooo awkward,” he reported. “The guy just kept texting. He was probably like, Why is this kid asking me questions?”

“And what if he was?” Randolph asked him. “You’re not responsible for what he’s thinking.”

The boy appeared to consider Randolph’s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, “exactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it’s all manageable.”

The subject line of Jake’s email to me last winter read simply, “College Results.” I opened it: “Hey Benoit, I just wanted to tell you that I was accepted to U.N.C. Chapel Hill. Jake.” I emailed back to say that he could stand to sound a little bit more excited, to which he replied, “Trust me, I’m pretty excited!”

Last month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I’d ever seen him. “Let’s walk,” he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.

Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. “The health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,” he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home — and some of his peers from Mountain Valley — via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. “My junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn’t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,” he said. “I don’t think like that anymore.”

That’s not to say that Jake doesn’t study. He does — usually days before he needs to. “Procrastination isn’t a good idea for me,” he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato’s “Republic.”

Jake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn’t gone through. He said he felt “a sudden burst of anxiety” — his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was “freaking out.” Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn’t a big deal. “That ended that crisis,” Jake told me.

For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university’s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. “I just haven’t felt like I need it here,” Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: “I know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.”

I was curious how much of Jake’s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn’t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?

It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. “I would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,” he told me. “There are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn’t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot’s changed.”

Before walking back to his dorm, where Jake’s friends were waiting for him, we stopped at the Old Well, a campus landmark where legend has it that students who drink from it on the first day of classes will get straight A’s that semester. The old Jake might have been first in line. But the new Jake?

I say all this with what has become the usual caveat for a Netflix show.","The sociologists he meets distrust the G-man poking around campus, but that’s nothing next to the suspicion from agents at the bureau. They put up a moral resistance to learning how murderers think; bad guys, they believe, are just bad. (A similar dynamic played out this year in Discovery’s “Manhunt: Unabomber,” in which old-school agents refused to accept the idea that their quarry was highly educated.)

Mr. Groff (“Looking”) plays Ford as room-temperature placid yet intense. There’s something compellingly off about him; he’s a milk-drinking straight arrow with a monomaniac streak that runs him afoul of department politics. As astute as he is with the criminal mind, basic social cues seem to elude him.

He finds help in agent Bill Tench (Holt McCallany), a behavioral-science specialist. The series becomes a kind of scholarly buddy-cop tale, Tench, serving as skeptic and human-language interpreter as they crisscross the country interviewing cops and convicts for research.

One unsettling encounter is with Ed Kemper (Cameron Britton), a necrophiliac murderer (popularly known as “The Co-Ed Killer”) who eluded capture until he turned himself in. In the flesh, he’s a garrulous, polite creep who discusses the mechanics of his crimes as dispassionately as he does the fine points of a prison egg-salad sandwich.

Apart from a grisly early scene, there’s little onscreen violence. The talk is ghastly enough. In the title sequence, images of death flicker briefly on screen over the meticulous loading of a reel-to-reel tape machine. Mr. Fincher, who directed four episodes, gives “Mindhunter” that restrained sensibility: micro-eruptions of primal blood through a facade of clean meticulous order.

“Mindhunter” was created by the playwright Joe Penhall, who wrote the first season with Jennifer Haley; the executive producers include Mr. Fincher and Charlize Theron. It’s based on the memoir “Mindhunter: Inside the F.B.I.’s Elite Serial Crime Unit” by John Douglas and Mark Olshaker, and it can be stiff downloading the book’s ideas into dialogue.

The series is very much a boys’ club early on. Hannah Gross has some screen time as Ford’s girlfriend, Debbie Mitford, a grad student whose flirt-talk includes “What do you think about Durkheim’s labeling theory on deviancy?” Anna Torv will eventually co-star as a behavioral psychologist.

Still, the series’ linking of irrational times and unspeakable acts resonates with today’s stories of mass shootings and a widening gyre of chaos in the headlines. “Mindhunter” doesn’t aestheticize or elevate the likes of Kemper. But the notion that killers like him can be figured out and foiled is like placing a bet on reason over chaos.

I say all this with what has become the usual caveat for a Netflix show. Streaming dramas nowadays take so long to establish their premises that I don’t know if the two episodes I’ve seen are representative or just setup. It’s possible “Mindhunter” may settle into a more predictable monster chase. Let’s hope not; the chase after ideas here is more interesting.",Review: ‘Mindhunter’ on Netflix Is More Chatter Than Splatter,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/arts/television/netflix-mindhunter-review.html

Mr. Groeneweg and other curators researched Mata Hari’s past extensively and drew new conclusions about her history.

Femme fatale, fallen woman, brazen double agent — every generation has its own version of Mata Hari.
Today, Mr. Groeneweg said, there is a “bigger, broader picture” of the woman known as Mata Hari.","In early 1917, Ladoux later arrested and interrogated Zelle, and garnered what he took as a confession: She admitted to taking money from the Germans, though she firmly denied having ever provided them with any useful espionage. On Oct. 14, Mata Hari was executed by firing squad. Newspaper reports described her as refusing to wear a blindfold and blowing kisses to the soldiers who raised their rifles against her.

Now, 100 years after the execution, the archives of her interrogation and trial have been opened to the public, and her complicated, extraordinary life is being reassessed and commemorated in the Netherlands, the country that she tried to leave behind at age 19. The Museum of Friesland in Leeuwarden is staging a biographical exhibition devoted to her life, while the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam is reprising a contemporary ballet, “Mata Hari,” which premiered in 2016 to great popular success. A theater piece focused on her mysterious life and performed by the singer and actor Tet Rozendal is also touring the country.

“Her story is still relevant in that she’s a woman who does not conform to society’s norms, and to anyone else’s ideas,” said Ted Brandsen, the managing director of the Dutch National Ballet. “She’s really about female transgression: She breaks through the limits of respectability.”

The commemorations in the Netherlands all attempt to separate the myth of Mata Hari from the truth of Margaretha Zelle’s life. But Zelle often presented herself as someone else from somewhere else — as Mata Hari, the exotic princess from the East — and her compatriots have had an uneasy relationship with her persona ever since.

“Almost everyone here knew that she got famous through exotic dancing, and people here didn’t like that,” said Klaas Zandberg, the coordinator of the Leeuwarden Historical Center, an archive in the city where Zelle was born in 1876 and lived until she was 18. He said many locals “still think that she’s some kind of whore who still gets too much attention.”

Mr. Brandsen said that she still commands fascination: “Ninety-eight to ninety-nine percent of the seats” for each performance of the ballet were sold in 2016, he said.

Although her childhood was spent in a prosperous household, her father, a hat merchant and speculator, lost all his money when she was 14. A series of tragic events followed: Her parents divorced, her mother died, her father left her with relatives and that didn’t go well. At 18, she answered a newspaper ad from a 39-year-old captain in the Dutch colonial army, met him for a date and married him five months later.

Zelle’s husband, Rudolph MacLeod, took her with him to the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), where she learned some Javanese dance and had two children. Her son died suddenly at age 3, possibly from mercury poisoning by a nanny. The couple divorced; when her husband refused to pay alimony, she left her daughter with him and found ways to support herself.

In 1903, she moved to Paris. Later, when asked why, she is reported to have said, “I thought all women who ran away from their husbands went there.” She was equally saucy and vague about her personal history once she transformed herself into Mata Hari.

Although today’s exotic dancers are associated with grimy clubs, Mata Hari’s sensational premiere took place at the Musée Guimet in Paris, an art institution where it was seen by upper-crust socialites, and her enormous and immediate success thrust her into their ranks. “She was at least a millionaire at one point,” said Hans Groeneweg, the curator of the Museum of Friesland exhibition.

Preparing for the exhibition took four years. Mr. Groeneweg and other curators researched Mata Hari’s past extensively and drew new conclusions about her history. It was not entirely clear that she ever spied for the Germans, for example, though she admitted to taking money from them, perhaps because she was broke at the time.

“When you read what information she gave to the Germans, you think it’s all very small,” Mr. Groeneweg said. “Like she’d tell that there was going to be an offensive in the spring, but everyone already knew that.”

The exhibition presents original documents from her trial — including her “confession” document — that were unsealed by the French authorities in January, along with personal letters and diary entries, on loan from Zelle’s family, that have never been shown to the public.

Artifacts of her life include a gold brooch she bought for her daughter, her prayer book and a portrait of her painted by Isaac Israels. The exhibit ends with a wall of posters from books and films that have focused on her life, including films in which she was played by Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. Femme fatale, fallen woman, brazen double agent — every generation has its own version of Mata Hari.

Today, Mr. Groeneweg said, there is a “bigger, broader picture” of the woman known as Mata Hari.

“We are trying to focus on more aspects of her life than only her dancing career or whether she was a spy,” he said. “When you focus on Margaretha as a mother or a spouse, you can relate to more aspects of her life.”

But the documents from the French archives have not filled in all of the gaps, Mr. Groeneweg said. “In some way, perhaps we have to be glad not knowing the complete story,” he added. “Something of the myth has to be preserved.”","Femme Fatale, Fallen Woman, Spy: Looking for the Real Mata Hari",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/arts/mata-hari-netherlands.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Ms. McGowan, who reached a $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997, has been vocal in her support of other women who have come forward to accuse the producer of sexually abuse.

On Tuesday, responding to the actor Ben Affleck’s comments about the accusations against Mr. Weinstein, Ms. McGowan called Mr. Affleck a liar and said he had known about the producer’s actions.

Mr. Mueller’s investigators wanted to question Mr. Priebus, who was fired in July, about Mr. Trump’s decision to fire the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, in May, and Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in February.

Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Photo

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

Hasn’t President Trump endorsed Mr. Erdogan?

Mr. Trump has a disturbing fondness for authoritarian leaders like Mr. Erdogan, whom he praised as a friend who gets “high marks” for “running a very difficult part of the world.” However, along with Vice President Mike Pence and 78 members of Congress, Mr. Trump has appealed for the release of some of the Americans — with no apparent effect.

Are there other issues?

Yes. After the recent suspensions of non-immigrant visas shook Turkey’s financial markets on Monday, the two sides signaled a willingness to ease tensions, but an American official warned, “We haven’t hit bottom yet.”

Mr. Erdogan is worried about the impending trial in the United States of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold dealer accused of violating sanctions on Iran, because he is connected to a corruption scandal that almost brought down Mr. Erdogan’s government in 2013. The Turkish leader is further incensed by America’s indictment of 15 of his personal bodyguards after a brawl with protesters in May during his visit to Washington. The two countries are at odds over American support for Kurdish fighters in Syria; Turkey considers those fighters to be terrorists allied with a Kurdish group in Turkey that has waged an insurgency there for 30 years. Washington is concerned that Turkey is distancing itself from NATO, as evidenced by its pro-Russia tilt in the Syrian war and its bid to buy a Russian missile defense system that cannot be integrated with NATO’s defenses.

Why can’t the U.S. simply kick Turkey out of NATO?

NATO has no provision for that, and besides, the United States wants Turkey to stay. Having an influential ally in the Mideast and access to the region is critical. But Mr. Erdogan’s anti-Western behavior is sowing deep mistrust about his commitment to an alliance that is supposed to be based as much on the common values of “democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law” as on a common military defense. So NATO experts are debating Turkey’s future and the wisdom of keeping the tactical nuclear weapons at Incirlik.

Doesn’t it help the U.S. to have nuclear weapons in Turkey?

No. Experts have long worried about the weapons’ security. During the coup attempt last summer, the Turkish government locked down the base for 24 hours, and the electricity was cut. Incirlik is near Syria, with its warring extremist forces. Mr. Erdogan’s anti-American behavior and his drift toward Russia have heightened anxiety.

The weapons were deployed decades ago as proof of America’s commitment to Turkey’s security but are symbolic. No one expects them to be used, and no planes at Incirlik can deliver them. The security commitment is better demonstrated in other ways. When the United States withdrew nuclear weapons from Greece, also a NATO ally, in 2001, it sold Greece F-16 fighter jets. If it becomes necessary to defend Turkey, America can use conventional weapons.

Can you really just move 50 or more nuclear weapons?

It’d be smart to move the weapons before Turkish-American relations collapse. A withdrawal would probably best be done quickly and covertly after the American-led coalition captures Raqqa, Syria, from the Islamic State.

Would this be a wake-up call to Mr. Erdogan? Or simply end the two nations’ alliance?

NATO is a consensus organization, and Turkey could make mischief by thwarting its decision-making. It could also withdraw from the alliance. But Turkey has prospered as a NATO member. That means it is likely to be the big loser if it forsakes the West for, say, closer ties with Russia. Mr. Erdogan needs to face up to the reality that the problem, like the provocations, are not NATO’s but his. He still has time to mend his ways.",Some Urgent Questions About Turkey,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/turkey-erdogan-nuclear-weapons.html

FRIDAY PUZZLE — TGIF, everyone! What a way to kick off the weekend; Damon Gulczynski has returned for his seventh themeless puzzle this year, and like all the rest of his work, it’s chock-full of pizazz.

Themelesses by their nature have numerous longer entries, and they show off overall vocabulary as opposed to an interesting theme, with a few fun nuggets of surrounding fill. However, there are many different styles to actually creating a themeless that should be noted. Some constructions are focused on a formidable-looking grid that has super smooth fill and a low word count. Other grids are less open, yet their longer answers are much flashier and thus allow the solver to overlook any dull, shorter fill.

Today, Mr. Gulczynski presents us with a hybrid of this concept: at 70 words total, he hasn’t quite reached the maximum allowed for a themeless (72), and yet the grid doesn’t appear very open. However, every answer of eight or more letters ranges from good to phenomenal: PHALANGE, I DARE NOT, GARY HART, SODA JERK, TELEKINESIS, OVER THE HUMP, HOVERBOARDS, IT’S NO BIGGIE, GIVE ME A RING, PABLO NERUDA, GENDER-BINARY and JOLLY RANCHER. That’s a ton of juicy fill.

As I said above, with so many marquee entries, the shorter fill usually suffers. But today? I pored over this grid post-solve, as I do when working with Will and Joel on submissions, and I couldn’t find more than three — maybe five, if I’m being super nitpicky — subpar answers. Can you guess which ones they were?

To have a puzzle be both so smooth and so exciting is near impossible, though Mr. Gulczynski makes it look easy. Let’s take a look at the cluing:

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.

Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.”

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

Cobb salad, paired with ‘Trick or Treat’ (Season 2, Episode 3)

Who invented the Cobb salad? According to Larry’s dinner companion in this episode, Cliff Cobb, it was invented by his grandfather at the Drake Hotel in Chicago. Larry, as well as our food writer Alison Roman, are a bit more skeptical about the salad’s origins. As Ms. Roman explains in the instructions for this classic, there are a few ingredients that you absolutely must include: “tender chicken breast, tangy tomatoes, perfectly hard-boiled egg and, perhaps most important, crispy bacon.” Larry’s take on the Cobb — sans bacon and eggs, with the blue cheese on the side — may not, ultimately, pass the test.",4 Things to Cook While Watching ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/smarter-living/curb-your-enthusiasm-recipes.html

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

As many factories moved from the United States to Mexico over the past two decades, many jobs migrated there, too. The ability of companies to take advantage of lower-cost labor in Mexico has often prompted a bitterness from longtime American workers who have lost their jobs in the process.

That is part of the story in Indianapolis, where the Rexnord Corporation closed the doors at its bearing factory in September, having shipped some jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. During their final months at the factory, many of the American workers struggled with the decision of whether or not to train the workers from Mexico who would be taking over their jobs. Some did, and forged friendships with their trainees. Others refused.

“Increasingly tech companies are going to be put into the position of making these sorts of judgments,” said Matthew Prince, Cloudflare’s chief executive.","“For 10 years, the arguments in tech were about which chief executive was more like Jesus. Which one was going to run for president. Who did the best job convincing the work force to lean in,” said Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Now sentiments are shifting. The worm has turned.”

News is dripping out of Facebook, Twitter and now Google about how their ad and publishing systems were harnessed by the Russians. On Nov. 1, the Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing on the matter. It is unlikely to enhance the companies’ reputations.

Under growing pressure, the companies are mounting a public relations blitz. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, was in Washington this week, meeting with lawmakers and making public mea culpas about how things happened during the election “that should not have happened.” Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, was in Pittsburgh on Thursday talking about the “large gaps in opportunity across the U.S.” and announcing a $1 billion grant program to promote jobs.

Underlying the meet-and-greets is the reality that the internet long ago became a business, which means the companies’ first imperative is to do right by their stockholders.

Ross Baird, president of the venture capital firm Village Capital, noted that when ProPublica tried last month to buy targeted ads for “Jew haters” on Facebook, the platform did not question whether this was a bad idea — it asked the buyers how they would like to pay.

“For all the lip service that Silicon Valley has given to changing the world, its ultimate focus has been on what it can monetize,” Mr. Baird said.

Criticism of tech is nothing new, of course. In a Newsweek jeremiad in 1995 titled “Why the Web Won’t Be Nirvana,” the astronomer Clifford Stoll pointed out that “every voice can be heard cheaply and instantly” on the Usenet bulletin boards, that era’s Twitter and Facebook.

“The result?” he wrote. “Every voice is heard. The cacophony more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harassment and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen.”

Such complaints, repeated at regular intervals, did not stop the tech world from seizing the moment. Millions and then billions of people flocked to its services. The chief executives were regarded as sages. Disruption was the highest good.

What is different today are the warnings from the technologists themselves. “The monetization and manipulation of information is swiftly tearing us apart,” Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, wrote this week.

Justin Rosenstein, a former Facebook engineer, was portrayed in a recent Guardian story as an apostate: Noting that sometimes inventors have regrets, he said he had programmed his new phone to not let him use the social network.

Mr. Rosenstein, a co-founder of Asana, an office productivity start-up, said in an email that he had banned not just Facebook but also the Safari and Chrome browsers, Gmail and other applications.

If social media is on the defensive, Mr. Zuckerberg is particularly on the spot — a rare event in a golden career that has made him, at 33, one of the richest and most influential people on the planet.

“We have a saying: ‘Move fast and break things,’” he wrote in his 2012 manifesto. “The idea is that if you never break anything, you’re probably not moving fast enough.”

Facebook dropped that motto two years later, but critics say too much of the implicit arrogance has lingered. Mr. Galloway, whose new book, “The Four,” analyzes the power of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, said the social media network was still fumbling its response.

“Zuckerberg and Facebook are violating the No. 1 rule of crisis management: Overcorrect for the problem,” he said. “Their attitude is that anything that damages their profits is impossible for them to do.”

Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president of global public policy, said the network was doing its best.

“Facebook is an important part of many people’s lives,” he said. “That’s an enormous responsibility — and one that we take incredibly seriously.”

Some social media entrepreneurs acknowledge that they are confronting issues they never imagined as employees of start-ups struggling to survive.

“There wasn’t time to think through the repercussions of everything we did,” Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, said in an interview shortly before he rejoined the service last spring.

He maintained that Twitter was getting an unfair rap: “For every bad thing, there are a thousand good things.” He acknowledged, however, that sometimes “it gets a little messy.”

Despite the swell of criticism, the vast majority of investors, consumers and regulators seem not to have changed their behavior. People still eagerly await the new iPhone. Facebook has more than two billion users. President Trump likes to criticize Amazon on Twitter, but his administration ignored pleas for a rigorous examination of Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods.

In Europe, however, the ground is already shifting. Google’s share of the search engine market there is 92 percent, according to StatCounter. But that did not stop the European Union from fining it $2.7 billion in June for putting its products above those of its rivals.

A new German law that fines social networks huge sums for not taking down hate speech went into effect this month. On Tuesday, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain said the government was looking “carefully at the roles, responsibility and legal status” of Google and Facebook, with an eye to regulating them as news publishers rather than platforms.

“This war, like so many wars, is going to start in Europe,” said Mr. Galloway, the New York University professor.

For some tech companies, the new power is a heavy weight. Cloudflare, which provides many sites with essential protection from hacking, made its first editorial decision in August: It lifted its protection from The Daily Stormer, basically expunging the neo-Nazi site from the visible web.

“Increasingly tech companies are going to be put into the position of making these sorts of judgments,” said Matthew Prince, Cloudflare’s chief executive.

The picture is likely to get even more complicated. Mr. Prince foresees several possible dystopian futures. One is where every search engine has a political point of view, and users gravitate toward the one they feel most comfortable with. That would further balkanize the internet.

Another possibility is the opposite extreme: Under the pressure of regulation, all hate speech — and eventually all dissent — is filtered out.

“People are realizing that technology isn’t neutral,” Mr. Prince said. “I used to travel to Europe to hear these fears. Now I just have to go to Sacramento.”","Tech Giants, Once Seen as Saviors, Are Now Viewed as Threats",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/technology/tech-giants-threats.html

Standard condom circumferences were “just basically too big,” he said.","“The idea was it had to be long enough to fit most men, and excess length could just be rolled,” said Debby Herbenick, a sexual health expert at Indiana University. She and her colleagues published a study of 1,661 men living throughout the United States that found that 83 percent had penile lengths shorter than standard condoms. The average length was 5.57 inches.

In studies, some men have complained that “condoms tend to slip off,” said Ron Frezieres, a vice president for research and evaluation at Essential Access Health, a nonprofit. And sometimes larger condoms actually felt tight because ”shorter men had a big roll of latex at the base of the penis.”

The custom condoms, marketed under the brand name myONE Perfect Fit, come in lengths of 4.9 to 9.4 inches and circumferences of 3.5 to 5 inches. (Standard condoms are typically 6.7 to 8.3 inches long and 3.9 to 4.5 inches in circumference.) The template that men are given to measure themselves does not include inches or centimeters, instead using randomly ordered letters and numbers. One man might be E99, another Z22.

“If they bought a small condom before and it was still too big, it’s horrible for men to have that experience,” said Mr. Wedel, whose company owns myONE condoms. Within hours of going on sale, he said, customers had ordered condoms in all 60 sizes.

One customer, Shawn Reimund, 34, of Austin, Tex., ordered B17. With standard condoms, “the length was frustrating because you would get a lot of sliding,” he said, and excess latex would be “cutting off your circulation. I compare it to an anaconda wrapping around you.” Also, “sometimes the girth just wasn’t enough.”

Some other condom improvement ideas have been downright perplexing. The Galactic Cap, a polyurethane number that covers only the tip and attaches with medical adhesive, hasn’t been tested nearly enough to try for F.D.A. approval. But Charles Powell, its California inventor, nonetheless sells it for $20, “flying under the F.D.A. radar,” he said.

“If they do come after me, I’m going to move my operation across the border into Mexico,” he said. He contends the Galactic Cap allows more sensation because more skin is uncovered, but admits it won’t necessarily protect against sexually transmitted diseases and has prompted complaints that its Band-Aid-like adhesive makes it “painful coming off.”

Other ideas seemed feasible but stalled for financial reasons. Mark McGlothlin, awarded $100,000 by the Gates Foundation to develop natural-feeling collagen condoms from cow tendon or fish skin, said he lacks $2 million for the necessary clinical trials.

Origami condoms, pleated to allow movement inside, received fanfare and a Gates grant. But efforts to check its status with the inventor were unsuccessful, and its website appears defunct.

One Gates winner, Mahua Choudhury, a medical pharmacologist at Texas A&M Health Science Center, said condom companies were considering investing in her stretchy hydrogel condom. Her proposal also claims that embedding an antioxidant in the condom can promote blood flow and muscle relaxation to “stimulate and maintain erection.”

Mr. Frezieres’s organization, which won two Gates grants totaling $1.2 million for a clingy, polyethylene “ultra sheer wrapping condom,” has corporate partners and clinical trial results. Now it is “tweaking the material,” hoping to conduct final testing soon, he said.

The custom-fit company president, Mr. Wedel, 50, got into the condom game as a Tufts University undergraduate, when he and a classmate sold condoms in packages festooned with the university’s mascot, Jumbo the elephant.

AIDS was raging, he said, and “we put a fun slogan and a picture on a condom, and presto, we were changing condoms from something taboo.”

Soon, Mr. Wedel, who considered becoming a professional violinist, informed his mother, a church choir director in Crystal Lake, Ill., that he was going “all in on the condom career.” He co-created a glow-in-the-dark condom, helped open Manhattan’s Condomania store, and won a court battle to sell Pleasure Plus, a condom that balloons near the tip.

Still, “condoms have an enormous image problem,” acknowledged Mr. Wedel, whose company works closely with public health organizations. The new federal study found “condom non-use remained common,” and that nearly 7 percent of women using them said condoms “broke or completely fell off.”

Although custom condoms became available in Europe in 2011, sold by TheyFit, which Global Protection purchased, it took years of pressing the F.D.A. and two standards organizations, ASTM International and ISO, for the devices to reach the United States, Mr. Wedel said.

One hurdle: tests like the “hang-and-squeeze,” during which condoms are filled with water and squeezed to see if they leak, and the “airburst” exam, which checks whether condoms break when inflated. Both evaluations were designed for larger condoms.

“If you make a condom that’s less than half the volume of a standard condom, you’re not going to fill it with as much water, or it’s not long enough to stretch on the mandrel for airburst testing,” he said.

Eventually, the F.D.A. granted clearance for expanded sizes, and last year ASTM International devised new testing methods for a wider range of condoms.

On a Reddit page for men who consider their penises small, reaction to custom condoms was mixed.

One member, RatsSewer — who like other users declined to provide his real name — said non-latex materials “would be way more helpful than custom condoms,” adding, “If I want good sex, I don’t use a condom.”

Another, Thrown_away011235, seemed interested, citing “condoms rolling up and slipping off in the past.”

Monkeyfun14 said he had ordered custom condoms, and “while they fit well,” he considered standard cheaper ones sufficient. “It’s not like a pair of shoes or a brassiere that you have to wear all day.”

Yaforgot-my-password ordered them, too, saying regular condoms were too small. (“I know it doesn’t fit this subreddit,” he said pointedly, “but I browse here sometimes.”) The custom ones are “pretty good so far.”

Custom condoms cost 66 cents apiece in regular 24-pack shipments ($1.66 apiece in a single six-pack). Early purchasers were also sent the next larger and smaller sizes for free.

Michael Davis, 21, a college student in Waverly, Fla., said he preferred the M77, the size above the one he first ordered. Standard condom circumferences were “just basically too big,” he said. With custom-fit condoms, he has found “no slippage whatsoever.”

Dr. Herbenick said condom education, along with tips like adding lubricant, are more important than access to 60 sizes. She and colleagues published a study that found custom-fit condoms less likely to break but, for some men, more likely to slip.

Some men might “prefer a condom that they think fits their penis,” she said. “But for the most part, men and their partners are fine with existing condoms.”

Still, Mr. Frezieres said, even without “true benefit,” custom condoms might increase usage, simply by being “confidence boosters.”",A Condom-Maker’s Discovery: Size Matters,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/health/condoms-penis-size.html

In addition to cutting off the subsidies, the president signed an executive order Thursday that may pave the way for competing plans that would be subject to fewer rules and could draw healthy customers out of the Obamacare markets.

“It’s a deliberate pattern,” said Chet Burrell, the chief executive of CareFirst, which is faced with a $50 million loss in Maryland if regulators do not allow it to increase its rates to make up for the loss of funding. “With active sabotage, this makes it more unstable.”

Mr. Burrell says CareFirst expects to continue offering coverage in the individual market regardless of what the Maryland regulator decides. But he said the administration’s actions “create profound instability and uncertainty for the future.”

Even as Mr. Trump created instability, his Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that it would take steps to help insurers stay in the market, despite the change. Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman, said the department would allow some plans to submit higher rates if their original prices had not taken account of the risk the subsidies would go away. The department “ is working on a case-by-case basis with those states where regulators explicitly required insurers to assume cost-sharing reduction payments would be made,” she said.

With or without the government payments to insurers, consumers who rely on subsidies for their premiums or their deductibles will be insulated from the changes, as long as carriers don’t flee. Insurers are still required to offer discounts to eligible customers, even if they don’t get reimbursed by the federal government. People who get their insurance through Medicaid will be unaffected.

But while the higher prices will keep most, if not all, insurers from exiting the markets, they will hurt customers who pay full price for their insurance. Around eight million Americans buy their own health plans and earn too much for government help. They will be footing the bill for double-digit increases linked to the increased policy uncertainty. Some may not be able to afford to keep their coverage.

The cumulative effect is very damaging, said Ceci Connolly, the chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. “How many cuts can this market and this law take before it’s just in smithereens?”

And even Mr. Neidorff says there is little doubt about Mr. Trump’s intent. “The world knows what his message has been from the beginning,” he said. “They want to unwind the Affordable Care Act.”

Insurers that raised their rates and whose customers are generally eligible for subsidies are the least affected by the loss of funding, and they are likely to stay. Health Care Service Corp. which offers Blue Cross plans in several states, said its participation would be unaffected, and other large Blue Cross plans like Florida Blue said they had priced in the uncertainty. Molina Healthcare, another large player in the market, said it plans to participate in the seven states where it had filed in 2018, although the company said it “will continue to evaluate our participation on a market-by-market basis.”

Anthem, which offers for-profit Blue Cross plans and had sharply reduced its participation in the marketplaces next year, in large part because of the turmoil in the market, declined to comment.

Alex Feldvebel, the deputy insurance commissioner in New Hampshire, said his department permitted insurers there to assume that government subsidies would go unpaid in 2018 when submitting their rates this summer. The carriers haven’t made their final decisions about whether to stay or go, but Mr. Feldvebel said he was reassured by preliminary conversations Friday. “We’re feeling pretty O.K. here that this will not throw everything into a cocked hat,” he said.

In Washington State, where the insurance department had not allowed carriers to price for the risk but had asked them to file two sets of rates, the state insurance commissioner reversed course, telling insurers Friday they could switch to the higher rates to make up for the lost government funds. The New Jersey insurance regulator also said insurers could refile higher rate requests, as did Oregon’s regulator.

The regulators, anxious to avoid any last-minute departures, are working closely with the insurers to make sure they stay.

“I am going to be doing my darnedest to reassure them,” said Mike Kreidler, the insurance regulator for Washington State. But he emphasizes that the administration’s actions have caused the companies to think hard about whether to stay. “It just continues that drumroll of uncertainty.”

He said he was worried about a mass exodus of insurers. “If one bolts, you could see them all bolt,” Mr. Kreidler said.",Not Dead Yet: Obamacare Insurers Are Hanging In There,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/upshot/not-dead-yet-obamacare-insurers-are-hanging-in-there.html

Yet Mr. Steiner, it could be argued, is partly responsible for the slow demise of centers like Eastland and Westland. He is a disrupter in the mall industry, and his most successful development, Easton Town Center, on the northeast edge of the city, serves a vital role in the test market ecosystem.

In the early 1990s, Mr. Steiner, a Turkish immigrant, was an aspiring developer in Miami. Asked to help develop a shopping center in the upscale Coconut Grove neighborhood, he took a cue from the bustling open-air commercial districts of Istanbul. Instead of building a big box and stuffing stores inside, he proposed turning the mall inside out, placing shops along tree-lined pathways and bringing in upscale restaurants with outdoor seating.

The result was CocoWalk, a shopping center that, improbably, was a pleasant place to spend time. Industry insiders took note, and before long Mr. Steiner was approached to develop a larger project in Columbus.

Working with some of the most influential retail forces in Columbus, Mr. Steiner designed and now manages Easton Town Center, a development that is less a mall than a small city. In addition to hundreds of stores, there are millions of square feet of office space, restaurants, apartments and hotel rooms.

It was hardly a guaranteed success. “A guy with an accent comes from Miami and says we’ll do an open-air project in a place that gets 40 inches of snow?” Mr. Steiner said. “I didn’t stand the chance of a snowball in hell.”

But more than two decades after it opened, Easton Town Center has helped create a new template for American shopping. There is a Tesla dealership, an Apple store and dozens of luxury shops, many of them doing brisk business.

Easton Town Center is also where many retailers do their experimenting. The Eddie Bauer store is there. Nearby, an explosion of neon lighting and skimpy lingerie signals the presence of a La Senza store, a Canadian brand that is just being introduced to the United States. And around the corner, Lane Bryant, the plus-size women’s clothing company, has introduced LaneStyle Studio, a personal shopping program that offers customers one-on-one appointments.

The test market activity continues up the road at Polaris Fashion Place, another high-end mall. There, Lane Bryant is replicating its personal shopping experiments, and Abercrombie & Fitch debuted its first new store design in 15 years in February, replacing its traditional shadowy décor with warmer, better-lit displays.

Also at Polaris, Mr. Rawlins, the chief executive of DSW, is tinkering with his own business model. At a location he calls “the lab store,” Mr. Rawlins is testing new offerings including shoe rental, shoe storage and cobbler services, even a nail salon.

“We’re looking for other ways to retain our customers,” he said.

A Retail Silicon Valley

Les Wexner, a Columbus native, remembers that when he attended Ohio State University in the late 1950s, his professors told him an unusual fact: Columbus was a major test market for consumer goods companies. When corporations wanted to see if a new soap or detergent would have broad appeal, they came to Columbus.

A few years later, Mr. Wexner opened his first women’s clothing store in town, calling it The Limited. As the company expanded, he took his education to heart, trying out new styles and store designs in his hometown before rolling them out to new markets.

“Before I even started the business, Columbus was a great test market,” Mr. Wexner said in an interview. “The customers here were average, and the thinking was that things they liked or rejected would be predictive for the rest of the country.”

The strategy worked. The Limited grew into a retail behemoth. Over the years, Mr. Wexner acquired some brands and introduced others, and at one time or another owned Lane Bryant, Abercrombie & Fitch and Express under the umbrella of his company, L Brands. All along the way, he tested new ideas.

“Les was never satisfied,” said Denny Gerdeman, who once designed stores for Mr. Wexner and is now a co-founder of the Columbus design firm Chute Gerdeman. “Every six months we had to redesign the stores.”

Mr. Wexner, the longest-serving chief executive of a major American company and a billionaire many times over, is not particularly modest about his accomplishments.

“Walt Disney invented characters, and I invent businesses,” Mr. Wexner said. “We’re constantly inventing, reinventing and spinning off businesses.”

To be sure, Mr. Wexner made his fortune with a preternatural ability to see retail’s future. He anticipated the rise of casual attire, spotted underappreciated brands and knew when to sell them off before they lost their luster.

Mr. Wexner’s penchant for experimentation extended beyond his stores, too. It was he, along with a developer called the Georgetown Company, who called up Mr. Steiner in Miami and helped develop Easton Town Center.

Over the years, Mr. Wexner spun off most of the brands he had acquired, seeding Columbus with a new crop of independent companies that in turn tossed off their own spinoffs and imitators. And over the years, an industry emerged. In same way that Hewlett-Packard gave birth to Silicon Valley’s technology sector, Mr. Wexner’s relentless deal making has spawned a network of companies that now shapes people’s tastes from coast to coast.

Today the L Brands headquarters share a campus with Express, which is now a public company of its own. The Abercrombie & Fitch headquarters are a short drive away.

“It all stems from Les Wexner,” said Steve Zawada, chief operating officer at Eloquii, a plus-size women’s clothing company based in Columbus.

But with few exceptions, the industry that Columbus helped create is now under threat. After years of job gains, retail employment in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, has decreased over the last year, according to the Columbus Chamber of Commerce. Today, retailers employ some 68,000 people, down from more than 93,000 in 2001.

Shares of Express are down about 45 percent this year. Ascena, the Columbus company that now owns Lane Bryant, has seen its stock plummet by 69 percent over the same time. And Abercrombie & Fitch and DSW have also fallen over the last full year.

Even Mr. Wexner’s company, after decades of success, appears to be in decline. Shares of L Brands, which today includes Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works, Henri Bendel and La Senza, have fallen by 42 percent over the past year. Sales at Victoria’s Secret were down 12 percent from last year through September, as women buy their lingerie elsewhere.

“I’m perfectly willing to accept that women may never wear bras,” Mr. Wexner said, tossing aside the notion that his products might one day be obsolete. “But probably women will still wear bras. The categories we are in we think have futures.”","An Alternate Universe of Shopping, in Ohio",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/business/an-alternate-universe-of-shopping-in-ohio.html

And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common.
He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

PhotoIn an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well.","From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

With economy, a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances, it revisits an early episode from the life of Thurgood Marshall, the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. From the 1940s to the early ’60s, he argued 32 cases before the court, winning most. “Sometimes history takes things into its own hands,” Marshall once said, but he also regularly gave history a shove.

“Marshall” isn’t about the famous cases that he argued in front of the court, including the history-making Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which led the court to declare racially segregated public schools unconstitutional. Instead, the movie focuses on a 1941 case involving Eleanor Strubing, a wealthy white woman from Greenwich, Conn., who accused her black chauffeur and butler, Joseph Spell, of raping her and then pushing her off a bridge. After hours of questioning, Spell confessed. The racist reactions to the charges, which invoked the dangerous Jim Crow stereotype of the ravaging black man, caught the notice of N.A.A.C.P., which sent Marshall to the rescue.

Jauntily self-possessed, the movie’s Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) rides in like a cavalry of one, taking the measure of the town and its escalating tension. He’s soon joined by another lawyer, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), a button-down type who reluctantly joins the defense and reasonably fears the attention it will bring. The pair’s introduction immediately sets the alpha and beta tag-team dynamic: Thurgood casually asks for a hand with his bags, and Sam ends up carrying the load. The scene telegraphs the shifting power dynamics Thurgood represents, but it also announces that the movie will resort to easy, ingratiating comedy to sell the goods.

Video

Seamlessly directed by Reginald Hudlin from a script by the father-and-son team of Michael and Jacob Koskoff, the movie primarily involves Thurgood’s strategy to free Joseph. Part of what made the case important to the N.A.A.C.P., as the scholar Daniel J. Sharfstein has written, was that it took place in the North instead of the South, where the organization was fighting on multiple fronts. In the 1930s, the activist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that the idea that there was no prejudice in the North was a fable. “The difference between North and South in the matter of segregation,” he wrote in 1934, “is largely a difference of degree.”

“Marshall” takes up that refrain both in its restaging of the trial and through the evolution of Thurgood and Sam’s slow-warming relationship. As the case comes into focus, Joseph (Sterling K. Brown) and Eleanor (Kate Hudson) take their opposing seats, the jury troops in, and the nasty judge (James Cromwell) starts snarling. Thurgood rapidly takes the lead while slyly poking and strategically prodding Sam to rise to the occasion. Thurgood and Sam banter, lash out, jostle for position and occasionally deliver some stink eye, especially Sam (at Thurgood). Like his character, Mr. Boseman is the star of this show, while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief. Both performers are natural showmen who never step on each other’s moment; they’re fun to watch.

It’s all a bit too much fun at times. The chuckles and legal-eagle bromance make the difficult, disturbing story flow easily, but there are moments when you wish that Mr. Hudlin would ease up on the comedy. Sam, in particular, occasionally comes uncomfortably close to a being a caricature, one of those bespectacled, emasculated types who need a kick in the pants, a sock in the jaw, so they can man up. The broadness of the characterizations is of a piece with the movie’s anxious rhythms and relentless forward drive. These may be a function of the clock running out on Joseph, along with a desire to entertain. But there’s little reflective or quiet time with the characters, these men of righteous action who chase clues before swooping into court and history.","Review: In ‘Marshall,’ a Legal Pioneer Gives History a Shove",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/marshall-review-chadwick-boseman.html

The tax projections in the offering plan were overly optimistic given that they live in an area in the midst of rapid residential growth and skyrocketing property values. The plan was also vague about the limits of their tax abatement. While someone who is buying an older apartment can scour years of tax history to anticipate how high taxes might go, Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist had to rely on the limited tax predictions in the offering plan. It is not clear how common it is for buyers to experience a confluence of events like this — a perfect storm.

Still, why were they caught so off guard? “This is a mystical process,” said Alex Barrett, the principal of Barrett Design, the building’s developer, about how taxes are calculated for his projects. “Hell if I know how it happens. We rely on these consultants to tell us: ‘This is what it’s going to be.’”

Seeking more clarity, I called Paul J. Korngold, who is something of a tax guru in the world of residential real estate. If you’re building a condo, he is one of a handful of the top tax lawyers you would hire to figure out how the city might assess a property once that hole in the ground turns into a dazzling tower of glass and steel. (Mr. Korngold, a partner at the Manhattan law firm Tuchman, Korngold, Weiss, Liebman and Gelles, did not advise Barrett Design on the Atlantic Avenue condo, but he has advised the company on other projects.)

Predicting the future, of course, is not a simple task. A tax lawyer or tax consultant prepares an opinion letter that calculates what taxes would likely be the first year the building is operational, often two or more years before a condo opens. But a lot can change in two years, particularly in a neighborhood where dozens of new residential buildings are popping up around the same time. First-budget-year taxes, which are what you see in the Schedule A, can also be surprisingly low because there is a good chance that the property was under construction for part or most of that time and therefore not assessed as a fully operational condo.

Walk into an open house and the brochure you pick up will include the Schedule A tax estimate, not a bad number to use if you’re trying to sell an apartment. Brokers “want to sell the units,” Mr. Korngold said. “They want to show low taxes.” So brokers work with the information in the Schedule A. For a fuller picture of what you will eventually owe, you or your lawyer have to thumb through the offering plan to find that tax opinion letter.

But the letter predicts taxes only for the first year that the building is fully operational. After that first year, a buyer is on his or her own. The city, meanwhile, reassesses properties every year and assessments and taxes usually only go in one direction — up.

In a small condo with 10 units or fewer, like the one on Atlantic Avenue, tax increases are limited to up to 8 percent a year, or 30 percent over five years. Larger condos have no such limits.

“No one can 100 percent predict what the Department of Finance is going to do and the sponsor doesn’t make any guarantees,” said Pierre E. Debbas, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. He said tax estimates are usually accurate. “But every now and then there’s an outlier that could be off.” Out of the hundreds of deals handled by his firm in the past year, Mr. Debbas has received complaints from three buyers, a small number unless you are one of them.

Yes, taxes rise, but the letter in Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist’s offering plan, prepared in 2013 by Metropolitan Realty Exemptions, a Brooklyn company, seems to have left out some details. For example, on the 421a abatement, the letter said any increase in assessed value “shall be exempt from property taxes.” Yet, the tax exemption only covers around $84,000 in assessed value, so anything over that would be subject to regular taxes. While most of the other apartments in the building are assessed at around $84,000, the home of Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist has been assessed at $135,505.

The letter also calculated $17,853 in residential taxes for the entire building, based on a projection of how the city would assess the property once construction finished. But two years later, Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist are on the hook for more than that amount just for their one unit. In other words, the estimate was really low compared with reality, and neither the couple, nor their lawyer, saw a red flag.

Calls to Metropolitan Realty Exemptions for comment were not returned.

Certainly, we live in a buyer-beware world, and it is up to the person buying the apartment to do the homework — that’s why you hire a lawyer. “The developer quotes you a price, but you have to have your eyes wide open,” said Dr. Sheron Latcha, 49, a nephrologist who is under contract to buy a one-bedroom apartment in One Waterline Square, a Richard Meier-designed tower on the Upper West Side. “If you didn’t read the fine print, that’s on you.”

But sometimes the fine print is not enough. For Mr. Reimer and Ms. Ljungkvist, the information they received did not prepare them for reality. The couple are now concerned that as the tax abatement dwindles, so, too, will the equity in their home. “If we had known” that the taxes would rise so high, Ms. Ljungkvist said, “we never would have bought this place.”",Could a Perfect Tax Storm Strike Your Condo?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/realestate/could-a-perfect-tax-storm-strike-your-condo.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

But not all flaws are equal in the eyes of buyers, and savvy sellers can turn some of those quirks into positives, with the right spin – and the right price.

To find the toughest sales in the city, we asked the real estate website Realtor.com to survey New York agents on the worst hurdles they have had to clear. And over the course of a week this fall, more than 140 agents from several brokerages ranked six common obstacles to a sale, from bad to worst.

An apartment with windows that look out onto a brick wall — or some other bleak backdrop — was the most dreaded, with an average score of 4.24 out of six. Lack of sunlight was second worst, followed by noisy streets, walk-up apartments and active construction nearby. Eccentric design was the least troublesome flaw, with a score of 2.99.

Then there were the write-in responses, which read like letters from the trenches. “Filth,” wrote one agent, without elaborating. “Offensive odors,” said another. “NEEDS WORK,” a third shouted. More prosaic answers included high carrying costs, bad tenants and persnickety co-op boards.

One precise agent borrowed a phrase from German to complain about unimaginative buyers: “No fingerspitzengefühl” — which is to say, they lacked feeling in their fingertips, or a sensitivity to what the space could be.

That’s where creative marketing comes in. Patrick Lilly, an associate broker with CORE, sold a tiny one-bedroom on the Upper East Side last year that had lingered on the market for 10 months with another brokerage. It was on the second floor of a walk-up co-op on a dead-end street a long way from the subway.

“We called it a cul-de-sac,” Mr. Lilly said, adding that the dead-end created a quiet green space overlooking the East River that he was able to play up to make the area feel quaint and detached from the city.

“Technically, it is a cul-de-sac,” he said, but who “calls it that in Manhattan?” Using the euphemism, however, helped publicize the listing and got it mentioned on real estate blogs. Mr. Lilly listed the apartment for $575,000 — $15,000 more than the previous agent had — and it sold in a month, for $550,000, to a family that saw it on one of the blogs.

But when it comes to the hardest obstacles, sometimes even sleight of hand falls short, said Andrew Feldman, an associate broker with Triplemint. He had a second-floor two-bedroom apartment in the Flatiron district that faced the back, with cramped eight-foot ceilings and very poor light. “It was like a dungeon. The ceilings made it feel like a torture chamber,” he said.

“There was nothing about the place I could candy-coat,” he continued. “I almost didn’t want the listing.”

Priced at $1.025 million, it languished on the market for 292 days. In February, after the owner had put a tenant in place, the apartment finally sold for $955,000, about 7 percent under the asking price, to an investor who was happy to collect the rental income.

For truly challenged properties, it often comes down to price. In the third quarter, the median sales price of resale apartments, including condos and co-ops, rose a modest 1.9 percent, to $995,000, compared to the same period last year — a new record, according to a Douglas Elliman report. But the average listing discount also grew, to 5.5 percent, up from 2.9 percent in the same period last year. And listings took longer to sell, spending an average of 101 days on the market, up almost 28 percent from last year.

“The seller is traveling further to meet the buyer,” said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, which prepared the report. Resales are also competing with a growing share of newly built apartments, which made up 13.7 percent of inventory this quarter, up from 9.1 percent the same period last year.

For sellers, facing up to that reality, especially when there is an obvious foible to their property, can mean the difference between a quick sale and listing limbo. Michael Vargas, president of Vanderbilt Appraisal in Manhattan, said the most common deficiencies could mean a 5 to 20 percent discount on resale value, compared to units without those flaws, a gap that could rise to 30 percent in a downbeat market.

Still, most flaws can be mitigated with the right mix of perks. In a walk-up apartment building, the second floor typically commands the highest price, Mr. Vargas said, with each subsequent floor dropping 2 to 3 percent in price, because of the longer schlep up the stairs. The ground-floor unit is dinged because it is perceived as less private. But a high-floor unit can compensate with an emphasis on better views, a better layout and quality renovations, he said.

Resisting a lower price at the outset, however, could mean headaches down the line. “Once something is on the market for a period of time, it’s like sharks smelling blood in the water,” said the appraiser Andrew Goodman, president of Gotham Valuation in Midtown. “People just assume they can wait on it.”

Frances Katzen, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman, listed a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment on a high floor of a prewar co-op on the Upper West Side for $1.425 million in late September. The apartment has a sizable living room, 10-foot ceilings and gets lots of sunlight, but the living room windows face a brick wall.

At its current listing price, the unit is about $100,000 less than comparable units with a better view, Ms. Katzen said. “I was honest” about the price, she said, telling the seller, who bought the apartment for about $1.3 million in 2013, that it was better to aim low and drum up interest to counter the poor views.

It may have worked. The first open house, she said, had 42 showings (closer to six is typical), and she now has an offer for $100,000 over the asking price.

For savvy buyers, of course, an overlooked apartment can present an opportunity. Ben Lund, 29, and his husband, Alexander Rosanelli, 27, found a one-bed, one-bath apartment with a private terrace on the Upper West Side that had lingered on the market because it was on the fourth floor of a five-story walk-up. They bought it for $475,000, down from $520,000.

“It comes down to what you’re looking for,” said Mr. Rosanelli, who runs Hound’s Tree Vineyards on Long Island. “We didn’t really think much about the walk-up at that point. I’m in a car a lot, and walking is part of what we like about the city.”

The reduced sale price allowed the couple to renovate, installing custom cabinets, reclaimed oak bookshelves, new appliances and large pocket doors to the bedroom.

They are now selling because Mr. Lund, who works in finance, has accepted a job in Greenwich, Conn. The listing, which came on the market in April, is at $649,000, down from an initial $675,000. Mae H. Bagai, the listing agent and an associate broker with Sotheby’s International Realty, said that she is counting on the recent remodel and private terrace to compensate for the stairs.

Often, dealing with an obstacle comes down to finding the right audience. Elizabeth Kee, an associate broker with CORE, has a railroad-style apartment in the East Village listed for $2.1 million that she is targeting at investors. The unit is on the ground floor of an artsy prewar building, where the hallways have castle-like accents and are covered in murals of Mediterranean landscapes. Its central window faces an air shaft with a brick wall.

The apartment does get sunlight on either end. It also has a private rear outdoor space, but the only way to get to it is through a window with mini-steps that rise to the windowsill. Complicating the sale is the inclusion of a basement commercial space, which could make financing more challenging.

“It has a little bit of everything,” Ms. Kee said ruefully, but she hopes that the apartment, which has been on the market since April, will eventually appeal to a buyer looking for rental income.

The key to a sale, she said, will be transparency: “I would rather point something out that’s a little extraordinary” — the step-up window, for example — “rather than have them say, ‘Wait, what is that, a hobbit door?’”

For Mr. Hawthorne, the NoHo homeowner, the quirks of his three-level, ground-floor apartment were never a bother. He and his wife, Dorothy Durkin Hawthorne, a former dean at the New York University School of Continuing and Professional Studies who died in 2011, were the first buyers of the co-op apartment, in 1978.

A freelance writer and former publisher, Mr. Hawthorne said he bought the 3,000-square-foot apartment, which was raw space at the time, for $73,000 cash, an amount he happened to have on hand from a recent bonus check.

Thanks to construction experience in his youth, he was able to build the apartment from the ground up with the help of a friend, creating a lofted office in the 14-foot-tall living room, two sleeping quarters on the lower level and a flexible space in the subbasement that now serves as an artist’s workshop.

The sound of the subway is noticeable in the basement, he admitted, but it is not intrusive. More often, it serves as the setup for a joke. “I used to say, ‘Maybe I should open up a newsstand and a coffee shop’” when the trains went by, he said.

His agent, Ms. Rothman of Halstead, said the trouble so far has been explaining the space. “People have no imagination, for the most part,” she said, which is why she has been pitching a number of uses for the basement space: a home theater, a gym, a woodworking shop.

Mr. Hawthorne, who dreams of moving to Bali with his brother-in-law and rekindling his old passion for scuba diving, said that while the layout is unusual, the apartment is now priced to allow the buyer to fully remodel the space.

Just this week, they received a full-price offer from a local couple who had seen it listed at a higher price, Ms. Rothman said. And now Mr. Hawthorne has bigger concerns than train traffic.

Kobe Steel added that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years.
No deaths or safety incidents have been attributed to Kobe Steel.
All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials.
The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.","Last week, Nissan Motor said unqualified staff members had carried out inspections at its factories, prompting the carmaker to recall 1.2 million vehicles, though it was not clear if the quality of the vehicles had been affected. Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor both admitted last year that they had been exaggerating the fuel economy of their vehicles by cheating on tests.

Perhaps the biggest blow to Japan’s reputation for quality has come from Takata, the airbag maker that was at the center of the largest auto safety recall in history, involving tens of millions of vehicles. Its faulty airbags have been blamed for more than a dozen deaths. Takata declared bankruptcy in June.

Toshiaki Oguchi, director of Governance for Owners Japan, a corporate watchdog, said that Japanese companies were generally diligent about quality, but that when cheating occurred — because of competitive pressure or other factors — it could too easily go unchecked. Japanese companies, he said, tend to discourage thorough examination or criticism, either from employees or from independent outsiders.

“When something goes wrong, companies always hire a committee of outsiders to examine what happened,” Mr. Oguchi said. “But why not be proactive? Why not have people reviewing procedures all the time?”

The extent of the problems at Kobe Steel are still unfolding.

Kobe Steel said on Sunday that employees at four of its factories had altered inspection certificates on aluminum and copper products from September 2016 to August this year. The changes, it said, made it look as if the products met manufacturing specifications required by customers — including for vital qualities like tensile strength, a measure of material’s ability to withstand a load without breaking when being stretched — when they did not.

On Wednesday, the company said it was investigating possible data falsification involving another product, powdered steel, which is used mostly to make gears. The company said the powdered steel it was examining had been sold to one customer it did not name.

Kobe Steel added that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years. The company did not provide significant details on the discrepancies, making it difficult to immediately determine if they posed a safety threat. No deaths or safety incidents have been attributed to Kobe Steel.

The company’s share price dropped sharply on Tuesday, the first day of trading after a holiday, and as of Wednesday morning in Tokyo had lost about one-third of its value since last week.

“The falsification problem has become an issue that could destroy international faith in Japanese manufacturing,” the Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei said in an article on Tuesday.

Even as Japan has given up its lead in technologies like televisions, cellphones and computers, it still excels in highly valued products used behind the scenes, including precision machinery, specialty chemicals, sensors and cameras.

Quality helps Japan preserve its markets overseas despite intense competition. Although China is the world’s largest steel maker, Japan still exports large amounts of iron and steel there.

One of the products at the center of the scandal, rolled aluminum, is widely used in the transportation industry because it is light. The lighter a car, train or airplane, the less fuel required to propel it.

Global manufacturers are now trying to assess their exposure, as they dig through an extensive supply chain.

A big car company like G.M. buys millions of tons of steel a year from a dozen or two dozen producers, in a variety of grades and forms. Steel can be sourced from different mills and shipped to any number of plants worldwide. G.M., for example, has 12 vehicle assembly plants and six stamping plants in the United States alone, all of which take deliveries of steel from many different producers.

All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials. Toyota called the data falsification a “grave issue” and said it was looking into the problem and considering how best to respond, a statement echoed by other carmakers. Ford and General Motors are trying to determine whether they have used the company’s products.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which makes equipment for Shinkansen high-speed trains in Japan, said it was investigating. JR Tokai, a railway company that operates the busiest Shinkansen route in Japan, between Tokyo and Osaka, said that the data discrepancies “do not present a problem in terms of design standards,” but that it was nonetheless considering whether to replace certain train components.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries uses aluminum from Kobe Steel in a midsize aircraft it is developing, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, as well as aircraft components it supplies to Boeing. Mitsubishi Heavy said it was investigating. Boeing said in a statement, “Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern, and we will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to complete our investigation.”

Kobe Steel’s problem points to “a common organization issue,” said Shin Ushijima, a lawyer who serves as president of the Japan Corporate Governance Network. He drew parallels between Kobe Steel and Takata and Mitsubishi, as well as with financial-reporting improprieties at Toshiba, which admitted to overstating profit in 2015.

“Boards aren’t doing their jobs,” he said. “This isn’t an issue that can be solved by the president resigning. There needs to be wholesale change.”

He added, “The Kobe Steel case is a test of whether we’ve learned anything from Toshiba and these other issues.”

Kobe Steel said it had confirmed data falsification affecting roughly 19,300 tons of flat-rolled and extruded aluminum products, 19,400 units of aluminum casting and forgings, and 2,200 tons of copper products. The amount was about 4 percent of the company’s output of those products from September 2016 to August.

The company said that it had received no reports from customers of problems with the affected products, and that the falsification had been discovered during an internal review. The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.

It said “tens” of employees and managers had been directly involved in the falsification, although no penalties against the employees were immediately announced.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges.
It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.
While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists.
“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967.","Catherine Leroy was 21 when she arrived in Vietnam in 1966 with only a hundred dollars, a Leica M2 and a limited professional portfolio. Over the next three years covering the war, she built an exceptional body of work: surviving and documenting a capture by the North Vietnamese Army, parachuting in combat operations with the 173rd Airborne, and being published on the covers of major magazines, including Life and Paris Match.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges. They are candid and revealing, attesting to her resiliency, exposing insecurities, and showing her in moments of triumph, despair, optimism or courage.

Photo

Despite her many strong images, Ms. Leroy had remained relatively unknown, partly because she wasn’t a self-promoter, and partly because women photographers have often been excluded from the medium’s history, especially war photography. Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”

A designer of erotic jewelry, a self-described “sexual anthropologist” and the author of the candid yet refined 2013 sex guide, “The Boudoir Bible,” the 49-year-old Vernon is a jeweler turned sex educator. She holds sessions in her private home studio in which she helps clients find erotic awareness through a combination of talk therapy, movement and occasional treatments in the nine-foot bronze, steel and leather swinglike contraption that hangs from the ceiling of her basement.

Democrats said Mr. Trump’s actions were meant to sabotage the health care program and undermine the Iran deal even without full repeal.
The Iran deal and Nafta are bellwether cases.","Mr. Trump’s advisers characterize that as the more pragmatic side of a businessman who takes maximalist positions in part to set the stage for negotiations but does not necessarily intend to go as far as he might give the impression. His critics said that the partial steps were still destructive, and that the president was effectively leaving initiatives like health care and the Iran deal wounded on the battlefield without allowing ambulances onto the scene.

A question for the president is whether partial actions will satisfy supporters demanding a full repudiation of the Obama era. Mr. Trump promised to deal with such issues in some cases within his first days in office but has found that Washington resists quick action. Frustrated by Congress, he is increasingly turning to executive power and can point to the moves he has made as signs of his commitment to fulfilling his promises.

“The gap between President Trump’s ambitious promises and actual policies is large and growing,” said William C. Inboden, a White House aide under President George W. Bush and now executive director of the William P. Clements Jr. Center on History, Strategy and Statecraft at the University of Texas. “This is weakening the institution of the presidency itself, which becomes diminished when presidents over promise and under deliver, or when responsibilities normally handled by the president become habitually shirked to Congress or other nations.”

A cautionary tale is Mr. Obama himself, who made lofty and ambitious heal-the-planet, close-Guantánamo promises only to fall short in some instances, to the disappointment of his liberal supporters. The difference is that Mr. Trump often gives the impression with his public comments that he has gone further than he actually has.

“It’s classic Trump: bluff and bombast substituting for actual deeds,” said Jacob Heilbrunn, editor of The National Interest, a foreign policy magazine. “He’s the political equivalent of the Washington Nationals — a choke artist at critical moments.”

Mr. Trump pronounced himself happy with the approach he is taking on health care, which has been the most consuming domestic issue of his presidency so far. “We’re going a little different route,” he told an audience of religious conservatives on Friday. “But you know what? In the end, it’s going to be just as effective, and maybe it’ll even be better.”

Later in the day, he acknowledged that his new strategy on Iran would not actually scrap the nuclear deal but would allow Congress to come up with an alternative. Asked why he did not simply terminate the agreement, he said: “I may very well do that. But I like a two-step process much better.”

Democrats said Mr. Trump’s actions were meant to sabotage the health care program and undermine the Iran deal even without full repeal. By cutting subsidies to insurance companies, “it’s clear the president is trying to sabotage the health care market and send costs soaring,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland denounced what he called “the president’s reckless, political decision and his subsequent threat to Congress” on the Iran agreement.

Mr. Trump has taken partial steps on other campaign promises as well. He signed an order scrapping his predecessor’s program granting legal status to as many as 800,000 younger immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, but delayed the final effect for six months to give Congress a chance to restore it on a more solid legal foundation. Even then, he suggested that he would find another way to preserve the program if Congress did not meet his deadline.

He has boasted that he was reversing Mr. Obama’s diplomatic opening to Cuba. But while he has pulled out many diplomats and restored some restrictions on contacts with the island, he has not cut off relations again, closed the embassy or shut down travel and other interactions. He has talked about throwing out Nafta, but has actually left it intact and has taken the route of negotiating to see if it can be retained with improved provisions.

“I am not surprised because Donald Trump is not an ideologue, he’s a realist and a pragmatist,” said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of the president’s. “During the campaign, he staked out some very strong positions maybe as a negotiating start point, or in other cases they were based on the facts he had at the time.”

“Trump is actually very open to feedback and criticism on his ideas,” Mr. Ruddy said. “Based on that he can easily adjust and change course.”

Clifford Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, said the president seemed to be trying to translate business negotiations to the political world. “Trump’s clearly got a theory of deal-making — demand the world, take the most you can, and then brag about it,” he said. “It’s actually a pretty good tack that’s often underestimated. But the bottom line, so far in his presidency, is that he’s been unable to deliver on overstated goals.”

In the end, he may wind up taking the more sweeping actions — he may yet pull the United States out of Nafta or the Iran deal. He may yet let the program for younger immigrants expire early next year. He has repeatedly talked about “letting Obamacare fail,” which his latest steps may accelerate.

“There is now a new and scary spring in his step,” Mr. Kupchan said. “He could be entering a new phase involving fuller takedowns of agreements and institutions. The Iran deal and Nafta are bellwether cases. What’s really interesting is that he fired his chief revolutionary, Steve Bannon, but seems on the verge of taking on that role himself.”",Promise the Moon? Easy for Trump.

The bugle incident is definitely fair game, since Trump’s been on a rampage against black National Football League players who kneel during the national anthem. Which is worse, people? Athletes staging a somber protest about racial injustice or a president sitting around joshing during a ceremony about the flag?

Trump’s whole crusade against the football demonstrators has been mean, a play to that fabled base of his. He’s even been cruel to Mike Pence, who was directed to walk out of an Indianapolis Colts game when some players knelt down. And Pence really wanted to see that game! They were retiring Peyton Manning’s jersey!

It seems only fair to take the occasional low road against a president who loves nothing more than getting up in the morning to launch a meaningless-divisive-symbolic crusade. For instance, we’re going to be spending the next 10 weeks listening to Trump talk about bringing back Christmas. It’s hard to believe that in his New York real estate days he didn’t occasionally say “Happy holidays!” But in this presidency, it’s as bad as, um, ignoring the flag.

“We’re saying Merry Christmas again,” he told the Values Voters Summit on Friday. It’s important, he explained, because it’s something that “people don’t talk about anymore.”

We are now going to have two and a half months to point out that in a land surrounded by Christmas sales, carpeted by Christmas trees and bathed in the broadcast of Christmas carols, the last thing we really need to worry about is the failure to mention the word “Christmas.”

If we were going to cruise down the highway of political virtue this week, talking policy and watching the climate change, we’d discuss health care. Trump is deliberately undermining a program that many working and middle-class Americans rely on to pay for their insurance coverage. Among many deeply depressing changes, he’s axing government payments to insurance companies that help subsidize policies for the poor.

On Friday the president talked about it very briefly with reporters. But he managed to explain, in a nanosecond, why he hates the subsidies: “Take a look at who those insurance companies support and I guarantee you one thing. It’s not Donald Trump.”

Low road beckons. Really, it’s waving its hand in desperation. So let’s just mention that at the signing ceremony held to celebrate one of the new health-care-wrecking changes, Trump forgot to sign. Pence had to drag him back to the little bitty table to write down his name.

The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

What’s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?

This distillation of all that Buddhism says: “The person who craves nothing cannot suffer.” From Harari and “Sapiens.” That made me say “eek”, as there is nothing in there about God, or the indifferent universe, or our need to be part of a greater connected humanity. That is as simple as “iif you don’t buy it you will never need it.” Turns out that Buddha was a sharpie.

If you could play one fictional character from a novel on stage or screen, who would it be and why? And one real-life figure you first encountered in a work of nonfiction?

I still am young enough to play Dean Reed, the American who, starting in the 1960s, was considered to be a big American singing star, but only to the Communist world. He was famous in the Soviet Union and East Germany and all over the Communist world. He was an actor, made movies, and was both beloved (by many) and dismissed (by many), was crazy-making good-looking and traveled in the upper echelons of the red world. That life, and all that attention, made for an inevitable tragedy by the 1980s. But those that loved him as a friend loved him very much.

In the fiction world, I’d like a whack at James Ellroy’s Lloyd Hopkins character — a cop who is such a genius the only work for him is police work. He is so smart and off-world in his abilities, the L.A.P.D. just sort of leaves him to poke around. A brilliant creation from the oh-so-complicated typing of Ellroy.

You’ve already starred in many movie adaptations of novels. Among those, which source material was your favorite?

“The Green Mile” was a perfect adaptation from Stephen King. The screenplay folded into the six novellas hand in glove. “Forrest Gump” was a high-wire interpretation of Winston Groom’s book. And “Cloud Atlas,” for me, reached the high country — so different in form and function from the Mitchell book, but exact in every detail nonetheless.

The Cheever stories, the Vonnegut stories, the Salinger stories (especially those I had to find online, before he became THAT Salinger). Bukowski wrote short stories that were prose poems, yet I read them as the vignettes of life that, to me, rate as full-blown short stories.

What’s the best thing you’ve ever read about typewriters?

Can’t say I’ve ever read about a typewriter, but I did see one that made me sit up and take notice. Ray Milland walking up Third avenue with his portable typewriter, looking for a pawn broker so he can hock it to buy alcohol. The typewriter was valuable to him so he could feed his addiction, but he was a writer! He was going to go all O. Henry and sell the tool of his trade, like a samurai warrior trading in his sword for a cheap blade and a jug of sake. He was committing creative career suicide. As a writer, he had only his mind and his typewriter, the latter had value but was made worthless without the former. He had lost his soul and had no more use for his typewriter — and it was a beauty!!

What’s the last book that made you laugh?

Ada Calhoun’s “Wedding Toasts I’ll Never Give.” I mean, underlining and yellow marker bust-out laughs.

The last book to make you cry?

“Hue 1968,” by Mark Bowden. Dear God, the horrors and the waste. And I know some of the people who were there …

The last book that made you furious?

James Baldwin’s “The Fire Next Time.” Nothing seems to have changed. He tells the story of going to the NYC Public Library on Fifth Avenue when he was 10. A cop — as large an authority figure in the world to a 10-year-old — said to him as he was crossing the avenue, “Why don’t you people stay in Harlem where you belong.” Heart-breaking and maddening …

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

WASHINGTON — Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke vowed Friday that there would be “no quarter” for employees who sexually harass or discriminate against colleagues. He said he would dismiss anyone found guilty of harassment and supervisors who sweep such charges under the rug.

After Secretary Zinke’s remarks, he and the acting National Park Service director, Michael T. Reynolds, answered questions from park employees in a closed meeting, which primarily focused on how agency managers would deal with reports of bullying and intimidation. The park was rocked by scandal after Sally Jewell, who was Interior Secretary under President Obama, received a request for investigation from 13 former and current employees in the Grand Canyon River District, citing an “intimidating, hostile, or sexually offensive work environment.”

The district was shut down after the Office of the Inspector General found what it called a 15-year-failure to address numerous reports of abuse and harassment, including male workers trying to take intimate photos of female colleagues, groping and physical assault, and withholding food on river trips after sexual advances were rejected.

In the long account of his life, Mr. Paddock never expressed remorse.","When Benjamin Paddock sat for the examination, he was built like a refrigerator and wore a neatly trimmed blond mustache and horn-rimmed glasses that framed strikingly light gray eyes. Pleasant, clean-cut and “incongruously cheerful,” he chain smoked through the interview, offering a gripping biography with a “fluent command of language.”

“He smiles frequently, sometimes winningly, shows occasionally just a touch of ruefulness,” the psychiatrist, William B. McGrath, noted. “No despair, alarm or concern about his fate is manifest.”

“I get the impression he enjoys being an interesting subject of examination,” the doctor wrote. He concluded that Mr. Paddock was bright, with no history of “mental defect,” and was able to stand trial. But, the doctor added, Mr. Paddock had a “sociopathic personality.”

The portrait of Stephen Paddock that investigators have assembled stands in stark contrast: Reserved, even boring, he was an accountant and investor who liked to gamble only after calculating all the risks. Before the shooting, the authorities say, he had never broken the law. Among the many questions that are unanswered is what influence, if any, his father’s absence and infamy had on his life.

“We are establishing the timeline of the suspect’s life, his motivation and everybody else associated with him throughout time,” Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. The F.B.I. has hundreds of agents on the case and more than 1,000 pieces of evidence, said Aaron Rouse, the special agent in charge in Las Vegas.

A statement from the Clark County coroner’s office said that an autopsy on Mr. Paddock had been completed, and that “multiple forensic analyses” would be performed, including an examination of brain tissue.

Benjamin Paddock had boasted during his psychological evaluation that his run-ins with authority started early and rarely stopped. He was an only child, pampered by his mother and not disciplined by his father. “I got away with an awful lot,” he told his evaluator. “I went where I felt like it, disrupting everybody’s schedule.” By 12 he was driving his own car.

He quit high school almost as soon as he started, then joined the Navy at age 15, but was discharged a few months later, he said, when the Navy figured out, “I wasn’t going to do what they wanted me to.”

He drove buses in Los Angeles, but got fired for a game of bus tag with other drivers.

In 1946 he was caught stealing a car in Chicago and reselling it in “a fraudulent fashion.” He spent five years in prison, 70 percent of it, he said, “in the hole,” or solitary confinement, because he was “unable or unwilling to abide by rules.”

When he got out, he made good money selling used cars in Chicago, but quit because, he explained, “the thrill had gone out of it.”

Photo

During that time he got married and fathered Stephen, who was born in 1953. He also set up a fraud ring that he said passed $90,000 in bad checks. He was caught and sent back to prison.

When he was released in 1956, he moved with his wife and son to Tucson. The couple had three more sons, and Benjamin Paddock operated a service station, a nightclub and a garbage disposal franchise. He bought a house and car, and got involved in the local hot rod and ham radio clubs.

He also walked into the sheriff’s office and offered to counsel troubled youths.

“I only took the incorrigibles,” he told his evaluator. “I have a knack for social work with kids. I told them I had a degree in social psychology and nobody bothered to check up on it. They regarded me as a leading light on juvenile delinquency.”

He boasted that none of his charges had ever ended up back in court.

While Stephen Paddock was playing at the family’s white ranch house, his father was robbing banks with a snub-nosed revolver and getting away in the family station wagon. He said the ham radio equipment he kept in the car was ideal for a robber because he could listen in on the police.

Benjamin Paddock was caught in 1960. But the bank robbery charges, he insisted to the psychiatrist, were a case of mistaken identity. A criminal syndicate was forcing him to take the rap.

For years after Mr. Paddock was arrested, his sons were told he was dead. Later they learned the truth and some visited him, his son Eric Paddock said, but none seemed to form a close relationship. Eric Paddock cursed his father in an interview and said he was angry at him for being more interested in crime than his family.

The authorities have not said what they know about the convict’s relationship with Stephen Paddock.

Facing trial, Benjamin Paddock insisted that he was not crazy. He said he had “never been mental ill, ‘Never even unconscious.’ ” As an aside, he explained that he could get a cushy job in the penitentiary that would beat the boredom of the mental hospital.

In the long account of his life, Mr. Paddock never expressed remorse. A few months later, a judge sentenced him to 20 years in a federal prison. He broke out after eight and spent much of the rest of his life on the lam.",Father’s History Could Offer Insight Into Mind of Las Vegas Gunman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/us/stephen-paddock-father-vegas.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Never before had an aircraft carried so many passengers — including, by the time the jet touched down, several babies born midair.
PhotoLike every 747 pilot since, Mr. Waddell also took a keen interest in how the plane looked.
Now, well into the 21st century, I asked Mr. Foster for an update.
One reader detailed his first 747 flight, on Alitalia, bound for Rome in 1971.","The hopes and fears of the era that gave us the 747 can seem distant. Nor is it easy, in the age of the internet, to feel the same awe at the 747’s ability to shrink and connect the world. Looking back, it’s perhaps enough to marvel at the billions of reunions, migrations, exchanges and collaborations of all manner that were made possible, or at least more affordable, by this aircraft. Today, the equivalent of around half the planet’s population has flown on a 747. The jets have also served in firefighting, military and humanitarian roles. In 1991, as part of Operation Solomon, about 1,100 Ethiopian Jews boarded the 747 that would take them to Israel. Never before had an aircraft carried so many passengers — including, by the time the jet touched down, several babies born midair.

If the 747’s place in history is assured, so too, it seems, is its cultural stature. The jet remains a go-to synonym for aerial enormity, one that a “Game of Thrones” director recently deployed to suggest the dimensions of a dragon. The 747 also endures as a symbol of speed, escape and, frankly, sexiness, one that — along with the pleasingly palindromic rhythm of its number-name — has appealed in particular to singers. A 747 playlist might include Prince (“you are flying aboard the seduction 747”); Earth, Wind and Fire (“just move yourself and glide like a 747”); and Joni Mitchell, who gave perhaps my favorite tribute to 747s (“...over geometric farms.”)

Photo

The jet also seems certain to be remembered as an icon of modern design. “This is one of the great ones,” said Charles Lindbergh of the aircraft that many consider to be uniquely good-looking. I am surely not the first to speculate that the jet’s distinctive hump (fashioned to facilitate cargo-loading in a future that many expected to be dominated by supersonic passenger jets) suggests the graceful head of an avian archetype. Frequently, looking up from my cockpit paperwork, I’ll spot several passengers in the terminal photographing the very jet in which I am sitting. I often see even senior 747 pilots disembark the aircraft that they’ve just spent 11 hours flying to Cape Town or Los Angeles, and then pause, turn around and photograph it.

Indeed, the jet may be most esteemed by those who have been lucky enough to fly it. The very first to do so, the test pilot Jack Waddell, described it as “a pilot’s dream” and a “two-finger airplane” — one that can be flown with just the forefinger and thumb on the control wheel; it is hard to imagine higher praise for such an enormous aircraft. Personally, I find the aircraft to be both smooth and maneuverable, a joy to fly and to land.

Photo

Like every 747 pilot since, Mr. Waddell also took a keen interest in how the plane looked. Remarkably, he did so even as he was piloting the new jet on that first-ever flight. “What kind of a looking ship is this from out there, Paul?” he said over the radio to Paul Bennett, a pilot in the “chase” aircraft that was following the newborn 747 through the skies of the Pacific Northwest. The reply from Mr. Bennett echoes through aviation history: “It’s very good looking, Jack. Fantastic!”

Many 747 pilots feel the same, and are pleased, but not surprised, to hear that the British architect Norman Foster once named the aircraft his favorite building of the 20th century. Now, well into the 21st century, I asked Mr. Foster for an update. The 747 “still moves me now as it did then,” he told me in an email. “Perhaps with the passage of time, and in an age of ‘look-alikes,’ even more so.”

Photo

Mr. Foster has plenty of company. At the start of my first book, a sort of love letter to my job as a pilot, I invited readers to send me their favorite window seat photographs. Many also wrote to share their particular passion for the 747. One reader detailed his first 747 flight, on Alitalia, bound for Rome in 1971. “I have been hooked ever since,” he said. Another, Andrew Flowers, a 42-year-old South African writer who lives in Helsinki, wrote that the 747s he saw as a child in Cape Town stood for what “I wanted most in the world: a way to Europe, to adventure, to freedom.”

When Mr. Foster emailed me, he also attached a transcript of remarks he made about the 747 in a 1991 BBC documentary. “I suppose it’s the grandeur, the scale; it’s heroic, it’s also pure sculpture,” he said then of the jet. “It does not really need to fly, it could sit on the ground, it could be in a museum.”

Today the first 747 is indeed in a museum — the Museum of Flight in Seattle. When I last visited, I couldn’t stay long. (Inevitably, I had a flight to catch.) But if you see me there another time — perhaps in a few decades when I myself am retired, with more time, I hope, to sit on benches and listen to Joni Mitchell — come say hello. I’ll tell you how much I loved this plane, and how sorry I was that my parents did not live to join me on one of my flights. Perhaps you’ll tell me about the first time you ever saw a 747, or flew on one, and together we’ll marvel at how it towers above us even at its lowest altitude, even as it rests on the world.","As the 747 Begins Its Final Approach, a Pilot Takes a Flight Down Memory Lane",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/travel/747-airplane-jet-pilot.html

Bob Corker Rebukes Trump

3. Corker should either remain silent or resign from the Senate. His continual public criticism of the president does not serve the country well. This should be a time of unity, not division in our foreign policy. The American voters elected Trump, not Corker, to be president and architect of U.S. foreign policy.

Devastating Fires Across California

4. I have a friend in Santa Rosa who was driving out of a burning neighborhood with his dog in the car and had to take an unfamiliar route due to fire on the road. He ran into a locked gate in a gated community and could not get out. Then a tree fell and blocked his retreat. He and his dog had to run on foot from a wall of fire. They hiked overland in active fires for several miles trying to get to the creek and/or down the hill into Santa Rosa, were trapped by several fences, and eventually my friend took shelter in a shed while fire raged all around. He was burned by embers, inhaled a lot of smoke, and was almost blinded by smoke and particles during this harrowing ordeal. My friend survived. His dog got lost and we fear the worst.

Mike Pence Walks Out of Indiana N.F.L. Game

6. Is it too much, Mr. Vice President, to ask that we also remember the now seemingly insignificant matter of why the protests began? Colin Kaepernick first knelt “to draw attention to racial oppression of African-Americans” (oh, *them* again). Speaking most particularly to police brutality. Heaven forbid we actually acknowledge and address that. How dare they? Better to shift focus to the ‘disrespect’ of flag, country, veterans and anthem while blatantly erasing the intention of the protests’ origins — leaving victimized, and/or dead African-American men, women and children to lie dismissed and irrelevant in their place.

Boy Scouts Will Welcome Girls

7. This is a bad move on behalf of the Boy Scouts, and it only creates divisiveness. The Boy Scouts would have done so much better to work more closely with the Girl Scouts to form cooperative programs where troops could come together if they were interested in involving girls. I’m been a Girl Scout all my life, and my relationships with other Girl Scouts are dearly important to me, just as I’m sure the same is true for lifelong Boy Scouts. These programs need to be friends, and it all works much better when they don’t poach kids from the other organization.

Camping With John Waters and His Band of ‘Filthy Freaks’ The “Pope of Trash” hosts a sleep-away camp in Litchfield County, Conn. Yes, there were marshmallows, polyester and nudity.

Hello, muddah. Hello, faddah. Here I am at Camp John Waters.

The kids are nice. Actually, they’re grown-ups, among them a vaudeville troupe from Montreal; a pair of bartenders from Key West, Fla.; burlesque dancers; nudists; and at least one pornographer. There are plastic pink flamingos outside the cabins, and the activities, alongside tennis and kayaking, include Scotch & Cigars and a campfire screening of “Female Trouble.”

Before the bus comes to take us home, here’s a recap:

The inaugural Camp John Waters took place at Club Getaway , which lets adults relive their sleep-away camping days. When this extra-campy theme weekend was announced in April, tickets sold out in days, with a waiting list 600 deep. (A 2018 edition was just announced.)

In came John Waters fanatics from as far away as Australia and Chile, towing beehive wigs and cat-eye glasses. On the bus from New York, we’d been asked to sign a standard Club Getaway waiver forbidding “excessive, inappropriate or disruptive actions.” It seemed like a lost cause.

Anticipation was high the first night, as Mr. Waters greeted the 400-odd campers under a tent, wearing a skull-print blazer and his trademark pencil mustache . “When my friends first saw the ad for this,” he told the euphoric crowd, “they said, ‘This isn’t true, right? This is a parody.’”

“The Pope of Trash.” “The People’s Pervert.” To his fans, Mr. Waters is a countercultural demigod, a dirty class clown at 71. His gleefully transgressive films, including “Pink Flamingos” and “Serial Mom,” created a topsy-turvy world in which gross is glamorous, housewives are homicidal, and the noblest title one can achieve is Filthiest Person Alive.

So it was only fitting that Camp John Waters had an upside-down spirit. “I hated sports at camp, so at this camp I think we should reward every team that loses,” Mr. Waters said, to raucous cheers. “This would be the camp where the fat people get picked first in dodge ball.” More cheers.

The campers, who paid up to $599, were a self-selecting group of exhibitionists and oddballs for whom Mr. Waters’s movies were a beacon of belonging. “We’re here to meet a bunch of filthy freaks, and maybe make some new friends,” said Jennifer Sisley, one of the Key West bartenders. “Everybody’s got a common interest.”

Alastair McQueen, a 28-year-old filmmaker, grew up in North Carolina and saw “Pink Flamingos” when he was 12. “My whole life was different after that,” he said, sneaking a cigarette behind the buffet tent. “That’s when I understood there were other weirdos like me.”

He was wearing cutoff jeans, a leopard-print V-neck and an eye patch (“I have pinkeye”), and had big plans for the Saturday meet-and-greet with Mr. Waters. “I’m going to paint a picture of him with my penis,” he said proudly. “And I’m going to have him sign my penis.”

Mr. Waters, as it turned out, had been a camper himself. From ages 8 to 13, he attended Happy Hollow, in his hometown, Baltimore, then went to a boating camp as a teenager. “I learned so much as a young man from summer camp,” he told the crowd. “I learned to smoke unfiltered cigarettes.” Then he mentioned other, less PG-rated activities.

He had a crush on one of his counselors, but the other campers didn’t beat him up for being gay, “because all the brutes thought I was crazy,” he said in an interview the next day. “I wanted to be a bad teenager. I remember listening to rock ’n’ roll secretly and smoking. Anything that was juvenile delinquent, that’s what I wanted to be.”

His fondest memory was Backwards Day, when campers eat dinner for breakfast and wear clothing backward. “It was the first surreal moment in my life,” he said, formative enough that it inspired a sequence in his 1977 film, “Desperate Living.”

There was another special guest on Friday night: Mink Stole, part of Mr. Waters’s ensemble of misfit collaborators from Baltimore known as the Dreamlanders, including Edith Massey, Mary Vivian Pearce and the drag queen Divine , who famously ate dog feces in the final scene of “Pink Flamingos.”

Ms. Stole led everyone down to the boathouse for karaoke, where a guy stripped naked singing “Mack the Knife.” This was after Mr. Waters had read everyone a bedtime story (a particularly gruesome chapter from his 2014 book, “Carsick,” about hitchhiking across America ) and promised, “I’ll be back here for the mandatory tick inspection.”

Saturday morning began with a 9:30 flag ceremony, where beer was served and an oversize bra was hoisted up the flagpole. From the lawn you could see the shimmering waterfront, framed by pine trees, log cabins and Adirondack chairs. “What’s the nudity policy?” someone asked over breakfast.

By midmorning, the volleyball courts and climbing wall were empty, but Bloody Mary Bingo was overflowing with people and drinks. (“We’re indoor kids,” one camper said.) Among the players was Randy Harrison, best known as Justin Taylor from the Showtime series “ Queer as Folk.” He had come to Camp John Waters with his friend Jakey Hicks, a wig maker for Cirque du Soleil. “It sounded like the craziest thing I’ve ever heard of,” he said.

Nearby was Josh McCullough, who runs a Tumblr page called Trashy Travels , on which he documents locations from John Waters movies. The day before, he had made his 10th trip to Baltimore and finally found the house from “Serial Mom” where Kathleen Turner’s character beats a woman to death with a leg of lamb.

After a drag lunch, some campers gathered on the lawn for color war, while others joined the Baltimore Bar Hike, turning the archery range into a makeshift pub. At the arts and crafts table, projects included enemy bracelets and satanic Christmas ornaments.

Outside her tent, Dominique Maciejka, who owns a vintage-clothing store on Long Island, had set up a pop-up shop for those who forgot to pack their polyester onesies. “We have lace masks, rainbow suspenders, bow ties, sunglasses,” she said. “We have kaleidoscope crystal glasses, which are fun because they make you feel like you’re on drugs, even if you’re not.”

At 5 p.m., Mr. Waters held court at the central lodge for a three-hour meet-and-greet. Stationed at a table below crisscrossed canoe paddles, he signed everything from books to plastic dog feces.

As promised, Alastair McQueen brought a portrait of Mr. Waters painted with his genitalia, then asked for an autograph. “I can initial it,” Mr. Waters said, borrowing a line from Truman Capote.

Mr. Waters took pride in his outré fan base. “They’re people who still like to cause trouble, but are happy,” he said. “They don’t even fit in their own minority, like gay people who don’t get along with other gay people, or punks that are too weird for other punks.”

As the sun set over the lake, the campers gathered at the boathouse for a costume contest, judged by Mr. Waters.

There were multiple Tracy Turnblads (the zaftig heroine of “Hairspray”), in headbands and roach-print dresses. A few people came as Johnny Depp from “Cry-Baby,” with gelled hair and biker jackets. (It’s the easiest thing for lesbians to pull off, one woman said.) One guy was dressed as an Odorama scratch-and-sniff card from “Polyester.”

The boathouse had been decorated as the 1960s dance-off show from “Hairspray.” As Mr. Waters looked on, contestants walked the stage and introduced themselves. (“Hi, I’m Jerry, and I’m the pervert from ‘Desperate Living.’”)

Cat McCarthy , a burlesque dancer from Buffalo, came as Babs Johnson, Divine’s trashy character from “Pink Flamingos.” Onstage, she raised a toy puppy above her mouth and squeezed peanut butter from its bowels. She was the first runner-up.

The winner (“because she looked the most like her,” Mr. Waters said) was Hannah Abelow, an artist and prop designer from Providence, R.I. She had come as Edith Massey’s character from “Female Trouble,” complete with feathered sleeves, blacked-out teeth and a hook hand.

Some campers stayed to dance, while others went out to the fire pit to toast marshmallows under the stars. Mr. Waters slipped out the back door and stood beneath the pines, elated. “It’s like Jonestown, but with a happy ending,” he said.

Sunday was quiet, even wistful. Ms. McCarthy, still reveling in her second-place finish, taught an impromptu burlesque class on the basketball court. “Love your skin!” she instructed the students, having stripped down to panties and pasties and smeared herself with peanut butter.

A fellow camper approached her and said, “You are the filthiest person here.”

“Thank you!” she said, beaming.

The Iran deal and Nafta are bellwether cases.","Mr. Trump’s advisers characterize that as the more pragmatic side of a businessman who takes maximalist positions in part to set the stage for negotiations but does not necessarily intend to go as far as he might give the impression. His critics said that the partial steps were still destructive, and that the president was effectively leaving initiatives like health care and the Iran deal wounded on the battlefield without allowing ambulances onto the scene.

A question for the president is whether partial actions will satisfy supporters demanding a full repudiation of the Obama era. Mr. Trump promised to deal with such issues in some cases within his first days in office but has found that Washington resists quick action. Frustrated by Congress, he is increasingly turning to executive power and can point to the moves he has made as signs of his commitment to fulfilling his promises.

“The gap between President Trump’s ambitious promises and actual policies is large and growing,” said William C. Inboden, a White House aide under President George W. Bush and now executive director of the William P. Clements Jr. Center on History, Strategy and Statecraft at the University of Texas. “This is weakening the institution of the presidency itself, which becomes diminished when presidents over promise and under deliver, or when responsibilities normally handled by the president become habitually shirked to Congress or other nations.”

A cautionary tale is Mr. Obama himself, who made lofty and ambitious heal-the-planet, close-Guantánamo promises only to fall short in some instances, to the disappointment of his liberal supporters. The difference is that Mr. Trump often gives the impression with his public comments that he has gone further than he actually has.

“It’s classic Trump: bluff and bombast substituting for actual deeds,” said Jacob Heilbrunn, editor of The National Interest, a foreign policy magazine. “He’s the political equivalent of the Washington Nationals — a choke artist at critical moments.”

Mr. Trump pronounced himself happy with the approach he is taking on health care, which has been the most consuming domestic issue of his presidency so far. “We’re going a little different route,” he told an audience of religious conservatives on Friday. “But you know what? In the end, it’s going to be just as effective, and maybe it’ll even be better.”

Later in the day, he acknowledged that his new strategy on Iran would not actually scrap the nuclear deal but would allow Congress to come up with an alternative. Asked why he did not simply terminate the agreement, he said: “I may very well do that. But I like a two-step process much better.”

Democrats said Mr. Trump’s actions were meant to sabotage the health care program and undermine the Iran deal even without full repeal. By cutting subsidies to insurance companies, “it’s clear the president is trying to sabotage the health care market and send costs soaring,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland denounced what he called “the president’s reckless, political decision and his subsequent threat to Congress” on the Iran agreement.

Mr. Trump has taken partial steps on other campaign promises as well. He signed an order scrapping his predecessor’s program granting legal status to as many as 800,000 younger immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, but delayed the final effect for six months to give Congress a chance to restore it on a more solid legal foundation. Even then, he suggested that he would find another way to preserve the program if Congress did not meet his deadline.

He has boasted that he was reversing Mr. Obama’s diplomatic opening to Cuba. But while he has pulled out many diplomats and restored some restrictions on contacts with the island, he has not cut off relations again, closed the embassy or shut down travel and other interactions. He has talked about throwing out Nafta, but has actually left it intact and has taken the route of negotiating to see if it can be retained with improved provisions.

“I am not surprised because Donald Trump is not an ideologue, he’s a realist and a pragmatist,” said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of the president’s. “During the campaign, he staked out some very strong positions maybe as a negotiating start point, or in other cases they were based on the facts he had at the time.”

“Trump is actually very open to feedback and criticism on his ideas,” Mr. Ruddy said. “Based on that he can easily adjust and change course.”

Clifford Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, said the president seemed to be trying to translate business negotiations to the political world. “Trump’s clearly got a theory of deal-making — demand the world, take the most you can, and then brag about it,” he said. “It’s actually a pretty good tack that’s often underestimated. But the bottom line, so far in his presidency, is that he’s been unable to deliver on overstated goals.”

In the end, he may wind up taking the more sweeping actions — he may yet pull the United States out of Nafta or the Iran deal. He may yet let the program for younger immigrants expire early next year. He has repeatedly talked about “letting Obamacare fail,” which his latest steps may accelerate.

“There is now a new and scary spring in his step,” Mr. Kupchan said. “He could be entering a new phase involving fuller takedowns of agreements and institutions. The Iran deal and Nafta are bellwether cases. What’s really interesting is that he fired his chief revolutionary, Steve Bannon, but seems on the verge of taking on that role himself.”",Promise the Moon? Easy for Trump.

The uncertainty is gone now. But the conservative planning of the insurance industry means that many insurers can afford to keep offering insurance, even after the president cuts off the funding. Plans that priced for the threat will take a small haircut this year, but they can still make money, even without the payments, next year.

The Congressional Budget Office offered an estimate about what would happen if the president stopped making the payments, and it’s instructive. It estimated that, in the short term, the decision would cause instability: One million additional people would become uninsured in 2018, prices for insurance would rise by 20 to 25 percent, and insurers would drop out of some parts of the country.

But, in the long run, the budget office thought that health plans and state insurance regulators would hack their way around the problem, resulting in an uninsured rate that would be even lower than it is under current law. The catch: It would end up costing the government more money in subsidies that help lower-income people pay their premiums, about $6 billion this year and $26 billion by the end of a decade.

Some of that hacking has begun. In California, insurers have been instructed to impose a surcharge on just one type of plan to cover their lost subsidy payments. That arrangement means that some customers will pay a higher price, but no insurance company will lose its shirt.

In other states, things are more unsettled, because insurers and regulators didn’t price ahead. In those places, the consequences of the president’s decision will be felt unevenly, with some state markets proceeding as planned, and others making last-minute exits or other adjustments. Insurers have already signed final contracts with the government for next year, though they have an out if the subsidies go unpaid.

Congress can also act. The president is able to eliminate the subsidies because of the ambiguity in the language of the health law. If lawmakers vote that the subsidies should be paid, either for the coming year or indefinitely, the president will need to begin paying them again. Bipartisan negotiations in the Senate committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions this summer had focused on just such legislation, though they got derailed in a recent effort to pass a Republican bill to replace parts of Obamacare with block grants.

The bipartisan talks could resume, though passage of cost-sharing payments would require Republican support, and many G.O.P. lawmakers view them, as the president does, as a “bailout of insurance companies.” An unusually broad alliance of interests has urged Congress to appropriate the money, signaling just how disruptive their loss could be. A letter drafted in September was signed not just by health insurers, doctors, and hospitals, but also by the Chamber of Commerce.

Eliminating cost-sharing subsidies is not the only thing the president did Thursday, however. He also signed an executive order devised to help more customers exit Obamacare’s markets in search of less regulated insurance options. And Thursday’s actions follow a string of smaller policy choices that are likely to reduce Obamacare sign-ups. (My colleague Haeyoun Park has been keeping a helpful list of them here.) Taken together, the actions send a strong signal to insurance companies about the administration’s approach to the future of the Obamacare marketplaces. That message may prove as powerful as any strict loss calculation.",Trump Is Trying to Gut Obamacare.
