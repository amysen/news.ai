In fact, the owner of the pet rats, an 18-year-old, had gotten sick in December 2016 with an ""unspecified viral illness,"" the researchers said.

The Seoul virusThe Seoul virus infects brown Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), which are found worldwide, according to the report.
Indeed, the Seoul virus is less severe than another form of the hantavirus, called the Sin Nombre virus, according to the CDC.","A mother and her daughter in Tennessee were infected with a virus rarely seen in the United States, and the culprit seems to be pet rats.

The two women tested positive for the Seoul virus, according to a new report, published today (Oct. 12) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Seoul virus is part of the Hantavirus family, a group of viruses that typically infect rodents.

The CDC reported in January that there was an outbreak of the virus among rat breeders and owners in Illinois and Wisconsin; that same month, the Tennessee Department of Health was notified of an individual with pet rats from one of the Illinois breeders with infected rats, according to the new report.

In fact, the owner of the pet rats, an 18-year-old, had gotten sick in December 2016 with an ""unspecified viral illness,"" the researchers said. She recovered fully from the virus without treatment. A test on a preserved sample of her blood that had been drawn when she was sick revealed that she had been infected with the Seoul virus.

The teenager didn't let health officials test her pet rats for the virus, but the officials presumed that the rodents also had the virus. As such, the officials recommended that the rats be euthanized. Once again, the teen refused. In response, the Tennessee Department of Health prohibited the teen from removing the rats from her home, essentially quarantining the pets. In addition, they educated the teen and her family about the best ways to avoid infection, which include avoiding contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva and nesting material, according to the report.

But in April, the teen's 38-year-old mother got sick, too. She went to the emergency room with symptoms including a very high fever of 104.5 degrees Fahrenheit (40.3 degrees Celsius), shortness of breath, fatigue and lack of appetite, the report said. A blood test revealed that she had the Seoul virus. The mother told doctors that she had cleaned up rodent droppings from a bathtub about three weeks before she got sick.

The Seoul virus

The Seoul virus infects brown Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), which are found worldwide, according to the report. The virus can spread easily between rats, and can also be passed from rats to humans, according to the CDC. As of January, 17 confirmed cases of the Seoul virus in people in the U.S. have been linked to rats from breeders in Illinois, the report said.

However, the virus cannot spread from human to human, according to the CDC.

Severe infections with the Seoul virus can cause a disease called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which includes symptoms such as internal bleeding and kidney problems, the CDC says. Most people who are infected with the Seoul virus, however, experience mild or even no symptoms, and the death rate for the disease is approximately 1 or 2 percent, the CDC says.

Indeed, the Seoul virus is less severe than another form of the hantavirus, called the Sin Nombre virus, according to the CDC. The Sin Nombre virus is spread by the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), and it causes a condition called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. These infections can cause severe breathing difficulties that require hospitalization, and the death rate for the disease is about 38 percent, the CDC says.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts.
And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

By now, Weinstein has been accused of everything from sexual harassment to rape and then decades of coercion and intimidation to hide his alleged actions. Collateral damage has rippled through the company he helped build and into the rest of Hollywood – even hitting other celebrities like Ben Affleck, who was forced to apologize for groping a woman several years ago.

An enormous number of Hollywood celebrities have claimed they were sexually harassed by Weinstein or others in power. Even actors Terry Crews and James Van Der Beek complained about harassment.

The Weinstein chaos was set in motion by the excellent work of New York Times writers Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey.

Unfortunately, the revelations about Weinstein also exposed both Hollywood corruption and news media cooperation that has lasted many years. They showed the lengths that Hollywood PR people and the media have gone to hide bad or compromising stories about Weinstein over the years.

NBC led the pack, but even late-night comics were reluctant to call Weinstein out. And even The Washington Post had zero print coverage the day after the scandal broke. Former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer gleefully criticized the paper for this failure.

The media tolerance of or complicity in Weinstein’s mistreatment of women calls to mind how many thousands of times journalists have used the term “war on women” against Republicans. In fact, GQ is still using that term against the GOP. Shockingly, in a story that mentions Weinstein.

To be blunt, there are too many media fails this week to hit them all. So let’s hit the high (or low) points.

● For all that Kantor and Twohey deserve credit for by exposing the dark side of Hollywood, their own paper choked when it had the chance to report the story 13 years ago. Former Times reporter Sharon Waxman wrote a story in The Wrap headlined: ""Harvey Weinstein’s Media Enablers’? The New York Times Is One of Them.” Waxman wrote that she investigated “oft-repeated allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein” in 2004. She said that she learned that the head of Weinstein’s film studio in Italy “had no film experience and his real job was to take care of Weinstein’s women needs, among other things.” Waxman wrote that she “also tracked down a woman in London who had been paid off after an unwanted sexual encounter with Weinstein.” However, Waxman said “the story I reported never ran” because of “intense pressure from Weinstein.”

● NBC certainly humiliated itself. NBC News correspondent Ronan Farrow couldn’t even get the network where he worked to run the story. CNN anchor Jake Tapper called out NBC’s “media complicity.” Farrow had to take his report to The New Yorker to get it published. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow told him in an on-air interview, “NBC says that the story wasn’t publishable.” Farrow proved the network wrong.

● NBC failed at every level. Its newscast ignored the story. Its news department squelched it. NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” the network’s anchor comedy show, didn’t even make one joke about Weinstein. The Huffington Post skewered NBC and deservedly so. ""Becoming more and more clear that what happened at NBC is straight-up journalistic malpractice,"" it wrote, adding an awesome illustration of a chicken with the network’s famous peacock feathers. NBC’s “Today” co-host Matt Lauer shockingly gave the network credit, saying Farrow had “been working this story for a long time, both for NBC News and The New Yorker.”

● Actress Rose McGowan, named in the original Times piece, has now come out and said that Weinstein, “raped me.” Just hours before that, she had bashed Weinstein favorite actor Ben Affleck for allegedly lying about what he knew about Weinstein. Twitter actually suspended her account, though Twitter claimed it was because she tweeted a phone number. McGowan, who reportedly had a settlement with Weinstein, seemed to be enjoying a measure of justice despite the bizarre suspension.

● All three broadcast networks reported in 2015 that Weinstein had been accused of groping an Italian model. Then they promptly forgot it and spent two years treating Weinstein like it never happened. This included NBC “Today” co-host Kathie Lee Gifford telling on air how she became friends with Weinstein. Both ABC and NBC reported how first daughter Malia Obama landed an internship with the mogul. Neither network mentioned the allegations against him. But I suppose the Obamas are still perfect parents even though they let an accused sex harasser give an internship to their daughter.

2. NFL Can’t Stand Getting The Knee From Trump: The NFL and its players union both look like the pathetic Cleveland Browns against Trump’s anti-protest air attack. Ever since Trump sacked the protesting players and said they should be fired, the protesters have been fired up.

Only so have the fans and they outnumber the players thousands to one. This week found protest ally ESPN abandoning one of its own star players – Jemele Hill. The “SportsCenter” anchor had touched off a furor by calling Trump a “white supremacist.” ESPN didn’t even suspend her for that.

This week she commented on how Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones vowed to bench protesting players. “If you feel strongly about JJ's statement, boycott his advertisers,” she tweeted. Calling the president a “white supremacist” was OK to ESPN. But messing with advertisers was a bridge too far. The network suspended her for two weeks, annoying the social justice community. Another ESPN staffer, Michael Wilbon, called Jones’ attitude a “plantation mentality.”

That was only part of the league’s problem this week. Vice President Mike Pence attended a Colts game and walked out after the player protest. That set more media tongues wagging, especially at MSNBC. The “Morning Joe” team was all set to be annoyed and host Joe Scarborough called Pence’s actions, an “abuse of power!” NBC’s Kate Snow criticized it as another “divisive issue” for the Trump administration.

The result of this continued bad PR is the league making a new rule that says players should stand for the anthem. Both owners and the players association are planning to meet to come up with a strategy to keep from further harming their sport. And the broadcast networks are doing their part to hide the NFL’s collapse on the field. They gave 10 times more coverage to the reaction to Trump’s initial criticism of the league than the announcement that the NFL appears to be backing down.

3. The Media And the Giant Impeach: What do comedian Amy Schumer, Democrat mega-donor Tom Steyer and Washington Post Republican Jen Rubin have in common? All three were pushing some form of removing the president – either by impeachment or a 25th Amendment remedy.

And, because it’s anti-Trump, many in the media swallowed the argument to make the president look bad. Schumer urged Instagram followers to push “#25thamendment” for several reasons, including, “because we don’t want WW3 on our ovaries.” (That sounds painful.) Billionaire eco-nut Steyer sent a letter to top Democrats making it clear the 2018 election will be about Trump’s impeachment. And, while Rubin said she’s been against using the 25th Amendment, she sure opened the door to it in a column headlined: “When do we reach 25th Amendment territory?”

The “news” channels ate it up. MSNBC's Chris Matthews and CNN’s Wolf Blitzer were just two of the TV talking heads to talk about removing Trump from office. Matthews naturally blamed the GOP’s “unbelievable cowardice” for the idea not moving faster.

The 25th Amendment gives the Cabinet that power of removal if the president is unable to perform his duties. Liberals, who talked impeachment before Trump even took office, now see this as the latest in a long series of anti-Trump strategies.

4. Playing Nuclear Football: Nuclear weapons launched another media feeding frenzy this week, enough to make even diehard conservatives fondly remember the “No nukes” movement.

NBC fired the first shot, saying “Trump Wanted Tenfold Increase in Nuclear Arsenal, Surprising Military.” Trump called out the network as “Fake @NBCNews” in a tweet response that also compared NBC to CNN. Trump followed with an attack that freaked out the media world, asking, “at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License?”

The result was more media mania, led by the Lord of Lies Brian Williams, claiming the U.S. was “the only nation on Earth to have set off nuclear weapons in anger.” Williams, who has manufactured enough of his own history, has now graduated into manufacturing U.S. history.

For all that liberals lament America’s use of the nuclear weapons, those two nukes ended a drawn-out and deadly war and set Japan on a path to become a free nation and saved American lives. That’s not an act of anger, it’s one of practicality.

New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof went nuclear on “Morning Joe,” aka Resistance HQ, and proceeded to contradict himself in dangerous ways. On one hand, he painted a picture of a terrifyingly dangerous North Korea: “Everywhere you go in Pyongyang, the capital, there are posters showing missiles striking the U.S. Capitol.” On the other, he depicted a nation the U.S. can’t stop from expanding its nuclear capacity and ability to strike the U.S. “I came back really feeling that we are not gonna be able to stop them,” he said.

Nowhere did he mention that the U.S. has followed his strategy of endless talk and that has gotten us in the fix we are in now. Kristof’s employer was so concerned that it ran an editorial calling for Congress to take away the president’s ability to use nuclear weapons in a first strike, effectively neutering America’s defense, As the anti-Trump paper put it: “He could unleash the apocalyptic force of the American nuclear arsenal by his word alone, and within minutes.” So could Obama, yet somehow no one in the media cared.

Hurray For Hollywood: While Tinseltown celebs like Julianne Moore are calling for new gun regulations, it’s important to see the entertainment industry for what it is – hypocritical. The week of the Las Vegas attack, four of the top five movies in the U.S. were incredibly violent – with more than 200 incidents of gun violence, along with another 377 incidents of other types of violence. Two of the movies – “American Assassin” and “Kingsman: Golden Circle” – assaulted the senses with so much bloodshed that it is challenging to tally all the violence. And automatic weapons that were part of the Vegas massacre figured prominently in three of the four films.

Nearly forgotten rapper Eminem (No, not these guys) is back and desperate to be relevant by being faux edgy – attacking Trump like almost every other media figure on Earth. He bashed Trump with rhymes so embarrassingly silly that he would lose “Epic Rap Battles of History” to J.R.R. Tolkien. Along with calling Trump “orange,” he gave the obligatory four-letter word salute to Trump fans.","Week’s top media fails: Weinstein scandal; NFL gets the knee from Trump + ESPN, Eminem and more",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/week-s-top-media-fails-weinstein-scandal-nfl-gets-knee-from-trump-espn-eminem-and-more.html

As a resident of Southern California, more specifically, Anaheim Hills, the term has recently taken on a different meaning.

Earlier this week, my wife and I were given 30 minutes to evacuate our home of 12 years. To make matters more complicated, I was en route to the airport when I received the text from my wife asking, ""What do you want me to pack in the car? I have to leave in minutes.""

My mind raced trying to determine what was important and irreplaceable. All I could think of was family photos and the flag that draped my dad's coffin at Arlington National Cemetery. In the midst of the chaos and disbelief, our friends and neighbors rallied to assist us in our time of need.

My thoughts shifted and I began reflecting on the chaos, both natural and man-made, that has affected our nation in recent days. I began to wonder if I had become numb to all the tragedy. I don't even have time to mourn the fact that we had to evacuate our home.

The next day, I found myself sitting in another airport trying to process everything that had happened in the past 24 hours. At first I reflected on our kind neighbors and how even in the worst of times we can see the good in humanity and love of God. Then my thoughts shifted and I began reflecting on the chaos, both natural and man-made, that has affected our nation in recent days. I began to wonder if I had become numb to all the tragedy. I don't even have time to mourn the fact that we had to evacuate our home.

Thinking about all of this, I found myself asking, “Where is God?” As a nation, we are facing an increase in lawlessness and what appears to me, an unusual number of natural disasters.

It’s a natural human response to ask questions for things we can’t understand or process. I get it; moral evil can be explained by the free will of man but much of the things we face (cancer, death, hurricanes and fires) are not a result of our free will. So where do I go from here? Either God or nature (which He created) must cause these physical evils. But these things seem incompatible with an all-loving, all-powerful God.

I'm left with what I call a ""divine tension."" I affirm the greatness of God and yet, at the same time wonder as the condition of the world.

C. S. Lewis captured my tension when he wrote, “God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but [God] shouts in our pain: it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.”

I admit I hear God better in the struggle than I do in its absence. Tears, heartbreak, loneliness and hurt all add to my humanity and character.

Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense.","In many parts of the world, if you are born poor you will almost certainly stay poor for your entire life. You don’t get the chance to get a good education or go on to a well-paid career. You struggle – picking crops, mopping floors, mowing lawns, waiting on tables, or in other low-paying jobs, barely making ends meet.

But in America – known the world over as the Land of Opportunity – upward mobility is the national ideal. It doesn’t always happen, of course. But just the possibility draws immigrants from the world over to our shores – my own parents included. For most, education is the key that enables them or their children to break out of poverty and enter the middle class or go higher, as I and millions of others have been able to do.

For this reason, providing equal educational opportunity for all is vitally important – not just for students who can get college degrees that transform their lives, but for America. We need an educated workforce to keep our economy and our nation strong. We need to keep the American Dream alive.

A stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

One immigrant who achieved the American Dream and helped thousands more young people do so as well was Jack Kent Cooke. Born in Canada in 1912, he never had the chance to go to college, leaving high school during the Great Depression to help support his struggling family. He went from selling encyclopedias door to door, to leading a band, to being a runner on the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange, to working as a salesman, to managing radio stations.

Cooke kept working his way up, becoming a part-owner of radio stations, newspapers and a magazine, and then buying a minor league baseball team in Toronto and other businesses. He immigrated to the United States in 1960 and became an even more successful businessman and owner of sports teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Kings and the Washington Redskins.

The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which I now head as executive director, has awarded $175 million in scholarships to more than 2,300 high-achieving, low-income students from 8th grade through graduate school, along with comprehensive counseling and other support services. The foundation has also provided over $97 million in grants to organizations that serve such students.

Every year, the Cooke Foundation finds absolutely brilliant students who have overcome incredible obstacles and gives them scholarships. Some of our Cooke Scholars have been homeless, have gone hungry, have been undocumented, have suffered from serious illnesses, have been kicked out of their homes after announcing they were LGBT, have been teenage parents, and have faced other big challenges.

Yet Cooke Scholars have graduated with distinction from some of the top colleges and universities in the world. Some have become physicians, created nonprofit organizations to help others in need, become medical researchers working to prevent and cure diseases, launched successful businesses, become professors, started charter schools, written books, and taken on many other important rules. How sad it would have been if they never had the chance to get a college education and instead spent their lives in dead-end jobs.

Yet a stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

What’s lacking isn’t brainpower among those with low incomes. What’s lacking is the opportunity to get a higher education and the money to pay for it.

Bruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West’s Mallory Square as a “reclamation party” got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.

“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”

The legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.

Harris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”

Residents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.

By Felicia Schwartz, The Wall Street Journal



WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is expected to announce on Friday that he won’t certify Iran is complying with the 2015 multinational nuclear agreement and will take Tehran to task more broadly for practices ranging from missile tests to support of violent groups, U.S. officials said.

The refusal to certify Iran’s compliance doesn’t mean the U.S. will pull out of the deal, the officials added, and Mr. Trump isn’t expected to ask Congress to re-impose economic sanctions that had been lifted as part of the agreement. But it could send the White House down a road of trying to change a deal that U.S. allies still support.

Mr. Trump, a longtime opponent of the accord negotiated under his predecessor’s administration, is expected to announce his decision in a speech in which he will also lay out plans to crack down on Iran’s missile program and its support for Hezbollah and other militant groups in the Middle East, the officials said.

Mr. Trump is also likely to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran’s elite military branch, as a terrorist organization, a step that has been the subject of internal administration debates, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

Iran vowed a “crushing” response if the U.S. takes that step.

The venue for Mr. Trump’s remarks was the subject of debate as well. Officials said they had discussed the possibility of the speech taking place in front of the unoccupied Iranian Embassy in Washington, although that plan was set aside.

Mr. Trump’s speech will mark the end of a months-long Iran policy review by the administration and begin an uncertain process under which Congress has 60 days to consider on an expedited basis reinstating sanctions that had been lifted under the terms of the nuclear accord.

You could almost hear the collective sigh of relief from America's allied capitals when President Donald Trump announced that he was kicking the Iran nuclear deal over to Congress to fix.

True to his campaign pledge, President Trump refused to certify to Congress that Iran has been complying with what he called the ""worst"" arms control deal the U.S. ever negotiated.

He also asked Congress to impose sanctions on Iran for its continued ballistic missile tests, its aggressive conduct in the region, its support for Syrian president Bashar al Assad, its support for terror and other efforts to destabilize the Middle East, and its human rights abuses.

He also added additional sanctions on members of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Ayatollah's shock troops.

Trump has bought the nuclear deal, and the pragmatists in Iran who negotiated it, some time.

Finally, he threatened to tear up the Iran nuclear deal if Congress and America's allies don't correct what he considers its unacceptable weaknesses. That's called leverage.

But he didn't shred the deal. He didn't unilaterally withdraw. ""What's done is done,"" Mr. Trump said, after denouncing the deal's many failings.

Many of the nuclear agreement's most ardent supporters -- including America's European allies and even the most rational members of his own cabinet -- feared he might not listen to reason.

They worried that while struggling to contain North Korea, a rogue state that actually has nuclear weapons and has vowed to develop long-range missiles capable of striking San Francisco, Trump would open a second nuclear front by abandoning the nuclear pact his despised predecessor, Barack Obama, so painstakingly negotiated.

But despite his dire threats and bellicose rhetoric, the president listened to the adults in the room, among them, Defense Secretary Mattis, who recently told Congress that the deal was in the nation's security interests.

He accepted political reality -- that there would be no chance of a united front against Iran, as Michael Singh, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, argued, unless Mr. Trump decided to try to strengthen the deal while remaining in it. ""This puts policy towards Iran on a much more solid footing,"" he said in an interview.

After weeks of discussions, Trump came to understand that the case for unilateral withdrawal was weak. While Trump officials have argued that Iran is violating the agreement, eight reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear programs and this pact, confirmed that Iran was adhering to its terms.

The leaders of France, England and Germany all warned of the consequences of a unilateral withdrawal by asserting their determination to abide by it.

Even many of the ostensible weaknesses the president cited in his speech Friday were misleading. For instance, though he said that the deal limits Iran's nuclear programs for too short a time, Anthony Blinken, a former senior Obama official noted that under another treaty that Iran has signed and ratified, the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, Iran is permanently barred from developing an atomic bomb. And its acceptance of intrusive inspections lasts far longer than the nuclear deal.

Clooney, who starred on the hit medical drama from 1994 to 1999, released a statement addressing Marquez’s claims, US Weekly reported.

I was an actor and only an actor. If she was told I was involved in any decision about her career then she was lied to. The fact that I couldn’t affect her career is only surpassed by the fact that I wouldn’t. “

“My official drink is finally here!!” read a message on Daly’s Instagram page, directly underneath a photo of his new John Daly’s Grip It & Rip It beverages, which come in both “Half & Half” and “Hard Tea” varieties.

Daly, a professional golfer with 18 professional wins over his 30-plus-year career, has long been infamous for his unconventional style of play, as well as his on- and off-the-course antics.

As Golf Digest notes, Daly tried launching a similar line of alcoholic beverages bearing his name in 2012, although those contained an ABV of 30 percent, and were more or less vodka-spiked lemonades.

Daly’s new drinks, on the other hand, appear to be malt beverages, according to the official website of Grip It & Sip It.

“Our unique blend of black tea and lemonade flavors hits hard, just like John Daly’s swing,” one of the descriptions reads.

“We’re taking a classic refreshment and giving it an extra kick, sort of like a mullet at a swanky country club,” reads another, a clear reference to the hairstyle Daly sometimes wore during his PGA tournaments.

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!",10 DIY Halloween decorations for all ages,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/10-diy-halloween-decorations-for-all-ages.html

Administrators at the Biloxi School District announced early this week they were pulling the novel from the 8th-grade curriculum, saying they received compaints that some of the book’s language “makes people uncomfortable.”

The Sun Herald reported that the book was pulled from the lesson plan because the novel contained “the N word.”

A message on the school's website says ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" teaches students that compassion and empathy don't depend upon race or education.

School board vice president Kenny Holloway says other books can teach the same lessons.

However, the book will still be available in Biloxi school libraries.

The novel, published in 1960, chronicled the adventures of Jean Louise Finch aka Scout and her brother Jeremy aka Jem and the racial inequality that existed in their small Alabama town. The book followed a court case their father, Atticus, was involved in.

In the story, Atticus defended Tom Robinson, a black man who was accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a young white woman. Despite strong evidence of Robinson’s innocence, he was found guilty of raping Ewell.

The book was adapted into a movie in 1962, starring Gregory Peck, who won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Atticus Finch.

The Sun Herald reported the novel was listed at No. 21 on the American Library Association’s most “banned or challenged books list in the last decade.”

The sister of Villegas’ wife, Vanessa, captured the moment Elianna opened up her present, which she described, “looked like daddy,” but the real surprise was the message.

The bear, with her father's voice, told Elianna: “Hey baby, daddy loves you and misses you so, so much and I can’t wait for you to be in my arms again. I love you very much.”

The little girl’s eyes went wide before squealing in delight, “Oh my God that’s daddy!”

Elianna gave her new soldier teddy bear a big hug.

The touching moment was posted on Twitter by Vanessa’s sister and immediately went viral Wednesday. As of Saturday, the video was retweeted more than 49,000 times and liked by more than 100,000 Twitter users.

“Everyone has been basically saying ‘Oh my gosh I’m crying’ (and) another girl was even like ‘I just put on my makeup and now it’s all over my face,'” Vanessa told KSAT.

“There’s also a lot of people on Twitter saying that they wish they had that from their dad or their mom and if they can hear their loved ones voice one more time, it would have made their entire world,” Vanessa said.

She said David was ordered to travel to South Carolina for basic training in August, leaving the family of three a few weeks to spend together before he left.

Vanessa said the deployment as hard on her daughter who has never been away from her father for this long.

Most Uncle Tims who fall under category A live on the East and West coasts.
And real men don't marry feminists.
To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims.
We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared on SuzanneVenker.com.

Have you ever made your husband a sandwich? If so, you should be ashamed of yourself. Don't you realize such behavior sets women back decades?

That's the message of a new article in The Daily Telegraph, entitled ""When making a sandwich is a crime against feminism,"" about an Australian woman named Maddie who asked a Facebook group of 26,186 mothers whether anyone had some yummy alternatives for her husband's lunches, which she said she makes for him every day.

Now that's what anyone I know would call a nice wife.

But that's not what Maddie was called on Facebook. Instead, she was told she was nothing but a “slave” and a “1950s housewife."" She was also “weird,” as no woman in her right mind would do something so demeaning as to make her husband lunch.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Here's just a sampling of some of the responses Maddie got:

“Your husband is a grown up, and you’re not his mother!”

“My husband can make his own damn lunch.”

""I make my husband the same thing he makes me. Nothing!!”

“Stuff that, hubby is a grown man. I already do his laundry and keep his children alive.”

“Our advice is to stop making his lunches.”

“My role is childcare during working hours and that’s it.”

“He’s lucky if I decide to make dinner some nights.""

That, my friends, is what feminists brought to America in the 1970s.

And it stuck.

The idea that a wife would—or God forbid, should—do anything for her husband with no expectation for anything in return—just to be nice, because, as Maddie put it, she ""loves her man"" and they ""can't afford to eat out""— makes her weak.

Honestly, is it really any wonder why the relationship between the sexes is such a mess today? Or why, as Bloomberg published just last week, married Americans are unhappier than ever? In my opinion, it is largely because there are so many women in America today who, either knowingly or unknowingly, have a feminist mind.

Feminists teach women, above all else, to stand up for themselves against the evil men of the world. Even harmless husbands fall into the category of 'evil men' since they supposedly long to lord over their wives. Thus, the knee-jerk reaction to the suggestion that a wife might serve her husband in some way—make him a drink or a meal—is to become defensive. Yet, if we turn the scenario around, if a husband were to serve his wife in any way, well, that's acceptable.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Of course, there are men who support feminists. My friend Helen Smith, Ph.D., refers to these type of men as ""Uncle Tims"" in her book ""Men on Strike."" An Uncle Tim is a male sellout who kowtows to feminists because he's (a) just as left-wing as they are and thus agrees with the feminist worldview, or (b) too weak to stand up for himself and knows that if he says anything he's not suppose to, he won't get sex.

Most Uncle Tims who fall under category A live on the East and West coasts. Those who fall under category B can live anywhere, but the one area of the country they're scarce is in the South and the Midwest. Because that's where the real men live.

And real men don't marry feminists.

The men who do have been feminized and are proud of not being ""the man of the house."" They see that as backwards and take pride in their progressive, non manly ways. Of course, don't expect an Uncle Tim to kill the intruder in the house on his wife's behalf—he's given up the role of provider and protector. He and his wife are equals!

Unfortunately, the Uncle Tims are often the ones who lose in the end because all too often feminist wives regret their choice to make their marriages androgynous—and the men who give up their manhood, because they thought that's what women and society wanted—are left in the dust.

To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims. We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook. A fantastic example is Chad Prather, aka Political Cowboy—who, not coincidentally, is from Texas. Check out his very funny (and very true) video on gender INequality!

Now there's a real man.

And I'd bet my life savings his wife isn't a feminist.",Are you weak if you make your man a sandwich? This is why real men don’t marry feminists,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/are-weak-if-make-your-man-sandwich-this-is-why-real-men-don-t-marry-feminists.html

Maj. Gen. Joseph Harrington, who heads U.S. Army Africa, was removed from his job due to a loss in confidence in his ability to command, the Army said in a statement.

He is the latest in a string of senior Army officials who have been disciplined for bad behavior, triggering the development of new programs aimed at shaping stronger, more ethical leaders.

A spokesman for the Army said Harrington is under investigation for sending the messages to the wife of a soldier who resides on the same base in Vincenza, Italy. Harrington, who is also married, was suspended from his post on Sept. 1, but had stayed in Italy.

The flirty Facebook messages include Harrington's referring to the woman as a ""HOTTIE,"" inquiring about the whereabouts of the woman's husband and asking her to delete the messages, USA Today reported.

Army Col. Patrick Seiber said Harrington will remain in the Army but will be reassigned to the Pentagon.

Earlier this year, the Army began putting together a number of new mental health, counseling and career management programs in order to boost professionalism within the officer corps and get at what may be the root causes of the behavior problems.

Gen. Mark Milley, the Army's chief of staff, told The Associated Press last month that, ""we recognized senior executive leaders, with varying amounts of stress, lacked a holistic program that focuses on comprehensive health."" He said the military has strived to combat stress disorders, suicide and other problems, but often put the focus on enlisted troops or lower-ranking officers. A new emphasis must be placed on senior leaders, he said.

“Why don’t they talk about it? Because he’s powerful. Because they’re scared … I mean, who are the women that he preyed on and preys on?

BBC World News presenter Stephen Sackur asked Fonda why she chose not to speak out.

“Well, it didn’t happen to me …” she said.

“I didn’t want to expose and I will admit that I should have been braver. And I think from now on I will be when I hear such stories,” she continued.

“Thank God it’s being talked about. This is hardly unique in Hollywood. It’s very, very common, just as it is in every country of the world, in every aspect ... in business, in government.

Actresses Angelina Jolie, Ashley Judd and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the women who have spoken publicly about alleged incidents involving Weinstein.

Here's what he has been accused of, based on recent reports.

Thursday, October 5

An Oct. 5 expose from The New York Times detailed Weinstein's alleged misconduct -- and said that the Hollywood titan has made eight settlements with women.

“Scream” actress Rose McGowan was paid a $100,000 settlement from Weinstein in 1997 following a hotel room incident, The Times reported. The settlement wasn't an admission of guilt, the paper described a legal document as saying.

The Times report also detailed how Weinstein, while in a bathrobe in his hotel room, had asked if he could give actress Ashley Judd a massage or if the star could watch him take a shower.

""How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?"" Judd told the newspaper she recalled thinking.

Former employees told The Times that an unnamed Miramax employee left the company not long after an alleged incident involving the producer. The employees said that the woman received a settlement.

In 1998, Zelda Perkins, a former production assistant with Miramax, allegedly confronted Weinstein, and told him to stop his “inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms,” The New York Times reported.

Perkins, now working as a theater producer in London, was reportedly concerned for other women working in the office, and threatened Weinstein’s behavior with legal action, according to former coworkers.

The Times reported that Miramax negotiated a settlement with Perkins and her lawyer, and Perkins declined to discuss what happened with the newspaper.

Emily Nestor, a temporary employee of Weinstein’s, said he’d made sexual advances to her as well, promising he’d help with her career, according to the report.

Additionally, The Times reported an incident with Weinstein and an unnamed assistant, who he reportedly tried to convince to give him a massage while he stood naked in front of her at a hotel, which left her “crying and very distraught,” according to a memo by Lauren O’Connor.

In O’Connor’s 2015 memo, in which she penned several accounts of women in the company and the atmosphere Weinstein’s advances created, she recalled how Weinstein would ask her to meet with aspiring actresses after they’d have meetings with him in his hotel room.

She wrote how she felt that she was being used to build relationships with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.” O'Connor reportedly settled with Weinstein.

Laura Madden detailed to The Times how Weinstein had asked her more than once for massages at hotels and how he would constantly make her re-evaluate herself after rejecting him.

“It was so manipulative,” Madden said. “You constantly question yourself – am I the one who is the problem?”

Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, an Italian model and actress, met with Weinstein at his office in New York’s SoHo neighborhood in 2015, The Times reported. But Gutierrez reportedly called the police hours later saying Weinstein had grabbed her breasts, while asking if they were real, and put his hand up her skirt.

Charges were ultimately not filed against Weinstein, and he and Gutierrez reportedly agreed to a settlement, according to anonymous sources who spoke with The Times.

Overall, eight women detailed their alleged inappropriate interactions with Weinstein to The New York Times. The report alleges that various employees were asked to perform ""turndown duty"" for Weinstein, which included getting him ready for bed at night and also waking him up in the morning.

“I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it,"" Weinstein told The Times in a statement. ""Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.""

Rebecca Traister, a reporter for The Cut, discussed in an essay about how she encountered Weinstein while covering one of his book parties in early 2000. She claimed he screamed at her for a question she asked, calling her an obscene name.

When her boyfriend and colleague intervened and tried to get Weinstein to apologize to her, she said “Weinstein went nuclear.” He reportedly pushed her boyfriend down a set of stairs and dragged him out to the street in a headlock.

Traister said the altercation was later described as “a case of an aggressive reporter barging into a party she wasn’t invited to and asking impertinent questions.”

Friday, October 6

Fox 11’s Lauren Sivan detailed an alleged 2007 encounter with Weinstein in a HuffPost report. Sivan said that while working for local station News 12 Long Island, Weinstein cornered her in the hallway of a Manhattan restaurant closed to the public and masturbated in front of her.

Sivan said she had rejected an attempt by Weinstein to kiss her and told him she had a boyfriend. “Well, can you just stand there and shut up,” she claims he responded prior to allegedly masturbating.

“Luckily I didn't need a job or favor from him + didn't have to be polite,” Sivan tweeted Friday. “Others did. Keep that in mind.”

In another tweet, she said, “For those asking why I waited? YOU try telling that story 10yrs ago. Only possible now because of women with bigger names far braver than me.”

She later spoke about the alleged incident on Megyn Kelly’s NBC show Monday.

In a tweet which has since been deleted, “Shaun of the Dead” actress Jessica Hynes recounted an alleged incident involving Weinstein, People reported.

“I was offered a film role at 19,” the 44-year-old reportedly wrote on Twitter. She alleged that Weinstein “came on board and wanted me to screen test in a bikini. I refused & lost the job.”

Saturday, October 7

Former model Zoe Brock wrote in a blog post for Medium that in 1997, when she was 23, she was ""Harveyed."" Brock said she ""had no intention of leading"" Weinstein on, and ""felt safe in his company to be"" herself.

Weinstein allegedly tricked her into going to his hotel room, where she found herself with no phone and no cash. He appeared naked and asked her for a massage, she said, adding that she felt ""uncomfortable.""

Brock eventually, according to her blog post, got Weinstein to let her leave.

Sunday, October 8

The Wrap founder Sharon Waxman claimed in an article that while working for The New York Times in 2004, she “got the green light to look into oft-repeated allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein.”

Waxman said she was able to find the man in charge of Miramax Italy. Citing “multiple accounts,” she alleged that “his real job was to take care of Weinstein’s women needs, among other things.”

Waxman claimed she was able to find “a woman in London who had been paid off after an unwanted sexual encounter with Weinstein,” she recalled in her piece.

However, Waxman alleged that there had been “intense pressure from Weinstein,” with the article “gutted.”

“The story was stripped of any reference to sexual favors or coercion and buried on the inside of the Culture section, an obscure story about Miramax firing an Italian executive,” she wrote.

“Our former colleague Sharon Waxman wrote about a story that was published in The Times in 2004,” a Times spokesperson told Fox News. “No one currently at The Times has knowledge of editorial decisions made on that story. But in general the only reason a story or specific information would be held is if it did not meet our standards for publication.”

British writer Liza Campbell alleged in an essay published in The Sunday Times of London that Weinstein suggested she take a bath with him at a hotel. Weinstein had earlier ""offered me freelance script-reading for Miramax,"" she wrote.

""Soon I was sent the script of Shakespeare in Love to summarise and critique, followed by The Usual Suspects,"" she wrote. ""And then the scripts stopped coming. I rang the Miramax offices, but nothing happened.""

She says that in a phone call with Weinstein, she told the producer that ""everything had stuttered to a halt. He said: ""You better come to my hotel and we’ll sort this out.""""

When she met him at his suite, there were initially several assistants present, but ""suddenly all the assistants vanished,"" Campbell claimed. She said they talked for several minutes before Weinstein left the room, and that she thought he'd gone to the restroom.

""I could hear him moving around and suddenly the sound of bath taps running. 'What do you say we both jump in the bath?' he hollered,"" she wrote.

Weinstein also allegedly told her, “Come on, it’ll be fun. We can drink champagne. You can soap me — whaddaya say?”

Campbell claimed to tell the producer loudly, “If you come back into this room with no clothes on I’m going to f****** lose my temper.”

She says she got out using one door, after she found that two others were locked.

A Weinstein representative told the newspaper that the producer ""will not respond to allegations about private matters in a public forum.""

Monday, October 9

Louise Godbold alleged in an essay published online Monday that ""in the early ‘90s, I too was one of the young women he preyed upon."" Godbold is an executive director for a Los Angeles nonprofit, Variety reports.

""The details of what I have learned was not unique to me are out there now – the office tour that became an occasion to trap me in an empty meeting room, the begging for a massage, his hands on my shoulders as I attempted to beat a retreat… all while not wanting to alienate the most powerful man in Hollywood,"" she wrote.

Godbold recalled ""the girlfriend who had introduced me to Harvey and was angry with me after he called her wanting to make sure I wasn’t going to make a complaint about his behavior.""

Tuesday, October 10

Ronan Farrow published a piece in The New Yorker which reported that 13 women alleged they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein.

Former aspiring actress Lucia Evans went on the record to allege Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex during a meeting.

""I tried to get away, but maybe I didn’t try hard enough,"" she told The New Yorker. ""I didn’t want to kick him or fight him.""

Actress-director Asia Argento, the daughter of famed horror filmmaker Dario Argento, claimed that when she was 21 in 1997, she was invited to what she believed was a Miramax party, but ended up in a hotel room with just Weinstein in it, the report said.

Weinstein left the room, but came back in a bathrobe and asked her for a massage, the report claimed. She ""reluctantly"" said she would before Weinstein went on to forcibly perform oral sex, the report alleged.

Argento claimed that Weinstein would contact her after the alleged assault, and that she would later have consensual relations with the movie mogul.

“I felt I had to,” Argento explained to The New Yorker regarding the initial such time. “Because I had the movie coming out and I didn’t want to anger him.”

An unnamed woman claimed to The New Yorker that Weinstein brought her to a hotel room before he changed into a bathrobe and “forced himself” on her. She reportedly thought about going to authorities, but decided not to.

She later maintained professional relations with the producer, the report said. “I was in a vulnerable position and I needed my job,” she explained.

Actress Mira Sorvino described an alleged 1995 hotel room incident with Weinstein to the publication.

""He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,"" Sorvino said. She reportedly left after saying it went against her faith to date married men.

An unnamed actress locked herself in a bathroom at a hotel so as to avoid the producer, she told The New Yorker. The actress also reportedly alleged that Weinstein masturbated in front of her.

The article also cited a 2015 audio recording made by the New York Police Department wherein Weinstein admits to groping Battilana Gutierrez, mentioned earlier in the Times piece.

The New Yorker article also described a meeting at a Beverly Hills hotel between Weinstein and Weinstein Company temp Emily Nestor, who was also mentioned in the Times report. Nestor, it said, refused his offer to be placed in his London office and be his girlfriend, and she also refused to hold his hand.

Weinstein, she alleged, told her, ""Oh, the girls always say ‘no.’ You know, ‘No, no.’ And then they have a beer or two and then they’re throwing themselves at me.""

The producer, she claimed, also allegedly said ""that he’d never had to do anything like Bill Cosby.""

""Nestor had a conversation with company officials about the matter but didn’t pursue it further: the officials said that Weinstein would be informed of anything she told them, a practice not uncommon in smaller businesses,"" Farrow wrote.

The report also described how French actress Emma de Caunes had a lunch meeting with Weinstein at a Paris hotel, and that he mentioned he had a movie adaptation of a book in the works.

Weinstein, according to the report, allegedly asked her to go with him to his room to get the book, and de Caunes answered her phone while Weinstein went into the bathroom. de Caunes recalled Weinstein later allegedly emerging from the bathroom nude with an erection.

The producer, she claims, told her to lay down on the bed. de Caunes ultimately fled the room.

Actress Rosanna Arquette and the producer were to have a dinner meeting during which she'd get a script at a hotel in Beverly Hills, and Arquette was told to go to his room, The New Yorker report said. Weinstein allegedly was wearing a bathrobe when he opened the door and claimed to need a massage.

Arquette, according to the report, said that she could give him a masseuse recommendation. During the encounter, she alleges that Weinstein tried to lead her hand to his erect penis. She turned him down.

Both Arquette and Sorvino allege that refusing Weinstein impacted their careers.

""There may have been other factors, but I definitely felt iced out and that my rejection of Harvey had something to do with it,"" Sorvino told The New Yorker.

The New Yorker article recounted an alleged incident between Weinstein and actress Jessica Barth at a Beverly Hills hotel. At his hotel room, the report described how Weinstein allegedly ""alternated between offering to cast her in a film and demanding a naked massage in bed.""

Barth refused to give him a massage and while she was leaving Weinstein offered a meeting with a female executive, according to the article.

“Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,"" Weinstein spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister told The New Yorker. ""Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.”

Actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie were among the women in a follow-up New York Times piece published Tuesday who allege Weinstein harassed them. Arquette also spoke to the newspaper.

Paltrow described Weinstein's attempt to lure her, as a then-22-year-old aspiring actress, into giving him a massage in a hotel room. The incident prompted her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt to confront Weinstein at a film premiere. The producer, according to the report, allegedly ordered Paltrow not to tell people about what happened.

Jolie also turned down Weinstein, who allegedly hit on her in a hotel room in the 1990s, the report said.

""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,” Jolie, now 42, told the Times in email. “This behavior towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable.”

The Times report also recounted a meeting between Tomi-Ann Roberts and Weinstein. Weinstein was naked in a bathrobe when she showed up, Roberts alleges. He also allegedly said her audition would be better if she got naked. She turned him down and left, according to the Times report.

Actress Katherine Kendall told the Times that she was at Weinstein's apartment when he came back from the bathroom in a bathrobe and requested a massage. Weinstein exited the room and came back naked after she said no, Kendall alleged.

Kendall claims that Weinstein chased her around the room and that he also asked her to show him her breasts, which she declined.

While in a hotel suite with Weinstein in 1996, French actress Judith Godrèche turned down his alleged request for a massage, the Times reported. She claimed Weinstein later tried ""pressing against me and pulling off my sweater."" She left the room.

Actress Dawn Dunning claims that Weinstein offered her contracts for his next three movies as long as she would have three-way sex with him, according to the Times report. She took off.

“Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,"" Hofmeister told the Times in a statement. ""Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counseling and rebuilding his life.”

A report published early Tuesday by The Guardian described how Weinstein allegedly wore just a robe during a hotel room meeting with British actress Romola Garai.

“Like every other woman in the industry, I’ve had an ‘audition’ with Harvey Weinstein, where I’d actually already had the audition but you had to be personally approved by him,” Garai told the publication. “So I had to go to his hotel room in the Savoy, and he answered the door in his bathrobe. I was only 18. I felt violated by it, it has stayed very clearly in my memory.”

“The point was that he could get a young woman to do that, that I didn’t have a choice, that it was humiliating for me and that he had the power,” the 35-year-old ""Atonement"" actress said.

Also Tuesday, former actress and screenwriter Louisette Geiss alleged that Weinstein appeared in an open bathrobe with no clothes on during a meeting at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. She claims that Weinstein asked several times that she watch him masturbate during the 2008 encounter.

Geiss made the allegations during a news conference with attorney Gloria Allred, who invited Weinstein to meet with his alleged victims in a mediation or arbitration process.

Geiss said in a statement that she is coming forward to help give voice to other alleged victims of sexual harassment. She said her experience with Weinstein led to her departure from the entertainment industry. She now works in real estate.

Actress Heather Graham said Weinstein implied she would have to sleep with him for a role in a Tuesday column for Variety.

She described a meeting with Weinstein in the early 2000s ""in which he mentioned that he had an agreement with his wife. He could sleep with whomever he wanted when he was out of town.""

""There was no explicit mention that to star in one of those films I had to sleep with him, but the subtext was there,"" she alleged.

Graham says she later skipped a meeting with Weinstein at a hotel because her actress friend who was supposed to come along said she was unable to attend.

""That was the end of that encounter — I was never hired for one of his films, and I didn’t speak up about my experience,"" she wrote. ""It wasn’t until Ashley Judd heroically shared her story a few days ago that I felt ashamed.""

Wednesday, October 11

Actress and supermodel Cara Delevingne took to Instagram to describe her encounters with Weinstein.

""When I first started to work as an actress, I was working on a film and I received a call from Harvey Weinstein asking if I had slept with any of the women I was seen out in the middle with,"" the statement said. The model said she didn't answer his questions and ""hurried off the phone.""

She also described a later incident where Weinstein asked her to come his hotel room.

""I quickly declined and asked his assistant if my car was outside,"" the statement said. ""She said it wasn't and wouldn't be for a bit and I should go to his room.""

A post shared by Cara Delevingne (@caradelevingne) on Oct 11, 2017 at 10:39am PDT

The model said she felt ""powerless"" and that in the room, there was a second woman.

""He asked us to kiss and she began some sort of advances upon his direction,"" she alleged. ""I swiftly got up and asked him if he knew that I could sing. And I began to sing....i thought it would make the situation better....more professional....like an audition....i was so nervous. After singing I said again that I had to leave. He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room.""

Actress Léa Seydoux told The Guardian that at the beginning of her career, during a conversation with Weinstein, he jumped toward her and attempted to kiss her.

“We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,” Seydoux said. “I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him.""

The ""Spectre"" actress added: “He tried more than once,” and described Weinstein as “very domineering” and “losing control.” Seydoux told the news outlet that she ""pushed him physically. I think he respected me because I resisted him.”

Actress Sarah Ann Masse described to Variety how Weinstein allegedly was in just his undergarments during her 2008 interview for a nanny position at his house in Connecticut.

“Harvey Weinstein opened the door in his boxer shorts and an undershirt. My first thought was, ‘Oh, this is weird. Maybe he forgot this interview is happening. Maybe he thought I was the mailman. I’m sure he’ll be embarrassed and excuse himself and get changed.’ But he didn’t,” she told the publication.

She claims he asked in the job interview, “You would never flirt with my friends or anyone to get ahead?” and that she told him no.

Masse claimed at the end he ""gave me this really tight, close hug that lasted for quite a long period of time. He was still in his underwear. Then he told me he loved me. I left right after that.""

Thursday, October 12

Actress Kate Beckinsale said in an Instagram post that when she was 17 years old, she was invited to meet Weinstein at a hotel.

She says she thought the meeting would happen in a conference room, but she was directed to Weinstein's room instead.

A post shared by Kate Beckinsale (@katebeckinsale) on Oct 12, 2017 at 6:02am PDT

“He opened the door in his bathrobe. I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him,"" she alleged. ""After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed.”

Weinstein, she claims, asked her a few years down the line ""if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting.""

The actress said she ""realized he couldn't remember if he had assaulted me or not.""

""I said no to him professionally many times over the years-some of which ended up with him screaming at me calling me a c*** and making threats, some of which made him laughingly tell people oh ""Kate lives to say no to me,"" she wrote.

British actress Claire Forlani also posted a statement on Twitter in which she claimed that she “escaped 5 times.”

She said there had been two night meetings at a hotel with Weinstein “and all I remember was I ducked , dived and ultimately got out of there without getting slobbered over, well just a bit. Yes massage was suggested.”

Forlani alleged there were three dinners and she recalled him listing “all the actresses who had slept with him and what he had done for them.”

Earlier in her statement, Forlani revealed Ronan Farrow had contacted her, but that she didn’t take part in The New Yorker expose.

“Today I sit here feeling some shame,” she confided.

French actress Florence Darel alleged to Le Parisien in a French-language interview that Weinstein hit on her in a hotel room in 1995 -- with his wife in the next room.

“He started to tell me that he found me very attractive and wanted to have relations with me,” Darel, now 49, said. “I told him I was very in love with my companion. He replied that didn’t bother him at all and offered to have me be his mistress a few days a year. That way we could continue to work together. Basically, it was ‘If you want to continue in America, you have to go through me.’”

Darel says she left.

English actor Sophie Dix, who was 22 in the 1990s when she met Weinstein, said her possible career path was ""massively cut down"" after an experience with the producer, according to The Guardian.

Dix said she found herself in a hotel room with Weinstein, and ""all the alarm bells starting ringing."" She was in bed with Weinstein ""tugging at her clothes,"" before she hid in the bathroom. Once she opened the door, she saw him ""standing there masturbating.""

It was then she decided not to pursue acting. ""I decided if this is what being an actress is like, I don't want it,"" Dix said.

Friday, October 13

Actress and former model Angie Everhart claimed Weinstein masturbated in front of her on a yacht more than 10 years ago, according to an interview she did with TMZ.

The incident allegedly occurred after Everhart had arrived in France for the Cannes Film Festival, she said. Feeling jetlagged, she reportedly fell asleep in one of the cabins. She later woke up to the sight of Weinstein in her room, blocking the door and masturbating, she said.

Despite him telling her not to, Everhart said she ""told everyone"" about what happened, including producers and other actors. But everyone reportedly shrugged off the situation saying, ""oh that's just Harvey.""

She said everybody knew what he was doing to women but no one said anything about it until the Times article was published on Oct. 5.

An abandoned funeral home in Rogersville, Mo., will be transformed into a haunted house for a high school fundraiser. But some of the town’s residents are crying foul – saying it’s an inappropriate and insensitive place to hold the Halloween-themed event.

The Preston-Marsh Funeral Home has been abandoned for some time and was slated to be demolished. But the owner of the building granted permission to students from Logan-Rogersville High School to use it for a haunted house fundraiser, WYMT reported.

The Logan-Rogersville High School said proceeds from the “Rogersville Horror Story” event would go to an event for the school’s seniors on graduation night. The organizers said they were going to utilize the leftover equipment left inside the funeral home as a way to enhance the spooky experience.

""I understand why people are upset. But, it is just a building,"" Christie Davis, a resident, told WYMT. ""But, the [deceased] people are no longer there. Everybody in Rogersville has had friends or family go through this funeral home. I know I have.""

""Some of us have friends that have lost their children on graduation nights in years past, and this is just a great way to prevent that from happening to somebody else,"" Davis said.

Residents took to Facebook to express their anger at the funeral home being used as a haunted house. WYMT reported some users said it was “distasteful” and “insensitive” to use “a place for grief and mourning to make a mockery of death.”

“…As for the owners of the building, I'll never purchase anything from them ever again.

But others said it was an appropriate use of the building.

: “So much sadness occurred in this building. Now, for its last service to the community it gets to bring happiness and laughter, as well as some good scares to everyone...and for a good cause. What better way to end things?”

Despite the uproar, the event was slated to go on as planned, event organizers told WYMT.

Case in point: the eternally-dirty sheet pan that always seems to have brown, burnt-on residue coating the sides.

But we don't have to resign ourselves to this fate — there's a simple two-ingredient solution that is probably already in your cupboard.

Mix ½ cup baking soda and ½ cup white vinegar with hot water in the sink. (We prefer Heinz white vinegar and Arm & Hammer baking soda, but this will work with any brands, really.) It will bubble up like a school science project, but that reaction is what helps loosen the residue. Make sure your sink is plugged so your pans stay submerged, and let it soak for 30 minutes to an hour before scrubbing away with a scouring pad, steel wool, or the scrubby side of your sponge. Although steel wool is most likely to scratch your pans, it's OK — you want them to look well-worn and used, but scrub in even circular motions to make the lines less noticeable. That elbow grease your parents always like to go on and on about? Yeah, time to use it.

After the scrub-down, wash with regular soap and water to finishing cleaning, and then dry immediately to prevent rust. This process is also a twofer: It helps clean out your drain — which you definitely don't clean enough — with the combo of baking soda and vinegar. It's all very easy, but remember to rock dishwashing gloves during this process to save your hands from getting all scratched up by the rough scrubber.

I had a sheet pan that I tried cleaning vigorously with my tried-and-true Scrub Daddy sponge at least half a dozen times, but the corners still had mysterious residue lingering around. So I made a soft of bath bomb for my pan, let it soak overnight — because I fell asleep and forgot about it, honestly; an hour probably would have probably been fine — and went to town on it with steel wool. I was hoping for an arm workout, but it was surprisingly easy. The brown stuff came off in a few seconds per scrub, and it wasn't noticeably scratched because most my cleaning was in the corners. I believe in miracles.

Vinegar isn't only for cleaning sheet pans. If there's a similar coating around the edge of a stainless steel sauté pan, boil a few cups of water with ½ cup vinegar for a few minutes, pour out, and wash as usual. We all know not to use steel wool on a Dutch Oven, so this is also a great way to clean it without scratching the precious enameled surface. If this doesn't work, Bar Keepers Friend powder is a good bet. It's powerful, yet gentle on your precious Le Creuset. You can sprinkle some powder directly on a scouring pad or sponge, wet it, and wash in circles.

Once you get 'em clean and looking (almost) as good as new, you'll want to maintain that shiny surface.

However, Lt. Howard Black told Fox News on Wednesday that it’s “absurd” that anyone would be discouraged from calling the department about a story and an incident.

Brianna, meanwhile, was still unsure of her husband's fate. ""After two weeks of living in a hospital, wondering if he would survive or be taken from us, [the family] made our way back home. The time had come for me to deliver our baby.”

Austin was still in the hospital when Brianna delivered their baby, but she said that “a beautiful miracle happened as I delivered our son. Austin woke up.”

“I went about a week without seeing him. I thought about him every day. I cried as I looked at my child who looked just like his daddy. When the baby was only a week old, I left him with my in-laws. I knew I needed to see Austin. I needed to tell him that our baby was here,” she said.

In her final paragraph on Facebook, Brianna wrote:

“Our life isn't normal. There are doctors visits and hospital trips- so many that I loose[sic] count. But we are here. Fighting. I wake up every day to take care of our beautiful little boy and my husband. I prepare the meals, do physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. I help him with personal hygiene. I help him walk. I help him with every aspect of his life. And in between these tasks I take care of our very busy eight month old. It is hard, and I am tired, but we make the most of it. He isn't the same man I fell in love with, but I still fall further everyday, We are fighting to help him recover. To make his life better.”

Police were sent to the scene after receiving a report of an alarm going off Tuesday morning.

When deputies arrived at the apartment, Waddell opened the door with blood splattered on his feet and his hands.

Deputies searched the apartment where they found Corvino dead in his bed. Waddell was detained following the discovery of Corvino’s body.

The Orlando Sentinel reported there were cameras in the apartment which captured the moments leading up to the shooting but not the slaying itself.

Deputies said they “believed the fired shots set off the alarms, which turned on the cameras.”

The video showed Waddell shifting Corvinos’s body to the edge of the bed and looking at him for a few minutes, deputies told the Orlando Sentinel.

Waddell said he and Corvino spent time together the night before in the apartment.

Waddell told deputies he was “mentally disabled” and took a few medications before he went to bed. It was not clear what medications he took.

Waddell owned two guns, a shotgun and handgun. He told deputies during the interview that he had no recollection of the shooting and asked if Corvino was dead.

Waddell told deputies he and the victim “were best friends for 10 years.”

Waddell was being held in Osceola County Jail.

Corvino was a longtime campaign GOP campaign staffer who worked on Attorney General Pam Bondi R-Fla. and former Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater’s R-Fla. campaign. Corvino was previously employed at Disney’s Polynesian Resort, according to his Facebook page.

Bondi told the Orlando Sentinel she was “heartbroken” when she heard of Corvino’s death and said he was “a great young man.”

“Many of our journalists are influential voices on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other platforms. The voices of our readers, listeners and viewers inform and improve our reporting,” Baquet wrote. “But we also need to make sure that we are engaging responsibly on social media, in line with the values of our newsroom.”

Baquet discussed Twitter at a forum at George Washington University Thursday and said his staff “should not be able to say anything on social media that they cannot say” in the Times, according to Politico.

The Times’ rival, The Washington Post, published a story back in Oct. 2016 headlined, “#Biased? Reporters on Twitter don’t hold back about Trump”. The article mentioned Times reporters throughout, noting that “reporters are supposed to keep their opinion out of the stories they write” but that policy doesn’t seem to apply to Twitter. The Post called out Times staffers Alex Burns for attacking Trump on a regular basis – and that was before he defeated Hillary Clinton on Election Day.

“Twitter has been around for 10 years and The New York Times is only now realizing that its staff say lots of stupid, left-wing things there?"" - Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor

“Twitter has been around for 10 years and The New York Times is only now realizing that its staff say lots of stupid, left-wing things there? I know Baquet isn't active on Twitter, but he claims he is aware of the Times agenda problem. You'd never know it though,” Gainor told Fox News.

“His solution is a mere fig leaf so the Times can pretend to be a serious news organization. This is the same paper whose columnist Paul Krugman recently tweeted about a nonexistent cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico,"" he added.

""This is the same paper that tweeted about its climate change agenda in August, asking ‘What’s a greater threat to Guam? North Korea, or climate change?’ And it will be the same paper that continues to bash Trump across all platforms, no matter what this new rule claims.”

Perhaps Baquet’s decision to update the policy has to do with the Times’ White House correspondent Glenn Thrush, who has not tweeted since Sept. 19 but had a habit of criticizing Trump prior to going dormant. Thrush said he stopped tweeting because it was “too much of a distraction” but some of his past tweets would have probably violated the paper’s new guidelines.

“In social media posts, our journalists must not express partisan opinions, promote political views, endorse candidates, make offensive comments or do anything else that undercuts The Times’s journalistic reputation,” the Times listed as a key point in the new policy.

“Very proud of my Executive Order which will allow greatly expanded access and far lower costs for HealthCare.
The subsidies have continued under Obama and Trump until now, despite prior Trump threats to block them.","President Trump touted his executive order on ObamaCare that attempts to lower premium costs for younger Americans and others while cutting off federal subsidies to insurance companies, saying their “windfall” has ended.

“Health Insurance stocks, which have gone through the roof during the ObamaCare years, plunged yesterday after I ended their Dems windfall!” Trump tweeted Saturday morning.

Trump argues the executive order he signed Friday will give millions of Americans more access to affordable health insurance, essentially by allowing them to buy premiums through large-group programs.

“Very proud of my Executive Order which will allow greatly expanded access and far lower costs for HealthCare. Millions of people benefit!” Trump said in a second early morning tweet.

The executive order cuts billions in federal dollars to insurance companies that are used to subsidize consumer costs -- lowering out-of-pocket expenses like co-payments and deductibles for low- and middle-income customers. About 6 million Americans benefit from the subsidies.

Trump and others consider the money a windfall for the companies. However, critics argue that ending them would drastically increase premium costs for millions of Americans because insurers under the 2010 health care law known as ObamaCare are required to lower costs for poorer customers.

So as a result of subsidies cut, carriers are likely to recoup the lost money by increasing premiums for people buying their own health insurance policies.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners estimates that Trump's move would produce a 12 percent to 15 percent upsurge in premiums.

Congressional Democrats, convinced they have important leverage, promised to press for a bipartisan deal to restore the money by year's end. That drive could split the GOP. On one side: pragmatists seeking to avoid political damage from hurting consumers. On the other: conservatives demanding a major weakening of the Affordable Care Act as the price for returning the money.

""The American people will know exactly where to place the blame,"" declared Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), all but daring Trump to aggravate what could be a major issue in the 2018 congressional elections.

Trump acted after the GOP-run Senate failed this summer to repeal and replace ObamaCare, one of his major campaign promises.

The president has long derided the subsidies as bailouts to insurers, even though the payments and the cost reductions for consumers are required by law.

A federal judge has found that Congress never properly approved the payments. The subsidies have continued under Obama and Trump until now, despite prior Trump threats to block them.

Stewart let the story slip during an Oct. 11 interview with People, in which Snoop also shared his secret favorite dish (a sandwich of peanut butter, pickes and potato chips) and Stewart admitted that she'd like to dress up like Beyonce for a day. But perhaps the cherry on top of the interview was when Martha told People of her craziest kitchen disaster ever.

Stewart began by saying she usually has a trip for keeping her kitchen blunders on the down-low — she just keeps them to herself.

“Oh, I’ve had lots of disasters, but I never let anybody know about them — that’s the secret,” she said. But eventually Martha relented, and explained how her biggest catastrophe involved Newman and her cherished dog, Bear.

“The worst one was I was catering a party for Paul Newman. He was my neighbor, and he asked me to cater a party for him,” Stewart divulged.

Hubley, who is currently hospitalized, required amputations below both her elbows and knees, and underwent a complete hysterectomy. Additionally, her fiancé, Mike Sampson, 34, has quit his job to help care for her and their newborn son.

“Our allegations are that had she been properly assessed when she presented at the hospital ... a substantial part of the damage, if not all of it, could have been prevented,” Wagner told the news outlet.

“We still expect difficult fighting in the days ahead and will not set a time for when we think (Islamic State) will be completely defeated in Raqqa,” U.S. military spokesman Col. Ryan Dillon told Reuters in an emailed statement.

Civilians flee Raqqa

In recent days, scores of civilians have been fleeing the last few remaining neighborhoods held by ISIS, ahead of an anticipated final push by U.S.-backed fighters seeking to retake the city.

A video that emerged Friday showed desperate, terrified residents emerging from destroyed districts, some of them collapsing on the ground in exhaustion as they arrive. They seemed to be taking advantage of a slowdown in the fighting and airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition amid efforts to ensure the safe evacuation of an estimated 4,000 civilians who remain trapped in the city.

The coalition has said that ISIS militants are holding some civilians to use as human shields, preventing them from escaping as the fight enters its final stages. The city, on the banks of the Euphrates River, has been badly damaged by the fighting, and activists have reported that over 1,000 civilians have been killed there since June.

Commanders said to be targeted

In Afghanistan, Abdul Ghani Musamim, a spokesman for the Kunar provincial governor, said Saturday that the drone strike took place Thursday afternoon in the Chawkay district. He said it targeted a meeting of IS commanders planning for a terrorist attack.

The government has no control of the remote area, where Afghanistan's ISIS affiliate has established a presence.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, Dawlat Waziri, also confirmed the report. There was no immediate comment from the U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.

However, lawmaker Shazada Shaheed rejected the report, claiming the victims of the strike were civilians.

Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper.""","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on Acculturated.com.

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

Click for more from the Coeur d'Alene Press.","An Idaho teacher was acquitted Thursday of having sex with a teenage boy, who her defense team claimed was lying to help his mother win a lawsuit against the school district.

A jury found Nichole Noel Thiel, 48, not guilty of sexual battery with a teen. Thiel faced up to 25 years in prison if convicted.

Prosecutors alleged that Thiel had sex with the boy in late 2015 and early 2016 at her condominium. At the time of the alleged encounters, Thiel was a 46-year-old culinary arts teacher at Lake Pend Orielle High School in Sandpoint, while the student was 16.

The defense noted that the teen had admitted when questioned by police that having sex with one of his teachers was an item on his ""bucket list."" Attorney Michael Palmer also noted that the teen's mother had recently filed a claim against the Lake Pend Orielle School District.

""[The student] has a massive incentive to get her convicted,"" Palmer told the jury, according to the Coeur d'Alene Press.

Palmer also pointed out discrepancies in the teen's recounting of the sexual encounters at Thiel's condo. At one point, the defense attorney said that the condo's imitation balcony was too small and too inaccessible for the teen to step outside and smoke a cigarette, which he claimed he did.

Bonner County Prosecutor Louis Marshall told the Coeur d'Alene Press that he accepted the verdict, but would follow up with the school's principal and the district's superintendent.

At the time of her arrest earlier this year, Thiel was vice principal and athletic director at the Coeur d’Alene Charter Academy. She was placed on leave when the accusations came to light. It was not immediately clear whether she would be restored to that position.

He said the Haqqani network, which held him and his wife captive for five years, had killed his infant daughter in captivity and raped his wife.

Boyle landed in Canada late Friday with his American wife and three young children.

The couple was rescued Wednesday, five years after they had been abducted by the Taliban-linked extremist network while in Afghanistan as part of a backpacking trip.

Coleman was pregnant at the time and had four children in captivity. The birth of the fourth child had not been publicly known before Boyle appeared before journalists at the Toronto airport.



""The stupidity and evil of the Haqqani network's kidnapping of a pilgrim and his heavily pregnant wife engaged in helping ordinary villagers in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan was eclipsed only by the stupidity and evil of authorizing the murder of my infant daughter,"" he said.

Boyle said his wife was raped by a guard who was assisted by his superiors. He asked for the Afghan government to bring them to justice.

He said he was in Afghanistan to help villagers ""who live deep inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where no NGO, no aid worker and no government has ever successfully been able to bring the necessary help.""

After returning to his parents' home in Smiths Falls, Ontario, on Saturday, Boyle emailed The Associated Press with a new statement saying they had ""reached the first true 'home' that the children have ever known - after they spent most of Friday asking if each subsequent airport was our new house hopefully.""

""Our daughter has had a cursory medical exam last night, and hospital staff were enthusiastically insistent that her chances seemed miraculously high based on a quick physical. Full medical work-ups for each member of my family are being arranged right now, and God-willing the healing process - physically and mentally can begin.""

It was reported earlier that one of his children was in poor health and had to be force-fed by their Pakistani rescuers.

On the plane from London, Boyle provided a written statement to the Associated Press saying his family has ""unparalleled resilience and determination.""

Coleman, who is from Stewartstown, Pa., sat in the aisle of the business class cabin wearing a tan-colored headscarf.

She nodded wordlessly when she confirmed her identity to a reporter on board the flight. In the two seats next to her were her two elder children. In the seat beyond that was Boyle, with their youngest child in his lap. U.S. State Department officials were on the plane with them.

The handwritten statement that Boyle gave the AP expressed disagreement with U.S. foreign policy.

""God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination, and to allow that to stagnate, to pursue personal pleasure or comfort while there is still deliberate and organized injustice in the world would be a betrayal of all I believe, and tantamount to sacrilege,"" he wrote.

He nodded to one of the State Department officials and said, ""Their interests are not my interests.""

The family was able to leave from the plane with their escorts before the rest of the passengers. There was about a 5- to 10-minute delay before everyone else was allowed out.

Dan Boyle, Joshua's younger brother, said outside the family home in Smith Falls, Ontario, that he had spoken to his brother a few times in the past few days.

""He's doing very well. He sounds a lot like how he sounded five years ago. He sounds like he had his head on his shoulders and his wits about him,"" he said.



The Canadian government said in a statement they will ""continue to support him and his family now that they have returned.""

""Today, we join the Boyle family in rejoicing over the long-awaited return to Canada of their loved ones,"" the Canadian government said.

Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria said the Pakistani raid that led to the family's rescue was based on a tip from U.S. intelligence and shows that Pakistan will act against a ""common enemy"" when Washington shares information.

U.S. officials have long accused Pakistan of ignoring groups like the Haqqani network, which was holding the family.



A U.S. national security official, who was not authorized to discuss operational details of the release and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. obtained actionable information, passed it to Pakistani government officials, asked them to interdict and recover the hostages -- and they did.

On Friday, President Donald Trump, who previously warned Pakistan to stop harboring militants, praised Pakistan for its ""cooperation on many fronts."" On Twitter, he wrote that the U.S. is starting to develop ""a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders.""



The operation appeared to have unfolded quickly and ended with what some described as a dangerous raid, a shootout and a captor's final, terrifying threat to ""kill the hostage."" Boyle told his parents that he, his wife and their children were intercepted by Pakistani forces while being transported in the back or trunk of their captors' car and that some of his captors were killed. He suffered only a shrapnel wound, his family said.



U.S. officials did not confirm those details.



A U.S. military official said that a military hostage team had flown to Pakistan on Wednesday prepared to fly the family out. The team did a preliminary health assessment and had a transport plane ready to go, but sometime after daybreak Thursday, as the family members were walking to the plane, Boyle said he did not want to board, the official said.



Boyle's father said his son did not want to board the plane because it was headed to Bagram Air Base and the family wanted to return directly to North America. Another U.S. official said Boyle was nervous about being in ""custody"" given his family ties.



He was once married to Zaynab Khadr, the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a senior al-Qaida financier. Her father, the late Ahmed Said Khadr, and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy.



The Canadian-born Omar Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a firefight and was taken to the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay. Officials had discounted any link between that background and Boyle's capture, with one official describing it in 2014 as a ""horrible coincidence.""



The U.S. Justice Department said neither Boyle nor Coleman is wanted for any federal crime.



U.S. officials call the Haqqani group a terrorist organization and have targeted its leaders with drone strikes. But the group also operates like a criminal network. Unlike the Islamic State group, it does not typically execute Western hostages, preferring to ransom them for cash.



The Haqqani network had previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, a son of the founder of the group, in exchange for turning over the American-Canadian family. In one of the videos released by their captors, Boyle implored the Afghan government not to execute Taliban prisoners, or he and his wife would be killed.



U.S. officials have said that several other Americans are being held by militant groups in Afghanistan or Pakistan.



They include Kevin King, 60, a teacher at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul who was abducted in August 2016, and Paul Overby, an author in his 70s who had traveled to the region several times but disappeared in eastern Afghanistan in mid-2014.



The family had left Pakistan on a commercial flight after Boyle reportedly balked at taking a U.S. plane out of Pakistan, fearing that his background could land him in the American detention center at Guantanamo Bay.

I would have preferred President Trump to announce a clean withdrawal from the nuclear agreement, but I support his decision to give Congress and European leaders a final chance to fix it – even though the chances of this happening are extremely remote.

I applaud the president for calling out Iran for its sponsorship of terrorism, missile program and efforts to destabilize the Middle East. He explained clearly and accurately why the agreement designed to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons is in reality weak and dangerous.

I would have preferred President Trump to announce a clean withdrawal from the nuclear agreement, but I support his decision to give Congress and European leaders a final chance to fix it – even though the chances of this happening are extremely remote.

The president’s compelling description of the growing threat from Iran explained why the Israeli and Saudi governments immediately endorsed his action.

President Trump’s ultimatum was the most important part of his speech, since he announced that he will kill the agreement unless its many flaws are fixed. Given the low probability that Congress, U.S. diplomats or European officials can devise and implement any substantial changes to the nuclear agreement, the deal’s future is grim.

Congress now has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose severe economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted by the nuclear agreement. Congress also will consider legislation on how to address the agreement’s shortcomings and “triggers” imposing sanctions in response to Iranian behavior.

Any legislation or renegotiation of the nuclear agreement must address its three major flaws: allowing Iran to enrich uranium; allowing Iran to operate a plutonium-producing heavy-water reactor; and the deal’s very weak inspection provisions.

Other issues also should be addressed, such as Iran’s missile program, support of terrorism and meddling in regional conflicts.

While there’s been some talk of extending the deal’s “sunset” clause – when the agreement expires – such a fix would be meaningless without the above changes concerning Iran’s nuclear program.

However, none of these vital changes is likely to approved by Congress in legislation or agreed to by other nations who signed the Iran deal.

Congress is very unlikely to pass legislation with any substantial fixes to the agreement because too many moderate Republican senators will vote with Democrats against changes that could cause Iran to withdraw. The Senate would require 60 votes to pass such legislation, meaning that even if all 52 Republicans supported it they would need to pick up eight Democratic votes.

Based on a statement by a senior European Union official Friday, European states plan to stubbornly resist any efforts by U.S. officials to fix the nuclear deal.

By not withdrawing from the pact immediately, President Trump is trying to work with Congress and follow the law. This is the opposite of how President Obama imposed the nuclear agreement on the American people by refusing to follow the U.S. Constitution and submitting the pact to the Senate for ratification as a treaty. To say that such a far-reaching international agreement is not a treaty was an absurd claim by the former president.

It’s also worth noting that President Trump can reimpose most sanctions on Iran himself if Congress fails to act. The president could take such action and impose additional sanctions as part of a withdrawal decision.

You could almost hear the collective sigh of relief from America's allied capitals when President Donald Trump announced that he was kicking the Iran nuclear deal over to Congress to fix.

True to his campaign pledge, President Trump refused to certify to Congress that Iran has been complying with what he called the ""worst"" arms control deal the U.S. ever negotiated.

He also asked Congress to impose sanctions on Iran for its continued ballistic missile tests, its aggressive conduct in the region, its support for Syrian president Bashar al Assad, its support for terror and other efforts to destabilize the Middle East, and its human rights abuses.

He also added additional sanctions on members of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Ayatollah's shock troops.

Trump has bought the nuclear deal, and the pragmatists in Iran who negotiated it, some time.

Finally, he threatened to tear up the Iran nuclear deal if Congress and America's allies don't correct what he considers its unacceptable weaknesses. That's called leverage.

But he didn't shred the deal. He didn't unilaterally withdraw. ""What's done is done,"" Mr. Trump said, after denouncing the deal's many failings.

Many of the nuclear agreement's most ardent supporters -- including America's European allies and even the most rational members of his own cabinet -- feared he might not listen to reason.

They worried that while struggling to contain North Korea, a rogue state that actually has nuclear weapons and has vowed to develop long-range missiles capable of striking San Francisco, Trump would open a second nuclear front by abandoning the nuclear pact his despised predecessor, Barack Obama, so painstakingly negotiated.

But despite his dire threats and bellicose rhetoric, the president listened to the adults in the room, among them, Defense Secretary Mattis, who recently told Congress that the deal was in the nation's security interests.

He accepted political reality -- that there would be no chance of a united front against Iran, as Michael Singh, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, argued, unless Mr. Trump decided to try to strengthen the deal while remaining in it. ""This puts policy towards Iran on a much more solid footing,"" he said in an interview.

After weeks of discussions, Trump came to understand that the case for unilateral withdrawal was weak. While Trump officials have argued that Iran is violating the agreement, eight reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear programs and this pact, confirmed that Iran was adhering to its terms.

The leaders of France, England and Germany all warned of the consequences of a unilateral withdrawal by asserting their determination to abide by it.

Even many of the ostensible weaknesses the president cited in his speech Friday were misleading. For instance, though he said that the deal limits Iran's nuclear programs for too short a time, Anthony Blinken, a former senior Obama official noted that under another treaty that Iran has signed and ratified, the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, Iran is permanently barred from developing an atomic bomb. And its acceptance of intrusive inspections lasts far longer than the nuclear deal.

With his pugnacious speech Friday, Trump has bought the nuclear deal, and the pragmatists in Iran who negotiated it, some time.

Bob Weinstein, 62, who founded Weinstein Co. with his brother Harvey, 65, told The Hollywood Reporter in an intense interview released Saturday morning the situation was “a waking nightmare.”

“I find myself in a waking nightmare. My brother has caused unconscionable suffering. As a father of three girls I say this with every bone in my body — I am heartbroken for the women that he has harmed. I'm a fighter,” Weinstein told The Hollywood Reporter.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN SEX SCANDAL: DETAILING THE ALLEGATIONS

“This hurts, but I don’t feel an ounce of remorse coming from him, and that kills me too,” he continued. “When I heard his written, lame excuse. Not an excuse. When I heard his admission of feeling remorse for the victims and then him cavalierly, almost crazily saying he was going to go out and take on the NRA, it was so disturbing to me. It was utter insanity. My daughters all felt sick hearing this because we understood he felt nothing. I don’t feel he feels anything to this day. I don’t.”

Harvey Weinstein came under fire after The New York Times released an expose on Oct. 5 that detailed decades of sexual harassment allegations made against the Hollywood producer by actresses and employees. On Tuesday, the New Yorker reported the movie mogul had sexually assaulted three women.

Following the bombshell allegations, a number of A-list stars came out to condemn the producer and some, such as Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, told their own uncomfortable experiences with Weinstein.

When The Hollywood Reporter asked Bob how he did not know of his brother’s misconduct, Weinstein said he had spoken to Harvey only a few times “on any personal level” in the last five years. However, Bob said he was aware of Harvey “philandering with every woman he could meet.”

“I was sick and disgusted by his actions. But that's the extent of what [I knew]. I said, “Harvey, you're just cheating. Why do you constantly cheat?” I could see it. But I wasn't in the room with him,” Bob Weinstein said.

“For me, I thought he was literally just going out there cheating in a pervasive way,” Bob said. “It wasn’t like he even had a mistress. It was one after another and that I was aware of. But as far as being in a room and hearing the description in “The New York Times?” No way. No f-----g way was I aware that that was the type of predator that he was. And the way he convinced people to do things? I thought they were all consensual situations.”

“I have a brother that’s indefensible and crazy,” Bob said. “I want him to get the justice that he deserves.”

Bob went on to say his brother was a “bully,” “arrogant” and “treated people like s—t all the time.”

Bob said employees would come into his office in tears due to something Harvey said to them.

On Sunday, Harvey was fired from the Weinstein Company. Bob confirmed he was on the board that fired his brother. Harvey planned to fight the firing.

“Anybody can do what they want to do. I cannot control other people’s actions. But he was fired by the board, okay? I was on that board. I fired him. He can fight. It will be a losing fight,” Weinstein said.

Weinstein said he was going to change the company’s name and he was still planning on the future of the studio’s shares.

Bob Weinstein told the media outlet he was personally going to write a letter to the Academy to get Harvey booted and would be cooperating with police in their investigation.

Weinstein concluded that he felt “mortified” and “disgusted” by Harvey’s actions and he was “sick” for the victims.

“I'm mortified and disgusted by my brother's actions. And I am sick for the victims. And I feel for them. I feel for them.”

Take, for example, the dwarf planet Haumea, a large egg-shaped body that hangs out beyond Neptune in the far reaches of our little planetary neighborhood, which researchers just discovered also happens to have a ring around it. Man, space is weird.

The research, which was published in the journal Nature, reveals that the oddly-shaped object is a real oddity, even among dwarf planets. Haumea's oblong shape isn't the only weird thing about it, as it also has an extremely fast rotational speed, leading to a full revolution once every 3.9 hours.

Haumea is one of only five officially recognized dwarf planets, with the others being Ceres, Eris, Makemake, and of course the onetime planet Pluto. Along with its egg shape and rapid rotation, it sets itself apart thanks to its pair of moons and of course it's newly-discovered debris ring.

Rings around planets like Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are well-studied and, for the most part, understood. But a dwarf planet boasting a ring of its own is definitely pretty weird, if only because it's the first with a confirmed ring.

Interestingly, the many oddities that make Haumea such a strange dwarf planet might be related. Past research suggested that the dwarf planet experienced a collision with another object in the Kuiper Belt -- the thick circle of debris that lies past Neptune -- and it's entirely possible that the impact not only caused the dwarf to spin wildly, sending debris into its orbit. That debris could have been the material that eventually formed its moons, with the rest of the dust falling into orbit and creating its ring.",There's a giant egg floating in our solar system with a ring around it,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2017/10/13/theres-giant-egg-floating-in-our-solar-system-with-ring-around-it.html

The cutbacks, which began on Thursday, are likely to impact 100 to 200 of the company’s 9,000 employees, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The number of employees impacted was less than originally rumored, according to a source with knowledge of the situation who pointed to early September reports that 3 percent of the work force could be let go.

ABC divisions cutting staff includes ABC Entertainment, ABC Studio, Disney Channel, DisneyXD, Disney Junior and Freeform. ABC News has not been impacted at this point.

No high-level positions in TV production and development are expected to be eliminated, according to the Times.

While staffers have been laid off, an ABC insider claims that there will be “hiring opportunities” across Disney and ABC in the near future as it attempts to shift resources to address future business needs as cord cutting plagues the industry and more viewers consume content online.

Disney and ABC have been dramatically impacted by changes in the way viewers consume content. Disney Channel and Freeform have lost about 4 million subscribers over the last three years, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The Disney-owned ESPN laid off several high-profile employees earlier this year and the sports network’s subscriber loss has been a hot topic among industry watchdogs. Many point to ESPN getting too political for its drop in subscribers. President Trump has even mocked the network on Twitter.

Disney Chairman and CEO Bob Iger is often rumored to harbor 2020 presidential aspirations. The New York Times recently said he is “emerging as a credible contender in the 2020 presidential speculation game,” while the Washington Post recently listed Iger as a top contender to land on the Democratic ticket and CBS published a headline pondering, “Is Bob Iger considering a presidential run?”

Meanwhile, ABC’s “Grey’s Anatomy” took a shot at Trump on Thursday night, the latest in a series of examples that the broadcast network leans left. ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live” has made political monologues a regular feature and the network also has been criticized for several shows that mock conservative values such as ""The Real O'Neals"" which made fun of Irish Catholics and ""When We Rise"" which was widely criticized for portraying Middle America as homophobic.

ABC’s entertainment division also has come under fire for canceling Tim Allen’s “Last Man Standing,” after the star expressed conservative views, although ABC president of Entertainment Channing Dungey told reporters that “politics had absolutely nothing to do with it.”

He waited nervously for two long hours as winds howled and embers flew by.

When the fire passed, he emerged, parched with thirst. He went to a nearby spring for water and screamed to see if anyone else was around.

No one answered.

Hanssen hurried toward his neighbors' house, where he found Sara Shepherd and her 17-year-old daughter, Kressa, lying on the ground, more than half their bodies burned. He called 911 and took water from a hot water heater left in the charred remnants of the family's home, squeezing drops into their mouths with the towel from his head.

""It was the most gut-wrenching, heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life,"" he said. ""They were so thirsty, and I knew how they felt because I just went through that thirst.""

Farther down the mountain, Hanssen found Shepherd's 14-year-old son, Kai. The eighth-grader at Eagle Peak Middle School, who loved baseball and wrestling, did not survive.

First responders found Kai's father, Jon Shepherd, separately, on the mountain. He was also badly burned but alive.

The wildfires that started late Sunday and swept across a wide area north of San Francisco are the deadliest and most destructive the state has ever seen. While much of the devastation is in Sonoma and Napa counties, the heart of California's wine country, fire also wiped out a swath of Redwood Valley, a community of about 1,800 roughly 70 miles (113 kilometers) north in Mendocino County.

Sara, 40, and Jon Shepherd, 44, finished building their dream home there two years ago on a long, winding road up a mountain where they could garden and raise their two children.

Now, the house is gone, their son is dead and the couple and their daughter are hospitalized in three different Northern California burn centers.

""Our minds are swirling,"" said Mindi Ramos, Sara's sister. ""We've lost our nephew. Everyone is in critical care right now. We don't know if Sara or Jon — we don't know what they remember. We don't know if they know that Kai is gone.""

Ramos, who grew up in the tight-knit community, said her family got a call from the Shepherds around 1 a.m. Monday to let them know they were evacuating. Time passed and when they didn't hear more, Ramos' parents grew nervous and checked the hospital in the nearby town of Ukiah.

CALIFORNIA COUPLE HID IN POOL AS DEADLY WILDFIRES SWALLOWED EVERYTHING AROUND THEM

It was then, Ramos said, that they learned their son-in-law had been brought in for burns. They later found out about the other family members.

Hanssen, a 46-year-old construction worker and sculptor, said he spoke with Jon Shepherd by phone shortly after they got a call to evacuate as flames lapped on the ridge across the valley. Shepherd said he was leaving with his wife and children. Hanssen decided to stay, hoping to save his home.

But the fire sped across the mountain too quickly, pushed by fierce winds. Within a half-hour, the windows blew in and everything inside Hanssen's home was on fire.

""It was like a nuclear blast wave that hit,"" he said. ""The embers were insane. They penetrated everything and set everything on fire.""

Hanssen retreated to the trailer and shut himself in with his dog. At one point, he stepped out and grabbed a piece of hose that held some trapped water, then soaked himself and resumed hiding.

When the winds died down, Hanssen came out. Everything had burned. Water tanks had melted.

The only things left were the trailer that sheltered him and a backhoe.

""I really should be dead right now, and the only reason I lived was an act of God, or something,"" he said.

The Shepherds had tried to drive down the mountain to escape the fire. Their two charred vehicles were blocking the road, doors still ajar from when they apparently abandoned them and fled on foot, Hanssen said.

Irma Muniz, Sara Shepherd's childhood friend who lives in Redwood Valley, evacuated with her family when a neighbor knocked on her door early Monday and told them to get out. Her house burned to the ground.

The 40-year-old photographer, who is 38 weeks pregnant with her third child, is now staying in a trailer on a friend's property.

She remembers driving up to the Shepherds' home last year to take photos of the family for a Christmas card. It was the first time she had met the children and remembers how Kai was timid, giggling as she had the family pose in the woods.

Now, the surviving Shepherds face a lengthy road to recovery. Kressa Shepherd, a Ukiah High School junior and talented artist, had both legs amputated beneath her knees, Ramos said.

Relatives are raising money to cover medical expenses and to prepare to eventually bring the family to live with Sara Shepherd's parents in Redwood Valley. Neighbors have offered to help retrofit the house to make it wheelchair accessible, Ramos said.

She said the Shepherds could not get fire insurance for their home due to its remote location.

Hanssen is staying with a friend in Pacifica, near San Francisco, thankful he survived and that his two children weren't with him at the time.

That's why scientists have turned to nature in an attempt to create truly amazing robotic camo, and it's already looking really, really amazing.

The new skin-like material mimics that of the cephalopods, which allow the aquatic creatures to raise or lower parts of their skin to create bumps and other shapes. In nature, the animals use this ability to mimic rocks and other features of the sea floor so that they can blend in for hunting or predator evasion purposes. Scientists believe this ability could be extremely useful for robots, and have set about making programmable skin that can take any shape that is needed.

The synthetic skin works a lot like the one nature has bestowed upon octopuses and cuttlefish, with a stiff membrane restricting the expansion of certain portions of the skin, but allowing other sections to balloon. When air is pumped in, the skin appears to morph into new shapes. This creates a 3D disguise that is incredible effective in nature, and would presumably also be quite powerful when applied to a robot.

Research robots could potentially use this kind of camo to observe animals without detection, but the other very obvious application is related to the military.

“What does a man do when they try to run him out of town for quoting a Bible verse?

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled 2-1 to vacate a preliminary injunction issued to the NFL Players' Association by a federal judge last month.

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled 2-1 to vacate a preliminary injunction issued to the NFL Players' Association by a federal judge last month.

Elliott was originally suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in August after the league concluded he had several physical confrontations last summer with his former girlfriend, Tiffany Thompson. Prosecutors in Ohio didn't pursue the case, citing conflicting evidence.

In issuing the injunction, U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant agreed with NFL players' union attorneys who argued that the investigation of the allegations in Ohio and a subsequent appeal were unfair to Elliott, one of the league's standout running backs.

The NFL countered that it followed procedures under the league's labor deal and that the union improperly filed a lawsuit before the appeals process was complete.

But the appeals court ruled Thursday that Mazzant had no jurisdiction over the matter and ordered the Eastern District of Texas to dismiss the case.

The most likely destination for further legal challenges from players' union attorneys representing Elliott is with the Southern District of New York. The NFL filed in that federal court after Elliott's NFL appeal was denied by arbitrator Harold Henderson last month.

Last year's NFL rushing leader as a rookie, Elliott's legal team filed the lawsuit on his behalf in the Eastern District of Texas before Henderson had rejected the appeal.

The NFL had already agreed to let Elliott play in the opener before Elliott's request for an injunction was granted by Mazzant in Sherman, north of Dallas. Henderson ruled against Elliott the same day Mazzant heard arguments over the injunction.

The NFL filed in the New York court because it is the home of league headquarters and was the site of Elliott's appeal hearing with Henderson.

The league won the ""Deflategate"" decision in the New York court, leading to New England quarterback Tom Brady serving his four-game suspension a year after it was originally imposed. A federal judge had put Brady's suspension on hold.

In the Elliott case, league attorneys wrote to the 5th Circuit that the union's lawsuit had resulted in ""hopelessly doomed proceedings"" that shouldn't continue.

According to the letter Elliott received informing him of the suspension, the NFL believed he used ""physical force"" three times over five days in a Columbus, Ohio, apartment last July resulting in injuries to Thompson's face, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, wrists, hips and knees.

Elliott, 22, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

If Elliott's legal team can't put the suspension on hold again, it will begin Oct. 22 at San Francisco. Elliott played the first five games while the case was in the courts.

The second-year running back out of Ohio State has recorded 424 all-purpose yards and scored three touchdowns.

To most women, Michelle Obama seems to have enjoyed a dream life.
Michelle Obama was perfectly positioned to manage this nexus of politics and business, helped by her husband’s status as a rising star in Chicago’s minority firmament.
And they don’t need to be lectured by Michelle Obama.","Isn’t Michelle Obama adorable? She actually thinks she is a typical woman in the United States, and that she can speak for all of us.

Michelle says she has no interest in running for president, trying to shatter what Hillary Clinton called the “highest and hardest glass ceiling,” but she might consider bursting out of that elitist, condescending Beltway Bubble.

Speaking recently at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women, Obama pushed women to speak up for themselves in the workplace. “Don’t waste your seat at the table,” she said. “If you are scared to use your voice, then you’ve got to get up and give it to someone who isn’t afraid to use the spot.”

Such good advice, coming from someone whose idea of hardship was graduating from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, and whose husband has always been there to provide for her.

To most women, Michelle Obama seems to have enjoyed a dream life. Married to a political supernova, spending eight years in the White House (which she once described as having “prisonlike elements”), moving on to a life of luxury and power; she has no idea how the real world functions. Her advice could get a lot of women fired.

In other words, she thinks women who voted for Trump did as they were told. And yet, isn’t that what Michelle is doing? Telling women what to think and what to say?

In 2014 she told the White House Working Families Summit how she once applied for a job at the University of Chicago Medical Center with her newborn baby in tow, and on the spot demanded flexible hours so that she could care for her growing family. She told her prospective employer, ""If you want me to do the job, you've got to pay me to do the job and you've got to give me flexibility.""

Doesn’t that sound like a terrific negotiating premise? I can’t do the job unless you bend the rules for me, possibly alienating my co-workers? Come on. Most women (or men) insisting on such special treatment would be shown the door.

“That was one of the first times I demanded flexibility,” Michelle says proudly about that early interview, as she exhorts others to follow her lead. For many of us who have juggled the demands of motherhood and work, the advice doesn’t ring true. It is the rare young job applicant, male or female, who can lay down demands, and women embarking on motherhood are typically more anxious than most to appear committed to their job. They need to be, as employers are understandably anxious about the competing demands on their time.

As a result, many of us put off having families until we were far enough along in our careers to negotiate some flexibility and consideration.

At the time that Michelle made that bold demand, her husband was a state senator in Illinois, and preparing to run for the U.S. Senate. He had earlier been a high-profile community organizer in Chicago, earning significant visibility within the city’s black community. Michelle initially worked at a top Chicago law firm; at the time she references she was being recruited to build the medical group’s community relations with Chicago’s South Side, where her husband had paved the way for her.

As the Washington Post revealed in 2008, Michelle Obama worked to redirect health care in the impoverished neighborhoods surrounding the hospital to local clinics, freeing up the Medical Center to care for patients with insurance who could pay more for the hospital’s care. The initiative was controversial; critics claimed the undertaking boosted the non-profit’s hospital’s bottom line at the expense of its commitment to the surrounding neighborhoods. To boost her efforts, she hired David Axlerod’s PR firm. Michelle Obama was perfectly positioned to manage this nexus of politics and business, helped by her husband’s status as a rising star in Chicago’s minority firmament. Hence, she had an excellent platform from which to demand special consideration.

She was paid well over $100,000 early on, which jumped to more than $300,000 when she became a Vice President, the year after her husband became a U.S. Senator. One of the earmarks the freshman senator petitioned for was a million dollar request for the UC Medical Center, which was never granted. Michelle had a strong wind at her back, named Barack.

Michelle has other advice these days – indeed, she is becoming the Edgar Bergen of our times, throwing her “voice” into the mouths of American women. Like the famed puppet master speaking for Charlie McCarthy, Michelle is spewing dictates, including recently telling women at an event in Boston “As far as I’m concerned, any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice in a way. . . . We look at those two candidates, as women, and many of us said, ‘That guy. He’s better for me. His voice is more true to me.’ Well, to me that just says you don’t like your voice. You like the thing we’re told to like.”

In other words, she thinks women who voted for Trump did as they were told. And yet, isn’t that what Michelle is doing? Telling women what to think and what to say?

I’m confident that, just like men, women will decide for themselves what they believe and who to vote for.

After years of helping patients in hospitals, Lauren realized it was having a detrimental effect on her on well-being.

She felt overworked, overstressed, overweight, fatigued and extremely unhappy, so she decided to take control of her life and get her priorities straight.

She said: ""I wanted to be a healthy, fit, strong, confident woman, actively preventing disease instead of treating everything with pills and medication.

""I wanted to change my life for the better and I wanted to help others before they lost control of their health too.""

The ultra-fit beauty never set out to become a ""fitness model.""

""I let the winter and holiday seasons get the best of me. I was unhappy with what I saw in the mirror and I felt even worse, so I decided to make a change for the better.""

She embarked on a paleo challenge, which involves eating a caveman-style diet and produced motivating results leading her to research entering competition shows.

After YouTubing to find out about the scene, she bit the bullet and signed up for her first bikini show where she placed 9th out of 30 competitors.

This spiked her interest and gave her the thirst to go for her professional card.

She hired a coach, entered more and more shows, and finally got the top spot in an amateur show, giving the opportunity to compete for money in professional body building, fitness and aesthetic shows.

She has since opened up her private Instagram account and now has over 3.6 million followers to whom she shares inspirational images of her stunning figure and workout routines, as well as the odd sexy picture of her self in tiny lingerie and bikinis.

A fellow pedestrian at University Place and 11th Street tells the New York Post that the “30 Rock” star was seen in a verbal exchange with a presumably reckless motorist that included insults and soft-drink throwing.

“Baldwin called the driver of a big black SUV ‘a meatball’ and kept asking him and the passenger to get out,” said the witness, who noticed the incident after it had already begun.

When the people in the car wouldn’t get out, “Alec got out his phone and started videotaping them. They pulled away right after, and he took a pic of their license plate and threw his extra-large drink in the street. Then he just went on his angry way.”

Baldwin’s rep had no comment.

In 2014, the actor was arrested in the same area for biking the wrong way down Fifth Avenue and reportedly becoming “belligerent and . . . arguing” with cops.

He also went on a Twitter tirade against an Upper West Side Starbucks barista in 2011, and delivered a homophobic rant against a Post photographer in 2013.

He waited nervously for two long hours as winds howled and embers flew by.

When the fire passed, he emerged, parched with thirst. He went to a nearby spring for water and screamed to see if anyone else was around.

No one answered.

Hanssen hurried toward his neighbors' house, where he found Sara Shepherd and her 17-year-old daughter, Kressa, lying on the ground, more than half their bodies burned. He called 911 and took water from a hot water heater left in the charred remnants of the family's home, squeezing drops into their mouths with the towel from his head.

CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE BURNS HOME OF ‘PEANUTS’ CREATOR CHARLES SCHULZ

""It was the most gut-wrenching, heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life,"" he said. ""They were so thirsty, and I knew how they felt because I just went through that thirst.""

Farther down the mountain, Hanssen found Shepherd's 14-year-old son, Kai. The eighth-grader at Eagle Peak Middle School, who loved baseball and wrestling, did not survive.

First responders found Kai's father, Jon Shepherd, separately, on the mountain. He was also badly burned but alive.

The wildfires that started late Sunday and swept across a wide area north of San Francisco are the deadliest and most destructive the state has ever seen. While much of the devastation is in Sonoma and Napa counties, the heart of California's wine country, fire also wiped out a swath of Redwood Valley, a community of about 1,800 roughly 70 miles (113 kilometers) north in Mendocino County.

Sara, 40, and Jon Shepherd, 44, finished building their dream home there two years ago on a long, winding road up a mountain where they could garden and raise their two children.

Now, the house is gone, their son is dead and the couple and their daughter are hospitalized in three different Northern California burn centers.

""Our minds are swirling,"" said Mindi Ramos, Sara's sister. ""We've lost our nephew. Everyone is in critical care right now. We don't know if Sara or Jon — we don't know what they remember. We don't know if they know that Kai is gone.""

Ramos, who grew up in the tight-knit community, said her family got a call from the Shepherds around 1 a.m. Monday to let them know they were evacuating. Time passed and when they didn't hear more, Ramos' parents grew nervous and checked the hospital in the nearby town of Ukiah.

CALIFORNIA COUPLE HID IN POOL AS DEADLY WILDFIRES SWALLOWED EVERYTHING AROUND THEM

It was then, Ramos said, that they learned their son-in-law had been brought in for burns. They later found out about the other family members.

Hanssen, a 46-year-old construction worker and sculptor, said he spoke with Jon Shepherd by phone shortly after they got a call to evacuate as flames lapped on the ridge across the valley. Shepherd said he was leaving with his wife and children. Hanssen decided to stay, hoping to save his home.

But the fire sped across the mountain too quickly, pushed by fierce winds. Within a half-hour, the windows blew in and everything inside Hanssen's home was on fire.

""It was like a nuclear blast wave that hit,"" he said. ""The embers were insane. They penetrated everything and set everything on fire.""

Hanssen retreated to the trailer and shut himself in with his dog. At one point, he stepped out and grabbed a piece of hose that held some trapped water, then soaked himself and resumed hiding.

When the winds died down, Hanssen came out. Everything had burned. Water tanks had melted.

The only things left were the trailer that sheltered him and a backhoe.

""I really should be dead right now, and the only reason I lived was an act of God, or something,"" he said.

The Shepherds had tried to drive down the mountain to escape the fire. Their two charred vehicles were blocking the road, doors still ajar from when they apparently abandoned them and fled on foot, Hanssen said.

Irma Muniz, Sara Shepherd's childhood friend who lives in Redwood Valley, evacuated with her family when a neighbor knocked on her door early Monday and told them to get out. Her house burned to the ground.

The 40-year-old photographer, who is 38 weeks pregnant with her third child, is now staying in a trailer on a friend's property.

She remembers driving up to the Shepherds' home last year to take photos of the family for a Christmas card. It was the first time she had met the children and remembers how Kai was timid, giggling as she had the family pose in the woods.

Now, the surviving Shepherds face a lengthy road to recovery. Kressa Shepherd, a Ukiah High School junior and talented artist, had both legs amputated beneath her knees, Ramos said.

Relatives are raising money to cover medical expenses and to prepare to eventually bring the family to live with Sara Shepherd's parents in Redwood Valley. Neighbors have offered to help retrofit the house to make it wheelchair accessible, Ramos said.

She said the Shepherds could not get fire insurance for their home due to its remote location.

Hanssen is staying with a friend in Pacifica, near San Francisco, thankful he survived and that his two children weren't with him at the time.

DANA PERINO, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City, and this is ""The Five."" Hollywood has been rocked by the Harvey Weinstein scandal this week. And now, more accusation against the movie mogul, actress Rose McGowan took to twitter blasting Amazon head Jeff Bezos, tweeting, I told the head of your studio that H.W., Harvey Weinstein, rape me over and over I've said it. He said it'd hadn't been proven. I said I was the proof. Amazon studio chief Roy Price has since been suspended. Meanwhile, feminist Jane Fonda is speaking out about why she stayed silent about Weinstein.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: About a year ago, and I'm ashamed that I didn't say anything right then.

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why didn't you? You're so bold.

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was not that bold. Because I guess it hadn't happened to me, and so I didn't feel like it was my place.

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: What did you know?

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: One of the women who have spoken out, Rosanna Arquette, told me. And, you know, it came as a shock and a great disappointment. This male entitlement.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



PERINO: So Kimberly, we've been talking about the story for about a week. I actually found Jane Fonda's response refreshingly honest. I think Hillary Clinton's was more contrived earlier in the week, basically saying, well, I and many others have no idea. But Jane Fonda was owning it saying, I don't know why I didn't come forward. I probably should have. It wasn't my story to tell. It's complicated.

KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Yeah. I think it was one of her better public interviews and appearances to be quite honest. I think maybe it would give people pause and reflection to think about if there's something they've seen or they've experienced or someone has told them about and coming forward and actually making a difference, you know, ahead of time. But you can tell the truth, being very genuine, being very authentic. You know, a lot of -- I guess, veracity and what it seems like in terms of her story and she was specific. And she even said, listen, it was Rosanna Arquette that came forward to tell me this, and kind of owning it, to say I should have done something. I could have done more, especially with her name and her clout and, you know, her position in Hollywood.

GREG GUTFELD, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: It's not the first time she's picked the wrong side, let's be honest.

JESSE WATTERS, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: No.

PERINO: All right. That's fair enough. How big a deal is this for Hollywood, Greg? We're 10 days into this story.

GUTFELD: I think that there's a lot of scared people right now. Hollywood right now is a big, old cat that's coughing up a fur ball. And you just think Harvey is the only fur ball, I don't think so. I think the positives -- what we can get out of this is we no longer need to take any moral lecturing from these holier than thou celebrities who are telling us about climate change, about the environment, who lecture us on sexism in the workplace, or racism when they have been living with this secret. We've talked about this before. There's no such thing as an open secret if everybody knows about it. It's actually a secret that you're hiding. They tolerated this. And, I don't know. I don't think I will ever be able to take any moral advice from Meryl Streep again.

PERINO: It might be kind of refreshing, right? If Hollywood backs off on the moral police.

WATTERS: But it won't happen.

(CROSSTALK)

WATTERS: They're a bunch of crusaders, so I don't expect that to stop. I don't really begrudge Jane Fonda. I'm not going to second-guess a woman. She didn't want to be the crusader against Weinstein and stand there alone, and all hell would rain down on her legally, politically, and P.R. wise if she choose to do that. So a lot of women are now coming forward because other women are coming forward. And I think the more people to come forward it's going to create a title wave, and hopefully you get justice at the end of that. But the cover up a lot of times they say is worse than the crime. All the board members at the Weinstein Company, apparently they had language in his contract that sexual assault or misdemeanors, so to speak.

PERINO: Have a pass.

WATTERS: Were allowable, and there was some money that changed hands, and it wasn't a fireable offense.

GUTFELD: Yes.

WATTERS: Right. So that goes to the point that there was knowledge previously of these actions and that was written in there on purpose to protect him. The Amazon situations completely corrupt that guy. I'm sure he's not the only one that got word of this, and then NBC News, too. They have a lot of deals with the Weinstein Company, through Bravo, through NBC Universal, so that raises a lot of questions about why they didn't go for it with the story. But Weinstein is not the only one guilty in Hollywood, he's just the only one that got caught.

PERINO: Well, actually, Juan, it's interesting. Oliver Stone, he was first asked about this and he defended Weinstein. Then, after being attacked for that a few hours later, he put out a full statement in which he said, I've been traveling, I'm appalled, and commend the courage of the women who step forward. But then, Patricia Arquette, a former playmate, accused Oliver Stone of harassment, and that's kind of explicit. We don't have to go in to it here. But you could see as the accusation start to fly -- you can see why people don't say anything because they end up in this position where they actually have to backtrack their words.

JUAN WILLIAMS, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Yeah. I'm not sure Jane Fonda fits into this because Jane Fonda said nothing happened to her, which she heard from somebody else that something happened.

PERINO: I'm talking about Oliver Stone.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. But in Oliver Stone's case I think I see here is that Karen Stevens who was a Playboy's playmate of the year in June of '97, so what you get is.

PERINO: Excuse me, yeah, I've have that wrong.

GUTFELD: No, it wasn't your fault. Patricia Arquette is not a former playmate. Oh, boy, that's a screw up.

PERINO: But that would be interesting. I had that down below, but let's not blame anybody here.

WILLIAMS: No, I'm trying to help you out, kid. So.

PERINO: It's not my fault.

(LAUGHTER)



GUTFELD: Don't you know the difference?

WILLIAMS: Anyway.

PERINO: Oh, my God.

WILLIAMS: Anyway, like this one.

PERINO: She doesn't know about that.

WILLIAMS: Anyway, so this woman says Oliver Stone once grabbed her at a party, right? He's groping her. So you get in a situation there where Oliver Stone initially said, oh, gee, I didn't realize how many people had corroborated the New York Times story, which I sense, I think, been enlarge on by the New Yorker story. But then he says, oh, at that point he thinks it's reprehensible and terrible and all that.

PERINO: Right.

WILLIAMS: But then you go to the story about the Amazon executive who is now on leave, this guy, Roy Price. And it's such an interesting story there because you have a woman who says she's a lesbian. A lesbian. And she says he gets in a cab and he's coming on to her and telling her all kind of awful things. And then, once she tells him that she's not only lesbian but married, he continues. And then, when she complains about it, all that happens is he doesn't appear at her parties or any event that she's involved with. And just as an aside, her dad turns out to be Philip K. Dick, who is the famous author. Why are you laughing, Mr. Gutfeld?

GUTFELD: Because I just love it when you retell an entire story.

WILLIAMS: But I love it.

GUTFELD: And I know the thing that you find interesting is, she's a lesbian, and her father is name Philip Dick.

WILLIAMS: No, no, no.

GUTFELD: It's amusing.

WILLIAMS: I actually like his writing. I think science fiction is up your alley too.

GUTFELD: No, no, no. To me -- do robots dream of electric sheep or something like that.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, right, the man in the high castle, which is what he's starring is her daughter, right?

PERINO: Right.

WILLIAMS: But the point is that this bad behavior is so consistent, and as we saw in the Amazon case, the higher ups don't do anything. They think they can cover it up. And we've seen this through our industry. Let me tell you, it ain't special to Hollywood.

GUTFELD: No, you're right. You're right. Can I ask a question about this -- I think when somebody says they're going to sex addiction rehab, I always feel like that's a copout because this doesn't strike me as sex addiction, this strikes me as being a really gross creep. There are people that have genuine sex addiction, like they spend hours in front of a computer and they ruin their careers.

PERINO: Can't function.

GUTFELD: Yeah. They can't function. He clearly can function. He just knew he can get away with it. I think that it's not a copout. It's a way for him to pay a rich man's penance.

GUILFOYLE: So you would see this actually a lot on, you know, cases that I would handle. If you have high profile defendant, especially ones that were well funded, well source, they would take their client and put them into rehab whether it was sex rehab, alcohol rehab, if it was a DUI case or sexual assault, completely two different things. He's trying to frame this as I am not a sexual predator, I am someone who has a sex addiction problem, so therefore I'm, you know, less culpable, and it's like a built-in excuse. So they're trying to do that and like persuade the judge.

WATTERS: Did he also say when the paparazzi were in his driveway, I made a mistake?

GUTFELD: Second chances.

WATTERS: Sexually assaulting women is not a mistake when you do it over and over and over again, it's not a mistake.

PERINO: It's either a mistake or you have an addiction.

WATTERS: You're an addicted, sexual.

GUTFELD: It's not an addiction because you're committing a crime.

(CROSSTALK)



WILLIAMS: Here's the addiction -- there's an addiction -- one other thing, Wade Boggs -- you remember Wade Boggs? The third baseman for the Red Sox, he said he went in for sex treatment. I never believe -- I thought what a joke this is. But in this case, men who are powerful and rich think, you know what, I can do what I want to do.

GUTFELD: That's not an addiction.

WILLIAMS: That's what I say. But, you know what? Men like sex and here are all these starlets hanging around, right? And these guys think they can get away with it, and no one is going to call on it because as in the Weinstein situation he has so much connections, so much power, and David Boyce who was the layer that negotiated his last contract said, explicitly in the contract said, he had had these problems with, I think, there were four other women? So I mean, that's not a secret.

GUTFELD: Yeah.

PERINO: That's an interestingly legal decision, right Kimberly?

GUILFOYLE: Yeah. It's absolutely is. And we were talking about it earlier on your show. And the thing is like -- it just goes to show that these companies had prior knowledge. They knew it was a problem. They went ahead and kept him in the employment, creating an unsafe environment for those that would come in to contact with him. But they essentially were licensing criminal sexual conduct and saying that it was OK for you to do this as long as you pay us back. So they were more interested in a financial (INAUDIBLE) but had no, you know, moral qualms with that whatsoever.

WATTERS: Did you see a class action lawsuit arising because of something like this, because of the number of women?

GUILFOYLE: Yes, we're talking about that earlier. Yeah. Because the bottom line is you can have people then join together to bring a case, like, a civil suit and, in fact, even against the company to say, look, the acted in conscience disregard of this known risk which created an unsafe environment for people. So there should be -- do you think that the jury would be very persuaded by something like that because it's pretty compelling and pretty shocking.

WILLIAMS: You know what struck me in reading about all of it this week was the Ronan Farrow angle. Now Ronan Farrow is the guy, the journalist for NBC. NBC doesn't take the story. He goes over to the New Yorker and the same story then become so explosive this week. So then, in people talking about why NBC executives didn't do this, they say, well, you know, some of the executives say it wasn't quite the same story. But they also say Ronan Farrow, of course, the son of Mia Farrow, had been involved with his sister making allegations against Woody Allen. And I'm wondering if people think, you know, this whole industry and all the connections, they just aren't sure. And also, NBC, of course, were the ones who withheld and then somebody leaked the tape on, guess who, President Trump and his vulgar attitude toward women.

PERINO: We'll see what the weekend brings. Maybe next week we won't be talking about this as much unless there's a lot more to say. We have more to come. President Trump's recent decision on the Iran nuke deal. You're going to hear about that next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUILFOYLE: Today, President Trump announced his long-awaited decision on the disastrous Iran nuke deal arranged by his predecessor.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The Iran deal was one of the most worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. What is the purpose of a deal that, at best, only delays Iran's nuclear capability for a short period of time? This, as president of the United States, is unacceptable.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



GUILFOYLE: He says he won't recertify the accord. But as the country isn't living up to the, quote, spirit of the deal, and had committed multiple violations.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of Iran's nuclear breakdown. In the event we're not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. It is under continuous review and our participation can be canceled by me as president at any time.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



GUILFOYLE: So if congress does not come up with satisfactory changes, he is in fact prepared to terminate it. So Dana, strong statement by the president on the discussion leading up to this in terms of what the president would do, and the involvement as well of congress.

PERINO: Right. And when the congress passed that -- the law, they said the president, whoever the president is going to be, every 90 days have to decide if Iran is in compliance or not. When the president had done this already two times after he was sworn in, he said he did not want to do it again. He ran on his campaign saying that the deal was one of the worst that United States has ever signed on to. He was mad because -- well, that this technical compliance might be true in some cases, but that the spirit of the deal was not being lived up to, and that, in particular, talks about how Iran, for example, was sending in -- mailing in its own soil samples.

GUTFELD: I do that too.

PERINO: Exactly. So that's awfully suspicious. And then, I thought was extremely bold, and the additional step taken that I don't think people saw throughout the week until it was announced today, is that he singled out the Iranian revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization. And I think that that is actually the first time that's ever been done about another country's actual military, to call them a terrorist organization. Extremely bold. But I also note that tonight, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said that his country will continue to stick to the nuclear deal despite U.S. President Trump's accusation that they've violated the spirit of it, and it's much stronger than Trump believes. So, I think, as Jesse and I was talking in the break, that's Jesse is right that Rouhani loves the deal because it was a better deal for Iran that it was for us.

GUILFOYLE: Yeah. Jesse, so, you know, this is something where Iran was like, listen, they were the beneficiary of what, at least President Trump has said and his advisors believed was an unequal bargain in terms of this deal.

WATTERS: Completely unequal. Can we get that $3 trillion in cash back? Can we get any of that money back?

PERINO: I don't think so.

WATTERS: What a waste of money. Yeah, we like to claw that back, it's a terrible deal. We're all safer, even Juan, as a result of President Trump's passion today, even though he did kick it to congress which is a little risky if congress can do something in 60 days. They have a lot on their plate. I'm not so confident. We'll see what happens. But, like you've said the revolutionary guard, they're causing mayhem in Iraq. They're exporting terror through Hezbollah and through Hamas. Israel came out today extremely happy about this. The Saudis, extremely happy about this. All of our allies never thought this was a good deal. If you look at what happened with North Korea.

PERINO: Right.

WATTERS: Perfect example, we give them lots of money, we give them fuel, we've helped them build reactors, and what do they do? They waited and waited and waited and then they nuked up. And now we're under a nuclear umbrella. So that was a lesson. Trump took that lesson and is now looking at using it with the Iranians. So what do we do now? If we get out of the deal, are we safer? Everybody says, oh, no, we're not as safe if we get out. I think we're absolutely more safe. They're not even letting us inspect military sites. How is that impossible to violate? I mean, that is the key ingredient to having the deal, full, unfettered inspection. If that's not on the table and they're continuing to test their ballistic missile program, and chanting death to America, it's not a good deal.

WILLIAMS: Let's quote the defense secretary, Mattis, he said this deal serves the U.S. interest. How about the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, he said that, in fact, Iran has held up their end of the deal. And then so you come to options. Number one option, congress does nothing, right? OK. And the fact Jesse said that's the most likely outcome. Second, impose economic sanctions on Iran that would kill the deal. Or third, open up new negotiations. But, of course, we're not offering anything in terms of new negotiations. We're not saying, oh, we'll give you this in exchange for that, so why would they negotiate?

So we come to Rouhani, the president. Rouhani is the moderate in this situation in Iran. He wants a deal with the U.S. because he is trying to moderate a lot of the Iranian negative influence in the Middle East. It's the ayatollah who was delighted that this deal is done because the ayatollah is now saying to all the other partners, and by the way, that includes Russia, China, Britain, France, who all like this deal and don't want to decertify, and saying to them you can't trust the United States. They make deals and they break them. Do you know what this is about? This is about Donald Trump not doing ObamaCare, not being able to do tax reform, not doing a wall, and now he's saying to his base, oh, but I did this. This is terrible.

GUILFOYLE: OK. That's like 12 segments that we have to cover right there. But I want to get Greg in, you know, and this is the president being consistent in terms of his opinion about this deal to begin with, so it's a follow-up. And today, specifically, was addressing the Iranian people directly.

GUTFELD: A moderate Iranian -- they only execute half your family. What was the central problem with the Iran deal that it was a treaty dressed up as legislation. So Obama cheated our constitution and he lied to get this thing through because he knew he couldn't get it passed. No one was going to past this terrible, terrible deal. So, this is -- the great story of this is how Trump is so far from being an autocrat, he's sending it back to Congress. He saying, let's do the right thing. I'm not going to be like President Obama and dress this thing up as something else, and tried to trick the American public. I'm going to tell you what it is. And guess what, you guys get to go back, and you guys get to work on it. Isn't that great? Why is that great? This is all about President Obama's desperate need for foreign policy legacy, so he created this horrible deal, and he shoved it through, and now we're shoving it back. And by the way, we're shoving it back in a constitutional manner.

WILLIAMS: No, you know what? So congress will get this deal, Greg, and they ideally will do something to move us forward to make it safer. And to the contrary, they will not because Donald Trump just said, this is so sticky.

GUILFOYLE: They're going to cut our mics.

WILLIAMS: Let the other guy have it.

GUILFOYLE: OK. So coming up, jam packed, right? Trump aims to dismantle ObamaCare. Top Democrats are calling it sabotage. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WATTERS: President Trump today defending his new executive order to stop payments to ensures under ObamaCare.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: You saw what we did yesterday with respect to health care. It's step-by-step-by-step. One by one, it's going to calm down and we're going to have great health care in our country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



WATTERS: Democratic leaders Pelosi and Schumer call it a spiteful act of vast pointless sabotage levied at working families and the middle class. GOP senator Ted Cruz opposed his party last ObamaCare repeal attempt, but supports the president's move and blasts Democrats for their hypocrisy.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



TED CRUZ, U.S. SENATOR: Why is it that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer get really angry defending corporate welfare, defending billions of bailouts for insurance companies, but they're not worried about the single mom who's had her hours forcibly reduced to 29 hours a week because of ObamaCare? They're not worried about the working family whose premiums have skyrocketed, average premiums have risen over $5,000 a year under ObamaCare.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



WATTERS: Greg, I can tell you this listening to Ted Cruz.

GUTFELD: I love his voice. By the way, this isn't crony capitalism, it's crony corporatism. Unconstitutional taxpayer funded bribes to select insurance companies. It's interesting to see liberals now defending big businesses and Republicans targeting, you know, crony corporatism and evil big business. The stereotypes are now reversed. I find that quite refreshing. We'll be right back.

WATTERS: Juan, defend that because they were getting hundreds of millions of dollars in payoffs because they were losing money on the unsuccessful ObamaCare exchanges.

WILLIAMS: Let me just say, you know, sometimes I don't know what to do. Today is Friday.

GUTFELD: I've noticed.

WILLIAMS: . I just want to.

WATTERS: Just do nothing.

WILLIAMS: . to scream. Because, I mean, the idea of the whole ObamaCare -- I mean, it's so open. Reduce the number of people without insurance in America, right? Republicans.

WATTERS: Now the goal is to bring prices down.

WILLIAMS: No, no. Reduce -- that was number one was reduce the number of uninsured Americans because it drives up all our cost because when those people run off to the emergency room, whatever, we end up bearing the cost anyway. But anyway, let me just say, so this is the situation at the moment where you say, you know what, we're going to help the insurance companies with insurance for low income and moderate income people.

WATTERS: Then why do deductibles and premiums go up?

WILLIAMS: Oh, let me just say, because they're all.

(CROSSTALK)

WILLIAMS: . there's a stated rising cost of health care in the country.

GUTFELD: So it didn't work?

WILLIAMS: No, it did work, because it would've gone up more, Greg.

(CROSSTALK)



WILLIAMS: What you're going to do here is you have Blue Cross/Blue Shield. You have the American Health Insurers Association. You have pretty much everybody in the business saying this is destabilizing, and President Trump is now putting the most vulnerable in our society, in terms of health care, at risk. I just --

GUTFELD: You mean insurance companies?

WILLIAMS: I find it loathsome. I just can't believe he did this.

WATTERS: Do you find it loathsome?

PERINO: Well, I actually think it's -- it's consistent with the law. Because the House of Representatives, the Republicans challenged the -- ObamaCare's payments to these insurance companies.

WATTERS: Yes, power of the purse (ph).

PERINO: A federal court in February said, actually, the House and Republicans are correct, and so this is actually President Trump fulfilling the law, which again he's not an autocrat!

GUTFELD: There you go, leaves and gentlemen!

WATTERS: Trump defending the Constitution, Kimberly Guilfoyle. It's legal.

GUILFOYLE: There you go. Very legal. Not barely legal, very legal.

So here's the problem for the Democrats. This is going to be very popular with the marketplace, with the Americans, with the hardworking men and women who want to see this kind of competition is going to be a better value for them. So by the time the Democrats are done whining about it, and also pushing it through the court system, many of these changes are going to be pretty much irrevocable.

So I think that it's going to be very positive move for President Trump, and also you see he was able to get the widespread support from, you know, Republicans sometimes who have sometimes been critical of him like Ted Cruz and, you know, Rand Paul.

And so this, I think, was something, when I think about it in, you know, reflection and contemplate it, I say, why didn't he do it sooner?

WATTERS: And if Democrats are unhappy with it, why don't they come --

GUILFOYLE: Exactly. Why don't they?

PERINO: That's a good question.

WATTERS: -- to the negotiation table --

PERINO: Well, because they want the law.

WATTERS: -- and start wheeling and dealing with the president?

PERINO: They wanted to pass a bill.

WILLIAMS: They do! They did want to do that!

PERINO: Actually, if he had done it, they --

(CROSSTALK)

WILLIAMS: I'm saying, you know, you guys, seven years Republicans have done nothing. They haven't come up with a better plan. They can't pass it. And this is --

WATTERS: I agree with that. I agree that Republicans can't pass it. We're in agreement with that.

PERINO: It's hard to take away the candy once it's given out.

WILLIAMS: Oh, yes?

WATTERS: That's right. It's the Santa Claus principle (ph).

GUTFELD: ""Facebook Friday's"" coming up.

WATTERS: Next up, an NFL player willing to give up his job than be forced to stand for the national anthem.

GUILFOYLE: My God, what a lunatic!

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WILLIAMS: I'm going to say it (ph).

Just when you thought the NFL protests were dying down, one wide receiver may take his protest one step further. Tennessee Titans player Rishard Matthews tweets he will step away from the league, in other words quit, if it implemented a new rule requiring players to stand for the national anthem.

So the owners are expected to discuss this issue next week. What do you think?

WATTERS: If he wants to give up the job he loves for his principles, that's fine. Let him do it. It doesn't matter to me. You know, I don't know how great of an asset he is to the team. I don't really -- I don't really know how many balls he's caught this season so far.

But I don't think his teammates would want him to bail out for something like that. I mean, this is still a team sport. And if you're going to leave on something as small as your right to take a knee, I bet the rest of the team might be a little upset about it. Maybe not the second-string wide receiver who will come up and take your spot. Probably everybody else.

WILLIAMS: Kimberly, the NFL said that they will not mandate that the players stand.

GUILFOYLE: OK. Well, I mean, really, what is this guy trying to do? You know, just invite, you know, bad luck into his life and to his front doorstep? I mean, it's just ridiculous, you know?

He's got a great opportunity to play a game that, you know, people love and do something to be able to provide for his family. It's just not smart.

Just when the baseball players, like when the whole strike -- that didn't work out well for them. And ultimately, he's hurting the other players on his team, too, by doing that.

WILLIAMS: So now we have a situation, Dana, where there's a sheriff who says he's boycotting Ford, because Ford put out a statement saying that players have the right to express their, you know, upset with the way that cops deal with black people.

PERINO: Isn't it -- isn't it great in America that you can have all this freedom to say or do whatever you want?

GUTFELD: No.

PERINO: So they can boycott. He can say -- they can say what they want to about the players. I mean, that's actually what it's about.

I really thought that Condoleezza Rice earlier this week answered it very well. And I think if these players heard her, they might change their mind. And she said that you stand in unison and respect, not because the nation is perfect but because it is imperfect. And that there's still work to do.

And he also is going to be giving $75,000 to local communities to deal with this issue. So he's got a great platform. I hope that he wouldn't quit and maybe decide to stand to try to make the country better. And also to put his money where his mouth is.

WILLIAMS: You know what I thought was impressive about Condoleezza Rice's statement? And of course, the reason I thought it was impressive is because I agree with her. Is that what she said, as I heard it, was if you are trying to persuade other people, you don't allow them to divert the conversation.

And what has happened is now you have, unfortunately, to my mind, it's become a black/white issue -- and you can see this in the polling -- where people say, ""Oh, this is about the flag, the anthem, or the military,"" and the players say, ""No, my mom was in the military. My dad is in the military, et cetera. It has nothing to do with that. This is about police brutality.""

GUTFELD: I wonder who said that about three times in the last month, that if only the protest was made clear, people would understand it.

GUILFOYLE: Right.

GUTFELD: But that's the problem. It wasn't clear.

Look, years from now, we're going to look back at this and see how irrational this country became due to identity politics, where identity politics infects. It becomes a game of chicken between sides. Because one side gets offended by the other, and then it goes -- it just keeps going.

You're seeing this on campuses now, where people are shouting down people. It's a game of chicken.

So let's take it to the ultimate. Why don't we just speed to the end? I have an idea for the biggest football game ever that will get the biggest game ever. Settle it once and for all. Kneelers versus the standers. You get the best kneelers, you get the best standers, and they play the game. You turn the game into an actual political battle. Settle it once and for all.

GUILFOYLE: Wow. The standers are going to win, especially if Kaepernick is the quarterback for the kneelers.

GUTFELD: Why not kneelers versus standers?

GUILFOYLE: Let me put a bet on that game.

GUTFELD: One person could put this together. Where is Don King?

WATTERS: Don King, yes. Bob Aaron (ph). They'll put it together.

But you know, so apparently, last night in Charlotte, you had people outside the stadium taking a knee during the anthem. Again, expressed their concern about this issue. Now, your point to me is, ""Oh, gee, this really is a waste of time."" I don't think it's a waste of time.

GUTFELD: I never said that.

WATTERS: You don't think it's --

GUTFELD: No, I just said that an -- a poor protest is when an overwhelming majority do not understand it.

GUILFOYLE: That's right.

GUTFELD: But there are a lot --

WILLIAMS: But do you think it's -- do you think that this has become, like, team sport politics, where they intentionally are not understanding, because they don't want to deal with the racial issue?

GUTFELD: No, no. I will never respect a man who has -- wears socks with (UNINTELLIGIBLE) the cops.

WILLIAMS: That seems like such a distraction.

GUTFELD: He wore them on purpose! Not as a distraction, but to get attention. That was part of his protest.

WILLIAMS: That's the biggest issue at the table?

GUTFELD: As cops are being targeted and executed? Yes.

WILLIAMS: No.

GUILFOYLE: And by the way, you know, play the game. Be respectful. You're getting paid a lot of money to be there at the stadium. And if you feel so inclined you would like to express yourself and engage in this type of, you know, social injustice protest, then why don't you do it on your free time and actually do that and show that you're personally invested, instead of while you're being paid to do something?

WATTERS: And the cameras didn't even show the national anthem at last night's football game, because they know it's hurting the bottom line.

GUTFELD: Are we done with this?

WILLIAMS: Yes, you know, in fact, the NFL may --

GUILFOYLE: Please!

GUTFELD: I mean, come on!

GUILFOYLE: Greg, can you do the job that you're paid to do and participate in this segment?

GUTFELD: This is why we only do one question on ""Facebook Friday.""

WILLIAMS: You're right. I want to do ""Facebook Friday."" OK, don't move. Don't move a bone. ""Facebook Friday"" is up next.

GUILFOYLE: What?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(MUSIC: ""FRIDAY THE 13TH"" THEM)

GUTFELD: A little theme music from ""Friday the 13th,"" Facebook addition.

OK, Maryellen F. -- what a great name -- asks this question, Kimberly: ""If you could come back, on the next life, who would you like to be?""

GUILFOYLE: You're such a hater. I just said for the break, I'm like, ""Hey, don't come to me first."" And you're ""Hey, Kimberly.""

OK, I've got an answer for you. Margaret Thatcher.

GUTFELD: Interesting.

GUILFOYLE: Very good choice, right?

GUTFELD: You should've said Juan Williams so I would have come to you second.

GUILFOYLE: So I'd be silent, screaming inside --

WILLIAMS: You've got it!

GUILFOYLE: -- my new body.

WILLIAMS: You've got it.

GUILFOYLE: Claw my way out of my own body.

PERINO: Confused.

GUILFOYLE: Yes.

GUTFELD: Juan, if you can come back --

WILLIAMS: I really appreciate that you -- you have a sense of what I go through every day.

GUTFELD: All right.

WILLIAMS: Thank you.

GUILFOYLE: Counseling session.

GUTFELD: Next life, Juan. What would you like to come back?

WILLIAMS: So you can't come back as Jesus, right?

GUTFELD: I don't know. You can if you want, but that's -- you're shooting pretty high there.

You think you can do a better job?

WILLIAMS: You can't get a job, because if you kneel during the anthem, they wouldn't say you were praying. Right? So you would be out of a job.

So what do you think? So who's having the most fun? Tom Brady, you once told me Tom Brady is married to a beautiful woman, makes a lot of money. I think he's the most popular football player?

GUTFELD: Well, I don't know. We went to the same high school. That's all I know.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, his diet is --

PERINO: You're not going to like that diet.

WILLIAMS: What do you mean? As long as they have ice cream, I'm OK.

GUTFELD: No, he's not. No.

GUILFOYLE: I don't think they even have that. I couldn't live in the same house as him.

GUTFELD: Jesse?

WATTERS: I'd come back as my mother.

GUTFELD: That's interesting and strange. Because that means you would sleep with your father!

WILLIAMS: Oh, man!

GUILFOYLE: Eww!

WILLIAMS: Do you see what I -- do you see what goes on here?

GUTFELD: I'm just pointing out the obvious! That is why I'm here on the show, to point out the obvious!

GUILFOYLE: That is so -- oh!

WILLIAMS: Wow.

GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.

GUTFELD: Say David Schwimmer.

WATTERS: I'm going to go with David Schwimmer.

GUTFELD: Then somebody goes, ""You look like Jesse Watters.""

GUILFOYLE: I think he's had too much cold medicine.

WATTERS: He's using my name to get into places.

GUILFOYLE: That's awesome, right?

GUTFELD: Dana.

WILLIAMS: That's a good one.

PERINO: I'm going to come back as Jasper. That's life.

WATTERS: Spoiled dog.

WILLIAMS: Because you'd be his owner?

PERINO: Yes.

GUTFELD: That is -- that is pretty strange. I would come back as planet Earth.

WATTERS: That's not --

GUTFELD: And you'd all be all over me.

GUILFOYLE: No. That is not a person.

WILLIAMS: No, but --

GUILFOYLE: You violated that.

GUTFELD: It is a collection of people. I want to come back as planet earth. I deserve it. I've been through a lot.

WILLIAMS: This answers Kimberly's question. Why is Greg so gaseous?

GUILFOYLE: Because he's had so many people inside his body?

WILLIAMS: He's earth, he's earth.

GUTFELD: A lot of flora.

GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.

GUTFELD: This is a great question.

GUILFOYLE: What is going on?

GUTFELD: I'll start with you, Dana. From Krissy K., ""What was your first cartoon lunch box as a kid?""

PERINO: Peanuts. Like the --

GUTFELD: Don't swear.

PERINO: Charlie the Brown [SIC] comic strip thing.

GUTFELD: Yes, yes, yes.

PERINO: Yellow. It had a red handle.

GUTFELD: That's good.

PERINO: Also, there was Holly Hobby, but I don't know which was first.

GUTFELD: Interesting. Very good. It tells you what era you were in.

What was yours?

WATTERS: Transformers, He-man, something like that.

GUTFELD: Yes, yes, yes.

The lunch box smell, I just hated, Jess. I just hated it smell of it.

PERINO: I loved my thermos.

GUTFELD: What kind did you have? Why didn't you just, like --

GUTFELD: I had the brown bag with the grease spot.

GUILFOYLE: Eww.

GUTFELD: Yes. Juan.

WILLIAMS: I think it was, like, a New York Mets.

GUTFELD: Sports.

WATTERS: I'm sorry to hear that, Juan.

WILLIAMS: Let me tell you, I've got a lot to be sorry about on the baseball front.

GUTFELD: Yes. K.G.

GUILFOYLE: Totally. So mine was Pele.

GUTFELD: Pele.

GUILFOYLE: I loved my Pele lunch box. Am I dating myself right now?

GUTFELD: No.

GUILFOYLE: OK. But I loved it. I loved to play soccer and I played on an all-boys team. It was perfect for me.

GUTFELD: You were a trailblazer.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, yes, yes.

GUTFELD: My lunch box with ""The Firing Line."" Interesting. Anyway.

WILLIAMS: You mean Bill Buckley?

GUTFELD: Yes. I bet you didn't know ""The Firing Line"" had a lunch box?

WILLIAMS: No.

GUTFELD: Interesting.

PERINO: You were a special premium subscriber?

GUTFELD: Came with a pipe.

GUILFOYLE: I think you're making this up.

(CROSSTALK)

GUTFELD: Kind of a similar question. I'll go to you, Jessie. What toy from your childhood do you remember fondly or do you still have? That's interesting.

WATTERS: Well, my mother threw out my Nintendo. I'm still bummed out about that. She also threw out all of my ""Star Wars"" toys, you know --

GUTFELD: Yes.

WATTERS: -- those things that you put together. And those are probably a lot of money.

GUTFELD: Yes.

WATTERS: So not happy about that either.

GUILFOYLE: When did you throw them out? Like last week?

GUTFELD: What about you, Kimberly?

GUILFOYLE: Well, let's see. So -- no. You know, Nintelevision? It's like a Nintendo, but it was like in television? Anyway, but no, I wasn't upset about it. I used to play with my brother, and then my dad made us give it away to some other children that had lost their mom. We gave it to them.

WILLIAMS: Oh, no.

PERINO: Aww.

WILLIAMS: That was nice.

GUTFELD: Juan.

GUILFOYLE: But that was a good memory.

GUTFELD: Toy from your childhood?

WILLIAMS: You know, I was just thinking. Silly Putty.

GUTFELD: Love that.

WILLIAMS: Isn't that cool?

GUTFELD: Love that.

WILLIAMS: I really did. And the funny thing is I don't even know if it's even around anymore.

GUTFELD: It think it still is. It still is.

Taste weird. Not as delicious as Play-Doh. Kids, don't eat Play-Doh. You'll end up like me.

Dana.

PERINO: I had a ""Sesame Street"" -- it was like a house, and you could open it up.

GUTFELD: Yes.

PERINO: And then you could put the little figurines inside, all the different --

GUTFELD: You used to run around in there?

PERINO: I did.

GUTFELD: Yes, she did.

Favorite toy.

GUILFOYLE: Glass houses, Greg.

GUTFELD: My favorite toy, a stick. Loved a nice stick.

WATTERS: Nice stick.

GUTFELD: A nice stick, yes. And you know --

PERINO: Not even a boomerang?

GUTFELD: No. A stick is the original boomerang. It really is. Throw a stick, it doesn't come back, who cares? You find another stick. You don't need the stick to come back. There are sticks everywhere.

PERINO: Well --

WATTERS: No carbon footprint.

PERINO: You must have had a great childhood.

GUTFELD: I did. I had a wonderful childhood. Lots of sticks.

All right. ""What Disney villain would you like to be?"" Juan. From Sherri S.

WILLIAMS: Disney villains?

GUTFELD: Yes.

WILLIAMS: I have to think here. So who's a Disney villain?

GUTFELD: Say ""Snow White.""

PERINO: Cruella de Ville.

WILLIAMS: Cruella de Ville, I think she's pretty strong.

GUILFOYLE: Snow White was not a villain.

GUTFELD: It was a joke.

PERINO: I don't --

GUTFELD: Because we keep talking about race.

GUILFOYLE: Do we have to be a villain?

GUTFELD: Yes -- no, well, that's the question. I can't change the question.

They're wrapping me up. It's 5:51.

PERINO: We'll answer it later.

GUTFELD: All right. Sorry, kids. ""One More Thing"" up next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PERINO: Oh, it's my turn.

GUTFELD: Oh!

PERINO: Time for ""One More Thing."" I thought it was Kimberly! Because Kimberly is first. So Kimberly, sorry.

GUILFOYLE: Thank you, my love.

All right. Well, it's time to feast your eyes on this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GUILFOYLE: ""Kimberly's Food Court.""

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD: Yay!

GUILFOYLE: Yes, yes, yes, indeed. And let me tell you something. This mamacita loves some noodles. And I'm super excited, because a very famous New York restaurant has opened back up again. New York City noodle fans are freaking out about this, including me, return of the legendary Szechuan restaurant Hwa Yuan. OK? Down on Broadway.

And they originally closed down in 1992, but they were really famous and known for their noodles. The queen loved the place, Bacall, Mayor Koch.

GUTFELD: Why does America care?

GUILFOYLE: They care because it's an American success story, a family that escaped communist China and opened this restaurant to live the American dream.

GUTFELD: Good.

WATTERS: So good.

GUILFOYLE: Thanks to Jimmy Tang is here.

WATTERS: Delicious.

GUILFOYLE: And his father opened it up, and so it's super exciting.

WATTERS: Really good.

WILLIAMS: There they are. There's the picture.

GUILFOYLE: Jimmy and his father. Was very excited, who's the chef here. And also your grandfather that started, Shorty Tang. And this is so good. This is Chinese pizza.

GUTFELD: Dude, you just got a half a million dollars of free advertising.

PERINO: Absolutely.

OK, now that I know what I'm doing, I will tell you about this. Do any of you play Pokemon? Did you ever hear of that?

GUTFELD: Yes.

PERINO: OK. So if your Pokemon was mean to you during the 2016 investigation, guess what? Apparently, there's an investigative report out today that Russia even tried to get inside the Pokemon to be mean to you. I don't know exactly how this works, but they were very savvy, the Russians, on some of these things. So if you were upset and you think fellow Americans were doing this to you, chances are it was probably the Russians, of course.

Jesse.

WATTERS: This was not my One More Thing, but my mom just texted me and she's demanding an on-air apology.

WILLIAMS: Uh-oh.

WATTERS: Apparently, she did not throw away all my toys when I was a younger boys. She offered them to me, and then I threw them away. I don't know. That could be fake news.

WILLIAMS: From your mom?

WATTERS: Could be fake news.

PERINO: Jesse, my mom wants to meet your mom.

GUTFELD: That's what she -- that's what she was offended by?

WILLIAMS: Yes, we had that.

WATTERS: Among other things.

Anyway, I just want to plug ""Watters' World,"" 8 p.m. Saturday night. We have a great lineup. We have Tomi Lauren. We have Jesse Watters, obviously. Sebastian Gorka, and Curt Schilling, probably the most conservative lineup I've ever had.

PERINO: Wow.

WATTERS: It's going to be a great show and hopefully you guys will all --

GUTFELD: That is fair and balanced.

WATTERS: I balance it out.

GUILFOYLE: He listed himself.

PERINO: Will you be doing mom texts on that?

GUTFELD: [IMITATING SEBASTIAN GORKA] Sebastian Gorka. Sebastian Gorka.

WATTERS: That's scary.

GUTFELD: So my show tomorrow, it's going to be amazing. I've got the great writer Walter Kern. I've got Emily Capagno (ph). I've got Kat Timpf, Tyrus. And Tippi Hedron, the star of ""The Birds"" is going to coming on and talk about her experience in Hollywood working for Alfred Hitchcock. And you don't want to miss that.

Now it's time for --

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD: Greg's Evil News.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD: So today it's Friday the 13th. Are you aware that today is the last ever Flight 666 to Hell?

WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.

GUTFELD: The Nordic Air has flown passengers from Copenhagen to Helsinki, Finland on Friday the 13th since 2006, and they've decided to retire the flight number, which is 666.

PERINO: I think that sounds fair.

GUTFELD: So you cannot fly to Hell on the triple six.

GUILFOYLE: That's kind of interesting.

WILLIAMS: Yes.

GUTFELD: That sure beats, you know, ""I'm starting up a restaurant.""

PERINO: How about Pokemon?

OK, Juan.

WILLIAMS: All right. There's no crying in baseball, but man, I was screaming after midnight last night, because --

PERINO: Why?

WILLIAMS: -- my Nationals were defeated and eliminated from the playoffs.

One particular play in particular is causing a storm to rise in my soul. Here you see the play, but notice, the Cubs patter hits the mask of the catcher's mask with his bat. That's against the rules!

GUTFELD: Wow.

WILLIAMS: Two runs scored on the play. The umpiring crew decided not to enforce the blanking rule.

Now, I don't -- it's not that I have any strong feelings about this --

GUTFELD: Watch your mouth.

PERINO: Wait, what?

WILLIAMS: -- but I'm going to tell you something. That cost us the game, you idiot!

PERINO: What is wrong with Juan? Juan is not that --

GUTFELD: What is right with Juan? What is right with Juan?

PERINO: Wow. That's amazing.

WILLIAMS: Yes, these people, they don't follow the rules!

GUTFELD: Now you care about the rules?

GUILFOYLE: Now you do.

GUTFELD: Mr. Sanctuary City. Maybe that's a sanctuary on base.

WILLIAMS: Oh, look --

PERINO: All right, you guys. Bret Baier is going to love this lead-in. All right. ""Special Report"" is up next.

Three songs into his show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the singer launched into a five-minute speech that honored the 58 killed and nearly 500 hurt in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But Aldean took a defiant tone in telling concertgoers to resist living in fear, and he called for more of the national unity he's seen since the attack.

""These people are going to continue to try to hold us down,"" Aldean said. ""To those people that keep trying to do that, I say (expletive) you, we don't really care.""

Fans agreed. They pumped their fists and held up American flags as Aldean continued.

""I want to play the show for you guys that the people in Las Vegas came to see and didn't get a chance to,"" he said.

Friends Audra Miller, Lee Holstein and Amanda Zmak were some of those fans. They were in the audience when the shooting happened and ran for cover like thousands of others.

They traveled from Dallas for the Tulsa show and wore T-shirts they decorated themselves that said ""Vegas Strong,"" a popular meme since the attack.

Miller, 34, said Aldean made them proud and viewed the evening as a triumph.

""It was therapeutic and kind of like a cleansing all at the same time,"" she said. ""We just wanted to represent family, friends, love and hope.""

Aldean gave fans the show they wanted. The Georgia native is one of country music's biggest stars, touring in support of his album ""They Don't Know,"" which debuted atop the Billboard 200 in 2016. Much of his catalog includes Southern rock, pop and hip-hop influences, a mix of hard-charging party anthems and ballads with lyrics about farm work, drinking and small-town life.

He blasted through hits including ""Big Green Tractor,"" ''Fly Over States"" and ""She's Country,"" and popped open a can of beer onstage after the encore.

Aldean canceled shows in California last week to mourn those killed Oct. 1 at the outdoor Route 91 festival. He resumed his tour in an arena where concertgoers walked through metal detectors, and police presence was visible.

The singer visited shooting victims still in a Las Vegas hospital Sunday. The day before, Aldean performed Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" on ""Saturday Night Live"" in tribute to the victims and the late rock superstar.

Petty died the day after the shooting in Los Angeles after suffering cardiac arrest.

Along with a bizarre Energizing Comfort feature that uses lights, scents, massaging seats and electronic music in an attempt to chill you out or revitalize you (seriously), the full-size sedan debuts the newest version of Mercedes-Benz’s Intelligent Drive collection of semi-autonomous driver aids.

Where to begin?

Intelligent Drive has pedestrian and bicyclist detection system and can autonomously brake for either that gets in front of the car if you don’t. It also monitors the lines on the road and steers itself between them, even when your hands are off the steering wheel. It will do that at both highway and around town speeds for up to a minute at a time before it asks you to check in by touching the wheel.

Tapping into both of those abilities, it can anticipate that you might want to swerve around a person you’re heading toward and helps you turn the steering wheel if you do. Mercedes actually developed the system to make an evasive maneuver like this all by itself, but tests showed that drivers caught off guard were instinctively grabbing the wheel and messing up the move. Humans have trust issues, apparently.

It can change lanes on the highway, however, but only if you ask it to. Just hit the turn signal stalk and it uses sensors to check the blind spot and 80 meters beyond for approaching traffic, then sidles over if the coast is clear. If it’s not, it will give the other cars 10 seconds to move out of the way before it gives up trying.

Regardless of what lane it’s in, the S-Class doesn’t wander around too much as it cruises along, but doesn’t stay locked in the center as well as Cadillac’s similar Super Cruise does. It also disengages too often for you to get completely comfortable relying on it, and that’s partially intentional. It’s marketed as a comfort feature that makes driving easier and safer, but isn’t supposed to do all the work. Especially since obeying stop signs and red lights is still up to you.

Speed limits are a different story. Using mapping data, Intelligent Drive knows if the cruise control is set too high for the road ahead and will automatically slow you down to an appropriate speed. When engaged, this works on off ramps, twisty country roads and traffic circles, even if you’re manually steering. You can go for miles at a variety of speeds without ever touching the gas or brake if you don’t need to stop for intersections, or any surprise obstacles in the road.

The S-Class (which runs from $90,895 to well over $200,000) will actually make it less likely that you’ll encounter any of the latter. It has a car-to-car communication system that networks all of the Mercedes vehicles in an area that are equipped with the feature so they can send each other warning messages about road conditions.

If you hit a patch of ice and the stability control engages, for instance, it will mark that spot and alert any other cars with the feature as they approach the location. You can even drop your own thumbtack on the map if you pass an accident, a tree blocking the road, or some other danger. It works similar to Waze, and there’s nothing stopping you from using it to note the position of certain black and white cars parked on the side of the road, too.

The communications are sent over a cellular network, not directly, so cars can’t give each other their precise location to help keep from running into each other, but that’s the long-term plan behind this concept and pretty much a necessity to fill the roads with fully-autonomous cars one day.

The S-Class isn’t one of those, but it’s getting closer.",The 2018 Mercedes-Benz S-Class is a very smart car,http://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/12/2018-mercedes-benz-s-class-is-very-smart-car.html

A new essay in The New York Times takes the argument a step further, suggesting that despite the benefits companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon provide consumers, the cons are starting to outweigh the pros.

In an essay entitled ""Silicon Valley Is Not Your Friend,"" writer Noam Cohen outlines the way three of Silicon Valley's biggest companies – Facebook, Google and Amazon – have changed society. And despite their claims that they have users' best interests in mind, Cohen says it isn't always the case.

Writing ""the sins of Silicon Valley-led disruption have become impossible to ignore,"" Cohen goes into detail about the recent scandal surrounding Facebook and the role it played in Russian operatives interfering in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Google, via its AdSense unit as well as YouTube, also played a role, with Russian operatives buying ads on its network, as they did on Twitter, which specifically called out state-backed media organization Russia Today.

FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, TWITTER: HOW TECH GIANTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

In recent days, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has asked for forgiveness for ways his ""work was used to divide people"" and has spoken about openly regretting his words that Facebook did not play a role in the 2016 U.S. election.

Zuckerberg recently said that Facebook would release the advertisements in question to Congress. But the 33-year-old CEO may have lost any good will he was beginning to earn when he was criticized for his tone-deaf response to showing off Facebook technology in light of the aftermath Hurricane Maria caused to Puerto Rico, leaving more than three-quarters of the country without power.

There is also the matter that Google and its chairman, Eric Schmidt, reportedly influenced think tank, New America – which describes itself as ""renewing American politics, prosperity, and purpose in the Digital Age"" – to cut ties with Barry Lynn after he was critical of Google and expressed support for the recent $2.7 billion antitrust penalty levied by a European Union court against the company.

(In a statement obtained by Wired, New America co-chair Jonathan Soros wrote in a letter to staff and its fellows that “Neither Google nor Eric Schmidt attempted to interfere,"" nor did “[t]hey did not threaten funding, and they did not call for any changes.”)

TRUMP ATTACKS AMAZON ON TWITTER AGAIN, SAYS IT'S 'DOING GREAT DAMAGE' TO RETAILERS

Amazon, which recently purchased Whole Foods in an attempt to gain market share in the $800 billion U.S. grocery market, has also come under heavy scrutiny as of late.

President Trump has repeatedly called out the Jeff Bezos-led company for a number of different reasons, including not paying so-called ""internet taxes"" and ""doing great damage to tax paying retailers.""

Cohen suggests that with the $13.7 billion Whole Foods acquisition, which the Trump administration allowed, it is pursuing ""the breathtakingly lucrative strategy of parlaying a monopoly position online into an offline one, too.""

Many have raised the question whether the U.S. government and its counterparts around the world have the regulatory power or know-how to keep them in check and not abuse their power.

""Now that Google, Facebook, Amazon have become world dominators, the questions of the hour are, can the public be convinced to see Silicon Valley as the wrecking ball that it is?,"" Cohen wrote, adding on to those worries. ""And do we still have the regulatory tools and social cohesion to restrain the monopolists before they smash the foundations of our society?""","'The sins of Silicon Valley': Backlash mounts against Google, Facebook, Amazon",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/13/sins-silicon-valley-backlash-mounts-against-google-facebook-amazon.html

To be blunt, there are too many media fails this week to hit them all.","It takes a disaster to get more attention in the media than President Trump. Hollywood A-lister Harvey Weinstein delivered just that – with his career and life in the eye of the storm this week.

By now, Weinstein has been accused of everything from sexual harassment to rape and then decades of coercion and intimidation to hide his alleged actions. Collateral damage has rippled through the company he helped build and into the rest of Hollywood – even hitting other celebrities like Ben Affleck, who was forced to apologize for groping a woman several years ago.

An enormous number of Hollywood celebrities have claimed they were sexually harassed by Weinstein or others in power. Even actors Terry Crews and James Van Der Beek complained about harassment.

The Weinstein chaos was set in motion by the excellent work of New York Times writers Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey.

Unfortunately, the revelations about Weinstein also exposed both Hollywood corruption and news media cooperation that has lasted many years. They showed the lengths that Hollywood PR people and the media have gone to hide bad or compromising stories about Weinstein over the years.

NBC led the pack, but even late-night comics were reluctant to call Weinstein out. And even The Washington Post had zero print coverage the day after the scandal broke. Former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer gleefully criticized the paper for this failure.

The media tolerance of or complicity in Weinstein’s mistreatment of women calls to mind how many thousands of times journalists have used the term “war on women” against Republicans. In fact, GQ is still using that term against the GOP. Shockingly, in a story that mentions Weinstein.

To be blunt, there are too many media fails this week to hit them all. So let’s hit the high (or low) points.

● For all that Kantor and Twohey deserve credit for by exposing the dark side of Hollywood, their own paper choked when it had the chance to report the story 13 years ago. Former Times reporter Sharon Waxman wrote a story in The Wrap headlined: ""Harvey Weinstein’s Media Enablers’? The New York Times Is One of Them.” Waxman wrote that she investigated “oft-repeated allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein” in 2004. She said that she learned that the head of Weinstein’s film studio in Italy “had no film experience and his real job was to take care of Weinstein’s women needs, among other things.” Waxman wrote that she “also tracked down a woman in London who had been paid off after an unwanted sexual encounter with Weinstein.” However, Waxman said “the story I reported never ran” because of “intense pressure from Weinstein.”

● NBC certainly humiliated itself. NBC News correspondent Ronan Farrow couldn’t even get the network where he worked to run the story. CNN anchor Jake Tapper called out NBC’s “media complicity.” Farrow had to take his report to The New Yorker to get it published. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow told him in an on-air interview, “NBC says that the story wasn’t publishable.” Farrow proved the network wrong.

● NBC failed at every level. Its newscast ignored the story. Its news department squelched it. NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” the network’s anchor comedy show, didn’t even make one joke about Weinstein. The Huffington Post skewered NBC and deservedly so. ""Becoming more and more clear that what happened at NBC is straight-up journalistic malpractice,"" it wrote, adding an awesome illustration of a chicken with the network’s famous peacock feathers. NBC’s “Today” co-host Matt Lauer shockingly gave the network credit, saying Farrow had “been working this story for a long time, both for NBC News and The New Yorker.”

● Actress Rose McGowan, named in the original Times piece, has now come out and said that Weinstein, “raped me.” Just hours before that, she had bashed Weinstein favorite actor Ben Affleck for allegedly lying about what he knew about Weinstein. Twitter actually suspended her account, though Twitter claimed it was because she tweeted a phone number. McGowan, who reportedly had a settlement with Weinstein, seemed to be enjoying a measure of justice despite the bizarre suspension.

● All three broadcast networks reported in 2015 that Weinstein had been accused of groping an Italian model. Then they promptly forgot it and spent two years treating Weinstein like it never happened. This included NBC “Today” co-host Kathie Lee Gifford telling on air how she became friends with Weinstein. Both ABC and NBC reported how first daughter Malia Obama landed an internship with the mogul. Neither network mentioned the allegations against him. But I suppose the Obamas are still perfect parents even though they let an accused sex harasser give an internship to their daughter.

2. NFL Can’t Stand Getting The Knee From Trump: The NFL and its players union both look like the pathetic Cleveland Browns against Trump’s anti-protest air attack. Ever since Trump sacked the protesting players and said they should be fired, the protesters have been fired up.

Only so have the fans and they outnumber the players thousands to one. This week found protest ally ESPN abandoning one of its own star players – Jemele Hill. The “SportsCenter” anchor had touched off a furor by calling Trump a “white supremacist.” ESPN didn’t even suspend her for that.

This week she commented on how Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones vowed to bench protesting players. “If you feel strongly about JJ's statement, boycott his advertisers,” she tweeted. Calling the president a “white supremacist” was OK to ESPN. But messing with advertisers was a bridge too far. The network suspended her for two weeks, annoying the social justice community. Another ESPN staffer, Michael Wilbon, called Jones’ attitude a “plantation mentality.”

That was only part of the league’s problem this week. Vice President Mike Pence attended a Colts game and walked out after the player protest. That set more media tongues wagging, especially at MSNBC. The “Morning Joe” team was all set to be annoyed and host Joe Scarborough called Pence’s actions, an “abuse of power!” NBC’s Kate Snow criticized it as another “divisive issue” for the Trump administration.

The result of this continued bad PR is the league making a new rule that says players should stand for the anthem. Both owners and the players association are planning to meet to come up with a strategy to keep from further harming their sport. And the broadcast networks are doing their part to hide the NFL’s collapse on the field. They gave 10 times more coverage to the reaction to Trump’s initial criticism of the league than the announcement that the NFL appears to be backing down.

3. The Media And the Giant Impeach: What do comedian Amy Schumer, Democrat mega-donor Tom Steyer and Washington Post Republican Jen Rubin have in common? All three were pushing some form of removing the president – either by impeachment or a 25th Amendment remedy.

And, because it’s anti-Trump, many in the media swallowed the argument to make the president look bad. Schumer urged Instagram followers to push “#25thamendment” for several reasons, including, “because we don’t want WW3 on our ovaries.” (That sounds painful.) Billionaire eco-nut Steyer sent a letter to top Democrats making it clear the 2018 election will be about Trump’s impeachment. And, while Rubin said she’s been against using the 25th Amendment, she sure opened the door to it in a column headlined: “When do we reach 25th Amendment territory?”

The “news” channels ate it up. MSNBC's Chris Matthews and CNN’s Wolf Blitzer were just two of the TV talking heads to talk about removing Trump from office. Matthews naturally blamed the GOP’s “unbelievable cowardice” for the idea not moving faster.

The 25th Amendment gives the Cabinet that power of removal if the president is unable to perform his duties. Liberals, who talked impeachment before Trump even took office, now see this as the latest in a long series of anti-Trump strategies.

4. Playing Nuclear Football: Nuclear weapons launched another media feeding frenzy this week, enough to make even diehard conservatives fondly remember the “No nukes” movement.

NBC fired the first shot, saying “Trump Wanted Tenfold Increase in Nuclear Arsenal, Surprising Military.” Trump called out the network as “Fake @NBCNews” in a tweet response that also compared NBC to CNN. Trump followed with an attack that freaked out the media world, asking, “at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License?”

The result was more media mania, led by the Lord of Lies Brian Williams, claiming the U.S. was “the only nation on Earth to have set off nuclear weapons in anger.” Williams, who has manufactured enough of his own history, has now graduated into manufacturing U.S. history.

For all that liberals lament America’s use of the nuclear weapons, those two nukes ended a drawn-out and deadly war and set Japan on a path to become a free nation and saved American lives. That’s not an act of anger, it’s one of practicality.

New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof went nuclear on “Morning Joe,” aka Resistance HQ, and proceeded to contradict himself in dangerous ways. On one hand, he painted a picture of a terrifyingly dangerous North Korea: “Everywhere you go in Pyongyang, the capital, there are posters showing missiles striking the U.S. Capitol.” On the other, he depicted a nation the U.S. can’t stop from expanding its nuclear capacity and ability to strike the U.S. “I came back really feeling that we are not gonna be able to stop them,” he said.

Nowhere did he mention that the U.S. has followed his strategy of endless talk and that has gotten us in the fix we are in now. Kristof’s employer was so concerned that it ran an editorial calling for Congress to take away the president’s ability to use nuclear weapons in a first strike, effectively neutering America’s defense, As the anti-Trump paper put it: “He could unleash the apocalyptic force of the American nuclear arsenal by his word alone, and within minutes.” So could Obama, yet somehow no one in the media cared.

Hurray For Hollywood: While Tinseltown celebs like Julianne Moore are calling for new gun regulations, it’s important to see the entertainment industry for what it is – hypocritical. The week of the Las Vegas attack, four of the top five movies in the U.S. were incredibly violent – with more than 200 incidents of gun violence, along with another 377 incidents of other types of violence. Two of the movies – “American Assassin” and “Kingsman: Golden Circle” – assaulted the senses with so much bloodshed that it is challenging to tally all the violence. And automatic weapons that were part of the Vegas massacre figured prominently in three of the four films.

Nearly forgotten rapper Eminem (No, not these guys) is back and desperate to be relevant by being faux edgy – attacking Trump like almost every other media figure on Earth. He bashed Trump with rhymes so embarrassingly silly that he would lose “Epic Rap Battles of History” to J.R.R. Tolkien. Along with calling Trump “orange,” he gave the obligatory four-letter word salute to Trump fans.","Week’s top media fails: Weinstein scandal; NFL gets the knee from Trump + ESPN, Eminem and more",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/week-s-top-media-fails-weinstein-scandal-nfl-gets-knee-from-trump-espn-eminem-and-more.html

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

The offending post on Icing’s social media channels featured sultry model Lacey Claire Rogers, 20, wearing heart-shaped pasties over her nipples in a see-through top.

The raunchy ad had been making the rounds on Twitter and Facebook all week.

“Loving @thelaceyclaire’s fearless look,” said the Twitter post next to the image, which shows Rogers wearing a beanie with the slogan: “Fearless.”

“Help @savethetatas with our fearless collection,” the quote continued. This was followed by the hashtag #IcingF**KCancer.

The Facebook post read: “Help us Save the ta-tas during Breast Cancer Awareness month by shopping our Fearless Collection in store and online.”

Besides the beanie, the range of products includes a lanyard, choker, pink ribbon pin and keychain.

People taking offense at the tone-deaf advertisement included 33-year-old Stage Three breast cancer sufferer Courtney Stateler, who posted a Facebook photo of herself in a surgical mask lying on a hospital bed. “Does this look fearless to you?” she asked in her comment, which has since been taken down by Icing.

Others put up pictures of women with mastectomy scars.

“This is insulting. We’ve seen women among us poisoned, radiated, permanently scarred, and suffer the long term biological fallout of breast cancer,” posted Facebook user Jaime Clark.

“Has lacy [sic] gone through breast cancer?” wonders Sun Angela. “Did she have to tell her parents and watch the anguish on their faces when she told them she had bc.”

Icing apologized for offending its customers in a pinned Facebook post on its site.

“We apologize if our ‘Fearless’ product images have caused offence, this was not our intent, our intent is to help support valuable research in the battle against this terrible disease,” says the post.

But breast cancer survivors were not impressed.

“That’s a bulls**t apology,” wrote Facebook user and cancer survivor Ashleigh Jones. The fact that photo was ever taken shows you know nothing about breast cancer and it shows that you don’t give a damn about the fighters or survivors.”

“Corker ‘begged’ me to endorse him,” Trump said in a string of tweets. ""I said ‘NO’ and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement). He also wanted to be secretary of state, I said ‘NO THANKS.’ ... Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!”

Later in the afternoon, Trump tweeted: “Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!”

Trump’s attack followed Corker saying last week, amid reports that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will resign, that Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis, and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly “are those people that help separate our country from chaos.”

Corker Chief of Staff Todd Womack on Sunday disputed Trump's portrayal of the endorsement issue.

“The president called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,” Womack told Fox News.

Trump and Corker appeared to have a good relationship early in Trump’s roughly first eight months in the White House, even playing golf together in June with retired NFL quarterback Peyton Manning.

However, that relationship appears to have fractured, at least publicly, in August, when Corker criticized Trump’s handling of the violent Charlottesville protests, in which an alleged white supremacist fatally struck a woman with a car.

Corker said Trump has yet to demonstrate “the stability nor some of the competence” needed to be successful.

Trump on Sunday, in a separate tweet, argued Corker supported the Iran nuclear deal brokered by the previous Obama administration that Trump argues Iran is violating.

“He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!” Trump tweeted.

The feminist bar is very low these days. We’ve now heard from a number of very successful, famous actresses (and the aforementioned politician) who are being lauded for coming out against producer Harvey Weinstein. After he was fired from his film company.

NEW YORK — OCTOBER 4, 2017 — FOX News Channel (FNC) is expanding the FOX & Friends franchise by one hour, announced Suzanne Scott, president of programming for FNC.

In making the announcement, Scott said, “As FOX & Friends continues to mark its most-watched year in network history, we are thrilled to give our viewers more of the morning franchise they love.”

FOX & Friends FIRST is presented prior to the network’s signature morning show, previewing the day ahead by covering the latest news headlines in politics, business, entertainment and health.

On pace to have its highest-rated year in network history, FOX & Friends has been FNC’s signature morning program for more than 19 years. Co-hosted by Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, the show has eclipsed the competition for 190 consecutive months.

Heather Childers joined FNC in 2010 as a general assignment reporter based in New York. During her tenure, she served as an anchor of America’s News HQ from 2011 to 2013, as well as helped launch FOX & Friends FIRST, where she has been a co-host for nearly five years. Prior to joining FNC, Childers served as a weekday evening anchor for News 14 Carolina (YNN 14) in Charlotte, NC.

Childers began her career as a producer at WCNC-TV (NBC 22) in Charlotte, NC. She graduated from the University of North Carolina with a B.A. in English.

Jillian Mele joined FNC from Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia (CSN Philly) in March 2017. While with CSN Philly, she earned an Emmy Award for her co-host role on the local morning news program, Breakfast on Broad. Earlier in her career, Mele spent seven years with WCAU-TV (NBC 10) in Philadelphia, PA and reported in various capacities, including as a news, sports and traffic reporter. She got her on-air start as a local news anchor for stations in Presque Isle, Maine, and Binghamton, NY. Mele received a B.A. in arts and communication from La Salle University.

Rob Schmitt was named a weekend news anchor and general assignment reporter at FNC in June 2016 and has served as a substitute anchor for various programs including FOX & Friends First, and FOX Report. Prior to joining FNC, he was an anchor for WNBC-TV (NBC 4) in New York, helming the 12 Noon News while also contributing reports to the 5PM/ET and 6PM/ET news programs. Before joining WNBC-TV, Schmitt worked as an anchor and reporter for CBS2/KCAL9 (CBS) in Los Angeles, CA, and began his career at WPLG-TV (ABC) in Miami, FL. A native of Indiana, Schmitt received a B.A. from the Ernie Pyle School of Journalism at Indiana University.

The company has stepped up its efforts to cooperate with investigators after it was criticized for not taking congressional probes seriously enough.



The handover occurred this week, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.



What remains unclear is whether posts associated with those accounts have been deleted from Twitter's servers. Politico reported on Friday that the company had deleted the tweets in line with its privacy policy. Twitter had no comment on that report.

The company's policy calls for removing tweets that a user deletes on their own. But that policy also states that some tweets can survive the process. For instance, retweets of deleted tweets will remain live if the retweeter added a comment. Twitter also can't remove tweets that have been temporarily stored, or ""cached,"" by services such as Google or reposted on other sites.



Twitter might be able to recover some information about any deleted tweets, according to another person familiar with the situation who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation. That person added that the company is working with investigators to find information that's useful.



The account handles previously hadn't been submitted in part due to legal privacy issues, the person said.



Twitter is set to appear Nov. 1 before the Senate intelligence committee at a public hearing. Both Facebook and Google have been invited to testify at the same hearing.



Twitter previously uncovered the accounts linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency -- a notorious ""troll farm"" known for pushing out pro-Russian positions via fake accounts -- by using information provided by Facebook, which found 470 Russia-linked pages or accounts. After looking for patterns linking those accounts and pages to accounts on its service, Twitter said it had suspended 22 accounts that pushed divisive social or political issues during the 2016 campaign.

FOX NEWS - President Donald Trump plans to halt payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care law also known as ObamaCare.

It’s the latest effort in the president’s bid to ultimately “repeal and replace” what’s considered the signature legislation of his White House predecessor.

Word of Trump’s latest plan came from two people familiar with the decision, who spoke to the Associated Press. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The White House said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the Obamacare law.

Trump's decision was expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces. The president has previously threatened to end the payments, which help reduce health insurance copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes, but remain under a legal cloud.

Trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Pushback expected

The president's action will likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general, who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law, and the president's position is reckless. Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, called the decision “sabotage,” and promised a lawsuit.","Trump to Halt ObamaCare Subsidies, Legal Fight Likely",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/13/trump-halt-obamacare-subsidies-legal-fight-likely

Trump last week told reporters he wished Tillerson would be “tougher.”

""You cannot publicly castrate your own secretary of state"" - Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee

“We have a very good relationship,” Trump told reporters. “We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes I'd like him to be a little bit tougher. But other than that, we have a very good relationship.”

Trump also told reporters recently that he and Tillerson have ""a little bit of a different attitude on North Korea than other people might have” but “ultimately my attitude is the one that matters.""

Speaking last month in China, which wants Washington to resume a full dialogue with Pyongyang, Tillerson fueled speculation of a new diplomatic effort, acknowledging open channels of communications between the two countries.

But then Trump appeared to undermine his efforts.

""I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,"" Trump tweeted, once again deploying his pet name for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!""

Demand for new passports in Venezuela is at a record high – at least half a million people have been trapped in the South American nation for months as they wait for new travel documents, according to Britain's The Times – as the economic and political crisis in the country continues with no end in sight.

In August, neighboring Colombia reported that 58,000 Venezuelans immigrated to the country in August, three times the monthly average at the beginning of 2017, to escape the world’s worst recession, soaring violent crime rates and an increasingly volatile political situation.

The passport shortage, which was first announced back in March, is only the latest item to be added to the list of scarcities in Venezuela.

In Caracas and elsewhere, Venezuelans have struggled for months – and in some cases years – to get hold of supplies ranging from vital medications to toilet paper to basic foodstuffs. A video recently went viral of a starving homeless women in the Venezuelan resort town on Rio Chico, about 80 miles east of Caracas, skinning and eating a cat in front of a shocked crowd.

Even those Venezuelans who have a valid passport will have a tough time traveling abroad as the country’s official currency, the bolivar, has basically become worthless, with one bolívar being worth about 10 cents in the U.S.

Venezuela’s political upheaval and crumbling economy – the value of a bolívar in now worth less than the fake gold used in the popular online role-playing game “World of Warcraft” – has also caused a number of major airlines to stop flights to and from the country.

In July, Colombian Avianca stopped service to Venezuela and Delta Air Lines said it plans to suspend service in November. These two join a group of some of the largest airlines in the world to stop flights to Venezuela – United, LATAM, Lufthansa, Aeromexico and Air Canada are just a few

There are now only 10 international airlines that maintain service to Venezuela: American Airlines, Air Europa, Air France, Caribbean Airlines, Copa Airlines, Cubana, Iberia, Latin American Wings, Tame, TAP and Turkish Airlines.

“This is a real tragedy for every Venezuelan,” Jason Marczak, director of the Latin America Economic Growth Initiative at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, told Fox News. “Commercial flights are critical for Venezuelans who have the ability to leave the country and for those who lobby for help from abroad.”

Home to the world’s largest oil reserves, Venezuela was for decades an economic leader in the Western hemisphere and, despite a massive gap between rich and poor, was a major destination for neighboring Colombians and other Latin Americans fleeing their less prosperous and more troubled homelands.

But in 1999 with the rise to power of the late Hugo Chávez – whose social and economic reforms initially endeared him to the poor but also set up an unsustainable system of state spending – Venezuela’s economy began to creep toward a crisis.

The situation has been exacerbated by Maduro, Chávez’s successor, who took power in 2013, and by a plunge in global oil prices in 2015. The International Monetary Fund projects Venezuela’s inflation rate could reach 720 percent this year, and 93 percent of Venezuelans said their income was not sufficient to buy the food they need, according to a study by some of country’s top universities.

Far from derailing Maduro, the Venezuelan leader appeared emboldened by the sanctions, praising those accused by the U.S. government of undermining the nation's democracy and abusing human rights.

""We don't recognize any sanction,"" he said. ""For us, it's a recognition of morality, loyalty to the nation and civic honesty.""",Venezuela extends expired passports for two years amid paper and ink shortages,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/13/venezuela-extends-expired-passports-for-two-years-amid-paper-and-ink-shortages.html

How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business?
Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does.
It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging.","Just last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intention to dedicate an extra $144 million towards fighting the opioid crisis – a decision which, while helpful, is long overdue. Substance abuse, and opioid abuse in particular, continues to wreak havoc on this country. Ninety-one Americans die each day from opioid abuse, and drug offenders make up the large part of our nation’s incarcerated population.

It’s a health care problem, it’s a criminal justice problem – but it’s also a family problem, and it’s one that is especially challenging for families who run a family business. I’ve spent all of my life and much of my career observing and advising family businesses, and time and time again I’ve seen that substance abuse plays a large role in the sad fact that 70 percent of family-owned businesses don’t make it past one generation. The collateral damage when a family business falls apart extends to the employees, the stockholders, the lenders, the suppliers, the customers, and even the tax base and economic health of the entire community.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business. A longtime friend of mine recently confided in me his sorrow over his two sons, both of whom had been doing wonderfully in college – until they discovered alcohol and quickly become addicted.

My friend tried putting his sons in treatment programs, but it didn’t work. He tried tough love, but his kids wound up hating him. His business prospered, but today his children won’t speak to him. He can’t hand his business on to them, his hoped-for legacy is in tatters, and much of what gave his life meaning has vaporized. What good, he asks himself, does it do to succeed financially and fail as a family?

I was deeply saddened by my friend’s story, but even more saddened to learn that he’s not alone.

One study found that more than half of family businesses had or were struggling with an addiction issue within the family. This may sound shocking, but it stacks up with other statistics: One in ten Americans have struggled with some kind of drug abuse and one in eight with alcohol abuse. Many American families don’t know whether their life’s work will live beyond them into the next generation or whether addiction and substance abuse will have the final say.

So – what to do? How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business? How to avoid heartbreaking situations like the one my friend found himself in?

There’s no one single answer, and even among healthy families, things will look different. But I’ve generally found that among the families that last, three core values were emphasized:

Be clear. Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does. Parents have far more influence than they know. According to Joe Califano, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter and the founder of the Center on Addiction and Substance (CASA), “Parent power is the greatest weapon we have to curb substance abuse.”

He encourages parents to emphasize that substance abuse is not simply illegal but seriously dangerous, and to take the same attitude towards it that they do towards asbestos. Most parents would be in an uproar if they found out their child’s school has asbestos, but are willing to let substance abuse in school slide. And kids respond to this kind of clear condemnation: Those who know their parents would be “very upset” are more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol than those who know their parents would only be “a little” or “not upset at all.”

Be together. Oftentimes, risky behaviors result from unloving homes. When children do not feel loved and valued by their parents, they are far more likely to look for love elsewhere – and oftentimes, that means succumbing to peer pressure to win admiration and acceptance.

Simply spending time together – without screens and without distractions – will increase family bonding and a child’s sense of worth and belonging. CASA found that teens who eat dinner with their parents fewer than three nights each week are more susceptible to smoking, drinking and drug abuse than those who eat with their parents five nights or more each week.

Be fun. Teach kids early on that you can have fun and be creative without substances. If they see you getting creative and enjoying yourself without alcohol and drugs, they’re less likely to turn to those things as a way to have fun.

Whatever you do, whether it be sports, board games, arts and crafts, or music, it’s important to intentionally set aside time to do it.

These things are important for all families that want to develop a strong family culture – but they are especially important for parents who themselves come from families that struggle with substance abuse. Creating a stable family is particularly hard when you have genetics and family patterns working against you – but not impossible.

Dr. Falk Lohoff, a scholar at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, argues that “While genetic factors can increase the risk of becoming addicted, they are not deterministic. There are also protective factors.” And one of the biggest protective factors is simple delay. CASA found that with each year of delay in substance use, the likelihood of addiction drops.

By putting the hard work in now of establishing clear values, spending quality time together and having creative, clean fun, you can create the kind of culture where your children will not only be able to perpetuate the family business, but will actually want to work for you and with you. It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging. ​",Mitzi Perdue: Substance abuse is sinking America's family businesses.

Goodell is not the only person to use a secret social media account to combat bad press. Last month, it was discovered NBA star Kevin Durant reportedly used secret social media accounts as well.

Goodell and the NFL have been embroiled in a debate involving players protesting during the playing of the national anthem. President Trump has repeatedly waded into the matter, making it a national issue. Last month, Trump told a rally in Alabama that owners should get rid of players who kneel during the anthem.

On Tuesday, Goodell said in a letter to team owners he believed players should stand for the national anthem, adding the league may consider a rule change requiring players to stand.

While he noted that the Like button succeeds at some things like drawing attention to a friend’s interests or acting as a catalyst for “positive sentiment,” it also results in gobs of “time wasted” when looking at videos that “don’t nourish your life” or are just constant distractions that are unproductive and disruptive.

This topic was recently highlighted in The Guardian, which said that smartphone use (and technology in general) is not just addictive, but it contributes to “continuous partial attention,” wreaking havoc on people’s ability to focus and potentially making them dumber.

“One recent study showed that the mere presence of smartphones damages cognitive capacity – even when the device is turned off,” the article noted.

Many of these early technologists are now “weaning themselves off their own products” and teaching their children to put down iPhones, iPads, and laptops, the Guardian added. However, the problem is large technology companies often define success as “time spent on site,” Rosenstein wrote.

Use versus abuse

""You need to define addiction. A lot of people just like to use the technology a lot"" but aren't necessarily addicted, Nir Eyal, author of ""Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products,"" who has taught at Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School, told Fox News.

""If you throw around this word 'addiction,' it really hurts people. It disempowers people to take control of it. 'It's not my fault, it's the technology's fault.'"" Eyal said, adding if you shirk personal responsibility, you're more likely to relapse.

But companies do have a ""moral imperative"" to at least try to help real addicts. ""We have personally identifiable information who is using and who is abusing,"" he said.

For example, a company could have a policy where ""if you use our product more than X number of hours per week, we're going to reach out to and ask if we can help you,"" he said. And if they are receptive and accept the offer for help, then the company can step in, he said.

Bush in the annual Warrior 100K mountain bike ride has a personal story of overcoming adversity. Warriors and civilians alike train for months for the privilege of challenging the rocky switchback single-track trails on Bush’s Texas ranch. The ride has its own momentum, and each year it is more about the networks that are forming and the obstacles being overcome than the physical challenge of the ride itself.

Out on the trail, the veterans ride in a kind of formation, banding together to assist someone who falls or has difficulty. Self-appointed supervisors, who must have been officers in war, bark out orders to start and stop. I am proud that my training allowed me to make it all the way up the challenging windy trail called Waterfall, over the narrow bridges and around the ridge in the lowest gear, and that I completed the two-day event on Sunday without falling.

But this ride wasn’t about me.

Many of the warriors who participate in the 100K carry incredible stories of courage and fortitude. President Bush said he was proud of retired Maj. Peter Way, who lost most of his right leg in Afghanistan and is transitioning from a hand cycle to a pedal-assisted e-bike with the help of a special leg prosthesis. He injured his back during the first day of this year’s ride, but he was back the next day, enduring intense pain, with the support of his brethren in Team 43, to ride at the conclusion of the event.

Research has shown that at least 20 percent of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression, but less than half seek help.

The theme this year was the Bush Institute’s new Warrior Wellness Alliance, which approaches the debilitating invisible wounds of war (traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress) with the wisdom that no one knows how to help a vet like another vet.

As President Bush told me in an interview, “One, admit you got a problem. Pretty logical. If a vet kind of keeps it in inside, no one will understand what I think, no one can possibly relate to what I feel like, and doesn’t share, obviously that leads to negative consequences.

“Secondly, when you seek help, you and I can be … we can be sympathetic. But we can’t possibly relate to what it’s like to see a friend killed in combat. And yet there are others who can. And here in this group, people have progressed from severe depression, a severe case of PTS, to a moderate case. In some cases, a light case of it, and they can share with their pal what it took. And so it’s logical, and it works.”

The Warrior Wellness Alliance focuses on the roles of spouses and caregivers, and it connects peer-to-peer veteran networks with expert health care providers around the country. The Stephen A. Cohen Military Family Clinics are heavily involved, including the one at my own medical center. Research has shown that at least 20 percent of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression, but less than half seek help.

The alliance hopes to help overcome this by building support systems like Team 43, which come together at sports events like the bike ride and share stories, struggles and hopes.

One of the most inspiring stories involves Marine Cpl. Dave Smith, who spoke at the first Warrior 100K mountain bike ride that I attended in 2012 and returned this year to ride with the alumni. He wears a haunted expression in President Bush’s evocative portrait in his book Portraits of Courage.

In Iraq in 2004, Smith’s unit came under heavy fire, and while trying to defend his position, he accidentally shot a fellow Marine in the leg. He has suffered for it ever since. He once put a shotgun in his mouth and almost pulled the trigger. He stopped himself at the last minute, thinking of a fellow vet who committed suicide and hurt many who cared about him.

Smith’s motto now is “Never give up.” He says he has sustained post-traumatic growth and that his heavy networking with fellow vets has helped him rebuild his life.

“A lot of it had to do with serving other people,” President Bush told me. “He got his spirit back, now married, and seems great.”

The Sun Herald reported that the book was pulled from the lesson plan because the novel contained “the N word.”

A message on the school's website says ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" teaches students that compassion and empathy don't depend upon race or education.

School board vice president Kenny Holloway says other books can teach the same lessons.

However, the book will still be available in Biloxi school libraries.

The novel, published in 1960, chronicled the adventures of Jean Louise Finch aka Scout and her brother Jeremy aka Jem and the racial inequality that existed in their small Alabama town. The book followed a court case their father, Atticus, was involved in.

In the story, Atticus defended Tom Robinson, a black man who was accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a young white woman. Despite strong evidence of Robinson’s innocence, he was found guilty of raping Ewell.

The book was adapted into a movie in 1962, starring Gregory Peck, who won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Atticus Finch.

The Sun Herald reported the novel was listed at No. 21 on the American Library Association’s most “banned or challenged books list in the last decade.”

He said the Haqqani network, which held him and his wife captive for five years, had killed his infant daughter in captivity and raped his wife.

Boyle landed in Canada late Friday with his American wife and three young children.

The couple was rescued Wednesday, five years after they had been abducted by the Taliban-linked extremist network while in Afghanistan as part of a backpacking trip.

Coleman was pregnant at the time and had four children in captivity. The birth of the fourth child had not been publicly known before Boyle appeared before journalists at the Toronto airport.



""The stupidity and evil of the Haqqani network's kidnapping of a pilgrim and his heavily pregnant wife engaged in helping ordinary villagers in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan was eclipsed only by the stupidity and evil of authorizing the murder of my infant daughter,"" he said.

Boyle said his wife was raped by a guard who was assisted by his superiors. He asked for the Afghan government to bring them to justice.

He said he was in Afghanistan to help villagers ""who live deep inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where no NGO, no aid worker and no government has ever successfully been able to bring the necessary help.""

After returning to his parents' home in Smiths Falls, Ontario, on Saturday, Boyle emailed The Associated Press with a new statement saying they had ""reached the first true 'home' that the children have ever known - after they spent most of Friday asking if each subsequent airport was our new house hopefully.""

""Our daughter has had a cursory medical exam last night, and hospital staff were enthusiastically insistent that her chances seemed miraculously high based on a quick physical. Full medical work-ups for each member of my family are being arranged right now, and God-willing the healing process - physically and mentally can begin.""

It was reported earlier that one of his children was in poor health and had to be force-fed by their Pakistani rescuers.

On the plane from London, Boyle provided a written statement to the Associated Press saying his family has ""unparalleled resilience and determination.""

Coleman, who is from Stewartstown, Pa., sat in the aisle of the business class cabin wearing a tan-colored headscarf.

She nodded wordlessly when she confirmed her identity to a reporter on board the flight. In the two seats next to her were her two elder children. In the seat beyond that was Boyle, with their youngest child in his lap. U.S. State Department officials were on the plane with them.

The handwritten statement that Boyle gave the AP expressed disagreement with U.S. foreign policy.

""God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination, and to allow that to stagnate, to pursue personal pleasure or comfort while there is still deliberate and organized injustice in the world would be a betrayal of all I believe, and tantamount to sacrilege,"" he wrote.

He nodded to one of the State Department officials and said, ""Their interests are not my interests.""

The family was able to leave from the plane with their escorts before the rest of the passengers. There was about a 5- to 10-minute delay before everyone else was allowed out.

Dan Boyle, Joshua's younger brother, said outside the family home in Smith Falls, Ontario, that he had spoken to his brother a few times in the past few days.

""He's doing very well. He sounds a lot like how he sounded five years ago. He sounds like he had his head on his shoulders and his wits about him,"" he said.



The Canadian government said in a statement they will ""continue to support him and his family now that they have returned.""

""Today, we join the Boyle family in rejoicing over the long-awaited return to Canada of their loved ones,"" the Canadian government said.

Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria said the Pakistani raid that led to the family's rescue was based on a tip from U.S. intelligence and shows that Pakistan will act against a ""common enemy"" when Washington shares information.

U.S. officials have long accused Pakistan of ignoring groups like the Haqqani network, which was holding the family.



A U.S. national security official, who was not authorized to discuss operational details of the release and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. obtained actionable information, passed it to Pakistani government officials, asked them to interdict and recover the hostages -- and they did.

On Friday, President Donald Trump, who previously warned Pakistan to stop harboring militants, praised Pakistan for its ""cooperation on many fronts."" On Twitter, he wrote that the U.S. is starting to develop ""a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders.""



The operation appeared to have unfolded quickly and ended with what some described as a dangerous raid, a shootout and a captor's final, terrifying threat to ""kill the hostage."" Boyle told his parents that he, his wife and their children were intercepted by Pakistani forces while being transported in the back or trunk of their captors' car and that some of his captors were killed. He suffered only a shrapnel wound, his family said.



U.S. officials did not confirm those details.



A U.S. military official said that a military hostage team had flown to Pakistan on Wednesday prepared to fly the family out. The team did a preliminary health assessment and had a transport plane ready to go, but sometime after daybreak Thursday, as the family members were walking to the plane, Boyle said he did not want to board, the official said.



Boyle's father said his son did not want to board the plane because it was headed to Bagram Air Base and the family wanted to return directly to North America. Another U.S. official said Boyle was nervous about being in ""custody"" given his family ties.



He was once married to Zaynab Khadr, the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a senior al-Qaida financier. Her father, the late Ahmed Said Khadr, and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy.



The Canadian-born Omar Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a firefight and was taken to the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay. Officials had discounted any link between that background and Boyle's capture, with one official describing it in 2014 as a ""horrible coincidence.""



The U.S. Justice Department said neither Boyle nor Coleman is wanted for any federal crime.



U.S. officials call the Haqqani group a terrorist organization and have targeted its leaders with drone strikes. But the group also operates like a criminal network. Unlike the Islamic State group, it does not typically execute Western hostages, preferring to ransom them for cash.



The Haqqani network had previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, a son of the founder of the group, in exchange for turning over the American-Canadian family. In one of the videos released by their captors, Boyle implored the Afghan government not to execute Taliban prisoners, or he and his wife would be killed.



U.S. officials have said that several other Americans are being held by militant groups in Afghanistan or Pakistan.



They include Kevin King, 60, a teacher at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul who was abducted in August 2016, and Paul Overby, an author in his 70s who had traveled to the region several times but disappeared in eastern Afghanistan in mid-2014.



The family had left Pakistan on a commercial flight after Boyle reportedly balked at taking a U.S. plane out of Pakistan, fearing that his background could land him in the American detention center at Guantanamo Bay.

During my years of painting people’s homes, I’ve learned that small spaces don’t have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home’s exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

RELATED: What Color Works Best in a Traditional-Style Bathroom?

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I’ve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home’s overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home’s design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn’t too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it’s between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room’s features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

8. Laundry room. You can’t avoid the task of laundry, so at least make it a room that is easy on the eyes and generates positivity. Think of a paint color you would never dream of using in the social areas of your home but would make you happy, such as a playful orange, a bold purple or a sunshine yellow. Who knows, being around your favorite color might even make the chore a little more enjoyable.",Transform a whole house by painting these 8 small spaces,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/22/transform-whole-house-by-painting-these-8-small-spaces.html

The Denison Police Department enjoys great support from most of our community and our businesses. I get it, especially with the anti-police rhetoric from the national media and police-hate groups we see in the country, that many people buy into that rhetoric and dislike police. Most of those that I have come across in my career that hate cops are very familiar with us because many have a lengthy history of arrests or have friends or family members with such a history. I get all this and we get used to it for the most part.

But when two of my officers were refused service by an employee of a local restaurant on October 14 just after midnight, then cursed by that employee and the on-duty manager’s only response is, “I don’t get into politics,” that concerns me.

If a business does not want police officers as customers, just let us know. There’s no need to curse us and make a scene, just let us know you don’t want us there and we’ll go somewhere else.

Now going somewhere else in Denison in the middle of the night is not easy because our officers don’t have many options. What really gets my goat with such an incident is that while most of us are sleeping – sleeping! -- the officers are out there working hard to keep us safe and when trying to take a break to eat – they face this type of reception from an employee of a local business and management calls it “politics”? The employee also said she would continue to refuse to serve officers.

Now we know. And rest assured officers will no longer patronize this business. Many of the officers also fear food-tampering with an attitude like this from such an employee.

As we most always try to do when there is a conflict, a police supervisor went to the restaurant and asked to speak to the employee in an effort to understand why she felt the way she did toward police.

The employee alleged “cops beat up my boyfriend and are racists.”

When questioned further, the employee said her boyfriend was “beat up” when arrested by DPD a few weeks ago.

The police supervisor went to the station and found the documentation of the arrest, then reviewed the video or audio of the arrest from the arresting officer’s dash cam.

It was a “routine” arrest. There was no physical altercation and no one [was] injured.

So the employee was simply lying about her boyfriend getting “beat up” by police.

I’ve seen similar service refusal stories like this around the state and country but never thought we’d see it locally.

Yet, while disappointing that this one business takes or supports such an anti-police stance, we relish in the fact the majority of the Denison businesses and citizens we serve greatly support us and what we do to try to keep our community safe.

Oh, one last thing -- Even though this one business accepts employees that refuse to serve and then curse cops, I guarantee you when they call 911 and need us, we’ll come running.

The company does not outright mention President Donald Trump’s immigration policy in the costume description, but the getup has led many social media users to comment that it’s a reference to his border wall proposal.

The costume, which features bricks with the words “the wall” on the front, is advertised online as a “unique Halloween look.”

“Really @PartyCity? A “Build The Wall” costume?” wrote on Twitter user. “This isn’t about being politically correct, it’s about being decent [sic] human beings!!!!!”

Another furious user tweeted, “If I see anyone wearing a “The Wall” costume, fair warning, you’re getting punched. Like hard.”

Others, however, suggested that the costume was referencing Pink Floyd.

“This is not a racist costume,” argued a Twitter user. “It’s just a reference to Pink Floyd’s ‘The Wall’ album cover.”

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water. Do not use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning products on a clay pot.",Essential cleaning tips for the 7 most popular cookware materials,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/essential-cleaning-tips-for-7-most-popular-cookware-materials.html

HARVEY WEINSTEIN ACCUSATIONS CAUSE CHAOS IN HOLLYWOOD“Anybody can do what they want to do.","Bob Weinstein dubbed his brother, Harvey, a “predator” and said he hoped the disgraced Hollywood producer “gets the justice that he deserves.”

Bob Weinstein, 62, who founded Weinstein Co. with his brother Harvey, 65, told The Hollywood Reporter in an intense interview released Saturday morning the situation was “a waking nightmare.”

“I find myself in a waking nightmare. My brother has caused unconscionable suffering. As a father of three girls I say this with every bone in my body — I am heartbroken for the women that he has harmed. I'm a fighter,” Weinstein told The Hollywood Reporter.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN SEX SCANDAL: DETAILING THE ALLEGATIONS

“This hurts, but I don’t feel an ounce of remorse coming from him, and that kills me too,” he continued. “When I heard his written, lame excuse. Not an excuse. When I heard his admission of feeling remorse for the victims and then him cavalierly, almost crazily saying he was going to go out and take on the NRA, it was so disturbing to me. It was utter insanity. My daughters all felt sick hearing this because we understood he felt nothing. I don’t feel he feels anything to this day. I don’t.”

Harvey Weinstein came under fire after The New York Times released an expose on Oct. 5 that detailed decades of sexual harassment allegations made against the Hollywood producer by actresses and employees. On Tuesday, the New Yorker reported the movie mogul had sexually assaulted three women.

Following the bombshell allegations, a number of A-list stars came out to condemn the producer and some, such as Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, told their own uncomfortable experiences with Weinstein.

When The Hollywood Reporter asked Bob how he did not know of his brother’s misconduct, Weinstein said he had spoken to Harvey only a few times “on any personal level” in the last five years. However, Bob said he was aware of Harvey “philandering with every woman he could meet.”

“I was sick and disgusted by his actions. But that's the extent of what [I knew]. I said, “Harvey, you're just cheating. Why do you constantly cheat?” I could see it. But I wasn't in the room with him,” Bob Weinstein said.

“For me, I thought he was literally just going out there cheating in a pervasive way,” Bob said. “It wasn’t like he even had a mistress. It was one after another and that I was aware of. But as far as being in a room and hearing the description in “The New York Times?” No way. No f-----g way was I aware that that was the type of predator that he was. And the way he convinced people to do things? I thought they were all consensual situations.”

“I have a brother that’s indefensible and crazy,” Bob said. “I want him to get the justice that he deserves.”

Bob went on to say his brother was a “bully,” “arrogant” and “treated people like s—t all the time.”

Bob said employees would come into his office in tears due to something Harvey said to them.

On Sunday, Harvey was fired from the Weinstein Company. Bob confirmed he was on the board that fired his brother. Harvey planned to fight the firing.

“Anybody can do what they want to do. I cannot control other people’s actions. But he was fired by the board, okay? I was on that board. I fired him. He can fight. It will be a losing fight,” Weinstein said.

Weinstein said he was going to change the company’s name and he was still planning on the future of the studio’s shares.

Bob Weinstein told the media outlet he was personally going to write a letter to the Academy to get Harvey booted and would be cooperating with police in their investigation.

Weinstein concluded that he felt “mortified” and “disgusted” by Harvey’s actions and he was “sick” for the victims.

“I'm mortified and disgusted by my brother's actions. And I am sick for the victims. And I feel for them. I feel for them.”

Byström followed up on her original post, letting her fans know that while she doesn't actually feel as though she's in danger, she does find the language people were using toward her to be concerning.

“I do think it is a problem that men use sexually violent language when women [don't] abide,” she wrote. “I mainly get concerned for the women that [have] to be around these men, because having that kind of abusive language coming from somebody that you know or are physically around you is very painful and damaging.”

Adidas originally posted the ad featuring Byström to their Instagram page, praising the model and artist for her photography, “which questions femininity and gender standards using so-called ‘girly’ aesthetics.”

While many people were praised the photo, defending Byström’s choice to not shave her legs, others were quick to judge, leaving comments like “I’m attracted to girls not monkeys,” and “hairy legs = gross.”

Weinstein has been accused in a lengthy New York Times story of doing some truly horrendous things to women, totally unsolicited − also known as sexual harassment − over a period of nearly three decades. His alleged victims were talented young actresses and other women who had the potential to build successful careers on their own without some ugly, creepy man coercing them into giving him a massage or worse.

Gross.

But this is Hollywood, and the feminists are the women who defend creeps like Weinstein.

Anita Dunn, a close associate of President Obama who became his communications director for a time at the White House, has been reported to have counseled Weinstein after the allegations broke in the media.

Even more troubling is that celebrity women’s advocate attorney Lisa Bloom is representing Weinstein. This is a woman who has represented victims in high-profile sexual harassment cases. Throwing that legacy away, she agreed to represent Weinstein, whom she said she has counseled that “times have changed” and he “needs to evolve into a higher standard.” Really?

Bloom’s reasoning regarding Weinstein gets better, though: “He has acknowledged mistakes he has made. He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways. He wants to reach out to any of the women who may have issues with him to talk to them in a respectful, peaceful way, with me present if that is acceptable to them.”

I hope Bloom has a better answer for the women who Weinstein is accused of sexually harassing and forcing to look at him half-clothed or with no clothes at all, with tears in their eyes, as he emotionally blackmailed them for sex.

But this is Hollywood. This is Hugh Hefner’s world. This is the liberal paradise of promoting equal rights and justice for women, yet defending the men who use them for their own satisfaction, discarding them for younger versions every year, and then complaining about it years later when the women finally have the courage to say “enough!”

This is not true feminism. Supporting men who tear down women for their own use, supporting free access to taxpayer-funded abortion so men can cover up their own conduct, and mistreating women for decades is nothing for women to get behind.

The blast occurred two days after the head of the U.S. Africa Command was in Mogadishu to meet with Somalia’s president, and two days after the country’s defense minister and army chief resigned.

“Like most women in these situations I didn’t say anything but I have thought a lot about what I’d say if I ever saw him again,” she concluded.

Comedy writer Jen Statsky corroborated Tendler’s account, tweeting, “I was also at this party and *multiple* friends had this same exact experience.”



On Tuesday night, Burton, 35, tweeted that she “didn’t forget” Affleck “tweaking” her left breast during an MTV taping in 2003, when she was a VJ on the network.

Affleck, who came under fire for his denouncement of alleged serial sexual harasser and rapist Harvey Weinstein, tweeted Wednesday, “I acted inappropriately toward Ms. Burton and I sincerely apologize.”

A source told Page Six that while the Oscar winner isn’t perfect, he isn’t a monster, noting, “Any allusion that he’s anywhere close to Harvey Weinstein is absurd and could be considered defamatory,” adding that it’s frustrating that McGowan “questioned [Affleck’s] ability to tell the truth.”

A rep for Affleck declined to comment.

Police were sent to the scene after receiving a report of an alarm going off Tuesday morning.

When deputies arrived at the apartment, Waddell opened the door with blood splattered on his feet and his hands.

Deputies searched the apartment where they found Corvino dead in his bed. Waddell was detained following the discovery of Corvino’s body.

The Orlando Sentinel reported there were cameras in the apartment which captured the moments leading up to the shooting but not the slaying itself.

Deputies said they “believed the fired shots set off the alarms, which turned on the cameras.”

The video showed Waddell shifting Corvinos’s body to the edge of the bed and looking at him for a few minutes, deputies told the Orlando Sentinel.

Waddell said he and Corvino spent time together the night before in the apartment.

Waddell told deputies he was “mentally disabled” and took a few medications before he went to bed. It was not clear what medications he took.

The famed Chicago Bears coach came under fire for making the comments during a radio interview on Monday about NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. He issued an apology the next day, saying he was talking about professional football and not society as a whole.

“I have absolutely seen oppression in society in the last 100 years,” the Hall of Fame tight end and Super Bowl-winning coach said in statement to WGN-TV in Chicago. “The interview was about the NFL and related issues. That’s where my head was at.”

The interview aired before the Chicago Bears played the Minnesota Vikings on Monday night.

The 77-year-old old Ditka previously has made harsh comments about players who take a knee, which has sparked fierce debate about issues such as patriotism and protest. He said he would bench players who didn’t stand during the anthem.

“There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of,” he said.

By Felicia Schwartz, The Wall Street Journal



WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is expected to announce on Friday that he won’t certify Iran is complying with the 2015 multinational nuclear agreement and will take Tehran to task more broadly for practices ranging from missile tests to support of violent groups, U.S. officials said.

The refusal to certify Iran’s compliance doesn’t mean the U.S. will pull out of the deal, the officials added, and Mr. Trump isn’t expected to ask Congress to re-impose economic sanctions that had been lifted as part of the agreement. But it could send the White House down a road of trying to change a deal that U.S. allies still support.

Mr. Trump, a longtime opponent of the accord negotiated under his predecessor’s administration, is expected to announce his decision in a speech in which he will also lay out plans to crack down on Iran’s missile program and its support for Hezbollah and other militant groups in the Middle East, the officials said.

Mr. Trump is also likely to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran’s elite military branch, as a terrorist organization, a step that has been the subject of internal administration debates, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

Iran vowed a “crushing” response if the U.S. takes that step.

The venue for Mr. Trump’s remarks was the subject of debate as well. Officials said they had discussed the possibility of the speech taking place in front of the unoccupied Iranian Embassy in Washington, although that plan was set aside.

Mr. Trump’s speech will mark the end of a months-long Iran policy review by the administration and begin an uncertain process under which Congress has 60 days to consider on an expedited basis reinstating sanctions that had been lifted under the terms of the nuclear accord.

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor.

The White House said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the Obamacare law.

Trump's decision was expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces. The president has previously threatened to end the payments, which help reduce health insurance copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes, but remain under a legal cloud.

Trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Pushback expected

The president's action will likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general, who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law, and the president's position is reckless. Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, called the decision “sabotage,” and promised a lawsuit.","Trump to Halt ObamaCare Subsidies, Legal Fight Likely",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/13/trump-halt-obamacare-subsidies-legal-fight-likely#commenting

But after a few moments of silence, it was announced the PA system failed – and there would be no playing of the Anthem.

Trinity senior fullback Ethan Suraci told Fox News the silence “felt like forever, honestly. You could hear the crowd and the opposing team” expressing disappointment over the announcement.

Suraci said he immediately started belting out the words to what he calls “America’s song,” which also happens to be his favorite song, and it seemed everyone joined in.

""There were almost three different waves of the Star-Spangled Banner going,” Coach Devanney said. Trinity’s team, Hamilton’s team, and the crowd each had started singing “almost like an echo,” but he added, “It all seemed to end on the same note.”

“It was a fantastic display of unity and patriotism and gave everyone in the crowd, the teams, and hopefully those who watch the video; chills of hope for a better United States of America and happiness to see us as a society beginning to heal - despite the polarization we see among the citizens and our politicians,” Suraci said.

The incident came a day before Vice President Mike Pence’s decision to leave Sunday’s NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers, when several 49er players kneeled during the Anthem.

Coach Devanney said he discussed the NFL protests with his team, calling it a “complicated issue.”

President Trump tweeted Wednesday it’s “about time” NFL’s Goodell called on players to stand for the national anthem.

The senior political science major, who identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump, agrees.

“I am in total agreement with one's constitutional right to protest. However, these players are protesting in an incorrect forum,” he said. “Why insult an entire country and all those who fell for her?”

As reported by sources for the New York Post, the Obamas are apparently waiting for 10 Gracie Square’s housing board to approve the purchase of a unit in the building, which has been home to such famous folks as Gloria Vanderbilt, Anderson Cooper, and former first lady of China Madame Chiang Kai-shek — but it’s also got quite a tragic past, the Post reports.

SEE THE NYC TOWNHOUSE WHERE OBAMA LIVED AFTER COLLEGE

The building has been the site of two very high-profile suicides in the last 30 years, which is enough to make even a New York City real-estate agent think twice about living there.

“I don’t know of any buildings with two suicides,” said Dolly Lenz, CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, in a statement to the New York Post. “It almost says that there is a cloud on the building.”

The first victim of these tragedies was Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old son of Gloria Vanderbilt and the older brother of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. According to reports, Carter was acting strangely in the months leading up to his suicide, but had been in therapy. Then, on July 22, 1988, during a visit to his mother’s home, he abruptly ran out onto the terrace of his Vanderbilt’s two-story penthouse apartment, hopped over the ledge, and dangled there before letting himself drop from the 14th floor — all while Vanderbilt watched from feet away.

""He let go, and there was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him,” Vanderbilt remembered during a 2011 appearance of Anderson Cooper’s talk series.

In Vanderbilt’s 1997 book, “A Mother’s Story,” she also alleged that Carter’s suicide may have triggered by an allergy to medication.

The second, much more recent suicide at 10 Grace Square took place in April 2017, and claimed the life of author, heiress and socialite Jean Stein. Stein, whose works include “Edie: An American Girl” and “West of Eden,” had reportedly been suffering from depression, according to her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, and jumped from the 15th floor of the building on April 30, the New York Times reported in its obituary.

A fellow resident who witnessed the suicide has said it was a messy one, as Stein “miscalculated” the jump and landed an eighth-floor terrace. She had also severed her leg in the fall, according to reports.

10 Gracie Square, however, is also infamous for more than these two suicides: In 1982, it was also where sixth-floor resident Frances Schreuder was arrested for conspiring with her son Marco to kill Schreuder’s father, wealthy Utah businessman Franklin Bradshaw.

Schreuder had reportedly been unhappy with the amount of money Bradshaw was allotting her, and persuaded her then-17-year-old son to shoot his grandfather dead in 1978. He was eventually caught, and Schreuder was nabbed while trying to escape out the window of her 10 Gracie Square abode.

“Health Insurance stocks, which have gone through the roof during the ObamaCare years, plunged yesterday after I ended their Dems windfall!” Trump tweeted Saturday morning.

Trump argues the executive order he signed Friday will give millions of Americans more access to affordable health insurance, essentially by allowing them to buy premiums through large-group programs.

“Very proud of my Executive Order which will allow greatly expanded access and far lower costs for HealthCare. Millions of people benefit!” Trump said in a second early morning tweet.

The executive order cuts billions in federal dollars to insurance companies that are used to subsidize consumer costs -- lowering out-of-pocket expenses like co-payments and deductibles for low- and middle-income customers. About 6 million Americans benefit from the subsidies.

Trump and others consider the money a windfall for the companies. However, critics argue that ending them would drastically increase premium costs for millions of Americans because insurers under the 2010 health care law known as ObamaCare are required to lower costs for poorer customers.

So as a result of subsidies cut, carriers are likely to recoup the lost money by increasing premiums for people buying their own health insurance policies.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners estimates that Trump's move would produce a 12 percent to 15 percent upsurge in premiums.

Congressional Democrats, convinced they have important leverage, promised to press for a bipartisan deal to restore the money by year's end. That drive could split the GOP. On one side: pragmatists seeking to avoid political damage from hurting consumers. On the other: conservatives demanding a major weakening of the Affordable Care Act as the price for returning the money.

""The American people will know exactly where to place the blame,"" declared Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), all but daring Trump to aggravate what could be a major issue in the 2018 congressional elections.

Trump acted after the GOP-run Senate failed this summer to repeal and replace ObamaCare, one of his major campaign promises.

The president has long derided the subsidies as bailouts to insurers, even though the payments and the cost reductions for consumers are required by law.

A federal judge has found that Congress never properly approved the payments. The subsidies have continued under Obama and Trump until now, despite prior Trump threats to block them.

Rest in Peace Boy Scouts.","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on The Resurgent.

We all knew this was coming. The Boy Scouts of America stood for over a century on its strong foundation of Judeo-Christian values, growing boys into young men, and young men into leaders. However, in recent years the BSA has allowed cracks to form in that foundation.

From the lifting of the ban on openly gay boys from joining the organization, to the sanctioning of openly gay adult leaders, to the encouragement of so-called “transgendered” boys to join, the BSA’s moral foundation has been rapidly and steadily eroding into dust.

As soon as the BSA changed the definition of the phrase “morally straight” in the generations-old Scout Oath back in 2013, allowing for homosexual membership, we all knew that this first compromise would not be the last. We all knew that it was only a matter of time before the BSA compromised itself into oblivion.

That day has now arrived.

From the BSA’s website:

""Today, the Boy Scouts of America Board of Directors unanimously approved to welcome girls into its iconic Cub Scout program and to deliver a Scouting program for older girls that will enable them to advance and earn the highest rank of Eagle Scout.""

This is incredibly disappointing news, but in light of the BSA’s changes over the last few years, it isn’t at all surprising. It does, however, mark a complete transformation for the organization. The Boy Scouts has always been exclusively for boys. As Ben Shapiro famously noted, it’s in the name.

There are plenty of organizations out there for all different varieties of youth. The Boy Scouts even have several co-ed programs for both boys and girls. The girls already have the Girl Scouts. If the Girl Scouts isn’t working, why not work to fix that organization instead? There is absolutely no need for the Boy Scouts to change who they are to be “inclusive.”

What now separates the Boy Scouts from any other youth organization? The BSA has now effectively rendered obsolete both the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts. If the Boy Scouts is a better youth organization for girls, why would any girl ever want to join the Girl Scouts?

More incredibly, I have to wonder why any parent would want their young teenage girls camping in the woods with young teenage boys? Who exactly is okay with this?

As an Eagle Scout myself, this is an incredibly difficult piece for me to write. My fondest memories from my youth come from my time in Boy Scouts. I learned a great deal about myself, about leadership, and about manhood in those years. The friendships I made with both adult leaders and fellow Scouts can never be replaced. Earning the rank of Eagle Scout in 2002 was the greatest achievement of my life at the time. Another honor was when my beloved Scout troop invited me back to town to participate in its centennial celebration earlier this year. My scouting experiences have guided me throughout my adulthood and will continue to do so.

I now see I was lucky to have been a Boy Scout at that time instead of today. Those experiences would not have been the same had the BSA not been so strict on its membership policies. It is important for boys and young men to grow together free from the distraction of girls.

I suspect the Almighty Dollar now motivates BSA more than the Almighty. Membership (and revenue) has been declining steadily for years. Suddenly membership eligibility is now opened to a whole new demographic. Draw your own conclusions there.

This is what the Left does best: target and destroy everything good in America. They cannot compete with us on ideas, so they have to eliminate everything that makes us who we are. If they were truly motivated to provide girls, homosexuals, and “transgenders,” with the same experiences Boy Scouts provides, then they would form their own youth organization. But it isn’t really about that, is it?

To execute such an aggressive plan for an Aegis-ship ballistic missile defense, some parts of which appear to be already in the works, the U.S. would have to place even greater focus on ballistic missile defense missions.
North Korea will build more missiles and it’s only a matter of time before more countries acquire such weapons.
These include the SBX-1 – a huge golf ball-shaped radar dome mounted on an oil platform that can track ballistic missiles – and additional satellites that can be used to track intercontinental ballistic missiles as they travel through space.","North Korea renewed its threat Friday to fire ballistic missiles in the direction of the American territory of Guam, following ominous earlier threats by the rogue regime to launch missiles topped with hydrogen bombs to wipe out cities on the continental United States.

We need to be prepared to defend against new North Korean missile launches – and there is a way to do this short of full-scale war.

One U.S. military option would be to deploy a special team of two or three guided-missile destroyers – ships especially equipped to target, track and shoot down ballistic missiles – to strategic locations off the North Korean coastline. The ships would be positioned outside the 12-mile internationally recognized maritime territorial limit, or at other locations that intelligence indicates would be effective.

Sources intimately familiar with the operations and deployments of those destroyers – and the vast capabilities of their top-secret ballistic missile defense systems – tell me such a plan could work. They say a similar strategy is one of the military options being considered at the Pentagon and at U.S. Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii. At the very least, this action would increase the costs to North Korea of continuing its missile program.

Erecting what amounts to a destroyer “fence” to contain North Korean missiles and knock them out of the sky might seem like a farfetched scheme. Can a handful of small warships really perform such a huge task?

America’s ballistic missile defense warships are outfitted with systems and weapons that have been proven in rigorous testing, including SM-3 missile interceptors. Since 2002, the Aegis combat system – a powerful weapons system used by the U.S. Navy that utilizes computer and radar technology to find, track and destroy enemy targets – has recorded 35 successful ballistic-missile intercepts in 42 test attempts. And in the last dozen tests, the SM-3s have only missed once.

While U.S. tests of our missile defense system are admittedly choreographed, the characteristics of a targeted ballistic missile in a test situation closely match those of a missile that has been deployed with bad intentions.

Nearly all of the tests pit a single U.S. missile interceptor against a single ballistic missile. Against an actual launch, the Navy could send up numerous interceptors, dramatically increasing its chances for a hit.

Up to now, North Korea has failed to prove it has the capability to launch and control a sufficiently large salvo of missiles to overwhelm a single Aegis ballistic missile defense ship, let alone two or three. Some experts speculate that North Korea, slowed as it is by international economic sanctions, might not develop that capacity until near the end of the decade or beyond.

The U.S. missile destroyers that could be formed into a team and used to knock down North Korean missiles overhead would be those outfitted with the latest version of the four-decades-old Aegis combat system. The newest series of upgrades was certified in January 2015.

All U. S. Navy destroyers and cruisers possess Aegis combat systems, which were first developed to protect ships – especially aircraft carriers – against air threats such as cruise missiles and aircraft.

However, ballistic missile defense requires different sensor settings, algorithms and missiles. Only 40 percent of the U.S. Navy’s Aegis-equipped destroyers and cruisers are designed for ballistic missile defense.

The ballistic missile defense ships depend on SM-3 missile interceptors to blow apart enemy ballistic missiles relatively soon after they enter what’s called flight midcourse, at their most vulnerable point where the atmosphere ends. This starts about 400 miles above the Earth’s surface and extends out to a few thousand miles.

SM-3s have no explosive warhead. Instead they work through sheer force, colliding with the targeted missile with the power of a 10-ton truck traveling 600 miles per hour. For very short-range missiles, SM-2 interceptors can potentially be used. New interceptors, called SM-6s, are being tested that are designed to hit longer-range ballistic missiles later in flight as they descend and re-enter the atmosphere.

Every ballistic missile defense destroyer has the capacity to launch up to 96 missiles. Each ship would have to retain some Aegis capacity for self-defense and that missile number would depend on the mission.

For argument’s sake, assume a destroyer making up part of the “fence” could aim 80 interceptors at a launched North Korean missile. That would mean two ships could unleash a fusillade of 160 missiles and three ships could fire 240. If North Korea were to triple its single-day launch rate, which with sanctions seems extremely difficult, it could possibly send a dozen missiles aloft. In that case, the odds still favor the Aegis interceptors.

Recently North Korea has focused mainly on short- and medium-range missile tests. The North has yet to prove it can launch an intercontinental ballistic missile armed with a payload that can reach the United States, despite its boasts.

If Pyongyang does deploy such missiles and they break though the fence created by U.S. ships and head toward America, the U.S. Air Force could meet them with a total of 36 ground-based interceptors launched from Fort Greely in Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Those interceptors have hit targets in 10 of 18 tests, including the last two in June 2014 and May this year.

To execute such an aggressive plan for an Aegis-ship ballistic missile defense, some parts of which appear to be already in the works, the U.S. would have to place even greater focus on ballistic missile defense missions. American fleet commanders will need to make sure destroyer captains improve their skill in basic seamanship – a proficiency called into question after the Navy recently lost two of its valuable ballistic missile defense destroyers in collisions with commercial ships.

An important step in making the fence operational would be for the U.S. to adopt rules of engagement that allow the Navy destroyers to shoot down North Korean missiles as soon as leave the country’s airspace. Current rules only allow for tracking and monitoring.

If an SM-3 misses, there’s little concern of collateral damage. The interceptor would burn up harmlessly as it reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. Even if an interceptor collided with a nuclear warhead there would likely be no nuclear explosion, experts say.

While North Korea could be counted on to rail at the “recklessness” of an Aegis interceptor taking out one of its missiles, the hornet’s nest would be stirred up far less than in the case of a U.S. invasion of North Korea’s territory or attack on a land target. In the latter two cases, the North Korean reprisal might be catastrophic, inflicting heavy casualties in South Korea.

If the moment for the destroyer fence to show its capability ever arrives, the U.S. Navy will have to make absolutely certain its missile-killing missiles don’t miss. North Korea would only feel emboldened if its greatest adversary seemed not up to the task of backing up its rhetoric with effective action.



Of course, a destroyer fence is only a short-term fix. North Korea will build more missiles and it’s only a matter of time before more countries acquire such weapons.

In the longer term, the Navy should consider upgrading more ships for ballistic missile defense. The Navy should also push forward an idea broached by shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries to develop a missile-defense variant of the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship that can be fitted out with a massive strategic antimissile battery of more than 400 interceptors or other missiles.

Similarly, more thought should be given to accelerating testing and deployment of systems that support and enable Aegis. These include the SBX-1 – a huge golf ball-shaped radar dome mounted on an oil platform that can track ballistic missiles – and additional satellites that can be used to track intercontinental ballistic missiles as they travel through space.

With bold use of proven, off-the-shelf missile-defense technology, the U.S. can turn the tables on Pyongyang, neutralizing its strategic missile threat without launching a war. The goal would be to buy enough time for cooler heads to prevail.",It’s time to deploy US ships off North Korea to knock out missiles when they’re launched,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/it-s-time-to-deploy-us-ships-off-north-korea-to-knock-out-missiles-when-re-launched.html

She’s not brave.”Yes, the maniac is Mr. Weinstein, but even monsters like him are stopped when women speak up.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared in The Washington Times.

Hillary Clinton: Woods walker, Chardonnay drinker, screamer-into-pillows, sore loser. And now? The recycled claim of Feminist Icon Supporter of All Women.

The feminist bar is very low these days. We’ve now heard from a number of very successful, famous actresses (and the aforementioned politician) who are being lauded for coming out against producer Harvey Weinstein. After he was fired from his film company.

“It took Hillary about 5 minutes to blame NRA for madman’s rampage, but 5 days to sorta-kinda blame Harvey Weinstein for his sexually [sic] assaults,” tweeted Kellyanne Conway. But even that was giving Hillary too much credit.

Hillary’s silence, and that of the Obamas, was so absurd even their own blogs (also known as the mainstream media) hectored them about it for days. Five days into the media firestorm, she finally issued a statement quintessentially Clintonian:

“I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein. The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.”

A rather rich statement about not tolerating sexual harassment and assault, coming from a “feminist” who made a career tolerating it, and modeling that acquiescence to a generation of young women. Shocked and appalled? No she wasn’t.

Hillary’s example for women is, if anything, consistent. She has shown them how to put up with, and defend, the most egregious treatment, if it will get you something.

Ian Tuttle at the National Review reminded us last year of Hillary’s role in attacking her wandering husband’s victims and accusers:

“[The New York Times and The Washington Post both cite] ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos’s memoir of his years as Clinton’s chief adviser, ‘All Too Human.’ When the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, ‘[Hillary] had to do what she had always done before,’ wrote Stephanopoulos: ‘swallow her doubts, stand by her man, and savage his enemies.’ To an allegation from Little Rock music groupie Connie Hamzy that Bill Clinton propositioned her, Hillary responded: ‘We have to destroy her story.’ “

The Daily Wire reports, “In an ABC News interview in 1992, Hillary smears Gennifer Flowers, a woman Bill would later admit to having an affair with, as ‘some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t even have much of a resume to fall back on.’ Hillary also referred to Flowers as ‘trailer trash.’ “

No wonder Mr. Weinstein’s Hollywood and Hillary’s Washington so frantically turned to deflection by painting Donald Trump as the singular menace for women. Because, you know, locker-room talk.

Through various reports and confessions, we know everyone in Hollywood knew about Harvey Weinstein. But he’s not the end of it, he’s just the beginning. Like the iceberg that nailed the Titanic, the problem is the part still hidden.

Those at most risk in the cesspool of Hollywood are the young and inexperienced. Mr. Weinstein targeted ingenues, and young staffers. But there were some women who escaped Mr. Weinstein’s grip, and developed successful careers.

Many of those successful women, some who claim to have had no idea and others admit they knew, also finally came out and condemned Mr. Weinstein, after he was fired.

Meryl Streep called his actions “disgraceful” and an “abuse of power.” She also says she had no idea it was happening. An odd ignorance, considering her friend was a leading supporter of allowing Roman Polanski back into the U.S. She then appropriately lauded the women speaking out against him (before it was safe), as heroes.

Rosanna Arquette and Oscar-winner Mira Sorvino both rebuffed Mr. Weinstein’s advances, and both women feel that it contributed to a stall in their careers.

Actress Rose McGowan is the hero of this story, and was calling attention to this over a year ago on social media. Her complaints, widely believed to be about Mr. Weinstein, were made before it was fashionable. She also has not had Angelina Jolie’s or Jennifer Lawrence’s career.

Ms. Lawrence says she had no idea of Mr. Weinstein’s behavior, while Ms. Jolie says she was sexually harassed by the mogul and did try to warn others who were working with him.

Yet Ms. Jolie has been among Hollywood’s most successful and powerful women for years. As her power and independence grew, still nothing was said publicly that may have helped end the predator’s decades-long career of sexual harassment, alleged sexual assault, and now some alleged rapes.

Is it acceptable for rich, powerful and successful women (and men!) who know what’s happening, to say nothing for years, because it allows their work to proceed unencumbered? Are these people, who know what’s happening, abandoning untold numbers of other women to the monster, brave and heroic and feminist to come out once the charade is exposed?

Gwyneth Paltrow was lauded by Jake Tapper on Twitter as “courageous” for admitting she was harassed by Mr. Weinstein. Tweeter Lola Ramona was concise: “It’s not courageous to jump off a bridge when your landing will be cushioned by the people who jumped first. She’s not brave.”

Yes, the maniac is Mr. Weinstein, but even monsters like him are stopped when women speak up. Asking powerful women to use their power isn’t an insult, it’s a necessity.

The elite in Hollywood are super-upset about all of this, so will George Clooney, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence and Angelina Jolie refuse to work until Rose McGowan, Mira Sorvino and Rosanna Arquette are offered roles and paydays worthy of them?

Our country needs both tax reform and Social Security reform.","We’re more than two weeks from Halloween, yet the mainstream media is already itching to give the American people a mighty good fright, spinning President Trump’s desperately needed tax reform framework as rash, ill-conceived and even dangerous.

At the same time, the president has been barnstorming across the rust belt and his tax reform plan has been met with enthusiastic approval by energized audiences. This show that our country’s elites still – nearly on year after the election – don’t have a darn clue what matters to real, hardworking Americans.

Like an unfailing barometer, the things that get President Trump’s detractors the most riled up dependably register as the things unapologetically designed to put America first. The fact that so many on the left are so hot and bothered is really all the reason the GOP-controlled Congress should need to pass the president’s tax plan as soon as possible.

Republicans in Congress have to get off their duffs and start supporting the leader who was elected to remake Washington. They blew the opportunity (several times) to eliminate one of the most egregious violations of personal liberty in modern history – ObamaCare. Their failure dissipated a lot of the momentum that could finally make the federal government responsive to its citizens.

Republicans are overdue to deliver a common-sense, landmark piece of legislation. Summer break is over, school is back in session. GOP members of Congress can’t afford another whiff and miss. Their constituents will not forgive them in the rapidly-approaching midterms.

President Trump’s tax reform framework contains several major provisions, all of which bring a much-needed quality to The Swamp: simplicity.

Forking over our money to the IRS just so it can be flushed down into an opaque, bottomless pit of bureaucratic ineptitude is infuriating enough. On top of this, the Tax Foundation estimates that Americans collectively spent $147 billion last year to prepare business income tax returns and $99 billion preparing individual income tax returns. The IRS estimates that we spent a total of 8.9 billion hours complying with tax-filing requirements.

One provision of President Trump’s tax reform framework calls for collapsing the current seven tax brackets into three, with marginal tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. This would have the immediate effect of eliminating legions of bean-counters who have built an entire industry and lined their own pockets by serving as the almighty interpreters of thousands upon thousands of pages of regulatory legalese.

Another perfectly sensible proposal is killing the death tax, which unceremoniously celebrated its centennial last year. A Gallup poll last year found that 54 percent of Americans want it eliminated. The tax has a devastating impact on the economy by increasing costs on small businesses.

Currently, 70 percent of family businesses do not survive to the second generation and 90 percent do not survive to the third generation. Families hit by the death tax are often forced to sell off land or valuable business assets, lay off workers, or even shut down entirely as a result.

The president’s tax reform framework further aims to help American businesses regain their competitive edge in a globalized economy increasingly stacked against them. It advises considering methods to reduce corporate double taxation, eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, and lowering the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent.

But if sustained growth and prosperity is this administration’s goal, the framework is only half of the equation. Our country needs both tax reform and Social Security reform. For without the latter, we are arbitrarily punishing our economy, our most vulnerable citizens, and future generations of American workers.

Fortunately, President Trump is brave enough to clutch third rails with both hands. Having a president ready and willing to buck convention means the chance for the GOP to pivot finally – and go big.

Because of demographic changes and decades worth of bad public policy, Social Security has ballooned in cost since its inception, consuming nearly one-quarter of annual federal spending. Social Security has two major trust funds, and both are expected to be insolvent by 2034. The inability to act will force a devastating 25 percent across-the-board cut in benefits.

“Kicking the can down the road” doesn’t adequately express the continual unwillingness of our elected officials to tackle the systemic problems of Social Security. A can might get dented from being kicked, but its weight doesn’t change.

Deferring action on Social Security is actually like pushing a snowball down a mountain. It ultimately can accumulate so much speed and mass that it turns into an avalanche. And the moment it destroys the quiet village at the bottom is imminent.

To be sure, when President Trump pledges “to make America great again,” he means making America a country in which we all have the chance to enjoy the fruits of personal and economic freedom, not just for four years or eight , or even for a few decades. He means beyond the horizon, farther than we can see, so that bureaucracy and the spinelessness of elected officials won’t be the traps that seal our republic’s fate.",America needs Trump’s tax reform plan (don’t believe the media scare tactics),http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/america-needs-trump-s-tax-reform-plan-don-t-believe-media-scare-tactics.html

We need to be prepared to defend against new North Korean missile launches – and there is a way to do this short of full-scale war.

One U.S. military option would be to deploy a special team of two or three guided-missile destroyers – ships especially equipped to target, track and shoot down ballistic missiles – to strategic locations off the North Korean coastline. The ships would be positioned outside the 12-mile internationally recognized maritime territorial limit, or at other locations that intelligence indicates would be effective.

Sources intimately familiar with the operations and deployments of those destroyers – and the vast capabilities of their top-secret ballistic missile defense systems – tell me such a plan could work. They say a similar strategy is one of the military options being considered at the Pentagon and at U.S. Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii. At the very least, this action would increase the costs to North Korea of continuing its missile program.

Erecting what amounts to a destroyer “fence” to contain North Korean missiles and knock them out of the sky might seem like a farfetched scheme. Can a handful of small warships really perform such a huge task?

America’s ballistic missile defense warships are outfitted with systems and weapons that have been proven in rigorous testing, including SM-3 missile interceptors. Since 2002, the Aegis combat system – a powerful weapons system used by the U.S. Navy that utilizes computer and radar technology to find, track and destroy enemy targets – has recorded 35 successful ballistic-missile intercepts in 42 test attempts. And in the last dozen tests, the SM-3s have only missed once.

While U.S. tests of our missile defense system are admittedly choreographed, the characteristics of a targeted ballistic missile in a test situation closely match those of a missile that has been deployed with bad intentions.

Nearly all of the tests pit a single U.S. missile interceptor against a single ballistic missile. Against an actual launch, the Navy could send up numerous interceptors, dramatically increasing its chances for a hit.

Up to now, North Korea has failed to prove it has the capability to launch and control a sufficiently large salvo of missiles to overwhelm a single Aegis ballistic missile defense ship, let alone two or three. Some experts speculate that North Korea, slowed as it is by international economic sanctions, might not develop that capacity until near the end of the decade or beyond.

The U.S. missile destroyers that could be formed into a team and used to knock down North Korean missiles overhead would be those outfitted with the latest version of the four-decades-old Aegis combat system. The newest series of upgrades was certified in January 2015.

All U. S. Navy destroyers and cruisers possess Aegis combat systems, which were first developed to protect ships – especially aircraft carriers – against air threats such as cruise missiles and aircraft.

However, ballistic missile defense requires different sensor settings, algorithms and missiles. Only 40 percent of the U.S. Navy’s Aegis-equipped destroyers and cruisers are designed for ballistic missile defense.

The ballistic missile defense ships depend on SM-3 missile interceptors to blow apart enemy ballistic missiles relatively soon after they enter what’s called flight midcourse, at their most vulnerable point where the atmosphere ends. This starts about 400 miles above the Earth’s surface and extends out to a few thousand miles.

SM-3s have no explosive warhead. Instead they work through sheer force, colliding with the targeted missile with the power of a 10-ton truck traveling 600 miles per hour. For very short-range missiles, SM-2 interceptors can potentially be used. New interceptors, called SM-6s, are being tested that are designed to hit longer-range ballistic missiles later in flight as they descend and re-enter the atmosphere.

Every ballistic missile defense destroyer has the capacity to launch up to 96 missiles. Each ship would have to retain some Aegis capacity for self-defense and that missile number would depend on the mission.

For argument’s sake, assume a destroyer making up part of the “fence” could aim 80 interceptors at a launched North Korean missile. That would mean two ships could unleash a fusillade of 160 missiles and three ships could fire 240. If North Korea were to triple its single-day launch rate, which with sanctions seems extremely difficult, it could possibly send a dozen missiles aloft. In that case, the odds still favor the Aegis interceptors.

Recently North Korea has focused mainly on short- and medium-range missile tests. The North has yet to prove it can launch an intercontinental ballistic missile armed with a payload that can reach the United States, despite its boasts.

If Pyongyang does deploy such missiles and they break though the fence created by U.S. ships and head toward America, the U.S. Air Force could meet them with a total of 36 ground-based interceptors launched from Fort Greely in Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Those interceptors have hit targets in 10 of 18 tests, including the last two in June 2014 and May this year.

To execute such an aggressive plan for an Aegis-ship ballistic missile defense, some parts of which appear to be already in the works, the U.S. would have to place even greater focus on ballistic missile defense missions. American fleet commanders will need to make sure destroyer captains improve their skill in basic seamanship – a proficiency called into question after the Navy recently lost two of its valuable ballistic missile defense destroyers in collisions with commercial ships.

If an SM-3 misses, there’s little concern of collateral damage. The interceptor would burn up harmlessly as it reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. Even if an interceptor collided with a nuclear warhead there would likely be no nuclear explosion, experts say.

While North Korea could be counted on to rail at the “recklessness” of an Aegis interceptor taking out one of its missiles, the hornet’s nest would be stirred up far less than in the case of a U.S. invasion of North Korea’s territory or attack on a land target. In the latter two cases, the North Korean reprisal might be catastrophic, inflicting heavy casualties in South Korea.

North Korea would only feel emboldened if its greatest adversary seemed not up to the task of backing up its rhetoric with effective action.



Of course, a destroyer fence is only a short-term fix. North Korea will build more missiles and it’s only a matter of time before more countries acquire such weapons.

""We thought at the beginning it was the waves of the sea in the rain, but the cries of our neighbors caught our attention,"" he said. ""When we went out we saw the aircraft broken by the beach. Airport authorities were alerted and rescue workers were immediately sent to help recover those wounded.""

Hundreds of onlookers gathered at the beach. Rescue workers carried away what appeared to be a corpse in a yellow bag. The tail and propellers of the plane were exposed.

Air traffic at the airport in the West African nation appeared to continue after the crash, according to the flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.

Frida, the beloved Labrador rescue dog, has been dispatched to Mexico City to help search for survivors caught in the rubble, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The brave pooch is part of the Mexican Navy’s Canine Unit. Frida, 7, has been credited with finding 52 people - 12 alive – in her career. The dog has been dispatched to a few natural disasters, including the aftermath of an earthquake in Ecuador in 2016.

Two weeks ago, the canine found a police officer’s body in Juchitan after an earthquake in Oaxaca.

Frida’s handlers have put the pup to work in Mexico City wishing she would discover survivors following a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that hit the region Tuesday, killing at least 273 people, including 137 in the capital.

So far 15 dogs have been stationed to search for bodies in the capital but Frida has quite a following. The Mexican Navy tweeted a series of photos of Frida, which garnered over 8,000 likes on Twitter.

On Tuesday, Frida was sent to the Enrique Rebsamen school in Mexico City that collapsed in the earthquake. Other emergency workers found 11 children alive and 25 people dead.

Frida worked long hours Thursday before being sent to rest.

Israel Arauz Salina, Frida’s handler, said Frida follows dogs when they appeared to have found a person.

“They act afraid,” Salinas said when dogs find a body. “That indicates to us that there is a cadaver.”

To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims.
We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared on SuzanneVenker.com.

Have you ever made your husband a sandwich? If so, you should be ashamed of yourself. Don't you realize such behavior sets women back decades?

That's the message of a new article in The Daily Telegraph, entitled ""When making a sandwich is a crime against feminism,"" about an Australian woman named Maddie who asked a Facebook group of 26,186 mothers whether anyone had some yummy alternatives for her husband's lunches, which she said she makes for him every day.

Now that's what anyone I know would call a nice wife.

But that's not what Maddie was called on Facebook. Instead, she was told she was nothing but a “slave” and a “1950s housewife."" She was also “weird,” as no woman in her right mind would do something so demeaning as to make her husband lunch.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Here's just a sampling of some of the responses Maddie got:

“Your husband is a grown up, and you’re not his mother!”

“My husband can make his own damn lunch.”

""I make my husband the same thing he makes me. Nothing!!”

“Stuff that, hubby is a grown man. I already do his laundry and keep his children alive.”

“Our advice is to stop making his lunches.”

“My role is childcare during working hours and that’s it.”

“He’s lucky if I decide to make dinner some nights.""

That, my friends, is what feminists brought to America in the 1970s.

And it stuck.

The idea that a wife would—or God forbid, should—do anything for her husband with no expectation for anything in return—just to be nice, because, as Maddie put it, she ""loves her man"" and they ""can't afford to eat out""— makes her weak.

Honestly, is it really any wonder why the relationship between the sexes is such a mess today? Or why, as Bloomberg published just last week, married Americans are unhappier than ever? In my opinion, it is largely because there are so many women in America today who, either knowingly or unknowingly, have a feminist mind.

Feminists teach women, above all else, to stand up for themselves against the evil men of the world. Even harmless husbands fall into the category of 'evil men' since they supposedly long to lord over their wives. Thus, the knee-jerk reaction to the suggestion that a wife might serve her husband in some way—make him a drink or a meal—is to become defensive. Yet, if we turn the scenario around, if a husband were to serve his wife in any way, well, that's acceptable.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Of course, there are men who support feminists. My friend Helen Smith, Ph.D., refers to these type of men as ""Uncle Tims"" in her book ""Men on Strike."" An Uncle Tim is a male sellout who kowtows to feminists because he's (a) just as left-wing as they are and thus agrees with the feminist worldview, or (b) too weak to stand up for himself and knows that if he says anything he's not suppose to, he won't get sex.

Most Uncle Tims who fall under category A live on the East and West coasts. Those who fall under category B can live anywhere, but the one area of the country they're scarce is in the South and the Midwest. Because that's where the real men live.

And real men don't marry feminists.

The men who do have been feminized and are proud of not being ""the man of the house."" They see that as backwards and take pride in their progressive, non manly ways. Of course, don't expect an Uncle Tim to kill the intruder in the house on his wife's behalf—he's given up the role of provider and protector. He and his wife are equals!

Unfortunately, the Uncle Tims are often the ones who lose in the end because all too often feminist wives regret their choice to make their marriages androgynous—and the men who give up their manhood, because they thought that's what women and society wanted—are left in the dust.

To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims. We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook. A fantastic example is Chad Prather, aka Political Cowboy—who, not coincidentally, is from Texas. Check out his very funny (and very true) video on gender INequality!

Now there's a real man.

And I'd bet my life savings his wife isn't a feminist.",Are you weak if you make your man a sandwich? This is why real men don’t marry feminists,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/are-weak-if-make-your-man-sandwich-this-is-why-real-men-don-t-marry-feminists.html

Pesquera said that the medical examiner is still reviewing all deaths that occurred in island hospitals around the time of the storm and the toll could rise further.

As the weather turns cooler, you might be looking for ways to keep outdoor living part of your routine. These 10 ideas can help make the most of enjoying the fresh air on your porch and patio or in your yard this season, whether you’re bookmarking dates for fall outings or looking for ways to keep your garden inviting.

1. Host a backyard party. Invite guests to bundle up and come outside to enjoy the crisp air for all or part of the evening. Make an outdoor lounge spot feel cozy with extra throw blankets and pillows brought out from inside the house. Light candles for an inviting glow or move chairs around an outdoor fire pit to take advantage of the warmth.

2. Move a porch swing outside. Admire the changing leaves from a front-row seat by hanging a porch swing in the garden. Look for a large lateral branch from a mature tree or — even easier — hang from a backyard shade pergola, if you have one. Finishing touches like pumpkin-colored pillows and pots of mums on either side make the swinging lounge even more festive.

3. Pick for a good cause. This year, why not trade a visit to a U-pick farm for a harvesting day out that will leave both you and the greater community a little richer in fall produce? Nonprofit organizations like San Francisco Bay Area-based Village Harvest host weekly picking trips to local backyards and small orchards where volunteers harvest the excess produce for community members in need.

You can also expect to take home fruit that’s not fit for donation (but may be perfect for pie) like those that are extra ripe, fragile or slightly damaged. You can join a trip or list your backyard if you have a couple of fruit trees with more ripe fruit than you can handle.

This time of year, expect to harvest apples, pears, persimmons and pomegranates, among others.

4. Find a sun trap. Gardens this time of year can feel damp and chilly but often have areas that catch the sun’s rays. Seek out these warm places or follow your cat or dog in the afternoon — they always seem to find them — as spots to linger and appreciate the last of the season’s warmth.

5. Embrace indoors-outdoors. Moving outdoor furniture under an overhang can be a great way to extend your ability to enjoy a meal or relax outside in a transitional season. If fall in your region means rain, the covered roof can make the difference of eating outside or indoors.

6. Invest in landscape heaters. Adding heat can make a big difference if you’d like to linger outside in cool weather. Installing small wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted outdoor heaters may be easier than you think. The units run from $120 to $200 in big-box stores and can be plugged in to regular home electricity systems. Most wall- or ceiling-mounted models cast about a nine-foot-square “heat blanket” — one heater would be enough for a cafe set, while two can heat an outdoor dining table.

7. Get cozy with sheepskins. Instantly make cold outdoor furniture feel more inviting by covering the seats or seat backs with a cozy material. Sheepskins (faux and real) provide warmth and a cushy padding, while throw blankets can double as wraps later in the evening.

8. Pick out a portable fire pit. It’s no surprise that adding a fire pit can really make your patio functional in the cooler months, providing warmth, light and a great excuse to go outside — s’mores! While large-scale fire pits and outdoor fireplaces can be pricey investments, smaller, portable gas-burning models come at a more wallet-friendly price. Plus, being portable, they can easily be moved from one area of the garden to another or brought in the garage for the winter.

9. Brighten up your porch. Hanging a few strings of lights can be all it takes to transform a shadowy porch into an alluring spot. Set the lights on your front porch on a timer so they turn on when you’re coming home in the evening, making for a bright and welcoming entry.

“I go with [President] Trump on this one,” Hanson told Fox News on Tuesday. “If you want to protest, that’s not the place to do it.”

He added: “A lot of people died over our flag. We’re able to voice our opinion because of it. If you’re going to show respect for anything, do it for the national anthem.”

Hanson has a track record of designing and digging massive messages – many political – using his old Massey tractor on his 850-acre farm.

And Hanson doesn’t use GPS or any technology for the work, which he says “works out pretty good in a harvested bean field.”

Then he flies his two-seater plane, and if his design passes the test, he snaps a pic with a Cannon camera and posts it on Facebook. He said he's only been unsuccessful twice.

Hanson told Fox News he got his “We Stand for the National Anthem” message right on the second try. During the first attempt, he was interrupted by a passerby with only two letters to go. He soon relocated to another section of the field.

Hanson said he initially wanted to add an addendum -- “We kneel at the cross” -- but the plan was foiled by the first frost of the season.

Hanson said, weather permitting, he plans to add that phrase soon.

Hanson and his wife, Darlene, are Lutherans and attend church regularly. He also describes himself as a Republican and Trump supporter, and he had the chance to get a picture of the president when Trump came to North Dakota for a tax reform speech in September.

“I was 20 feet away from him,” Hanson said. “It was a good meeting and the president stayed on script.”

Hanson said he believes Trump is trying to do well, but faces a “continuous battle” in Washington, D.C. And Hanson said he's doing all he can to send his support from his Edgeley farm.

Some of his previous messages include “Drain the Swamp,” “Blue Lives Matter,” “Feel the Bern,” “GOP, get your act together,” and “Vote Trump.”

He said his Prince symbol, plowed after the singer passed away, was one of his most popular for fans all over the world, but he caught a lot of flak for his “Never Hillary” message.

Mr. Trump has now nominated nearly 60 judges, filling more vacancies than Barack Obama did in his entire first year. There are another 160 court openings, allowing Mr. Trump to flip or further consolidate conservative majorities on the circuit courts that have the final say on 99% of federal legal disputes.

This project is the work of Mr. Trump, White House Counsel Don McGahn and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Every new president cares about the judiciary, but no administration in memory has approached appointments with more purpose than this team.

What I know is healing, in the face of violence and senseless acts, will always find a way.","The news of Las Vegas came in as fast and as devastating as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and as violent as the raging fires tearing through California. I could imagine the sudden horror of the thousands of men, women, and children dancing and singing one minute, and then scrambling for their lives before the next downbeat. It must have felt like a roof ripping off and leaving thousands of people traumatized in its wake. My husband and son, Marcus and Levi Hummon, are both in the music industry and have lots of friends who were in Las Vegas, so our communities have felt this mass shooting rip apart our own sense of security.

I have felt both grief and anger on behalf of the victims and their families. I can understand how people might wonder why God would allow such a horrific thing to happen to innocent people but God didn't do this, God is grieving with us. This is a time to question a lot of things, but I believe that this is not a time to question our faith. This is a time to lean into our faith, as our faith is what carries us through. This is a time for remembering all we have lost through violence and injustice and to be a community. Community is the common thread, woven by the fiber of love, that binds us together. And I know something about love: Love heals. It heals people, and it will heal our nation, too.

At Thistle Farms, a community of survivors of prostitution, addiction, and trafficking, where I have worked for the past 20 years, one sentiment remains constant; hearts expand as they heal. For women recovering from childhood trauma and sexual violence, the painful edges of their hearts discover new depths of compassion along the path of healing. America, too, can grow both stronger in the pain and more radically passionate for loving one another. Once we all allow healing to smooth over rough edges in our own hearts, it will push the boundaries of love a little further for all of us.

We can transform brokenness into compassion, anger into advocacy, and fear into courage. On a daily basis, I see the survivors in our community being transformed by love. Healing is beautifully simple and surprisingly accessible.

If you are wondering what you can do to find some peace and healing in your own life, I encourage you to:

Make time for quiet reflection: Find a green pasture, sit on a pew, stretch out on an exercise mat, soak in a bathtub—go anywhere that is your quiet space so that you can get still. Sip tea, light a candle, go silent.

Pray: Everyone defines this differently. You can pray out loud, on paper, or before bed. If we desire healing, we journey inward, reflect, face the pain, and find new spaces in our hearts to love each other.

Give generously: This can be your time, money or talents. We refuel our spirits by helping another person or contributing to the greater good. Volunteer.

Take a break from social media: Social media contains negative stories, unkind words, judgment, comparison, and unrealistic standards in the news feed. Use the time you would have spent on social media to help create good news. Nurture the relationships in your life that don’t rely on a screen.

With every action, we can become more peaceful, more loving, and more compassionate towards ourselves and others. This is what makes healing a journey; In the small steps we make daily, we find, looking back, that we have made a big difference along the way.

While I don’t know why we have faced a relentless amount of tragedy across our country this past year, what I do know is that love will be stronger and will last longer. In grieving, hearts can grow stronger, and in pain, there is comfort. What I know is healing, in the face of violence and senseless acts, will always find a way. Peace and love to you.","Deadly fires, a mass shooting, hurricanes and more -- I still believe love can heal our nation",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/deadly-fires-mass-shooting-hurricanes-and-more-still-believe-love-can-heal-our-nation.html

Boyle said his wife was raped by a guard who was assisted by his superiors.
""Today, we join the Boyle family in rejoicing over the long-awaited return to Canada of their loved ones,"" the Canadian government said.
U.S. officials have long accused Pakistan of ignoring groups like the Haqqani network, which was holding the family.
The Haqqani network had previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, a son of the founder of the group, in exchange for turning over the American-Canadian family.","After landing in Canada with his family Friday night, Canadian ex-hostage Joshua Boyle told reporters some frightening news about his family's ordeal in Afghanistan.

He said the Haqqani network, which held him and his wife captive for five years, had killed his infant daughter in captivity and raped his wife.

Boyle landed in Canada late Friday with his American wife and three young children.

The couple was rescued Wednesday, five years after they had been abducted by the Taliban-linked extremist network while in Afghanistan as part of a backpacking trip.

Coleman was pregnant at the time and had four children in captivity. The birth of the fourth child had not been publicly known before Boyle appeared before journalists at the Toronto airport.



""The stupidity and evil of the Haqqani network's kidnapping of a pilgrim and his heavily pregnant wife engaged in helping ordinary villagers in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan was eclipsed only by the stupidity and evil of authorizing the murder of my infant daughter,"" he said.

Boyle said his wife was raped by a guard who was assisted by his superiors. He asked for the Afghan government to bring them to justice.

He said he was in Afghanistan to help villagers ""who live deep inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where no NGO, no aid worker and no government has ever successfully been able to bring the necessary help.""

After returning to his parents' home in Smiths Falls, Ontario, on Saturday, Boyle emailed The Associated Press with a new statement saying they had ""reached the first true 'home' that the children have ever known - after they spent most of Friday asking if each subsequent airport was our new house hopefully.""

""Our daughter has had a cursory medical exam last night, and hospital staff were enthusiastically insistent that her chances seemed miraculously high based on a quick physical. Full medical work-ups for each member of my family are being arranged right now, and God-willing the healing process - physically and mentally can begin.""

It was reported earlier that one of his children was in poor health and had to be force-fed by their Pakistani rescuers.

On the plane from London, Boyle provided a written statement to the Associated Press saying his family has ""unparalleled resilience and determination.""

Coleman, who is from Stewartstown, Pa., sat in the aisle of the business class cabin wearing a tan-colored headscarf.

She nodded wordlessly when she confirmed her identity to a reporter on board the flight. In the two seats next to her were her two elder children. In the seat beyond that was Boyle, with their youngest child in his lap. U.S. State Department officials were on the plane with them.

The handwritten statement that Boyle gave the AP expressed disagreement with U.S. foreign policy.

""God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination, and to allow that to stagnate, to pursue personal pleasure or comfort while there is still deliberate and organized injustice in the world would be a betrayal of all I believe, and tantamount to sacrilege,"" he wrote.

He nodded to one of the State Department officials and said, ""Their interests are not my interests.""

The family was able to leave from the plane with their escorts before the rest of the passengers. There was about a 5- to 10-minute delay before everyone else was allowed out.

Dan Boyle, Joshua's younger brother, said outside the family home in Smith Falls, Ontario, that he had spoken to his brother a few times in the past few days.

""He's doing very well. He sounds a lot like how he sounded five years ago. He sounds like he had his head on his shoulders and his wits about him,"" he said.



The Canadian government said in a statement they will ""continue to support him and his family now that they have returned.""

""Today, we join the Boyle family in rejoicing over the long-awaited return to Canada of their loved ones,"" the Canadian government said.

Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria said the Pakistani raid that led to the family's rescue was based on a tip from U.S. intelligence and shows that Pakistan will act against a ""common enemy"" when Washington shares information.

U.S. officials have long accused Pakistan of ignoring groups like the Haqqani network, which was holding the family.



A U.S. national security official, who was not authorized to discuss operational details of the release and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. obtained actionable information, passed it to Pakistani government officials, asked them to interdict and recover the hostages -- and they did.

On Friday, President Donald Trump, who previously warned Pakistan to stop harboring militants, praised Pakistan for its ""cooperation on many fronts."" On Twitter, he wrote that the U.S. is starting to develop ""a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders.""



The operation appeared to have unfolded quickly and ended with what some described as a dangerous raid, a shootout and a captor's final, terrifying threat to ""kill the hostage."" Boyle told his parents that he, his wife and their children were intercepted by Pakistani forces while being transported in the back or trunk of their captors' car and that some of his captors were killed. He suffered only a shrapnel wound, his family said.



U.S. officials did not confirm those details.



A U.S. military official said that a military hostage team had flown to Pakistan on Wednesday prepared to fly the family out. The team did a preliminary health assessment and had a transport plane ready to go, but sometime after daybreak Thursday, as the family members were walking to the plane, Boyle said he did not want to board, the official said.



Boyle's father said his son did not want to board the plane because it was headed to Bagram Air Base and the family wanted to return directly to North America. Another U.S. official said Boyle was nervous about being in ""custody"" given his family ties.



He was once married to Zaynab Khadr, the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a senior al-Qaida financier. Her father, the late Ahmed Said Khadr, and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy.



The Canadian-born Omar Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a firefight and was taken to the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay. Officials had discounted any link between that background and Boyle's capture, with one official describing it in 2014 as a ""horrible coincidence.""



The U.S. Justice Department said neither Boyle nor Coleman is wanted for any federal crime.



U.S. officials call the Haqqani group a terrorist organization and have targeted its leaders with drone strikes. But the group also operates like a criminal network. Unlike the Islamic State group, it does not typically execute Western hostages, preferring to ransom them for cash.



The Haqqani network had previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, a son of the founder of the group, in exchange for turning over the American-Canadian family. In one of the videos released by their captors, Boyle implored the Afghan government not to execute Taliban prisoners, or he and his wife would be killed.



U.S. officials have said that several other Americans are being held by militant groups in Afghanistan or Pakistan.



They include Kevin King, 60, a teacher at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul who was abducted in August 2016, and Paul Overby, an author in his 70s who had traveled to the region several times but disappeared in eastern Afghanistan in mid-2014.



The family had left Pakistan on a commercial flight after Boyle reportedly balked at taking a U.S. plane out of Pakistan, fearing that his background could land him in the American detention center at Guantanamo Bay.

“We’re covering the family aspect of hunting, the renewability of hunting, [we’re] celebrating the herds,” says Waddell. “We’ve even got recipes for truly organic eating. Because if you want to eat organic, there’s no better way than to do your hunting in the wild.”

“We want to shed a light on that, that it’s a gift,” adds McMillain. “Our ancestors didn’t make it through hard winters eating salad, you know?”

“We’re lucky to have our heritage of hunting still going on, and we want to share that,” says McMillain, who adds that he’s excited to share his traditions with the next generation of hunters.

“Hopefully, Deer Week can [get] some young kids out hunting, get them outdoors, expose them to the same gift.”

Waddell, too, tells Fox News he’s especially proud to inspire others to get outside and have a great experience in the wilderness.

“[We] really get it back down to the family fun — in all caps, the F-U-N — of the outdoors in general. To get off the concrete and steel, go feel the cool breeze, watch the wilderness come alive,” he says.

“It’s going to be a big celebration of the principal values of deer hunting,” Waddell tells Fox News. “We’re uncovering every aspect, from the point of view of the veteran hunter who wants to fill the freezers, to the trophy hunter, to even the beginner, in some cases.”

“We’re covering the family aspect of hunting, the renewability of hunting, [we’re] celebrating the herds,” says Waddell. “We’ve even got recipes for truly organic eating. Because if you want to eat organic, there’s no better way than to do your hunting in the wild.”

“We want to shed a light on that, that it’s a gift,” adds McMillain. “Our ancestors didn’t make it through hard winters eating salad, you know?”

In addition to Waddell’s “Bone Collector,” Deer Week viewers can expect seven-consecutive nights of non-stop deer-hunting programming, including new and classic episodes of “Jim Shockey’s Hunting Adventures,” “True Magnum TV,” “Red Arrow,” “Realtree Outdoors” and more.

“We’re lucky to have our heritage of hunting still going on, and we want to share that,” says McMillain, who adds that he’s excited to share his traditions with the next generation of hunters.

“Hopefully, Deer Week can [get] some young kids out hunting, get them outdoors, expose them to the same gift.”

Waddell, too, tells Fox News he’s especially proud to inspire others to get outside and have a great experience in the wilderness.

“[We] really get it back down to the family fun — in all caps, the F-U-N — of the outdoors in general. To get off the concrete and steel, go feel the cool breeze, watch the wilderness come alive,” he says.

Our country needs both tax reform and Social Security reform.","We’re more than two weeks from Halloween, yet the mainstream media is already itching to give the American people a mighty good fright, spinning President Trump’s desperately needed tax reform framework as rash, ill-conceived and even dangerous.

At the same time, the president has been barnstorming across the rust belt and his tax reform plan has been met with enthusiastic approval by energized audiences. This show that our country’s elites still – nearly on year after the election – don’t have a darn clue what matters to real, hardworking Americans.

Like an unfailing barometer, the things that get President Trump’s detractors the most riled up dependably register as the things unapologetically designed to put America first. The fact that so many on the left are so hot and bothered is really all the reason the GOP-controlled Congress should need to pass the president’s tax plan as soon as possible.

Republicans in Congress have to get off their duffs and start supporting the leader who was elected to remake Washington. They blew the opportunity (several times) to eliminate one of the most egregious violations of personal liberty in modern history – ObamaCare. Their failure dissipated a lot of the momentum that could finally make the federal government responsive to its citizens.

Republicans are overdue to deliver a common-sense, landmark piece of legislation. Summer break is over, school is back in session. GOP members of Congress can’t afford another whiff and miss. Their constituents will not forgive them in the rapidly-approaching midterms.

President Trump’s tax reform framework contains several major provisions, all of which bring a much-needed quality to The Swamp: simplicity.

Forking over our money to the IRS just so it can be flushed down into an opaque, bottomless pit of bureaucratic ineptitude is infuriating enough. On top of this, the Tax Foundation estimates that Americans collectively spent $147 billion last year to prepare business income tax returns and $99 billion preparing individual income tax returns. The IRS estimates that we spent a total of 8.9 billion hours complying with tax-filing requirements.

One provision of President Trump’s tax reform framework calls for collapsing the current seven tax brackets into three, with marginal tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. This would have the immediate effect of eliminating legions of bean-counters who have built an entire industry and lined their own pockets by serving as the almighty interpreters of thousands upon thousands of pages of regulatory legalese.

Another perfectly sensible proposal is killing the death tax, which unceremoniously celebrated its centennial last year. A Gallup poll last year found that 54 percent of Americans want it eliminated. The tax has a devastating impact on the economy by increasing costs on small businesses.

Currently, 70 percent of family businesses do not survive to the second generation and 90 percent do not survive to the third generation. Families hit by the death tax are often forced to sell off land or valuable business assets, lay off workers, or even shut down entirely as a result.

The president’s tax reform framework further aims to help American businesses regain their competitive edge in a globalized economy increasingly stacked against them. It advises considering methods to reduce corporate double taxation, eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, and lowering the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent.

But if sustained growth and prosperity is this administration’s goal, the framework is only half of the equation. Our country needs both tax reform and Social Security reform. For without the latter, we are arbitrarily punishing our economy, our most vulnerable citizens, and future generations of American workers.

Fortunately, President Trump is brave enough to clutch third rails with both hands. Having a president ready and willing to buck convention means the chance for the GOP to pivot finally – and go big.

Because of demographic changes and decades worth of bad public policy, Social Security has ballooned in cost since its inception, consuming nearly one-quarter of annual federal spending. Social Security has two major trust funds, and both are expected to be insolvent by 2034. The inability to act will force a devastating 25 percent across-the-board cut in benefits.

“Kicking the can down the road” doesn’t adequately express the continual unwillingness of our elected officials to tackle the systemic problems of Social Security. A can might get dented from being kicked, but its weight doesn’t change.

Deferring action on Social Security is actually like pushing a snowball down a mountain. It ultimately can accumulate so much speed and mass that it turns into an avalanche. And the moment it destroys the quiet village at the bottom is imminent.

To be sure, when President Trump pledges “to make America great again,” he means making America a country in which we all have the chance to enjoy the fruits of personal and economic freedom, not just for four years or eight , or even for a few decades. He means beyond the horizon, farther than we can see, so that bureaucracy and the spinelessness of elected officials won’t be the traps that seal our republic’s fate.",America needs Trump’s tax reform plan (don’t believe the media scare tactics),https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/america-needs-trump-s-tax-reform-plan-don-t-believe-media-scare-tactics.html

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

With the win, the Yankees completed their comeback from a 2-0 deficit in the Division Series to dethrone the AL champions.

These bend-but-don't-break Yankees staved off elimination for the fourth time in this postseason and advanced to play the Houston Astros in the AL Championship Series starting Friday at Minute Maid Park.

The AL West champion Astros, led by 5-foot-6 second-base dynamo and MVP candidate Jose Altuve, went 5-2 against the wild-card winners this season.

After winning twice in New York, the Yankees -- with little offensive help from rookie star Aaron Judge -- came into Progressive Field and finished off the Indians, who won 102 games during the regular season, ripped off a historic 22-game streak and were favored to get back to the World Series after losing in seven games a year ago to the Chicago Cubs.

Cleveland's Series drought turns 70 next year -- baseball's longest dry spell.

The Indians closed to 3-2 in the fifth against starter CC Sabathia before David Robertson pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings for the win. Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman, who faced Cleveland in last year's spine-tingling World Series and signed an $86 million free agent contract in December, worked two innings for the save.

Chapman went to the mound with a three-run lead in the ninth after Brett Gardner battled Cody Allen for 12 pitches before hitting an RBI single, with New York's fifth run scoring when Todd Frazier raced home on right fielder Jay Bruce's throwing error.

Gardner's gritty at-bat was symbolic of these Yankees. They wouldn't give in.

When Austin Jackson was called out on strikes to end it, the Yankees rushed to the mound to celebrate with a wide-eyed Chapman.

These baby Bronx Bombers became the 10th team to overcome a 2-0 deficit to win a best-of-five playoff series. New York also did it in 2001, rallying to beat Oakland -- a series remembered for Jeter's backhand flip to home plate.

Gregorius, who took over at shortstop following Jeter's retirement after the 2014 season, hit a solo homer in the first off Kluber and added a two-run shot in the third off Cleveland's ace, who didn't look like himself during either start in this series.

One win shy of a Series title last year, the Indians had only one goal in mind in 2017.

They came up short again, and have now lost six consecutive games with a chance to clinch a postseason series dating to last year's World Series, when they squandered a 3-1 lead to the Chicago Cubs.

Cleveland is the first team in history to blow a two-game series lead in consecutive postseasons.

Everything was set up for the Indians: Kluber on the mound, Game 5 at home, sensational setup man Andrew Miller rested.

The Yankees, though, wouldn't be denied. They battled back from a 3-0 deficit in the first inning of their wild-card game against Minnesota and then had to overcome a crushing loss in Game 2, when manager Joe Girardi's decision not to challenge a hit batter, drew heavy criticism and possibly cost New York during in a 9-8 loss in 13 innings.

But these young Yankees, who are ahead of schedule to be contenders, displayed pinstriped pride.

""This team has never stopped fighting and never stopped believing,"" Girardi said before Game 5. ""That's the mark of a very good team. They know how to persevere and continue to grind out everything, whether it's an at-bat or it's on the other side, you're facing a batter, how you grind it out.""

The Yankees did it without much help from Judge, who struck out four times in Game 5, and went 1 for 20 (.050) in the series with 16 strikeouts.

But the 6-foot-7 rookie might have saved New York's season in Game 3, when he reached above the right-field wall to rob Francisco Lindor of a two-run homer in a 1-0 win.

Kluber was one of baseball's most consistent pitchers all season, winning 18 games and leading the AL with a 2.25 ERA. He's a favorite to win his second Cy Young Award.

However, October has been cruel to the right-hander. He allowed nine runs, including four homers, over 6 1/3 innings in two postseason starts, hardly what he or the Indians expected.

Gregorius came in batting just .077 (1 for 13) in the series and only .133 (2 of 15) in his career against Kluber before tagging the right-hander for two homers in the first three innings.

The 27-year-old with the easy smile and sweet swing gave the Yankees a 3-0 lead in the third, pulling an 0-1 pitch into the lower deck in right. Gregorius set a franchise record for home runs in a season by a shortstop with 25, one more than Jeter hit in 1999 when No. 2 led the Yankees to a second straight World Series title.



Just as in Game 2, Kluber didn't get out of the first unscathed.



Gregorius got New York off to an ideal start, homering with two outs in the first when Kluber grooved a fastball. The shot deep into the seats in right raised the anxiety level to an already jittery Cleveland crowd fearing the worst.

A few hours later, those fears were realized.","Yanks beat Indians, will face Astros for AL title",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/12/yanks-beat-indians-will-face-astros-for-al-title.html

Here are four of the most popular draws throughout the week.

JLTV – Advanced armor plus laser

As far as draws go, it is hard to beat a vehicle responsible for keeping soldiers safe – and one that now has a laser weapon.

Oshkosh is celebrating its 100th birthday this year and it went big on the AUSA floors. The company featured not just one of their Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV), but three – and three mounted with a serious amount of firepower that no enemy would ever want to face.

One JLTV was equipped with a Boeing Compact Laser Weapon System (CLWS) and a Kongsberg Protector LW 30 Remote Weapon System with a M230LF cannon.

Another JLTV featured the Boeing Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) Launcher including a M3P .50 cal machine gun and a M299 launcher with four Longbow Hellfire missiles.

JLTV General Purpose equipped with Rafael Samson RWS Dual Stabilized Remote Weapon Systems with M230 LF, and the Trophy Light Active Protection System.

One of the popular features from a soldier’s point of view is that no matter the terrain, the ride is surprisingly smooth, thanks to OshKosh’s TAK-4i suspension system. The JLTV can tackle extreme terrain leveraging design like the 20 inches of wheel travel.

Families can take comfort in the advances for protection like the MRAP-level underbelly to protect against improvised explosive devicesand the vehicle wide armoring that provides enhanced protection against blasts and ballistic threats.

The Core-1080 Crew Protection System provides a very comprehensive advanced approach to crew protection. Features like the capsule design, energy absorbing floor, seats and even floor mats all enhance protection and help to keep American soldiers safe.

SilentHawk Motorcycle

Tucked away in the sprawling, massive AUSA floors was the very impressive SilentHawk - a hybrid-electric, two-wheel drive all-terrain motorcycle. Not only can it handle very tough terrain, it can do so while running nearly silently.

The quiet operation could provide a range of advantages to the Army like the element of surprise and avoiding detection. And a bike that can handle challenging off-road effortlessly gives teams advantages as well. For example, teams would have the option to travel unexpected routes to targets.

At 350 pounds, the bike is lightweight but it can reach speeds of 80 mph and run for up to 170 miles without refueling.

It has a two-mode hybrid propulsion system. The battery-only mode provides the ultra-quiet operation. SilentHawk can travel two hours in this quiet mode on a single charge.

The multi-fuel mode can be used when long-range is needed. The bike is compatible with gasoline, JP-5, JP-8, Jet-A1, propane and AVGAS so there are lots of fuel options to harvest along the way during a mission.

There’s also an interactive graphical interface to display mission data and system status and integrated mount and power for an Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK).

SilentHawk is currently in development with Alta Motors and Logos Technologies.

PODCAST: LEARN TO DRIVE YOUR ATV LIKE SPECIAL FORCES

MRZR-X

The intense competition to win a SMET contract served as a backdrop and the subject of much conversation at AUSA. Nine companies have submitted ten robots for selection as an Army SMET – a robot that would serve alongside soldiers in Brigade Combat Teams.

The wildly popular Polaris Defense ATVs always draw crowds and this year there was also much curiosity surrounding the MRZR-X. This is the Polaris submission for SMET and unsurprisingly Soldiers and their families were fascinated by what a “thinking” MRZR ATV would be like.

Polaris kept the MRZR-X under wraps, but featured MRZRs that provide hints as to what a smart MRZR could bring to combat. We can expect the “brains” laid out in the Army requirements combined with the MRZR’s assets.

MRZRs can handle heavy off-roading in tough terrain. They have on-demand, advanced all-wheel drive with the already in-built smarts to automatically engage all four wheels and revert to two-wheels

The vehicles can reach speeds of about 60 miles per hour and deliver maximum agility. They are air transportable and quickly adaptable for different mission requirements.

The military regularly takes advantage of features like instant black out jump and go keyless ignition.

ZH2 Chevy truck

Another crowd favorite this year was a Chevy truck unlike any other.

This new General Motors prototype, known as the Chevrolet Colorado ZH2, runs on hydrogen fuel cells. It's based on a Chevrolet Colorado truck – but with lots of modifications for military purposes.

US Army TARDEC – renowned for their tank work – and GM have teamed up to explore a new method of power for Army vehicles. The prototype has been designed to deliver near silent operation and very hard to detect heat signatures.

How else is it different to a typical Chevrolet Colorado? For starters, it is reinforced inside and out. To tackle the sort of extreme terrain the military faces, it has a specially modified suspension.

And it doesn’t take gasoline. This one uses a futuristic fuel source that has often been thought to be dangerous.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

Her dad, Rich Tucker, 48, said it turned her entire body purple after infecting her bloodstream, and left the the little girl on the brink of death.

RARE VIRUS TRACED TO TEEN'S PET RATS

Miraculously she battled back but had to have all four limbs amputated to save her life and after eight months in hospital and intensive therapy, she took up piano lessons.

Now she practices whenever she can and has mastered the skill of performing beautiful songs by pressing keys with the stumps of her arms.

""I use the tip of my arms to press the keys and I simplify the music so I play no more than two notes at a time,"" Tucker, of New Hampshire, said. ""I always enjoy hearing the end product of a song. ""

""I can imagine that people assume that I can't do all of the things that they can,"" she said. ""When they see how independent I am they treat me the same as they would anyone else.""

Tucker's ordeal began on Easter Sunday 2010 when she woke up feeling achey, tired and suffering from flu-like symptoms.

In that time the deadly illness - caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria - was seeping into her bloodstream and attacking her body.

“She said she would take it easy and ride it out a but then I noticed her stomach was starting to turn dark purple so we rushed her to ER,"" her dad said.

“Within an hour her whole body was purple. She was bloated and puffy and they had her in a helicopter going to Boston Children’s Hospital,"" he said. ""They said, 'There’s a good chance she is not going to make it.'""

Incredibly Tucker defied the odds to pull through after medics exchanged the infected plasma for healthy plasma.

Slowly the purple disappeared from her face and stomach but as that was clearing up her limbs became darker and darker until they were completely black.

Doctors had no choice but to amputate both her legs above the knee and arms above the elbow to save her core.

Ever since then, Tucker has battled to do things that other kids can do - like painting using a cloth sleeve on her arm and playing piano.

""It was the scariest time of my life but Bella's attitude throughout has just been absolutely unbelievable,"" her dad said. “She can’t play soccer or basketball but she started taking piano lessons and learned how to play with the ends of her arms.""

“She never played before all this happened but she didn’t find it difficult - it was just a matter of finding the right song where she can play one or two keys at a time,"" he said.

Tucker made her on-stage debut at a talent show during Camp No Limits, an event hosted by the No Limits Foundation, a non-profit supporting children with limb loss.

She took to the stage in front of hundreds of other children and their parents at Camp No Limits in Maine in August.

""She was really shy before and so the fact she would even get up and play in front of 200 people just blew me away,"" her dad said. “You could hear a pin drop it was so quiet and there wasn’t a dry eye in the house. I was one of the people crying.""

""She is an awesome kid. She has such a great attitude,"" he said. ""I just love her so much.""

""Bella had the room in silence while she played and brought everyone to tears of joy,"" Mary Leighton, founder of the No Limits Foundation, said. ""She was nervous but played so beautifully. She is a beautiful soul.""","Teen who lost arms, legs to illness stuns with piano performance",https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/13/teen-who-lost-arms-legs-to-illness-stuns-with-piano-performance.html
