Reuters -- A kidnapped U.S.-Canadian couple and their three children born in captivity have been freed in Pakistan, nearly five years after the couple was abducted in neighbouring Afghanistan, Pakistani and U.S. officials said on Thursday.

American Caitlan Coleman and her Canadian husband, Joshua Boyle, were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012 by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, which the United States has long accused Pakistan of failing to fight.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been highly critical of Islamabad, praised Pakistan's cooperation with the U.S. government over the freeing of the hostages, saying it represented ""a positive moment"" for U.S.-Pakistan relations.

""The Pakistani government's cooperation is a sign that it is honoring America's wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region,"" Trump said in a statement.

Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly, drove home the dire conditions that the family had been subjected to during its long captivity.

""They've been essentially living in a hole for five years,"" Kelly said. ""That's the kind of people we're dealing with over there.""

It was unclear how precisely the Pakistani military secured the family's release, which came after the United States shared intelligence about the hostages' location. It was also unclear when the family would return home.

Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the U.S. military had been ready to fly the family out of the country but said Boyle, who is Canadian, had refused to board the aircraft.

Boyle had once been married to the sister of an inmate at the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay. The marriage ended and the inmate was later released to Canada.

As of Thursday evening, there was no indication the family had left Pakistan. Boyle's parents said he told them by phone he would see them in a couple of days.

""So we're waiting for that,"" his mother, Linda Boyle, said in a video posted on the Toronto Star newspaper's website.

U.S. officials expressed hope that the hostages' freedom could represent a turning point in relations between Pakistan and the United States, uneasy allies in fighting Taliban and other Islamist extremists in the region.

In recent days, senior U.S. officials have been more pointed about Islamabad's alleged ties to militant groups, who are battling against U.S. and U.S.-backed forces in a stalemated 16-year-old war in neighboring Afghanistan. Some U.S. officials say Pakistani safe havens have helped prolong the conflict.

Pakistan fiercely denies such ties, and it touted the operation as proof of the strength of the alliance.

""The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan's continued commitment towards fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy,"" a Pakistani army statement said.

Boyle's father, in the video message, offered his thanks to Pakistani forces ""who risked their lives and got all five of ours out safely and rescued.""

The Toronto Star reported that Boyle told his parents that he was in the trunk of the kidnappers' car with his wife and children when they were rescued by Pakistani forces. Boyle said he sustained minor shrapnel wounds during the shootout, which left his kidnappers dead.

""The last words Boyle said he heard from the kidnappers were, 'kill the hostages,'"" the Star reported.

The Pakistani army said its forces were able to recover the hostages after acting on U.S. intelligence about their passage into Pakistan from Afghanistan.

The White House, Pentagon and State Department did not offer details about the Pakistani effort, even as it praised cooperation from Islamabad.

Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland asked for respect for the family's privacy.

""Joshua, Caitlan, their children and the Boyle and Coleman families have endured a horrible ordeal over the past five years. We stand ready to support them as they begin their healing journey,"" Freeland said.

Coleman was pregnant at the time she was kidnapped, and a video released by the Taliban in December showed two sons born while she and her husband were hostages. Thursday's statements from Islamabad and Washington were the first mention of a third child.

Some officials said Pakistanis' motive for freeing the hostages may have been political rather than humanitarian, intended to reduce the tensions ahead of upcoming visits by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

Tillerson in a statement said Trump's strategy in the region recognized ""the important role Pakistan needs to play to bring stability and ultimately peace to the region.""

Mattis, who last week said the United States would try ""one more time"" to work with Pakistan in Afghanistan, was upbeat on Thursday.

""This is a very positive moment and the Pakistan army performed well,"" Mattis told reporters during a trip to Florida.

That men from his father's generation simply didn't talk about mental health issues and males from his son's generation are much happier to dive into conversations about feelings.","Just two months ago Australian media personality Andrew Denton was diagnosed with advanced heart disease. For the first time since undergoing bypass heart surgery, he's spoken about the importance of living in the moment and how the idea of being a man means talking about feelings and mental health.

The 57-year-old comedian spoke to Adam Garone, the co-founder of the Movember Foundation, in a podcast interview and revealed how he has learnt throughout his career to recognise his triggers for poor mental health.

""When I was younger, I had issues with depression. It wasn't until my 30s that I actually got a diagnosis or even understood what it was,"" he said.

""There was no real conversation about it. So what I do for my mental health -- what I know now having been through that more than once -- I recognise the triggers and I recognise what puts me back into that position. So, I act on that.

""The triggers are generally if I completely overstress myself and get very run down, that can lead to that depressive sense.""

As a result of his triple bypass heart surgery, Denton -- who is also a director of the assisted dying advocacy group Go Gentle Australia -- was forced to step aside in recent months from that organisation and media responsibilities.

Denton began Go Gentle in 2016 after seeing his father, prominent Australia broadcaster, writer and author of 'Breaker Morant' Kit Denton, die slowly and painfully two decades prior from heart failure.

Denton had made it his life's work to lobby for law reform for terminally ill people. And while that brought about a particular level of mental stress, he told Garone that he finds value for his own mental health in ""the elemental business of being alive"".

""When I was going through very depressive times, one of the things that enabled me to keep stepping forward was to reminding myself of—and this sounds very Hallmark greeting card—but literally of the beauty of a sunset or literally the amazingness of a flower,"" he said.

""Think, whatever other s--t is happening in the world, how extraordinary to, for however long I'm alive, to be able to experience these miraculous things. That's what I mean about the elemental business of being alive.

""Whether there's a God or not, I don't know. We are a part of the universe, a series of atoms that's coalesced for some reason into this conscious being, and we have the opportunity to experience the amazingness of the physical world.""

In the podcast, the television personality also spoke about his father's influence on him when it comes to thinking about masculinity and how he can convey that to his own son, Connor.

And the thing that stood out the most for him? That men from his father's generation simply didn't talk about mental health issues and males from his son's generation are much happier to dive into conversations about feelings.

""I think my dad being of his generation from England, he wasn't raised in a tradition of sharing your feelings. I think intellectually he knew how to do that,"" he said.

""But I would say that men today -- not across the board -- are much better at having that conversation... than my dad's generation was.

""It's still an issue and it's been great in recent years to see footballers, for example, who are strong masculine role models, start to talk openly about the kind of problems they have. One of the reasons I'm very proud of my son is that I have seen from a young age he's deeply empathetic to his friends and offers himself to be there.""

Andrew Denton said modelling might be his next career move -- at least he has the pose on point.

As for his next step into the future, he told Garone that he's looking forward to enjoying life -- even fitting in time for a quick laugh about his possible next career move.

""Look, I always transition [in his career], but for me I have a philosophy that life is the career, not the other way around,"" he said.

""In fact, when this is done, I'm really looking forward to stepping back out of the square.

""I think male modelling is my next step.""

Mais tous les quatre estiment que la politique à l'ancienne est moribonde et que, dans le court terme, tout est bon à prendre... sauf la place de président du parti LR.","Drôle de compétition, pour le leadership LR: il y a la première compétition, officielle et ouverte, entre quatre candidats à la présidence du parti, Laurent Wauquiez faisant figure de grand favori, à deux mois de l'échéance en tout cas (on sait ce qu'il est advenu des favoris dans cette famille). Et il y a, en retrait de l'avant-scène, quatre poids lourds qui fourbissent leurs armes et bâtissent une stratégie: ils prédisent que l'avenir et le leadership de la ""famille"" LR se jouera en dehors du parti.

Laurent Wauquiez, lui, est persuadé non seulement que sa victoire sera aisée en décembre, que le corps électoral des militants encartés à LR n'aura pas d'autre choix crédible que de voter pour lui (aucun des trois autres candidats, à ses yeux, ne roulant dans sa catégorie) mais aussi qu'il aura une nette longueur d'avance en ""prenant le parti"", dans la course de fond qui ne fait que commencer, du côté d'une ""droite décomplexée"" qu'il veut incarner depuis l'échec de François Fillon à la présidentielle.

Wauquiez s'est moulé en bon successeur-imitateur de Sarkozy

Pour cet ancien adepte d'une droite sociale et européenne, passé (après quelques années et des conseils de Patrick Buisson notamment) à l'ultra-droite à penchant souverainiste et ""identitaire"", sa campagne électorale actuelle a un but assez clair: maîtriser l'appareil LR, son budget, ses salariés et, au-delà des militants restés encartés (dont il devine qu'ils n'ont aucun penchant pour la modération), un réseau d'élus locaux qui reste le premier de France. Les dernières élections sénatoriales l'ont rappelé. Tout cela, pour le prétendant à la présidence du parti, moulé en bon successeur -et imitateur- de Nicolas Sarkozy pour accéder à cette fonction partisane, qui représente un précieux trésor de guerre, malgré les deux lourdes défaites politiques: celle de François Fillon, dès le premier tour de la présidentielle en avril 2017, et celle de Nicolas Sarkozy, dès le premier tour de la primaire de la droite, en novembre 2016.

Tous les hauts responsables de ce parti n'ont bien sûr pas la même analyse du double échec, de l'ancien Président de la République et de l'ancien Premier Ministre, aujourd'hui retirés de la politique. Quatre poids lourds font même le pari inverse: l'avenir ne passera pas par le parti. Le sujet a été mûrement réfléchi par deux actuels Présidents de région, qui pèsent lourd dans cette famille de la droite républicaine : Xavier Bertrand et Valérie Pécresse. Tous deux ont compris, notamment lors de leur campagne et leur victoire à la tête des régions Hauts-de-France et Ile-de-France il y a deux ans, puis en vivant ensuite dans une certaine douleur les campagnes des primaires, puis de la présidentielle, que la force partisane n'était vraiment plus ce qu'elle était du temps du RPR de Papa Chirac, et même du temps de l'UMP du grand frère Juppé.

Des partis assimilés à des affaires et de petites combinaisons

Discrédit croissant des appareils partisans, assimilés à des affaires incessantes et des combinaisons insignifiantes, incapacité des partis à favoriser la participation civique sur des enjeux puissants, difficulté des mêmes partis à faire émerger des idées originales et des projets présidentiels solides et cohérents... tout cela a conduit à l'émergence de phénomènes nouveaux, qui se sont développés en dehors du cadre des partis traditionnels. Le ""dégagisme"" est bien sûr passé par là, ou plus exactement, a été la résultante d'un vaste et lent processus d'autodestruction des partis classiques, dits de gouvernement. Le PS a été, en cette année 2017, le plus impacté, contraint même à vendre son immeuble, évitant de peu d'être rayé de la carte d'une représentation consistante à l'Assemblée Nationale. Le LR a mieux résisté (aux élections législatives de juin), mais rien ne dit que la force de l'appareil LR y est pour quelque chose...

Et si Laurent Wauquiez misait son avenir à partir d'un calcul vieux de 15 ans? Certains, y compris dans le camp très conservateur des ex-fillonistes et ex-sarkozistes, soulignent aujourd'hui, en coulisse et de manière totalement détachée, l'erreur stratégique commise en 2014 par Nicolas Sarkozy lui-même, entraîné et aveuglé par ses amis d'alors (Morano, Hortefeux...), qui estimaient que la meilleure manière d'emporter la présidentielle était déjà de ""prendre le parti""! Résultat, il est vrai avec une série d'autres boulets qui l'ont très sérieusement handicapé – son bilan de chef de l'Etat, son entourage, son comportement incorrigible, les affaires... - Nicolas Sarkozy n'a même pas passé la barre du premier tour... de la primaire de la droite.

Ne pas s'embarquer ""dans la galère de l'appareil LR""

Enorme déconvenue du camp sarkoziste, qui n'en s'est d'ailleurs pas remis, mais qui n'a pas empêché Laurent Wauquiez de tenter d'imiter le maître! Dans sa gestuelle comme dans son positionnement idéologique. Mais, avec moins de talent politique que l'ancien Président de la République, aura-t-il un meilleur résultat, à terme, et au final en 2022? Beaucoup d'eau coulera sous le pont Mirabeau d'ici là, personne ne peut prédire qui sortira fortement du lot de ces compétiteurs. Mais certains hauts responsables ont bien pris garde de pas s'embarquer ""dans la galère du parti"". Ainsi, celui qui était présenté au printemps comme un Premier-ministrable de François Fillon, Bruno Retailleau, réélu à la tête de plus de deux cent sénateurs LR, tout comme l'ancien Président de la région PACA, Christian Estrosi, ont bien veillé à rester en dehors de l'arène partisane, qui leur est apparue bien étriquée pour en faire ressortir une ambition politique à la fois attractive, crédible et rassembleuse. Bruno Retailleau, comme Christian Estrosi, Xavier Bertrand et Valérie Pécresse, parient tous les quatre bien davantage sur la force d'une identité politique et personnelle, résultant à la fois de leur expérience du terrain régional, d'un positionnement original assumé et d'un investissement dans le débat d'idées qu'il juge bien plus productif d'effets positifs que toute posture partisane.

Chacun à leur manière, dans ce quarteron d'éventuels prétendants au statut convoité de présidentiable LR, a pensé ou pense aujourd'hui à la fois créer un club d'idées et provoquer un mouvement d'opinion en leur faveur à l'occasion d'événements futurs. Chacun d'entre eux a aussi, et peut-être même surtout, très bien vu, a posteriori et avec une certaine admiration (qui reste officieuse), l'opération Macron lancée en 2016 et comment un ancien Ministre que tout le monde croyait isolé a réussi, en dehors de tous les partis en place, à conquérir les Français et l'Elysée, en explosant au passage une grande partie du paysage politique. Aucune de ces quatre personnalités LR ne dira bien sûr publiquement, ""chapeau l'artiste"". Mais tous les quatre estiment que la politique à l'ancienne est moribonde et que, dans le court terme, tout est bon à prendre... sauf la place de président du parti LR.

Voilà pourquoi ils ont laissé le chemin si libre à Laurent Wauquiez. Bien sûr, ce dernier peut tenter de faire de son parti une future écurie présidentielle à son seul service. Mais la ficelle apparaîtrait si grosse, y compris au regard très attentif de ses petits camarades, qu'elle pourrait devenir une chaîne de plomb: aussi lourde que le boulet partisan qu'elle traîne.

Sie behaupten, Bass habe der Türkei mit Angriffen des sogenannten Islamischen Staates gedroht

Es ist ein historischer Tiefpunkt in den Beziehungen zwischen der Türkei und den USA. In der Visa-Krise hat der türkische Staatspräsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan die Amerikaner erneut scharf angegriffen.

Im Mittelpunkt des Konfliktes steht ein Mann: John Bass, scheidender US-Botschafter in Ankara.

Erdogan warf der US-Regierung am Donnerstag in einer Rede vor Gouverneuren vor, die strategische Partnerschaft mit der Türkei für einen ""frechen Botschafter"" zu opfern.

Auch die türkische Presse schoss sich am Donnerstag auf Bass ein, den die Führung der AKP für die Eskalation verantwortlich macht.

► Der Hintergrund: Die USA hatten am Sonntag die Vergabe von Visa in ihren Vertretungen in der Türkei auf unbestimmte Zeit ausgesetzt. Hintergrund ist die Inhaftierung eines türkischen Mitarbeiters des US-Konsulats in Istanbul in der vergangenen Woche.

Die Medienkampagne, die die regierungsnahen Medien in der Türkei jetzt gegen die USA lostraten, ging jedoch noch viel weiter als die bisherigen gegenseitigen Vorwürfen.

""Die USA kontrollieren den IS""

Die konservative Zeitung ""Takvim"" warf Bass vor, der Türkei mit Angriffen des IS gedroht zu haben. Bass habe vor Journalisten erklärt, das Land habe den USA zu danken, dass die Terrormiliz dort in den vergangenen neuneinhalb Monaten keine Anschläge verübt habe.

""Das ist kein Beweis, dass der IS aufgegeben hat, sondern Resultat unserer Kooperation"", hatte Bass gesagt. Was er wohl meinte: Die Unterstützung der USA für die Regierung in Ankara habe den IS bislang abgeschreckt.

Die AKP-nahe Zeitung ""Aksam"" behauptete darauf, Bass habe zugegeben, die USA würden den IS kontrollieren: ""Der IS hat unter der Führung der Vereinigten Staaten gehandelt."" Bass drohe zwischen den Zeilen mit neuen Terroranschlägen in der Türkei.

Der Botschafter, der gerade vom US-Senat als neuer US-Vertreter im Afghanistan bestätigt wurde, habe während seiner Zeit in der Türkei enge Kontakte mit Gülenisten unterhalten, behauptete die ""Takvim"" – also mit Unterstützern des islamischen Predigers Fethullah Gülen, den die türkische Regierung als Terroristen einstuft.

Bedrängen die USA die Türkei von Bulgarien aus?

Die kleinere Zeitung ""Aydınlık"" berichtete indes gar von einem US-amerikanischen Plan, die Türkei militärisch von Norden unter Druck zu setzen.

Die USA hätten demnach amerikanische Soldaten von Rumänien über Bulgarien Richtung türkische Grenze geschickt. 2500 Soldaten seien demnach in Bulgarien stationiert, einige nur 60 Kilometer von der türkischen Grenze entfernt.

""Es geht darum, die Türkei zu umzingeln"", schreibt die Zeitung.

In anderen türkischen Medien ist die Rede von einem kurdischen Korridor gegen die Türkei, den die USA errichte. Gemeint sind die kurdisch kontrollierten Gebiete im Norden des Iraks und Syriens, wo die USA verschiedene Kurden-Gruppierungen unterstützt.

Auch Erdogan bediente am Donnerstag Verschwörungstheorien gegen die USA.

Es gebe ""eine Fraktion der alten Regierung, die versucht unsere Beziehung zu torpedieren"", sagte der türkische Präsident. Für die Eskalation sei also die Obama-Führung verantwortlich.

Even as thousands of Rohingya Muslims are fleeing Myanmar to escape violence and persecution at the hands of the country's military and police, the chief of India's premier body on social sciences believes they should not be tolerated in India.

The Hindu today reported on the remarks made by Braj Bihari Kumar, who heads the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), at a seminar recently organized by the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).

Speaking at the public event, Kumar said, ""This nation should not tolerate them as part of India.""

""This nation should not tolerate them as part of India.""

Earlier this year, Kumar succeeded prominent academic S.K. Thorat as the head of the ICSSR, an autonomous body established by the Indian government in 1969 to promote social studies research.

Kumar, 76, served has the editor of two journals, Dialogue and Chintan Srijan, published by Astha Bharati, a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting ""India's unity and integrity.""

The online news outlet, Scroll, has previously reported on the opinions that Kumar has professed over the course of years, including, ""There is none in India, who has suffered more due to intolerance than Narendra Modi.""

Kumar's remarks come at a time when the Modi government is making a legal case to deport Rohingya Muslim refugees from India, branding them as national security threat. The central government's position has been condemned by human rights activists and lawyers who argue that even those who are not citizens are guaranteed protection under the Indian Constitution when they are on Indian soil.

""There is none in India, who has suffered more due to intolerance than Narendra Modi.""

Speaking at the ICHR event, Kumar said, ""We should like to know about the Rohingyas also. What is their record? In 1943, when war was going on between the British and the Japanese, the British government of Burma supplied arms and ammunitions to the Rohingyas to fight against the Japanese, and the Rohingyas turned the gun towards the Buddhists,"" he said.

""How can Burmese forget such enemies? They are not fools like Indians. The Burmese remember their enemies,"""" Kumar continued. ""My point is that we can't placate illegal migrants. We should not do it. This nation should not tolerate them as a part of India.""

The Hindu further reported that Kumar had also claimed that Rajput king Prithviraj Chauhan beat Ghori 17 times but did not kill him. The newspaper pointed out that history tells us there were only two battles.

Barcelona im Oktober 2017. Ganz Europa blickt auf die Metropole im Nordosten Spaniens, als am Mittwoch den 5. Oktober Präsident Puidgemont eine Art ""Unabhängigkeit Light"" ausruft. Er erklärt die Abspaltung von Spanien – und setzt den Prozess dann gleich wieder aus.

We were too, as the kids would say, shook AF to even begin to piece things together. That being said, so were the bachelors, as they mourned Luke's departure and most likely eventual appearance on 'Bachelor In Paradise'.

Uncle Sam deemed himself ""the next frontrunner"" which is like Abraham Lincoln calling himself the best audience member the theatre has ever seen. Don't get too ahead of yourself mate.

Thankfully the most handsome magician in the house, Apollo, nabbed the single date. Uncle Sam called the muscular, handsome and kind Apollo ""a dark horse"" which is fine if you think the definition of ""dark horse"" is ""perfect man"".

Excuse us we just have a lot of fanfic to write about this.

If Sophie and Apollo weren't attractive enough their date basically involved getting into a pen full of puppies. They decided to do ""Doga"" which, before you get too excited, is doggy yoga. A woman wandered over to Apollo and Sophie and spritzed them with ""love spray"", something that'll get you kicked out of a Coles.

The pair did yoga with two of the fluffiest, cutest dogs and we stress-ate an entire tub of ice cream because of all the feelings.

Sophie and Apollo shared stories about being creative types. ""I used to have a mouse costume and one time I just sat really still for hours,"" Sophie admitted. ""My best friend was a girl and we used to hunt fairies,"" Apollo told her.

Honestly this is why no one likes creative types.

Back at the house Blake, one of the few boys yet to have a single date with Sophie, was concerned he wasn't getting enough time with her. He greeted her on the group date by telling her she had a ""sick outfit"". Men are so strange.

Osher informed the bachelors that they were about to compete in a boat race. Jarrod, the most competitive bachelor in history, was ready to throw his own team into the ocean.

Jarrod is the first man to find a way to power a boat purely from sheer competitiveness and screaming.

""GO, GO, GO, GO"" Jarrod screamed at everything on the boat. ""GO, GO, GO"" he shouted at a pile of ropes. Meanwhile Blake decided to give Sophie a massage.

""I love competition,"" Jarrod said before noting that the ocean was wet and the sky was blue. ""I love competition,"" Jarrod said like Scrooge McDuck would admit to loving money.

Unfortunately, despite all his incessant screaming at a bunch of ropes, Jarrod didn't win the alone time, Blake did.

As they sipped champagne on the front of a boat in the gorgeous Sydney Harbour Blake looked at Sophie and said, ""I really want to kiss you now"". Then he turned back to the harbour and stared directly into the sun, searing his eyes as the awkwardness set in of not actually kissing her.

""Ha ha this is not awkward at all,"" Blake said before snapping his champagne glass in half and eating it.

It was awkward as hell and such a huge missed opportunity for ol' Blakey boy.

Surprisingly this episode featured a THIRD date, possibly because Blake's alone time was so awkward and boring (for both Sophie AND us) Sophie gave Sam his second date. Remember the ""double delight rose""? The one Sam wouldn't shut up about? Well he finally got his second single date.

""It's like so tacky it's awesome,"" Sophie said either describing the hummer limo she picked him up in or his hair.

As Sophie and Sam drove through the countryside in a stretch hummer he kept talking about all his actor friends, his voice over work and how he basically is the best music producer in Australia. Sophie was so impressed she could barely make a facial impression.

Then she took him to play some connect four in a field because Sam is basically what would happen if a teenager had fallen in a coma in the '90s and only just woke up. ""Radical, I am so good at Connect Four! Cowabunga dudette!""

Somewhere, Jarrod is screaming ""I'M VERY GOOD AT CONNECT FOUR, I LOVE COMPETITION"".

The date went on as Sophie tried to quiz Sam about his intentions and why he decided to be on the show. Was it for fame? Was it for her? Was it for the bromance between him and Blake? Whatever it was, Sophie wasn't feeling the vibe and DIDN'T give Sammy a rose on their games date.

As Sophie entered the cocktail party Jarrod described her as ""Black Swan all over,"" a film where Natalie Portman wants to be so good at ballet she goes crazy and dies. Okay mate.

We then had to talk about Jarrod's love plant for ANOTHER DAY. The good news, however, is that his little plant was finally growing. ""Oh, mine's like massive... mine's overtaken yours but it's still good,"" she said pitifully.

""It bodes well for me that Sophie is impressed by minimal growth,"" Jarrod thought.

Blake and Sam had a really weird chat where they both decided that they'd love to be the final two because they both believe Sophie would be ""safe"" in the other's hands. It was... kind of creepy and weird.

Speaking of weird: this rose ceremony was BONKERS.

Two bachelors weren't going to get roses and quickly Jarrod, Stu and James all joined Apollo in the rose brigade, leaving Blake, Sam and AJ behind. There were a few swear words (sorry Ryan, we know you don't like swears!) as she dropped an immense bombshell.

Sophie dismissed AJ because, like who cares. Then she approached Sam and Blake, the two remaining bachelors. ""Do I know the real you, Sam?"" ""Blake, most of our time together I didn't think you liked me,"" she said to both of them.

Excuse us we just have a lot of fanfic to write about this.

She then walked back to the rose and... gave it to Blake!!!!

It confirms that diet is one of the most important to asses the risk of depression.
""Interestingly, in somatic symptoms (which included symptoms of pain, liver and hearing) what dominated was the bowels.
""Adolescents would go to their clinician and work out their Risk Index and where it's most affecting their risk -- is it their diet, lifestyle, stressful event?""","When we're sitting down to eat a meal, most of us don't think about how food could affect our mental health. But more research is showing the connection between what we eat and depression, and new research has validated this.

Using a first-of-its-kind 'Risk Index for Depression' to assess how different behaviours affect the risk of depression, the research found that our diet is the most important contributor to mental health, followed by other factors like sleep and exercise.

The research, predominantly done through IMPACT SRC at Deakin University in collaboration with Swinburne University, confirms that depression is not caused by one simple factor or event, but rather various factors which, if identified for each young person, could help clinicians recognise the early signs of depression. In other words, the Risk Index for Depression is about prevention.

Considering depression is a global health concern -- with one in six people to experience depression at some point in their life which will affect their wellbeing, personal relationships, work life and productivity -- the Risk Index for Depression shows promise as a tool to add (or remove) direct or indirect risks.

To understand more about the risk determinants for depression, HuffPost Australia spoke to the Risk Index for Depression (RID) developer and Swinburne lecturer in the Department of Statistics, Data Science and Epidemiology, Joanna Dipnall.

""We utilised a large database from the U.S. which has a huge amount of information about people's diet, lifestyle and self-reported medical symptoms,"" Dipnall said.

""We spent time compartmentalising each of the risk determinants for depression, which include diet, lifestyle, environs, biomarkers and somatic symptoms, and for each of those we put into a probability of depression and built this into a structural model of the RID to see if we could determine an overall risk of depression and isolate the important elements.

""What we found confirms that depression is not a simple condition -- it is complicated and multifaceted. It confirms that diet is one of the most important to asses the risk of depression. Diet has a direct path.""

A healthy diet with plenty of plant-based foods is incredibly important -- not just for physical health but mental health.

In the research, under each main risk determinant there are predicted probabilities of depression. Lifestyle included sleep, weight and exercise; demographics included gender, rage and age; biomarkers included red cell distribution risk; somatic symptoms included pain, bowels and thyroid; and diet included fruit, vegetable and whole grain intake.

A key finding from the research is that a person is more likely to become depressed if their diet is poor, their lifestyle is erratic and they do not exercise.

""Interestingly, in somatic symptoms (which included symptoms of pain, liver and hearing) what dominated was the bowels. This also ties into diet,"" Dipnall told HuffPost Australia.

""The team at Deakin University in the Food and Mood Centre are looking even further into this in isolation and have already found dietary fibre being central to gut health. My research is further confirming this.""

Certain dietary patterns influence parts of the brain, namely the hippocampus which is important for mental health.

So, what's comes next?

""This is the first stage. The RID is modular so we want to build on this model to include the important aspects of factors such as 'stressful life event',"" Dipnall said.

""It's not yet ready and needs more research, but ultimately the RID is about a predisposition to depression. What we want to do is be able to look at younger people and intervene based on their Risk Index with the best targeted intervention.""

Essentially, in the future clinicians may be able to use this tool to work out a young person's predisposition for depression and identify their various individual determinants.

""Adolescents would go to their clinician and work out their Risk Index and where it's most affecting their risk -- is it their diet, lifestyle, stressful event?"" Dipnall explained.

""A lot of people talk about depression and say, 'You've got to do this to help your mood', but nobody has really tried to bring it together to say, 'Yes there's diet, yes there's lifestyle, and yes you have these somatic symptoms'.""

Four French citizens survived the crash but were injured, Ivory Coast’s Security Minister Sidiki Diakite told reporters at the scene. Several Ivorian security sources said French soldiers were among the wounded.

“What we can say for the time being is that this morning around 8:30 (0830 GMT), an Antonov plane crashed...with 10 on board including the crew members,” he said.

The crash occurred during a storm with heavy rain and lightning and rescuers were hampered by rough seas. Though Abidjan’s airport is located in a heavily populated area, it did not appear that anyone was hurt on the ground.

The French military operates a logistics base next to the airport in support of its Barkhane operation, combating Islamist militants in West Africa’s Sahel region.

“This was a plane chartered by the French army in the framework of the Barkhane force in order to carry out logistical missions,” French army spokesman Colonel Patrick Steiger said.

It was not immediately clear what caused the plane to crash, he said, adding that the four injured French citizens were being treated at the French military base adjacent to the airport.

France’s ambassador to Ivory Coast along with French gendarmes and soldiers quickly arrived at the crash site.

Hundreds of residents of the heavily populated neighborhood of Port Bouet, which surrounds the airport, crowded around the crash site. Some of them assisted firefighters and rescue divers who freed the bodies of the dead from the wreckage, which had broken into several large pieces.

Le président de la République d'alors, Jacques Chirac, n'avait pas entendu son appel: ""Je vous demande le droit de mourir"".

En 2005, comme pour étouffer l'émotion suscitée par ce drame personnel, la loi Leonetti du 22 avril introduisait le tristement célèbre ""laisser mourir"" et l'hypocrite double effet des analgésiques. A peine quelques mois après la promulgation de cette loi, le drame du jeune Hervé Pierra démontrait cruellement, dans ce cas, l'inefficacité de cette nouvelle loi présentée comme presque parfaite par son auteur. Depuis 3 ans, les Belges, eux, bénéficiaient de la légalisation de l'euthanasie.

Lundi 2 octobre 2017. La fille d'Anne Bert annonce le décès de sa mère en Belgique. Anne Bert avait courageusement planifié cet ultime voyage; elle en avait la force morale et – pour quelque temps encore – physique et les moyens. Dans sa douleur, elle savait avoir encore cette chance de pouvoir fuir, s'exiler, se réfugier dans un pays qui place le respect des consciences et des volontés au-dessus des dogmes et des principes. Durant ces mois de témoignages, jusqu'à la parution de son livre si plein de vie, Le tout dernier été, Anne Bert a fait de son combat individuel un combat collectif.

De 2003 à 2017, combien de nos amis, de nos proches, de nos parents sont morts dans des conditions épouvantables, dans des souffrances insupportables et inadmissibles? Et pas à cause de la fatalité, pas à cause du manque de jugement de tel ou tel médecin, mais bien parce que la loi française est inappropriée dans de nombreux cas. Il y a pourtant déjà tellement de souffrances dans ce monde, qu'il n'est pas nécessaire d'en imposer d'autres, des ultimes, comme une rédemption qui n'a pas sa place dans notre république laïque.

Vincent Humbert, Hervé Pierra, Maïa Simon, Rémy Salvat, Chantal Sébire, Jean Mercier, Nicole Boucheton, Vincent Lambert et tellement d'autres ont tous enduré la surdité d'une partie du corps médical, celle que dénonçait le professeur Sicard dans son rapport remis au président de la République d'alors, François Hollande, en décembre 2012 ; cette partie du corps médical dont certains membres siègent sur les bancs de l'Assemblée nationale, bloquant, depuis 15 ans, toute tentative d'ouvrir à chacun des Français le droit de choisir les conditions de sa propre fin de vie.

Combien faudra-t-il encore de drames de la fin de vie pour qu'enfin le président de la République, le premier ministre, la ministre de la santé, les parlementaires acceptent de légaliser une aide médicalisée à mourir. Comment faut-il leur parler pour leur rappeler – comme ce fut le cas dans les années soixante-dix avec l'interruption volontaire de grossesse; comme ce fut le cas quarante ans plus tard avec le mariage pour tous – qu'un droit nouveau ne retire rien à ceux qui ne veulent pas en bénéficier et qu'une société, loin de se mettre en danger, s'enrichit des nouvelles libertés qu'elle accorde à ses citoyens. Le droit de mourir dans la dignité: un droit, évidemment, pas une obligation...

Demain, avec la légalisation de l'euthanasie et du suicide assisté, avec la garantie d'un accès universel aux soins palliatifs qui, malgré les grands discours, est loin d'être assuré alors que seuls 20% des mourants qui en ont besoin en bénéficient effectivement, avec le respect de la parole du patient et la démocratie sanitaire, avec le respect des volontés et des consciences – y compris, bien sûr, celle des médecins opposés à un geste actif de délivrance – nous mettrons un terme à tant de souffrances de fin de vie, à tant de déchéances insupportables pour celles et ceux qui en sont les victimes et pour leurs proches ainsi que pour leurs soignants, à des infantilisations comme trop souvent elles sont subies dans des établissements inadaptés et sous dotés en moyens humains. Humains...

Nous mettrons aussi fin aux graves dérives que connaît la France, car si, selon l'INED, il y a 0,8% d'euthanasies par an dans notre pays, seuls 0,2% des mourants l'ont demandée! C'est-à-dire que 1.100 personnes ont été entendues par des médecins courageux mais 3.400 ont été aidées... sans rien avoir demandé! Des dérives que le législateur ne veut pas voir...

Si la mort est une évidence dont nous avons conscience depuis la petite enfance, nous ne pouvons pas nous résoudre à notre souffrance, ni à celle de ceux que nous aimons.

Depuis 1980, l'Association pour le Droit de Mourir dans la Dignité – qui tient sa 37ème assemblée générale à La Rochelle le samedi 14 octobre 2017, en présence d'Olivier Falorni, député de Charente-Maritime et auteur d'une nouvelle proposition sur la fin de vie (réunion publique dès 14 heures) – milite pour qu'une loi d'ultime liberté donne à chacun la maîtrise de sa propre fin de vie. Nos près de 70.000 adhérents agissent au quotidien pour sensibiliser les élus français à cette nécessité humaniste tout en apportant une entraide solidaire à toutes celles et à tous ceux qui, en l'absence d'une loi de liberté, redoutent à juste titre les fins de vie dramatiques.

Comme l'a si bien écrit Chateaubriand, ""Tout nous ramène à quelque idée de la mort, parce que cette idée est au fond de la vie."" Alors, avec Marguerite Yourcenar, essayons de mourir ""les yeux ouverts!""

Friday, 13 October, will be remembered as the day women across the world took a day off from Twitter to protest sexual harassment, the company's apparent inability to contain abuse, and lax security that has, over the years, allowed a colony of vicious trolls to grow and thrive.

#WomenBoycottTwitter was trending nationally in India at 10 AM and women joined hands in solidarity to log off from Twitter — a self censorship of sorts — to force the social media giant to formulate better policies to control, regulate and punish accounts that issue death, rape and maiming threats to women, stalk them repeatedly and abuse and bully them on a regular basis with no serious consequences.

Women maintained that it will not silence their voices, but will stop Twitter from making money by exploiting them.

Recently, several women wrote to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey when he announced the newest policy of allowing longer — 280 characters, instead of the traditional 140 characters — tweets, and asked him to focus on women's safety on the platform instead.

This is a demand that Twitter's faced for years. Malicious, and mostly anonymous, trolling has turned the platform — one of the most vibrant communities in the online space for sharing moments, news, views and images — into an infestation.

Indian women are hoping that their silent protest will help bring the focus back on the subject.

According to the Guardian, the Twitter boycott started it suspended Rose McGowan, one of the accusers of film producer Harvey Weinstein, who is facing several sexual assault allegations, for violating its terms and policies. It kicked off at midnight in New York.

This was Twitter's response.

We have been in touch with Ms. McGowan's team. We want to explain that her account was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates our Terms of Service. 1/3 — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 12, 2017

Comme l’arbre qui cache la forêt, le suicide du créateur du Gaulois de Portneuf cache un pan de l’agriculture québécoise en péril.","Le suicide du Gaulois de Portneuf

Nicolas Mesly, reporter et photographe

Hugo Jolion-David, journaliste vidéo



« C’est un drame, parce que c’est d’abord la perte d’une vie humaine. Et puis c’est une entreprise agricole de moins sur notre territoire », résume Jean Poirier, maire de Saint-Basile, un village d’environ 2600 âmes dans la région de Portneuf, et dont la moitié de l’économie tourne autour de l’agriculture.



Peu avant Noël dernier, Rudy Ducreux, un jeune agriculteur d’origine française, mettait fin à ses jours en se pendant dans l’atelier de sa ferme, la ferme Ducrêt, située à un jet de pierre de la mairie.



Pour les gens du milieu, ce jeune agriculteur était une étoile filante dans le firmament des fromagers québécois. « C’était quelqu’un d’assez réservé. Mais dès que vous parliez d’agriculture, vous constatiez combien il était passionné! Ses fromages au lait cru, dont Le Gaulois de Portneuf, étaient exceptionnels, irremplaçables. On ne peut pas se permettre de perdre des gens comme lui », raconte Charles Trottier, copropriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines qui, partageant la même profession, l’a bien connu.



Les deux fromagers artisans ont passé à travers la crise de la listériose de 2008, qui a fait 2 morts et 38 malades, et où le gouvernement a fait jeter aux poubelles des milliers de kilogrammes de fromage. Dans un rapport sur la gestion de cette crise (2010), le ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation (MAPAQ) exonérait les fromages au lait cru en identifiant la bactérie coupable, le pulsovar 93, une souche de la bactérie Lysteria monocytigene, provenant de fromages au lait pasteurisé. Mais le mal était fait, le Québec ne compte plus aujourd’hui, avec le départ de Rudy Ducreux, que quatre ou cinq fromagers au lait cru, selon Normand Côté, président de l’Association des fromagers artisans du Québec, qui regroupe une trentaine de membres.



Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j'ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents.

– Charles Trottier



Un métier sous très haute tension



Le métier de fromager-artisan relève des 12 travaux d’Hercule. Il faut traire des vaches 2 fois par jour, 365 jours par année, car on ne peut pas fermer le pis des vaches comme l’eau d’un robinet. Il faut ensuite fabriquer son fromage dans des conditions hygiéniques aussi salubres qu’une salle d’opération d’hôpital. Et il faut l’emballer, le distribuer et le vendre dans les boutiques spécialisées ou les restaurants.



« C’est trois métiers dans un », explique Charles Trottier. Sans compter qu’il faut composer avec le stress de la météo, la ferme étant une usine à ciel ouvert, pour produire des fourrages et des grains afin d’alimenter les vaches.



C'est dans l'établi de sa ferme que le jeune agriculteur Rudy Ducreux a mis fin à ses jours.



De plus, ce métier s’exerce sous une charge administrative kafkaïenne. « Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j’ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents, dont un de fabrication du ministère de l’Agriculture, un permis du ministère de l’Environnement, un permis de transport du lait, de vente au détail, de l’organisme de certification biologique, de la municipalité… » poursuit Charles Trottier.



Comme si cette lourdeur administrative ne suffisait pas, la décision du gouvernement Trudeau de permettre l’importation de 16 000 tonnes métriques de fromages fins en provenance d’Europe dès le 21 septembre prochain sous l’Accord économique et commercial entre le Canada et l’Union européenne (AECG) risque de faucher plusieurs fromagers artisanaux du terroir québécois. « Cette importation, c’est l’équivalent de 640 fermes comme la nôtre. Il est illusoire de penser que nous ne serons pas affectés », croit Charles Trottier.



Depuis ses débuts, l’homme d’affaires a investi 1,8 million $ dans la fromagerie, dont 750 000 $ depuis deux ans, entre autres pour construire une nouvelle étable. Et il compte sur sa clientèle québécoise -- plus de 30 000 personnes visitent la fromagerie chaque année -- pour survivre.



Contrairement à Charles Trottier, qui dit travailler plus de 105 à 110 heures par semaine pour faire tourner la fromagerie avec son associé et une vingtaine d’employés, « Rudy, lui, opérait seul, avec l’énergie de la jeunesse ».



C’est peut-être parce qu’il devait se battre envers et contre tous que Rudy Ducreux avait surnommé son produit vedette « Le Gaulois de Portneuf », gagnant d’un prix Caseus (2011), sorte de Jeux olympiques annuels du fromage.



Charles Trottier, co-propriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines, a bien connu Rudy Ducreux, un champion fromager.



Combien d’agriculteurs se suicident?

« Je ne sais pas dans quelle mesure le cas de Rudy Ducreux est représentatif de l’état psychologique de l’ensemble des producteurs laitiers du Québec », dit Ginette Lafleur, doctorante au Centre de recherche et d’intervention sur le suicide et l’euthanasie (CRISE) à l’UQAM. Si les fromagers artisans ne transforment qu’une goutte de lait produite par les quelque 5 600 fermes laitières du Québec, ils sont le porte-étendard d’une industrie qui génère près de 30 % de toutes les recettes agricoles de la province.



Selon la doctorante, le métier d’agriculteur est reconnu comme l'un des plus à risque de stress à cause d’éléments incontrôlables comme la météo. Mais la mondialisation, les traités commerciaux, le prix du lait, le prix du quota, l’endettement des entreprises, les changements technologiques, les conflits familiaux, les chicanes de couple ou l’isolement sont tous des facteurs de stress qui s’additionnent et font grimper le taux de la détresse psychologique. « Jusqu’à ce que l’élastique pète », explique celle qui a étudié le malaise des agriculteurs tant au Québec qu’en France et en Suisse1.



Toutefois, la seule étude disponible sur le taux de suicide des agriculteurs québécois indiquait qu’il était le double de celui des hommes dans la population générale québécoise. Mais cette étude2 réalisée par Santé Canada date de trente ans (1971-1987). Le problème, pour obtenir l’heure juste, c’est que l’Institut national de la santé publique du Québec ne comptabilise pas les suicides par profession. En 2014, 845 Québécois se sont enlevé la vie et, depuis 1981, cette triste statistique annuelle oscille entre 795 et 1284 hommes.



Parmi les pays développés, la France s’est toutefois dotée en 2013 d’un Observatoire national du suicide qui dénombre 417 suicides chez les hommes agriculteurs entre 2007 à 2009, surtout dans les élevages de bovins.



Rudy Ducreux, l’arbre qui cache la forêt?



Notre enquête révèle cependant que le phénomène du suicide des agriculteurs existe bel et bien dans la campagne québécoise. Parlez-en à Laurier Gauthier, un voisin de Rudy Ducreux. L’homme de 67 ans est producteur de lait et copropriétaire avec ses frères de la seconde plus grosse érablière de la Belle Province. Il a offert de nous accompagner à la ferme Ducrêt.

La vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec.

– Laurier Gauthier

En chemin, à bord de son camion, M. Gauthier lance devant la ferme d’un de ses voisins. « Lui aussi il s’est suicidé. Puis pourtant, il avait de l’argent plein les poches. Il venait de s’acheter une Cadillac. Un bon matin, on apprend qu’il s’était tiré un coup de 22 en arrière des oreilles. Surprise totale ». Il ajoute avoir connu six personnes, dont cinq producteurs et un employé de ferme, qui se sont enlevé la vie dans un rayon de 12 kilomètres de son entreprise.



Quant au geste irrémédiable de Rudy Ducreux, M. Gauthier l’explique peut-être par une charge de travail trop lourde pour un seul homme, mais, « la vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec », dit-il. Maire de Saint-Basile durant une trentaine d’années, le producteur pointe du doigt l’actuel contexte socio-économique comme facteur important de détresse psychologique chez les producteurs agricoles. Il reproche à Québec, depuis le règne du ministre de l’Agriculture péquiste Jean Garon (1976-1985), champion de la souveraineté alimentaire, de nommer des ministres de l’Agriculture à temps partiel ou ignorant des enjeux.



Quant au fédéral, le producteur se demande jusqu’où Ottawa, dans l’actuelle renégociation de l’ALENA exigée par le président Donald Trump, est prêt à défendre la gestion de l’offre et ne pas la sacrifier au profit des secteurs du bois d’œuvre, de l’automobile ou de l’aviation.



Nous arrivons à la ferme Ducrêt. Rudy Ducreux avait acheté en 2004 la ferme de Luc Mailloux, un ex-fromager au lait cru, et frère du psychiatre controversé Pierre « Doc » Mailloux. Sur place, nous sommes accueillis par Connie McLellan, une jeune agricultrice de 28 ans originaire de Nouvelle-Écosse. Elle hésite à parler au journaliste, selon les conseils de l’avocat engagé par la succession « pour ne pas nuire à la vente de la ferme », prévue d’ici l’automne. Le corps de Rudy Ducreux a depuis longtemps été rapatrié par la famille.



Connie McLellan, une jeune productrice, s'occupe du troupeau de Rudy Ducreux.



La jeune femme explique avoir été recrutée pour traire le troupeau de 26 bêtes. À part le cliquetis des chaînes des vaches à l’étable, le silence règne autour de la maison, de la fromagerie, de l’établi et des remises désertés. Seul un chat en manque de caresses nous suit d’un bâtiment à l’autre.



Dans les champs adjacents, de la machinerie rouille au milieu de hautes herbes. Et on peut apercevoir de nouvelles plantations d’arbres sur les terres voisines autrefois cultivées. Comme l’arbre qui cache la forêt, le suicide du créateur du Gaulois de Portneuf cache un pan de l’agriculture québécoise en péril.

Eine Studie der Kultusministerkonferenz hat sich die Leistungen in den Fächern Deutsch und Mathematik angeschaut

Grundschüler in Deutschland haben mit immer größeren Lernschwierigkeiten zu kämpfen.

An diesem Freitag stellt die Kultusministerkonferenz (KMK) in Berlin eine Studie über das Niveau in den Fächern Deutsch und Mathematik vor. Die Präsidentin der KMK Susanne Eisenmann sprach von einer wichtigen Standortbestimmung.

Die Studie, die am Nachmittag präsentiert wird, zeigt laut baden-württembergischen Medienberichten, dass das Bildungsniveau vom Jahr 2011 auf 2016 in ganz Deutschland massiv gesunken ist - vor allem in zwei Bundesländern: Bremen und Baden-Württemberg.

Das berichteten die ""Heilbronner Stimme"" und der ""Mannheimer Morgen"" am Donnerstag unter Berufung auf Südwest-Regierungskreise. Die ""Südwest Presse"" berichtete von einem drohenden ""Desaster"". In Stuttgart verlangten die oppositionellen SPD und FDP bereits nachdrücklich Maßnahmen zur Stärkung der Grundschulen.

Mehr Lehrer sollen das Problem lösen

Unmittelbar vor der Präsentation der großen Schulstudie wird besonders der Ruf nach mehr Lehrern für Deutschlands Schulen lauter. ""Ohne ausreichend Lehrer kann es keinen Bildungserfolg geben"", sagte Hamburgs Schulsenator Ties Rabe (SPD) der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Berlin.

Rabe sagte, gegen den Lehrermangel seien kurzfristige Schritte und längerfristige Konzepte nötig. ""Es ist ein Zukunftsthema, dessen Brisanz sich immer schärfer abzeichnet."" Bestimmte Länder hätten erhebliche Probleme, ausreichend Nachwuchs zu finden.

Rabe zeigte sich offen dafür, verstärkt Uniabsolventen ohne Lehramtsstudium einzustellen. Geklärt werden müsse: ""Was lassen wir zu?"" Um die Situation dauerhaft zu entschärfen, müssten die Ausbildungskapazitäten erhöht werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: In den Schulen unterrichten immer mehr unqualifizierte Lehrer - Experten warnen vor den Folgen

Rabe sagte, bei Schultests dürften die Veränderungen in der Schülerschaft als Grund für durchschnittliche Änderungen der Schülerkompetenz nicht außer Acht gelassen werden. So seien weit mehr Kinder von nach Deutschland Geflüchteten in den Schulen, als noch vor wenigen Jahren.

Problemfall Sonderpädagogik

Die Kultusministerkonferenz hatte festgestellt, dass insbesondere die Grundschulen, die Sonderpädagogik und die beruflichen Schulen von Lehrermangel betroffen seien.

In den ostdeutschen Ländern herrsche noch deutlich mehr Bedarf als in westdeutschen Ländern. Nun solle unter anderem eine Stärkung der Berufs- und Studienorientierung geprüft werden - mit dem Ziel, dass mehr junge Menschen ein Lehramtsstudium aufnehmen.

I'm Not Going To Let MS Stop Me From Exercising - It's What Keeps Me Fighting I spent a lot of time in the gym when I was teenager.

The confession came just a day after the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said claimants could manage accounts entirely online, and only after HuffPost UK confronted officials with detailed accounts of hardship caused by phone fees.

The 55p a minute charge prompted a Commons showdown and was described as a “mass injustice” and “grim beyond belief” by an influential Labour MP.

“Justice calls for a freephone number to be introduced as a matter of urgency,” Frank Field, chair of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, told HuffPost.

HuffPost UK Calls to the Universal Credit helpline cost as much as 55p per minute

It comes after Theresa May fought off demands to scrap the fees after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged her to “show humanity” and cut the call costs.

The PM’s spokesperson later said most people claim Universal Credit online and so avoid the charges, while the DWP suggested people had a choice. “[F]or those who want to call us, they are charged at local rates,” it said.

However, claimants told HuffPost they are forced to use the 0345 helpline to set up their Universal Credit account in the first place - meaning all recipients are effectively required to use the service.

Donna Plant Donna Plant revealed she was forced to use the Universal Credit helpline as part of the set up process

Claimant Donna Plant told HuffPost on Thursday that along with using the helpline to set up her account, she is forced to use it every time she wants to re-arrange an appointment or meeting.

“To do anything, to set up, to make an appointment you have to ring the Universal Credit line,” the 33-year-old from Walsall, West Midlands, said.

“If you can’t attend an appointment you have to ring the helpline. The job centre don’t really do anything any more. There is no other option.”

Plant shared a letter with HuffPost which reveals claimants are told in writing to call the 0345 helpline number to re-arrange missed meetings and appointments.

And Plant is not alone. Other people contacted HuffPost to share their accounts of using the helpline either themselves or on the behalf of others.

‘30 to 40 minutes on hold’

“I was calling on behalf of a friend who because of [Universal Credit] and DWP errors nearly got evicted last year,” one person who did not wish to be named said.

“On average the time spent on hold of late has been around 30 to 40 minutes, no matter what time or day you call. For those on low incomes trying to get through it is an awfully high amount [to pay].”

One person helped by Citizens Advice said: “Since being on Universal Credit I have spent hours on the phone and have wasted so much money making these calls.

“Every month they deduct money from my payment so I have to call, explain the situation and then they send it back to me.

“It’s really inconvenient and on occasions when my payments have been on a weekend I have been left short and unable to pay my rent and other bills.”

‘How do they think that I can afford to pay 55p a minute?’

“How do they think that I can afford to pay 55p a minute to call Universal Credit?” Plant added.

“I’ve had to call twice this month so far, I needed to see if I could get a budgeting loan. I’m going to have call them again because an advisor hasn’t got back to me about my budget.”

In fact, after HuffPost shared the accounts with the DWP, it conceded in a statement that Universal Credit applicants are required to arrange an initial appointment over the phone.

PA Archive/PA Images The DWP has admitted Universal Credit claimants do need to use the phone to arrange an initial appointment

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman told HuffPost on Thursday: “Nine out of ten people are applying for Universal Credit online. Once they complete the online process, they are asked to arrange their first Work Coach appointment over the phone.

“After that point, they can re-arrange appointments and contact their Work Coach via their online journal, or by email.”

Stephen Lloyd, the Lib Dem DWP spokesperson, told HuffPost: “I am not surprised in the slightest that the DWP have had to come back and admit all new UC recipients have to phone the helpline initially, despite saying earlier they did not and that it could be done online.”

And Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, added: “The public will be knocked sideways by this mass injustice.

“The Government clearly looks as though it is kicking large numbers of people while they’re down; people without any money are required to pay for these essential calls just to try and establish a source of income.

“It’s grim beyond belief. Justice calls for a freephone number to be introduced as a matter of urgency, to prevent people sliding into destitution.”

Figures released under freedom of information laws show 55,000 people a week called the Universal Credit helpline during August.

HuffPost revealed on Wednesday that callers to the helpline are not given the option of being called back “straight away” due to data protection rules.

Our reporter spent 12 and a half minutes on hold before their request for a call back was denied by a call handler.

The call would have cost some people on mobiles £7.51, the equivalent of more than 11 percent of the weekly allowance for some claimants.

Justice Helen Bowskill described the Fortitude Valley incident as ""cowardly and violent"" and said his actions stole the life of a young man and ""destroyed"" those of his family and close friends.

However, she noted it was also a tragedy that Renata found himself in the prisoner's dock because of a single moment of gratuitous violence.

""We lost our best one,"" Cole's father Steven said, voice wavering, outside court as he spoke of his family's loss.

He said he thought Renata's sentencing was professionally and ably handled, but called for greater deterrents to stem a tide of ""senseless violence"" plaguing society as a whole.

""Our society is just full of violence every day and until there is a bigger deterrent I think we're not going to solve this problem,"" he said.

""We have a social problem with violence.""

His comments came after the bereaved father gave a heart-wrenching victim impact statement to the court describing the ""nightmare"" of losing his son.

Mr Miller said the talented water polo player was a ""kid with a dream"" and his death had thrown the family into ""utter turmoil"".

""It's been a long 20 months since then, I know my children suffer everyday,"" Mr Miller said.

""(The) tragic loss of their brother ... is a burden they will carry forever.""

At times dabbing his eyes with a tissue, Mr Miller described lying awake at night listening to his wife Mary-Leigh cry.

He then read his wife's statement in which she described having to take anti-depressants and sleeping tablets to cope with the devastation of her loss.

She said she was engulfed by grief whenever left alone and remembered her son as a beautiful, quiet and gentle young man.

Renata appeared distressed in the dock as he listened to the harrowing statements, later making his own apology to the court.

""From the very bottom of my heart, I am truly sorry,"" he said.

It comes after Renata's co-accused, Daniel Maxwell, walked from court in August after being given an 18-month suspended sentence for starting the fight that led to Mr Miller's death.

Maxwell has since been deported to New Zealand.

Renata's more than 600 days in pre-sentence custody were declared as time already served, meaning he could apply for parole in just under four years.",One Punch Killer Gets Seven Year Jail Term,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/13/one-punch-killer-gets-seven-year-jail-term_a_23242021/

Der Pflegenotstand in Deutschland ist gravierend - und die Politik versäumt es, notwendige Reformen zu verabschieden

Dabei bieten sich gerade skandinavische Modelle als Vorbild für politische Veränderungen an

Und: Schon die Änderung eines einzigen Satzes im Pflegegesetz könnte große Fortschritte bewirken

Deutschland ist ein altes, pflegebedürftiges Land. Und weil die Bevölkerung immer älter wird, wird Deutschland auch immer pflegebedürftiger.

Die Politik weiß um das Problem. Doch in den vergangenen vier Jahren hat die Bundesregierung wenig getan, um den Herausforderungen in der Pflege zu begegnen. Der Notstand wird ausgesessen - zum Leidtragen der Pflegebedürftigen und auch der Menschen, die sich um deren Versorgung kümmern.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 21-jähriger Pfleger klagt an: ""Die, die unseren Wohlstand erwirtschaftet haben, liegen jetzt in der Scheiße""

Auch im Bundestagswahlkampf und den Koalitionsverhandlungen über eine Jamaika-Koalition spielt das Thema Pflege bisher kaum eine Rolle. Eine nachhaltige Pflegereform ist in Deutschland also nicht in Sicht.

Und das, obwohl es in Skandinavien genug Vorbilder für funktionierende Pflegesysteme gäbe - und schon die Änderung eines einzigen Satzes im deutschen Pflegegesetz drastische Verbesserungen bewirken könnte.

Der Pflegebedarf wurde grob unterschätzt

Klar ist: Das deutsche Pflegesystem gilt schon lange als gescheitert.

Schon 2012 prognostizierte die Bertelsmann-Stiftung in einem Pflegereport, dass die Zahl der Pflegebedürftigen in Deutschland bis 2030 auf 3,4 Millionen Menschen steigen werde. Gleichzeitig werde die Zahl der Beschäftigten im Pflegesektor dramatisch abnehmen. ""Insgesamt werden 500.000 Vollzeitkräfte fehlen, wenn nicht gegengesteuert wird"", schrieben die Bertelsmann-Autoren damals.

Ihre Berechnungen basierten auf der Pflegestatistik 2009 - und wurden Anfang dieses Jahres als noch zurückhaltend entlarvt. Da erschien die aktuelle Pflegestatistik mit den Zahlen von 2015. Die Statistik offenbart: Vor zwei Jahren gab es in Deutschland bereits 2,9 Millionen Pflegebedürftige, die genannte Zahl von 3,4 Millionen bis 2030 wird wohl überschritten werden.

Der Pflegebedarf in Deutschland wurde also grob unterschätzt. Die Folgen: Überlastete Angehörige, unterversorgte Patienten und vollkommen überarbeitete Ärzte und Pflegekräfte.

""Im deutschen System wird erst agiert, wenn der Schaden eingetreten ist""

Dass es anders funktionieren kann, zeigen die skandinavischen Länder. Während Deutschland laut OECD-Statistiken nur knapp 1 Prozent seines Bruttoinlandsprodukts für die Pflege ausgibt, sind es in Norwegen, Schweden, Island, Finnland und Dänemark 2 bis 3,5 Prozent.

Das macht sich bemerkbar: Im Gegensatz zu Deutschland ist Skandinavien von einem Pflegenotstand weit entfernt. Die Politologin Cornelia Heintze vergleicht in ihrer Forschung seit Jahren die Pflegesysteme in den skandinavischen Ländern mit dem Modell in Deutschland.

Anders als in Deutschland werde in Skandinavien die Pflege als kommunale Aufgabe verstanden und deshalb vornehmlich aus Steueraufkommen finanziert, erklärt Heintze der HuffPost. Sie sagt: ""Im deutschen System wird erst agiert, wenn der Schaden eingetreten ist.""

Der Staat lasse die Menschen bei der Pflege im Stich. ""Da wird gesagt: 'Wir als Staat wollen damit nichts zu tun haben - wir haben ja den Markt, auf dem kann sich jeder selbst kümmern'"", erklärt Heintze. Das deutsche Pflegesystem funktioniere letztendlich wie eine Teilkasko-Versicherung, bei der hohe Ziele ausgegeben würden, ohne dafür das nötige Geld und die nötigen Strukturen zu haben.

Während also in Skandinavien der öffentliche Sektor Marktführer im Bereich Pflege sei, wären dies in Deutschland die privaten Anbieter. Diese sind laut Heintze maßgeblich mitverantwortlich für den aktuellen Notstand - weil sie ihre Mitarbeiter schlecht bezahlen und das Wohl der Patienten dem Profitgedanken unterordnen würden.

Wie skandinavische Ideen Deutschlands Pflegesystem reformieren könnten

Heintze hat deshalb gleich mehrere konkrete Vorschläge, wie Pflege in Deutschland neu organisiert werden müsste, um die steigende Zahl an Pflegebedürftigen versorgen zu können.

► Zunächst werde Deutschland nicht anders können, als mehr Geld für die Pflege in die Hand zu nehmen. ""Der Staat kann sich nicht darauf verlassen, dass sich Arbeitgeber und Gewerkschaften verständigen"", sagt Heintze.

Bei den privaten Heimbetreibern, die 40 Prozent des Marktes für sich beanspruchen würden, gäbe es keinerlei tarifliche Bestimmungen. Eine bessere öffentliche Gegenfinanzierung und eine Tarifeinheit könnten staatliche Einrichtungen wieder konkurrenzfähiger machen und somit für mehr Wettbewerb und Qualität in der Pflege sorgen.

► Für einen Pflegeplatz fallen in Deutschland laut Heintze monatlich durchschnittlich 1500 Euro private Zuzahlungen an. ""Es gibt nur einen kleinen Bevölkerungssatz, der sich diese privaten Zuzahlungen leisten kann"", sagt die Politologin.

Die Lösung: Den vom Staat getragenen Anteil am Pflegesatz ausweiten - so, wie in Skandinavien.

► Heintze empfiehlt zudem, den privaten Pflegebetreibern eine Gewinnbegrenzung von drei bis vier Prozent Rendite aufzuerlegen. So würden ausländische Investoren abgeschreckt, die das deutsche Pflegesystem für Profite anzapfen wollten.

""Die Haie abhalten"", nennt Heintze das.

► Die schwarz-gelbe Bundesregierung hat 2013 die Pflegegesetze zugunsten von privaten Anbietern reformiert. Private und freigemeinnützige Betreiber wurden gleichgestellt. Das Gesetz sieht laut Heintze seitdem sogar vor, dass private Pflegeleistungen ""der öffentlichen Leistungserbringung vorgehen"".

Heintze fordert: Es müsste genau umgekehrt sein, Non-Profits und öffentliche Geschäftsmodelle müssten den kommerziellen vorgehen. ""Das ist ein Satz, der geändert werden müsste"", sagt die Forscherin. Ein Satz, dessen Umformulierung den Weg hin zu einem staatlich gegenfinanziertem Pflegesystem kommunaler Verantwortung in Deutschland frei machen würde.

Deutschland wird nie Skandinavien sein - aber es kann ihm nacheifern

Das Deutschland das skandinavische Pflegemodell komplett adaptieren könnte, das glaubt auch Heintze nicht.

Die von ihr angesprochenen Reformen brächten in Deutschland noch lange kein solches System hervor, ""aber eines, dass der Würde des älteren Menschen mehr verpflichtet ist, Angehörige besser unterstützt und Pflege als gesellschaftliche Aufgabe annimmt.""

Ohnehin: Politische Mehrheiten für skandinavische Ideen in der Pflege sieht die Wissenschaftlerin nicht in Deutschland. Gerade auch, weil bald womöglich die FDP mitregieren würde, die die Privatisierung des Pflegesektors überhaupt erst vorangetrieben habe.

""Ich bin nicht optimistisch"", sagt Heintze deshalb. Die Politik verspräche zwar, sie würde sich der Realität stellen - ""aber ich sehe nicht, dass sie das tut.""

Yesterday, 11 October, was International Day of the Girl and Beyonce honoured it with a powerful new video of her Freedom track from her 2016 hit album Lemonade.

The new videos shows young girls from around the world mouthing the song's lyrics, while disturbing statistics about atrocities against girls are outlined in the background — like 71% of human trafficking victims are female, 63 million girls have undergone female genital mutation, 130 million girls are out of school, among many others.

The most piercing moment of the video comes in the form of a little Black girl dancing in front of the Capitol Hill, with Abraham Lincoln's statue watching over her in the background. In another shot, another one dances in front of the White House.

Intentional or not, these moments are poignant reminders of the oppression faced by girls who find themselves at the intersection of sexism and racism in Trump's America.

Mais la vérité n'est pas près d'éclater. Ce vendredi 13 octobre, le procès a dû être suspendu après un moment de grande tension et de confusion, lorsque les avocats de la défense ont quitté le prétoire... et été poursuivis jusque dans la rue par le président de la cour.

D'après le récit qu'en font les journalistes présents au procès, les avocats de Cécile Bourgeon et Berkane Makhlouf se sont indignés d'une remarque de Marie Grimaud, avocate de l'association Innocence en danger et partie civile à ce procès, qui a indiqué qu'un témoin de l'entourage du couple, entendu à la barre, avait par le passé été défendu par maître Mohamed Khanifar, l'actuel avocat de Berkane Makhlouf. Maître Renaud Portejoie, l'avocat de Cécile Bourgeon, a expliqué qu'il se sentait accusé de subornation de témoin, un délit pénal.

Comment démêler le vrai du faux?

En première instance, en novembre 2016 à Riom, la jeune femme avait été acquittée des violences, condamnée à cinq ans de prison pour avoir menti en 2013 sur la disparition de sa fille de cinq ans, tandis que son ancien concubin avait écopé de 20 ans de réclusion.

Cette semaine, ils ont crié de concert leur innocence. ""La mort de Fiona, elle était pas voulue. C'était un accident mais je ne suis pas médecin légiste"", a lancé Cécile Bourgeon. Et Berkane Makhlouf d'assurer qu'ils ne sont ""pas des criminels"", en regrettant que le corps de l'enfant n'ait pu être autopsié, faute d'avoir pu retrouver le lieu où le couple, connu pour sa toxicomanie à l'époque, dit l'avoir enterré, dans les environs de Clermont-Ferrand.

Mais comment croire aujourd'hui ceux qui sont tombés dans le discrédit depuis quatre ans, en mentant à la France entière? Comment démêler le vrai du faux dans leurs accusations réciproques et leurs multiples versions?

Cécile Bourgeon semble peser chaque mot, comme pour éviter des pièges

""Il m'a enfoncée, je l'ai enfoncé. J'ai déversé ma haine, toute ma rage"", explique Cécile Bourgeon au sujet de leurs aveux à Perpignan, en septembre 2013. Trois ans plus tard, autour du premier procès, elle disait encore tout et son contraire à deux surveillantes de prison, comme elles en ont témoigné cette semaine à la barre.

Au Puy-en-Velay, chacun joue sa partition. Makhlouf, volubile, intervient à tout va, sans y être invité, et parfois pour des détails, car au dernier procès, ""sans parler"", ""il avait pris 20 ans"". À l'inverse, Cécile Bourgeon semble peser chaque mot avant de répondre aux questions, comme pour éviter des pièges. Elle préfère le silence aux déclarations fracassantes et vindicatives de l'an dernier.

Mais plus la tension monte, moins l'accusée -que ses avocats surveillent pourtant comme du lait sur le feu- parvient à se maîtriser.

""Si vous ne vous calmez pas, je vais m'en mêler!""

Alors que sa mère est longuement interrogée mercredi soir, Cécile Bourgeon s'empare du micro et lance à ceux qui la bombardent de questions: ""Si vous ne vous calmez pas, je vais m'en mêler!"". Puis, à l'avocate d'une association de protection de l'enfance, Me Marie Grimaud, chaussée d'escarpins: ""on n'est pas en discothèque à danser en talons"".

Jeudi, c'est l'intervention d'une ancienne voisine et amie, qui exhorte les deux accusés à dire la vérité, qui la fait sortir de ses gonds. ""Si tu veux jouer, on va jouer, d'accord! Tu peux te regarder dans une glace, toi? Ça m'étonnerait! Moi? j'ai la conscience tranquille, pas toi. Attention!"", lance-t-elle à Berkane Makhlouf.

Les anciens partenaires vont-ils s'affronter? Ou s'en tenir au pacte que les parties civiles les soupçonnent d'avoir passé? ""Ils ne se tirent pas dans les pattes et il y a une alliance entre leurs avocats"", résume le père de Fiona, Nicolas Chafoulai, qui attend ""qu'on rentre dans le vif du sujet et qu'on aborde les faits pour savoir à quel jeu elle (son ex-compagne, ndlr) veut jouer"".

This is PART II of a two-part series. Check out the first part here.

As the air worsens for the winter, you may find yourself wanting to protect your family with air purifiers, masks, or a pollution sensor, but are uncertain how to select and use them. Here are some tips on to get the best:

Air purifiers:

HEPA filters are essential to remove PM2.5. Jeff Smith, a founding member of Help Delhi Breathe, advises looking for models with HEPA filters rated H13 or H14.

Many purifiers use carbon to remove odours and some harmful gases. Smith recommends those models that feature several kilos of activated carbon (or alumina).

Some models also feature ionisation technology. Barun Aggarwal, CEO of Breathe Easy, told us that ionisation is not essential (and can be harmful), so look for an air purifier with an option to shut this feature off, in models that use it.

A larger number of filters does not necessarily equal better performance.

Look for a unit that is portable. So it can be used in the bedroom at night, and in the living room in the day.

Smith cautions against machines that take air in only at the floor level as the filters will quickly get clogged with dust and larger particles.

To determine the required number of purifiers, Aggarwal suggests halving the square footage recommended by the manufacturer, as their numbers are based on ideal conditions and with the machine operating at high speed, which is often quite noisy.

Clean air delivery rate (CADR) is a metric used by manufacturers. A high CADR is important as buildings in India let in a lot of unfiltered, outside air. Therefore, a purifier that cleans the air well but cannot circulate the air in a room through its filter fast enough will not be effective.

Doors and windows must be kept closed for the purifiers to be effective. Open windows once a day for about an hour to reduce CO2 levels.

Purifier filter maintenance: Vacuum or wash pre-filters, but never wash a HEPA filter and avoid vacuuming HEPA filters as they are easily damaged. Check HEPA filters regularly and replace as per the manufacturer's instructions (up to 2 times per year in the most polluted places).

There are many products on the market, but a few that have been independently tested for the efficacy of their filters without any emission of harmful gases and their CADR include Sharp and IQAir.

Car purifiers are now available, but may not be necessary if your car has high-quality filters. Aggarwal advises people to test their cars before investing in one.

Masks:

Effective, inexpensive masks should be rated N95 or higher, such as Venus, 3M, and Honeywell masks. These masks cannot be gotten wet, are available only in adult sizes, and are disposable. When the mask is visibly soiled (or, in the case of a green, carbon-containing mask, when the smell of the filtered air changes), it must be replaced.

Masks are available in different levels of resistance. Lower resistance masks are not as effective at filtering particles, but are easier to wear during aerobic activities, and have one-way exhalation vents.

The more expensive masks, such as Vogmask and Cambridge mask, come in sizes for children. Aggarwal cautions that they can be very carefully surface cleaned, preferably after removing the valve, but not soaked nor wrung out to dry. Each manufacturer provides guidelines, but in unhealthy (red on AQI scale, PM2.5 56-150 µg/m3) conditions, one Cambridge mask can be worn for approximately 220 hours.

A mask is only effective when it fits snugly, with a metal piece across the nose and tightened at the base of the chin, as per the manufacturer's instructions.

Extend mask life by storing in a ziplock bag when not in use.

Do not wear masks for long periods of time as it can lead to higher exposure to CO2 (pay attention to symptoms: dizziness, headache, fatigue).

Nasal filters offer an exciting new type of protection against particulate pollution. They are more discreet and comfortable than masks. The self-adherent films that cover the entire nostril (versus alternatives that must be inserted into the nose) are the most effective.

Air pollution sensors:

Check online real-time resources for monitoring stations near you (e.g. http://clonewdelhi.com/custom/AQI/missionindiaaqi.php#, and http://aqicn.org/city/delhi/ito/, https://openaq.org/#/?_k=pt2rau).

Sensors can be purchased that measure a combination of PM2.5, PM10, carbon dioxide (CO2), and total volatile organic compounds.

Sensors come in three categories: A, B, and C grade sensors. The most readily available are C-grade sensors, which are good enough to tell the relative difference in air quality with or without an air purifier on (or indoor versus outdoor). However, readings from these sensors can be variable. More reliable and expensive are A- or B-grade sensors, which are reference grade (EPA approved) or commercial quality, respectively.

Aggarwal suggests using sensors only for the length of time required to make a measurement, then shutting them off and keeping them inside to prolong the life of the sensor, which may need to be replaced every 18 months to 2 years. Ideally, look for a model that allows for the replacement of the sensor after this period. Occasionally compare measurements with the closest publicly-available monitoring stations to make sure the sensor is still functioning well.

He condemned an RCMP questionnaire which appeared to target Muslim asylum seekers on Friday.

VANCOUVER — Canada's immigration minister is condemning an RCMP questionnaire that appears to target Muslim asylum seekers crossing the border from the United States into Quebec.

Speaking in Vancouver on Friday, Ahmed Hussen described the Mounties' interview guide as unacceptable, saying it is incompatible with the government's anti-discrimination policy.

Among other things, the document directed applicants to specify their religion and ""how often'' they practice it, and asked opinions about head coverings associated with Muslim women and terrorist groups with mainly Muslim members.

""That line of questioning is simply not consistent with the way we do things in Canada,'' Hussen said.

""It is unacceptable. It is against our values as a society to treat everyone equally.''

The questionnaire was used at a Quebec border crossing that saw thousands of asylum seekers enter from the U.S. over the summer.

Hussen said he applauded Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale's decision to put a stop to the practice as soon as he found out about it.

It is unacceptable. It is against our values as a society to treat everyone equally. Ahmed Hussen, Immigration Minister

A spokesman for Public Safety Canada said Thursday the questionnaire was only used ""locally'' and described the questions as inappropriate.

Asked about the document, an RCMP spokeswoman said it had been revised and the Mounties would not be granting interviews on the topic.

Hussen was in Vancouver to showcase changes to the Citizenship Act that came into effect this week that reduce the residency and language requirements for people applying to become Canadians.

As of Wednesday, permanent residents only need to be in Canada for three of the previous five years before they are eligible to apply for citizenship, with no minimum days per year. That compares with the previous law requiring that four of the past six years are spent in Canada, with a minimum of 183 days in each of those four years.

The new law also narrows the age at which applicants must meet language and knowledge requirements to anyone between 18 and 54 years of age, compared with the previous span of applicants who are between 14 and 64 years old.

New law allows faster path to citizenship



Changes to the act also now give credit towards the residency requirement for citizenship even before an applicant becomes a permanent resident.

""We hope that these steps will encourage even more permanent residents to meet their citizenship requirements to become Canadians,'' Hussen said.

""These changes will enable them to become Canadian citizens faster and do so in a flexible manner, contribute to them joining our family sooner and allowing them to contribute even more to our country's economic, social and cultural success.''

Amendment to the Citizenship Act received royal assent in June but certain provisions were delayed.

Further changes are expected in late 2017 and 2018, such as authorizing citizenship officers to seize suspected fraudulent documents and transferring responsibility from the minister to the federal court for making decisions on revoking someone's citizenship in cases of false representation or fraud.

Un musée chinois, situé dans la province de Hubei, dans la ville de Wuhan, a été contraint de retirer des photographies associant Africains et animaux sauvages, relate le New York Times. L'exposition, intitulée ""This is Africa"" (""Voici l'Afrique""), présentait une série de 150 clichés, pris par l'artiste chinois Yu Huiping.

Dans le détail, les photographies comparaient les expressions faciales d'Africains à autres chimpanzés, babouins, lions ou encore girafes. Parmi elles, un petit garçon Noir pose en ouvrant la bouche. À ses côtés, un singe ouvrant lui aussi sa gueule.

Les photos ont d'abord été dénoncées sur Instagram par un visiteur de l'exposition, Edward E. Duke, qui a la nationalité nigériane. ""Dans un musée à Wuhan, la Chine juxtapose des photographies d'une ethnie particulière à côté d'animaux sauvages, pourquoi?"". La publication a depuis été supprimée.

Mais cette exposition a continué d'indigner les Africains, y compris ceux qui vivent en Chine, a indiqué le conservateur de l'exposition. ""Pour montrer notre bonne volonté et notre sincérité, nous avons remplacé les photos que les amis africains jugent choquantes"", a-t-il expliqué, après avoir affirmé que ""dans les proverbes chinois, les animaux sont utilisés pour faire des compliments et suscitent l'admiration"".

Zhao Yingxin, président des Éditions nationales chinoises de la photographie, approuvait l'exposition, louant le travail de l'artiste: ""La photographie de Yu Huiping est perceptive, intelligente, et visuellement percutante. Elle capture l'énergie de la vie primitive"", déclare-t-il au site d'informations chinois Shangaiist, tandis que ce dernier la trouvait ""étonnamment offensive"".

Ce n'est pas la première fois que la Chine est accusée de racisme. Comme le rapporte 20 Minutes, une compagnie de lessive avait été contrainte de s'excuser en 2016, après avoir diffusé une publicité dans laquelle un Africain ressortait d'une machine à laver sous les traits d'un Asiatique.

Ce vendredi 13 octobre, un message a été envoyé par le ""système d'alerte et d'information des populations"" (SAIP), évoquant un exercice dans une école de Seine-Maritime.

Problème: l'alerte a été reçue bien au-delà des zones concernées et de nombreux utilisateurs ont fait état de bugs de l'application.

L'exercice a été annoncé par la préfecture de Seine-Maritime, qui a encouragé la population à tester l'application.

Techniquement, les alertes SAIP sont envoyées en fonction de la géolocalisation des événements. Par exemple, les utilisateurs qui sont géolocalisés à Lyon recevront une notification si un risque est détecté dans cette zone. Le site du ministère de l'Intérieur précise également que l'application ""permet également à l'utilisateur, même non géolocalisé, de recevoir des notifications d'alertes pour des zones prédéterminées.""

Mais ce vendredi 13, plusieurs alertes concernant un exercice en cours en Seine-Maritime, ont été reçues par des utilisateurs dans toute la France. Certains ont aussi fait état de ""bug"" lorsqu'ils ont tenté d'ouvrir la notification, tandis que d'autres ont regretté l'envoi d'alerte, souvent perçue comme anxiogène, dans le cadre d'un simple exercice.

Contacté par Le HuffPost, le ministère de l'Intérieur n'a dans un premier temps pas été en mesure de fournir une explication. Il a ensuite expliqué que l'alerte avait été reçue sur des téléphones où l'application n'était pas à jour. ""Il y a régulièrement des exercices de simulation d'attentat, mais en général, nous ne mobilisons pas l'application SAIP.

Ce n'est pas la première fois que l'application du gouvernement, mise en place lors de l'Euro 2016, est critiquée et jugée inefficace par les utilisateurs. Lors de l'attentat de Nice en juillet 2016, l'application s'était déclenchée avec plusieurs heures de retard. En septembre de la même année, c'est une fausse alerte évoquant une possible ""prise d'otage"" dans une église parisienne, qui a semé une panique générale. Le ministre de l'Intérieur de l'époque Bernard Cazeneuve s'était alors défendu, évoquant une une mesure ""de précaution"", tout en reconnaissant que SAIP devait encore être améliorée.

Plus récemment, en février 2017, l'application n'a pas non plus été déclenchée lors de l'attaque de militaire au Louvre. Cette fois-là cependant, le ministère de l'Intérieur a affirmé que l'alerte n'avait pas été envoyée volontairement. De même pour l'attentat sur les Champs-Elysées.

Pour autant, l'application SAIP est loin d'être au point, à en croire le rapport d'un sénateur publié en août 2017. Le sénateur LR de la Sarthe Jean-Pierre Vogel, au point sur le secteur de la sécurité civile, estimait alors que le système du gouvernement était ""obsolète"", ""défaillant"", ""contestable"". Un jugement très critique, une nouvelle fois partagé par certains utilisateurs ce vendredi, et qui remet en doute la crédibilité de l'application.

El ejercicio es indispensable para llevar una vida sana; sin embargo, a mucha gente le cuesta trabajo adoptar un programa regular de ejercicio. Esto puede ser un gran reto para la gente que ha llevado una vida sedentaria la mayor parte de su vida.

Motivación intrínseca y extrínseca

Existen dos tipos diferentes de motivación: intrínseca y extrínseca. Las motivaciones extrínsecas son valores que provienen del exterior. Para el ejercicio estas recompensas son cosas como nuestro aspecto, buscar los elogios de los demás, la pérdida de peso. No carecen de importancia estas razones, pero difícilmente te mantendrán motivado a menos de que exista una motivación intrínseca.

La motivación intrínseca es el significado que descubrimos y las recompensas internas que experimentamos como resultado de cualquier cosa que emprendemos. Cuando descubres a un corredor aporreando el pavimento en una tarde lluviosa, lo más probable es que el correr le proporcione una satisfacción interna por sí misma; es decir, que el corredor no sólo está tratando de verse bien, pero que también necesita algo más profundo, una satisfacción personal que mejora su calidad de vida.

Las satisfacciones intrínsecas que se obtienen gracias al ejercicio incluyen: la fuerza emocional, menores niveles de estrés, una sensación de bienestar, satisfacción espiritual, confianza, un propósito superior y crecimiento emocional. Para la gente que se ejercita en grupos, la sensación de comunidad es una motivación intrínseca.

La gente que se apega a programas de ejercicio a largo plazo tienen motivaciones intrínsecas. Si tu doctor te recomienda hacer ejercicio, necesitas encontrar un propósito adicional al de la pérdida de peso o de controlar la presión arterial para poder sentirte motivado diariamente. La gente que no tiene una motivación intrínseca es incongruente: lo que tienen que hacer contradice lo que quieren hacer. Es decir, saben que tienen que hacer ejercicio, pero emocionalmente no quieren hacerlo.

Cómo desarrollar una motivación intrínseca

El primer paso para comprometerse con un programa de ejercicio es construir una motivación intrínseca. Esto tomará tiempo y paciencia, especialmente si has sido sedentario la mayor parte de tu vida. El ejercicio regular requiere disciplina, pero las recompensas son inmensurables.

He aquí cinco sugerencias.

1. Encuentra algo que disfrutes

Antes de embarcarte en un nuevo programa de ejercicio, es importante pensar en tu personalidad y considerar qué actividad puede ser más atractiva para ti. Por ejemplo, algunas personas disfrutan las clases grupales, correr o caminar en grupo, mientras que otras personas prefieren estar solas a la hora de entrenar. Algunas personas disfrutan los ejercicios de movimientos repetitivos como nadar y correr, caminar o andar en bicicleta. Otras prefieren la variedad de la danza o una clase de Pilates, o aerobics acuáticos. Es más fácil que te den ganas de hacer ejercicio si encuentras una actividad que te guste.

2. Incrementa tus metas Tempura via Getty Images

Un obstáculo para construir motivación intrínseca es plantear objetivos que son demasiado ambiciosos y llevan al fracaso. Esto puede aplastar la motivación de cualquier persona por buena que sea.

Por ejemplo, si quieres nadar 30 minutos sin detenerte, necesitas ir construyendo el objetivo. El objetivo a largo plazo es nadar 30 minutos. Fija objetivos más pequeños que te lleven a un objetivo más grande: nadaré 3 veces esta semana; nadaré una vuelta sin detenerme y descansaré 30 segundos entre cada vuelta. La próxima semana nadaré dos vueltas sin detenerme. No importa la edad ni la habilidad atlética previa, seguir un programa de metas progresivas aumenta la fuerza y la resistencia.

Al tiempo que te fortaleces, la sensación de resistencia y fuerza te ayudará a construir motivación intrínseca. Es más fácil encontrar satisfacción en la actividad si te sientes bien con lo que estás haciendo. El establecer metas realistas ayudará a evitar el sabotaje de tu progreso.

3. Descubre tu rutina

Si es posible, planea entrenamientos a la misma hora todos los días para ayudarte. Por ejemplo, algunas personas pueden seguir mejor sus programas si es lo primero que hacen en la mañana. A otros les parece mejor en la noche. Otros prefieren la hora del almuerzo. No existe una hora específica, sólo la que sea mejor para ti. Lo importante es hacer que el ejercicio se vuelva parte de tu rutina diaria.

Piénsalo. Cepillar tus dientes y/o tomar café es algo que haces por lo general a la misma hora; el ejercicio necesita convertirse en un reflejo como el de estos rituales diarios.

4. Vuélvete responsable

Mucha gente considera que contratar un entrenador personal o unirse a un grupo los ayuda a estar motivados porque tienen una responsabilidad para con otros. Si te inscribes a una carrera de 5K o a un evento de spinning o de danza para recolectar fondos, también le da sentido a tu entrenamiento, ya que el evento te da un objetivo. En ambos casos, el enfoque compartido para el bienestar que se encuentra en los grupos despierta la camaradería.

5. Cambia tu percepción

La percepción y la actitud tienen un gran impacto en la motivación. Si odias ir al gym, lo más probable es que tu experiencia en el gym sea odiosa. Cambia tu percepción del ejercicio. En lugar de verlo como algo que tienes o debes hacer, considéralo una oportunidad para encontrar mayor satisfacción en la vida. Si permaneces en un programa tiempo suficiente como para construir resistencia física, descubrirás muchas recompensas internas: relajación, una sensación de bienestar, una mejor actitud, menor estrés, resistencia emocional, confianza, propósitos.

Sé paciente. Comprométete. Sé positivo. Mientras más cambies tu perspectiva, mayor será tu motivación. Lo prometo.

Ein Angler in England erstickte beinahe an einem Fisch

Die 14 Zentimeter lange Seezunge sprang dem Mann in den Mund

Rettungssanitäter mussten den 28-Jährigen wiederbeleben

Ein Angler am Pier der britischen Stadt Bournemouth erstickte beinahe an einem lebendigen Fisch. Er musste wiederbelebt werden, nachdem er das Tier versehentlich verschluckt hatte, so der britische Sender BBC.

Voller Freude über seinen Fang hielt der Mann sich den Fisch über den Mund, um ihn zu küssen. Doch die 14 Zentimeter große Seezunge zappelte sich frei und sprang in seinen Mund.

Dem 28-Jährigen wurde dadurch die Luftröhre blockiert. Trotz Erste-Hilfe-Maßnahmen durch seine Freunde erlitt der Angler einen Herzstillstand.

Sanitäter Harrison hatte nur einen Versuch, um den Fisch zu entfernen

Die gerufenen Rettungssanitäter konnten den Mann retten, indem sie den Fisch mit Hilfe einer Pinzette entfernten.

“Uns war bewusst, dass wir den Fisch aus dem Hals des Patienten entfernen mussten, sonst hätte er die kurze Fahrt bis zum Royal Bournemouth Hospital nicht überlebt”, sagte Sanitäter Matt Harrison der BBC.

”Tatsächlich hatte ich nur einen Versuch, um den Fisch zu entfernen. Denn wenn ich abgerutscht, ein Stück abgebrochen und der Fisch tiefer gerutscht wäre, hätten wir nichts mehr tun können, um die Blockierung zu lösen.”

“Hier ist es Tradition, seinen ersten Fang zu küssen”

Laut BBC berichtete Harrison, dass die Kiemen und Widerhaken der Seezunge zwar feststeckten, es ihm aber trotzdem gelang, den Fisch in einem Stück zu entfernen.

Die Sanitäter konnten anschließend das Herz des Anglers nach drei Minuten wieder zum Schlagen zu bringen. Für Harrison war es sein bis dahin bizarrster Einsatz.

“Wir sind alle sehr froh, dass der Patient keine Folgen von seinem Herzstillstand davon trägt, denn das Ganze hätte sehr leicht eine tragische Wendung nehmen können.”

Ein Freund des Anglers erklärt den ungewöhnlichen Vorfall so: “Hier ist es Tradition, seinen ersten Fang zu küssen.”

Wie ein Imker die Bienen entfernt, seht ihr im Video oben

Ein Mann aus Hillside in New Jersey fragte sich, was sich hinter seiner Wohnzimmerwand verbirgt. Immer wieder hörte er lautes Summen. Er vermutete einen Insektenschwarm hinter dem Gemäuer.

Und damit sollte er Recht behalten. Denn es war ein Schwarm aus 30.000 Bienen, wie unter anderem das Wissenschaftsportal “Science Alert” berichtet.

“Das ist verrückt! Sowas habe ich noch nie gesehen.”

Auch der Imker Mickey Hedegus, der den Schwarm beseitigen sollte, war beeindruckt. “Das ist verrückt! Sowas habe ich noch nie gesehen”, sagte er der ”Washington Post”.

Der Bienenzüchter bohrte zunächst ein kleines Loch in die Wand, um mithilfe einer Kamera die Größe des Schwarmes einzuschätzen.

Beim Öffnen der Wand stieß der Imker dann nach und nach auf immer mehr Bienen und Waben. “Das sind mindestens 30.0000 und über 40 Pfund Honig”, sagte Hedegus.

Der Imker wird mehr als 30 mal gestochen

Er nutzte einen Vakuumsauger und konnte 95 Prozent der Bienen aus der Wand in Boxen sammeln. Auch die Waben entfernte er aus der Wand und nahm sie mit, um die Bienen zu retten und nicht töten zu müssen.

Offenbar handelte es sich um eine sehr aggressive Art. “Ich wurde trotz meines Schutzanzugs mindestens 30 Mal gestochen. Das sind afrikanisierte Honigbienen. Diese Art baut besonders viel Waben und Honig an, sie sind aber auch äußerst aggressiv”, sagte er.

Encore un film de super-héros? Oui, mais celui-ci est sans doute le plus intrigant car l'enjeu est multiple. Le studio de production Warner Bros (qui détient les droits d'adaptation de DC Comics, l'éditeur américain qui publie les aventures de Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, la Justice League, etc.) doit tout d'abord solidifier l'univers partagé de DC Comics au cinéma, appelé DCEU — pour DC Extended Universe. Après les échecs critiques (mais pas commerciaux) de Batman v Superman: l'Aube de la Justice et Suicide Squad en 2016, le film Wonder Woman a été l'un des succès surprise de cette année 2017 et a réconcilié le public avec le DCEU. Warner doit continuer sur cette belle lancée malgré les problématiques rencontrées durant le tournage de Justice League. En effet, Zack Snyder s'est retiré du projet après un drame familial. Joss Whedon, réalisateur des deux volets d'Avengers chez la concurrence (Marvel) a finalisé le film en post-production. Enfin, il s'agit de la première incarnation sur grand écran de la mythique équipe de justiciers, composée ici de Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Cyborg et Aquaman (et sans doute Superman même s'il est absent du matériel promotionnel jusqu'à présent). Si les fans connaissent déjà les aventures papier de ces héros, le néophyte est sans doute perdu entre les nombreuses publications existantes.

Anthologie, volumes uniques et séries en plusieurs tomes

En France, c'est Urban Comics, la filiale spécialisée dans la bande dessinée américaine de Dargaud qui s'occupe de publier les ouvrages de DC Comics, et donc ceux sur la Justice League. Une porte d'entrée efficace est tout simplement le premier tome de la série Justice League sorti en 2012: Aux origines. Issu d'un relaunch, un concept qui relance à zéro les séries, c'est le livre idéal pour découvrir simplement un récit moderne, pas forcément de très grande qualité narrative, mais relativement efficace et mainstream. Achevée en dix tomes et d'une qualité hétérogène, les plus impatients pourront se ruer la version limitée compilant les deux derniers volumes sous le titre La Guerre de Darkseid (sortie prévue le 22 novembre — couverture provisoire à droite ci-dessous). Un beau livre tiré à 2.500 exemplaires, contenant de nombreux bonus et, qui plus est, offrant une histoire complexe et fascinante, dans laquelle les justiciers sont des ""Néo-Dieux"". La série se poursuit dans Justice League Rebirth - Tome 01: Les Machines du Chaos, vraie-fausse suite dont le premier volume est sorti en juin dernier mais qu'on déconseille fortement. En revanche, la série Justice League of America constitue un autre bon point de départ, reprenant les origines des héros. Début 2017, Urban Comics a proposé le premier tome (publié il y a 20 ans outre-Atlantique) et la série s'étale sur huit volumes au total (dont un numéro zéro).

Incontournable, Justice League Anthologie (en vente dès le 27 octobre) regroupe, comme son nom l'indique, des chapitres indépendants sur l'emblématique team parfois composée d'autres justiciers, moins connus du grand public, comme Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Le Limier Martien, Plastic Man, Hawkman, Black Canary, etc. Onze récits complets proposés par de prestigieux artistes. D'autres volumes uniques (one-shot) valent le coup et narrent une histoire avec un début, un milieu et une fin. Par exemple Justice, un indispensable sorti cet été ou encore La Tour de Babel, plus anecdotique dans sa partie graphique (assez grossière) mais qui met en avant la paranoïa de Batman au sein du groupe, à découvrir mais dispensable. Un autre récit culte est prévu pour 2018, toujours en un seul tome, La Nouvelle Frontière, du défunt Darwyn Cooke — à ne pas manquer dès sa sortie. Enfin, et c'est l'ouvrage le plus conseillé entre tous: Crise d'identité. Longue enquête pour découvrir qui se cache derrière la mort d'un des leurs (un personnage très secondaire de l'univers DC Comics), la Justice League souffre ici comme n'importe quel être en deuil. Malgré un nombre conséquent de protagonistes, l'œuvre, désormais culte, est parfaitement accessible et s'avère être, contre toute attente, un point d'entrée idéal elle aussi.

Les ""crises"" (crisis), une valeur sûre mais pas forcément accessible

Impossible de parler Justice League sans évoquer les récits majeurs dans la mythologie de DC Comics associés au terme ""crises"" (crisis en anglais). Ainsi, en complément de Crise d'identité (Identity Crisis en VO), on se doit d'ajouter Crisis on Infinite Earth (et son prélude Crisis Compagnon), datant de 1985-86 et la série Infinite Crisis (en cinq tomes) publiée vingt ans plus tard. Au programme: la fin et la renaissance du multivers, c'est à dire des terres parallèles où d'autres super-héros comme Batman, Superman, etc. officient également ; ou bien leurs fameux doubles maléfiques, comme dans le one-shot Justice League - L'Autre Terre, original mais pas particulièrement aisé pour un novice. La saga Infinite Crisis ne l'est pas non plus (sans compter ses connexions avec d'autres séries diverses) et Crisis on Infinite Earth, bien qu'une valeur sûre et indémodable, est plus contraignante à découvrir en premier (c'est d'ailleurs pourquoi Urban Comics a choisi de proposer cette bande dessinée dans son catalogue assez tardivement — environ quatre ans et demi après leur création). Ces récits complexes se poursuivent dans la série 52 (le premier des quatre tomes vient tout juste d'être mis en vente). Des aventures conseillées mais pas pour débuter vu tout ce qu'il faut découvrir auparavant.

Les amoureux des elseworlds, les univers alternatifs, seront comblés par la grande saga Injustice (10 tomes) issue du jeu vidéo éponyme dans laquelle Superman est un dictateur et où le Chevalier Noir mène une résistance de la dernière chance. C'est d'ailleurs une scène aperçue dans Batman v Superman: l'Aube de la Justice à travers un cauchemar prémonitoire de Bruce Wayne (et c'est justement suite à cette vision que le milliardaire souhaite rassembler d'autres super-héros et qu'il perçoit Superman comme une menace — avant de comprendre que le réel danger vient d'ailleurs). Pour les férus de futur hypothétique, on ne peut que conseiller le tome unique Kingdom Come, petit bijou facile d'accès (malgré, une fois de plus, son nombre de personnages très élevé). Dans un genre similaire mais moins réussis, Futures End et Earth 2 satisferont peut-être les curieux.

Il y a donc une offre conséquente sur le marché, soignée et accessible. On récapitule les indispensables pour découvrir l'univers de Justice League en BD!

Rendre l'accord iranien nul et non avenu couronnera l'approche perfide et malavisée de Trump et sapera irrémédiablement le leadership mondial, moral et politique de l'Amérique.","Il est tout à fait légitime de craindre que l'Iran poursuive ses efforts pour mettre au point des armes nucléaires dès que le Plan d'action global commun aura expiré dans dix ans. Mais il ne sert à rien de vouloir répondre à ces préoccupations en annulant l'accord actuel. Cette mesure ne ferait que raffermir davantage la volonté de l'Iran d'acquérir un arsenal nucléaire. Au contraire, les États-Unis et leurs alliés (aux côtés de la Russie et de la Chine) devraient s'appuyer sur cet accord pour qu'à son expiration, l'Iran n'acquière pas rapidement des armes nucléaires. L'idéal serait que l'État iranien soupèse les avantages de ne pas se doter de ce type d'armes par rapport à n'importe quel avantage stratégique qu'il pourrait éventuellement tirer en obtenant pareil arsenal.

Cette solution ne garantit nullement que l'Iran abandonne son ambition d'acquérir des armes nucléaires. Mais elle donne à la communauté internationale le temps et l'occasion d'offrir à l'Iran des mesures d'encouragement ainsi que la perspective de devenir un membre actif, constructif et respecté de la communauté des nations, s'il demeure un pays non nucléaire.

Dans son discours à l'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies, le président américain Donald Trump a déclaré: ""L'accord avec l'Iran est l'une des pires transactions et l'une des plus biaisées auxquelles les États-Unis aient jamais participé. Franchement, cet accord est un embarras pour les États-Unis et, croyez-moi, nous n'avons pas fini d'en entendre parler"".

Le problème, c'est que Donald Trump est tout simplement résolu à défaire les mesures législatives et les décrets du président Obama, qu'importe leur mérite, leur utilité ou leur efficacité. Hélas, le Plan d'action global commun n'y échappe pas. Le président américain ferait mieux de certifier que l'Iran a respecté et continue de respecter pleinement l'accord conclu, car l'annulation de ce dernier déclenchera des répercussions régionales et internationales dangereuses, bien au-delà de ce que Trump est capable d'envisager.

Avant la conclusion de cet accord, le gouvernement de Téhéran subissait déjà de fortes pressions, notamment de la population iranienne, pour résoudre le problème nucléaire avec les États-Unis, obtenir la levée des sanctions et atténuer la misère économique du peuple. Maintenant que le gouvernement respecte entièrement les termes de cet accord, les Iraniens soutiennent la position de leur gouvernement, même si cela signifie souffrir considérablement de l'imposition de nouvelles sanctions sévères. Les États-Unis ne peuvent donc pas compter sur le futur mécontentement de la population iranienne pour faire pression sur son gouvernement afin de négocier une nouvelle entente.

Une fois l'accord annulé, l'Iran sera libre de reprendre son programme nucléaire, au mépris des recommandations de la communauté internationale (d'autant plus que la plupart de ses installations sont toujours en place), ce qui entraînera inéluctablement une prolifération nucléaire au Moyen-Orient –précisément ce que les États-Unis cherchent à éviter. Trump pense qu'il pourrait négocier un meilleur accord, mais ses suppositions ne tiennent pas la route. Il lui reste encore à démontrer ses soi-disant talents de négociateur, alors qu'il a misérablement échoué à négocier avec son propre parti pour adopter un nouveau projet de loi en matière de soins de santé. En outre, comme l'Iran respecte en tous points l'accord actuel, il refusera catégoriquement de le renégocier.

À ce stade, l'annulation de cet accord entamera par ailleurs sérieusement la crédibilité des États-Unis qui essayent en même temps de trouver une solution pour négocier l'utilisation des armes nucléaires avec la Corée du Nord. Le dirigeant nord-coréen Kim Jong-un n'a aucune raison de se fier à Trump. Pour arrêter d'étendre son arsenal nucléaire, duquel il pense que la survie de son pays dépend, Kim Jong-un doit obtenir l'assurance que les États-Unis négocient de bonne foi. Or, renier l'accord nucléaire iranien compliquera considérablement toute négociation éventuelle avec l'État nord-coréen et ne facilitera pas la mise en place de solutions durables.

Les alliés des États-Unis, à savoir la France, l'Allemagne et la Grande-Bretagne –ainsi que la Russie et la Chine, cosignataires de cet accord– s'opposent fermement à l'annulation et ne soutiendront pas l'imposition de nouvelles sanctions. De plus, l'abandon de cet accord aura pour conséquences de laisser les États-Unis complètement isolés, de fragiliser la sécurité mondiale et de mettre à rude épreuve les relations de l'État américain avec ses alliés, eux-mêmes soumis à de fortes pressions suite au comportement imprévisible et malvenu de Donald Trump.

Si l'accord est annulé et que l'Iran obtient des armes nucléaires, cette situation consolidera sensiblement son emprise régionale et nourrira davantage son ambition hégémonique. De plus, l'annulation de cet accord aura pour conséquences d'intensifier le conflit entre l'Arabie saoudite et l'Iran, de prolonger la guerre par procuration entre les sunnites et les chiites au Yémen, en Irak et en Syrie, et d'enraciner davantage l'Iran dans tout le croissant entre le Golfe et la Méditerranée.

Les efforts des États-Unis pour lutter contre l'extrémisme islamique violent seront entravés, dans la mesure où l'Iran sera beaucoup plus dévolu au soutien de groupes extrémistes, au financement du terrorisme et à la déstabilisation de la région où et quand il le souhaitera. En outre, l'Iran poursuivra avec détermination son programme de missiles et aucune nouvelle sanction américaine ne pourra l'en dissuader, même si ces mesures ont permis de faire pression sur l'État iranien par le passé.

Le Premier ministre israélien Benyamin Nétanyahou fait cavalier seul en poussant naïvement Trump à annuler l'accord iranien. Il semblerait cependant que celui-ci ne comprenne pas les conséquences que cet acte malavisé aura sur la sécurité nationale d'Israël. En effet, l'annulation de l'accord iranien désavantagera considérablement Israël, puisque l'Iran sera en mesure d'accélérer l'élaboration de ses armes nucléaires. Selon toutes les estimations, l'Iran sera capable de tester une arme nucléaire dans un an.

Enfin, l'annulation de cet accord changera radicalement l'équilibre du pouvoir au Moyen-Orient entre les États arabes et l'Iran. Elle aura le même effet sur Israël et Téhéran, puisque l'Iran neutralisera le bouclier nucléaire israélien et laissera le pays tributaire d'une dissuasion nucléaire précaire au lieu de bénéficier d'un avantage stratégique.

Trump devrait écouter son secrétaire à la défense James Mattis qui a récemment déclaré devant le Congrès qu'il était dans l'intérêt de la sécurité nationale des États-Unis de maintenir cet accord. Au lieu de l'annuler, et de faire face aux terribles conséquences évoquées ci-dessus, Trump (avec le soutien des autres signataires) doit veiller à ce que l'Iran continue de respecter pleinement l'ensemble des dispositions de l'accord, en avertissant Téhéran que la communauté internationale ne tolérera pas la moindre violation.

Les États-Unis doivent essayer de renforcer cette entente et s'assurer qu'à son terme, l'Iran continuera de respecter les règles et les exigences du traité sur la non-prolifération des armes nucléaires (TNP), dont l'Iran est signataire, afin de l'empêcher de poursuivre secrètement son programme nucléaire.

Les États-Unis doivent également insister sur le fait que l'Agence internationale de l'énergie atomique continuera de procéder à des vérifications et des contrôles intrusifs, illimités et inopinés, pour que Téhéran comprenne bien les conséquences désastreuses qui s'ensuivront si l'Iran se fait prendre la main dans le sac.

En outre, les États-Unis devraient renforcer pleinement la coopération de leurs services de renseignement avec ceux des leurs alliés en partageant des informations pertinentes pour empêcher l'Iran ou n'importe lequel de ses représentants de planifier et de mettre en œuvre un acte de terrorisme, ou d'envoyer ou de fabriquer des armes à l'un ou l'autre de ses clients, comme le Hezbollah au Liban.

Il faut convaincre Téhéran qu'il est inacceptable que l'Iran continue de soutenir des organisations terroristes en leur fournissant de l'argent et du matériel pour déstabiliser la région. L'Iran en paiera le prix non seulement par l'imposition de sanctions paralysantes, mais aussi en risquant une confrontation militaire avec les États-Unis.

Il convient de souligner que le potentiel d'acquisition d'armes nucléaires de l'Iran doit être examiné dans le contexte de la situation régionale. Les États-Unis devront donc tenir compte des conflits qui impliquent l'Iran –y compris les guerres au Yémen, en Syrie et en Irak– dès que l'État islamique sera totalement vaincu. En effet, tant que persistent ces luttes violentes, l'Iran cherchera sans aucun doute à obtenir des armes nucléaires pour renforcer sa stature et son influence dans la région.

Les États-Unis doivent dès lors inciter l'Iran à résoudre la guerre civile en Syrie, le conflit au Yémen et la stabilité future de l'Irak. L'État américain doit également reconnaître le droit à l'indépendance des Kurdes irakiens, une reconnaissance qui permettrait d'atténuer, plutôt que d'exacerber, les tensions entre les Kurdes irakiens et la Turquie, l'Irak et l'Iran. En outre, les États-Unis doivent apporter une aide financière au Liban, à la Syrie et au Yémen dans le but d'affaiblir l'influence et la portée de l'Iran.

Enfin, les États-Unis doivent renforcer la défense des pays du Golfe afin de dissuader l'Iran de lancer des attaques conventionnelles, en fournissant à ces pays ainsi qu'à d'autres alliés du Moyen-Orient un parapluie nucléaire qui rendra bien moins attrayante la quête d'un armement nucléaire aux yeux de l'Iran. Les États-Unis ne doivent laisser aucun doute dans l'esprit du clergé iranien: ils respecteront leur engagement de protéger leurs alliés s'ils sont menacés directement ou indirectement par l'Iran.

À l'inverse, l'État iranien doit s'attendre à ce que ses relations avec l'Occident se normalisent et à ce que toutes les sanctions qui lui sont imposées soient progressivement levées, à mesure qu'il manifestera sa volonté de mettre un terme au soutien qu'il apporte aux organisations terroristes et aux extrémistes violents, en endiguant son programme de missiles à longue portée et en permettant l'organisation d'inspections continues et illimitées de ses installations nucléaires.

Toute mesure ne visant pas à certifier le respect par l'Iran de cet accord sera contre-productive, car elle le plongera dans la confusion et le désarroi, le mettant tout à fait en péril. Trump doit encore faire preuve de perspicacité diplomatique ou démontrer ses compétences pour résoudre des crises, mais il ne fait que s'engager dans des polémiques imprudentes et dangereuses qui empoisonnent davantage les relations entre les ennemis et les amis des États-Unis.

Rendre l'accord iranien nul et non avenu couronnera l'approche perfide et malavisée de Trump et sapera irrémédiablement le leadership mondial, moral et politique de l'Amérique. Les généraux de Trump le savent pertinemment bien et doivent donc l'arrêter avant qu'il ne soit trop tard.

AUSTIN -- A 3-year-old girl in suburban Dallas is missing after her father said he punished her for not drinking her milk by telling her to stand outside by herself at night near an alley behind her home, police said on Monday.

Wesley Mathews, 37, has been arrested for suspected child endangerment for the treatment of his daughter, Sherin. He was taken into custody on Saturday after reporting the incident to authorities and has been released on bond, according to police in Richardson, north of Dallas.

Mathews did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

But it is extremely unlikely that the board didn’t know about the allegations or the settlements, legal experts and industry sources told HuffPost this week.
Another Weinstein Co. employee, Lauren O’Connor, had detailed harassment allegations made by others in what the Times described as a “searing memo” that circulated internally.

Even if the board’s members were unaware of the settlements and allegations against Weinstein, they should have known about them, Yamada said.","Multiple members of the board of directors for The Weinstein Co. ― from which Harvey Weinstein was fired last Sunday ― have said that they did not know about allegations that the mogul had harassed and sexually assaulted women or about the numerous financial settlements he reportedly reached with accusers.

But experts — and news reports — have cast serious doubt on the board members’ claims of ignorance.

At least some members of the board knew as early as 2015 that Weinstein had reached financial settlements with women who had accused him of sexual harassment, the New York Times reported Thursday. Four members of the company’s board resigned last week; the remaining four members ― including Weinstein’s brother, Bob ― have denied that they had any prior knowledge of his behavior or the settlements.

But it is extremely unlikely that the board didn’t know about the allegations or the settlements, legal experts and industry sources told HuffPost this week.

Weinstein’s intimidating approach to his job and employees was no secret in the industry, according to several recent statements made in the press by people close to the company. Given prior investigations and allegations made internally at Weinstein and Co., that behavior should have alerted Weinstein’s board members to the larger harassment and assault accusations that surfaced this week, said David Yamada, a Suffolk University law professor who specializes in workplace bullying and employment issues.

Emily Nestor, a Weinstein Co. employee, complained about Weinstein’s behavior to the firm’s human resources department in 2014, according to the Times.

At least one Weinstein executive, Irwin Reiter, was aware of Weinstein’s “unwanted advances” toward Nestor and had raised the issue in meetings with Weinstein and messages with Nestor, The New Yorker reported this week.

Another Weinstein Co. employee, Lauren O’Connor, had detailed harassment allegations made by others in what the Times described as a “searing memo” that circulated internally.

Andrew Kelly/Reuters

New York City police had also investigated Weinstein in 2015 for allegedly groping Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.

“There were some letters and memos sent to the company, so they were put on notice that there were concerns about him,” Yamada said. “[Board] members have a fiduciary duty to be aware of legal settlements that could affect the health of the company, so it’s quite possible that board members or other high-level executives were aware of this. But for better or worse, their priorities tend to be with the profit margins of their company and not the experiences of the people under them.”

Board members were aware of at least three settlements Weinstein had reached, the company’s longtime lawyer told the Times on Thursday, appearing to contradict the statement the board released last week that denied any prior knowledge of the allegations against Weinstein. One board member, Lance Maerov, told the Times that, although he knew of settlements, he did not know they were related to alleged sexual misconduct.

Weinstein’s employment contract with the company also casts doubt on the idea that his fellow board members were blissfully unaware of his conduct. That contract, according to a Thursday report from TMZ, specifically allowed Weinstein to keep his job even if he was sued for sexual harassment and stated that if Weinstein was sued for any violation of the company’s code of conduct, he only had to pay a fine to the company and reimburse any damages it suffered to keep his job. The fines Weinstein would have paid the company ― ”$250,000 for the first such instance, $500,000 for the second such instance, $750,000 for the third such instance, and $1,000,000 for each additional instance,” according to TMZ ― are larger than the settlements he paid his accusers.

The report did not elaborate on whether the company had ever found Weinstein in violation or assessed any penalties.

Actor and director Rose McGowan, who reached a $100,000 settlement with Weinstein over allegations of harassment in 1997, this week called on the entire board to resign and suggested in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that men who did business with Weinstein had been “complicit” in his behavior.

In denying that it had knowledge of the accusations, the Weinstein Co. board announced that it was launching an investigation into Weinstein’s behavior toward female employees and actresses. Debra Katz, a partner at Katz, Marshall & Banks, a D.C. law firm that specializes in sexual harassment cases, said she had “every confidence that the board was aware of these allegations” and that the investigation should focus on which board members knew and which members “chose not to act.”

In fact, one board member, Tarak Ben Ammar, suggested this week that the company had attempted to address Weinstein’s behavior amid the groping allegation in 2015. “Two years ago, we demanded from [Weinstein] that he re-sign the company’s code of conduct on the basis of these rumors in 2015,” Ben Ammar told a French television station this week. But the board dropped the issue, Ben Ammar said, after Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. declined to press charges against Weinstein.

None of the four board members who resigned last week ― Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry, Technicolor deputy CEO Tim Sarnoff, investor Paul Tudor Jones, and investor and World Surf League founder Dirk Ziff ― immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment on whether they were aware of the allegations against Weinstein or the settlements he had reached with accusers. A Weinstein Co. spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the current board members.

India has a ""serious"" hunger problem and ranks 100th out of 119 countries on the global hunger index – behind North Korea, Bangladesh and Iraq but ahead of Pakistan, according to a report.

The country's serious hunger level is driven by high child malnutrition and underlines need for stronger commitment to the social sector, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) said in its report.

India stood at 97th position in last year's rankings.

""India is ranked 100th out of 119 countries, and has the third highest score in all of Asia -- only Afghanistan and Pakistan are ranked worse,"" IFPRI said in a statement.

""At 31.4, India's 2017 GHI (Global Hunger Index) score is at the high end of the 'serious' category, and is one of the main factors pushing South Asia to the category of worst performing region on the GHI this year, followed closely by Africa South of the Sahara,"" it added.

As per the report, India ranks below many of its neighbouring countries such as China (29th rank), Nepal (72), Myanmar (77), Sri Lank (84) and Bangladesh (88). It is ahead of Pakistan (106) and Afghanistan (107).

North Korea ranks 93rd while Iraq is at 78th position.

The GHI, now in its 12th year, ranks countries based on four key indicators -- undernourishment, child mortality, child wasting and child stunting.

The report ranked 119 countries in the developing world, nearly half of which have 'extremely alarming', 'alarming' or 'serious' hunger levels.

""India's high ranking on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) again this year brings to the fore the disturbing reality of the country s stubbornly high proportions of malnourished children,"" the statement said.

More than one-fifth of Indian children under five weigh too little for their height and over a third are too short for their age.

IFPRI pointed out that more than one-fifth of Indian children under five weigh too little for their height and over a third are too short for their age.

""Even with the massive scale up of national nutrition- focused programmes in India, drought and structural deficiencies have left large number of poor in India at risk of malnourishment in 2017, said P K Joshi, IFPRI Director for South Asia.

However, he said that the on-going efforts are expected to make significant changes in improving the existing situation.

Joshi appreciated that India has developed and launched an action plan on 'undernourishment free India' by 2022. The plan shows stronger commitment and greater investments in tackling malnutrition in the coming years.

""As of 2015-16, more than a fifth (21 percent) of children in India suffer from wasting (low weight for height) -- up from 20 percent in 2005-2006,"" IFPRI said.

Only three other countries in this year s GHI — Djibouti, Sri Lanka and South Sudan — show child wasting above 20 per cent. India s child wasting rate has not shown any substantial improvement over the past 25 years.

However, India has made considerable improvement in reducing its child stunting rate, down 29 per cent since 2000, but even that progress leaves India with a relatively high stunting rate of 38.4.","India Ranks 100th On Global Hunger Index, Trails North Korea, Bangladesh",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/12/india-ranks-100th-on-global-hunger-index-trails-north-korea-bangladesh_a_23241949/

Le scandale soulevé par Ronan Farrow dans le New Yorker à propos des agressions présumées de M. H. Weinstein (une enquête a été ouverte aux États-Unis et en Angleterre) a provoqué une onde de choc jusque dans l'industrie du cinéma français.

Comme l'a très bien exprimé le producteur Charles Gillibert, le rôle moins déterminant en France que peut avoir un producteur sur la carrière d'une actrice, limite - du moins nous l'espérons - les agissements d'un équivalent français à ce qui semble être un scandale massif ayant perduré pendant des dizaines d'années dans un milieu pourtant rompu à la médiatisation.

Nous sommes nombreux dans la profession, mais certainement bien au-delà du cinéma, à ressentir un grand malaise alors que notre société continue aujourd'hui de créer des situations semblables, souvent tragiques, presque systématiquement aux dépens des femmes.

À l'occasion de la condamnation en 2005 pour harcèlement sexuel du réalisateur Jean-Claude Brisseau, une guéguerre médiatique avait agité le milieu du cinéma et en avait révélé au-delà de ses penchants rétrogrades, un machisme spectaculaire. On pouvait alors entendre certains excuser un ""artiste"", la limite floue entre ce que l'on est en droit de demander à une actrice pour inspirer sa création et ce qui relève d'une perversion.

Ces dernières semaines, de nombreuses questions se sont percutées dans un fracas parfois indigne de la souffrance des victimes. Les échos aux affaires Polanski, Cantat, DSK (preuve que le sujet est transversal et touche surtout aux rapports de pouvoir), la question du chemin que peut prendre l'expression de la victime (en marge de l'affaire Baupin), la question du droit et de la morale, la question de savoir si un-e citoyen-ne qui a payé sa dette doit être socialement condamné-e à perpétuité. Si un-e citoyen-ne qui ne se rend pas légalement coupable de viol, de violence, n'est pas pour autant moralement responsable d'avoir imperceptiblement abusé de sa position.

J'ai depuis que j'ai commencé à travailler dans ce métier régulièrement et incidemment entendu des témoignages, que ce soit d'actrices ayant quitté un casting douteux, des réalisateurs parfois confirmés ayant reçu de jeunes actrices chez eux pour des séances photos pas tout à fait raccord avec le rôle envisagé, leur épouse dans la pièce à côté pour maintenir l'ambiguïté, de jeunes réalisatrices à qui un producteur, en marge d'une réunion de travail, proposait une relation intime, prétextant qu'il avait couché avec d'autres réalisatrices à qui cela avait plutôt bien réussi, un producteur feignant son trouble au moment d'engager une collaboratrice au prétexte qu'il était attiré par elle. Un autre agrémentant de commentaires salaces une réunion de casting autour de la recherche d'un rôle féminin pour un film en préparation. Et comment ne pas évoquer aujourd'hui cette actrice abasourdie de se voir demander à l'issue d'un dîner professionnel au Ritz avec M. Weinstein une proposition aussi crue que complètement déplacée?

À chaque fois, ces femmes ont eu la force, la structure, la présence d'esprit, parfois la chance de ne pas céder à ces avances, à la pression sourde d'un homme qui, parfois à la frontière de la légalité, propose une relation sexuelle en faisant plus ou moins subtilement un lien entre celle-ci et une relation de travail en cours ou à venir. Le prix à payer de leur succès n'avait pas à passer par les assauts d'hommes ayant maladivement et pathétiquement besoin d'exercer un rapport de pouvoir pour s'exciter sexuellement.

Derrière ces exemples quotidiens, combien de femmes et d'hommes ont été obligés de céder, combien de femmes et d'hommes se taisent aujourd'hui, paralysés par un sentiment de honte, celui de n'avoir pas anticipé, de n'avoir pas été entouré, préparé à cette violence, de n'avoir pas pu dire non, de devoir parfois à un agresseur une opportunité professionnelle? Les statistiques laissent craindre l'existence d'une foule ahurissante de victimes silencieuses.

Il ne s'agit pas de pointer du doigt, une fois de plus, les excès du milieu du cinéma. Il n'est pas plus pervers ou vertueux qu'un autre. À partir du moment ou un lien de dépendance (souvent d'une femme envers un homme) se crée, le danger existe. Certainement pas parce que les hommes sont tous des salauds, mais parce que notre société patriarcale, en dépit de progrès relatifs de l'égalité homme/femme, continue de supposer que le silence vaut consentement, que l'échange relation intime/opportunité professionnelle est un échange gagnant/gagnant. Et que l'homme est bien supérieur à la femme, une des preuves les plus flagrantes étant qu'il est mieux rémunéré à fonction égale.

Je suis un homme. Je suis producteur. Je me sens responsable.

Nos pratiques peuvent évoluer. Si on se pose la question des castings, pourquoi ne pas envisager une charte signée par l'ensemble des organisations de producteurs-trices, de réalisteur-rices, d'agent-e-s artistiques actant le fait qu'un casting doit systématiquement se faire en la présence d'au moins deux personnes, dont une personne du même sexe que la personne castée? Cela ne règlera certainement pas le problème, mais compliquera certainement la tâche de certains prédateurs ou cadrera les comportements ambigus qui peuvent parfois prendre place dans le huis clos d'une salle de casting. C'est au prix de ce genre de règles que nous ferons évoluer les mentalités.

La parole doit aussi être libérée, être encouragée, sans la crainte pour notre société d'une vindicte qui jetterait en pâture la présomption d'innocence comme c'est trop souvent le cas aujourd'hui.

Grâce aux médias, pourvu qu'ils s'appliquent la déontologie inhérente à leur responsabilité, mais aussi grâce à un accès renforcé à ceux qui peuvent soutenir et aiguiller les victimes en préservant leur anonymat quand elles le souhaitent.

Enfin, ce qui changera durablement les choses est notre rôle d'éducateur-rice, de parents, d'ami-e, de thérapeutes, de citoyen-ne. Nous avons tous la responsabilité de ne pas nous taire, de porter à la connaissance de tous, les témoignages de tels débordements, d'enseigner à nos enfants, à nos assistant-e-s, stagiaires et appenti-e-s, à nos élèves, ce qui est acceptable et ce qui ne l'est pas.

Certains se lassent déjà de la résonance donnée à l'affaire Weinstein, elle est pourtant symptomatique de la violence ancestrale de nos sociétés envers les femmes.

A tired-looking Boyle read a brief statement to the media late Friday after arriving in Toronto with his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, and their three young children. The family was freed by Pakistani commandos on Wednesday after they and their captors crossed the border from Afghanistan.

Boyle and Coleman had been kidnapped in Afghanistan in October 2012 while on a backpacking trip. Coleman was pregnant at the time and had four children in captivity. The birth of the fourth child had not been publicly known before Boyle appeared before journalists in Toronto.

With hands trembling as he read his statement, Boyle lambasted the ""stupidity and the evil"" of his kidnappers, who he said were members of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network, for abducting both him and his pregnant wife during a trip to help villagers in Afghanistan's Taliban-controlled areas.

Joshua Boyle leaves after speaking to the media at Pearson International Airport in Toronto. Boyle and his family were rescued earlier this week.

He said the Haqqani leadership authorized the murder of his infant daughter in retaliation for his refusal to accept an offer from the kidnappers, but did not elaborate on the offer. He also condemned his kidnappers for engaging in the brutal rape of his wife.

""Not as a lone action by one guard, but assisted by the captain of the guard and supervised by the commandant ... of the Haqqani network."" Boyle said.

""God willing, this litany of stupidity will be the epitaph of the Haqqani network.""

Boyle said the Afghan government should provide his family the justice that they are owed.

""I certainly do not intend to allow a brutal and sacrilegious gang of criminal miscreants to... weaken my family's commitment to do the right thing no matter the cost.""

Boyle said he and his wife now want to focus on building a new life.

""Obviously it will be of incredible importance to my family that we are able to build a secure sanctuary for our three surviving children, to call a home, to focus on edification and to try to regain some portion of the childhood that they have lost.""

God willing, this litany of stupidity will be the epitaph of the Haqqani network. Joshua Boyle, former hostage

The final leg of the family's journey to freedom was an Air Canada flight from London to Toronto.

U.S. State Department officials accompanied the Boyle family on the flight home.

Boyle gave The Associated Press a handwritten statement expressing disagreement with U.S. foreign policy.

""God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination, and to allow that to stagnate, to pursue personal pleasure or comfort while there is still deliberate and organized injustice in the world would be a betrayal of all I believe, and tantamount to sacrilege,"" he wrote.

He nodded to one of the State Department officials and said, ""Their interests are not my interests.""

He added that one of his children was in poor health and had to be force-fed by their Pakistani rescuers.

Joshua Boyle and his family were held by Afghan militants for five years.

Coleman, who is from Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, sat in the aisle of the business-class cabin wearing a tan-coloured headscarf.

She nodded wordlessly when she confirmed her identity to a reporter on board the flight. In the two seats next to her were her two elder children. In the seat beyond that was Boyle, with their youngest child in his lap.

The family was escorted off the plane five-to-10 minutes before the other passengers on the flight.

The Canadian government said in a statement that it joined the Boyle family ""in rejoicing over the long-awaited return to Canada of their loved ones.""

On Thursday, officials in Pakistan said the family had been rescued in ""an intelligence-based operation"" after their captors moved them across the border from Afghanistan.

The couple had set off in the summer 2012 on a journey that took them to Russia, the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and then to Afghanistan.

Their release came nearly five years to the day after Boyle and Coleman lost touch with their families while travelling in a mountainous region near the Afghan capital, Kabul.

Joshua Boyle stands next to his father Patrick Doyle after arriving with his wife and three children at Toronto Pearson International Airport.

Coleman's parents last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8, 2012, from an Internet cafe in what Boyle described as an ""unsafe"" part of Afghanistan.

Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nafees Zakaria, said the Pakistani raid that led to the family's rescue was based on a tip from U.S. intelligence and shows that Pakistan will act against a ""common enemy"" when Washington shares information.

U.S. officials have long accused Pakistan of ignoring groups like the Haqqani network. The Americans consider it a terrorist organization and have targeted its leaders with drone strikes.

But the Haqqani group also operates like a criminal network. Unlike the Islamic State group, it does not typically execute Western hostages, preferring to ransom them for cash.

A U.S. national security official, who was not authorized to discuss operational details of the release and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. obtained actionable information, passed it to Pakistani government officials, asked them to interdict and recover the hostages — and they did.

Boyle was once married to Zaynab Khadr, the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a senior al-Qaida financier. Her father, the late Ahmed Said Khadr, and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy.

The Canadian-born Omar Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a firefight and was taken to the U.S. detention centre at Guantanamo Bay. Officials had discounted any link between that background and Boyle's capture, with one official describing it in 2014 as a ""horrible coincidence.""

The U.S. Justice Department said neither Boyle nor Coleman is wanted for any federal crime.

Love and acceptance -- they're two of the things that the world can never have enough of.

Even prior to the ballots being delivered in the same sex marriage postal survey, the National Mental Health Commission released a statement expressing ""alarm"" at the detrimental mental health impacts of the marriage equality debate as ""damaging, emotive mistruths"" began to be spread about LGBTQ people by the 'No' campaign.

""I think fundamentally what's important is that we recognise everyone has dignity and everyone deserves to be treated equally,"" Atlassian's Head of Global Diversity and Inclusion, Aubrey Blanche, told HuffPost Australia.

""I think when you look at [marriage equality] from the lens of everyone needs a little bit more love in the world, then it seems like a pretty easy call to make.""

Atlassian staff donning their 'Love is Love' t-shirts.

But light projections aren't the only way Atlassian is rallying around their 'Outlassian' community -- they've also had a lot of internal initiatives that range from a rainbow bake sale (the proceeds of which went towards counselling services for LGBTQ individuals), staff donning 'Love is Love' t-shirts and an office with rainbow flags flying proudly.

""I will tell you that there's been more than a few tears of joy,"" Blanche said.

""The thing that resonates with me is when they [employees] say things like 'It's so hard right now but at least I can come to work', because they know [they belong] ... We use these symbols to communicate to them that they belong.""

Atlassian HQ will be lit up in support of marriage equality over the next week.



​At the heart of the company is a mission ""to unleash the potential in every team"" which starts from examining diversity at a grassroots level and working ""to do things that positively benefit the people around you"".

It's well known that the tech industry is a 'boy's club' -- in Australia women make up 46.3 percent of all employees, but only 28-31 percent occupy roles in technology -- and Atlassian is well aware that some of their female employees may sometimes feel isolated working in teams that lack a sense of community.

""With that insight [and] empirical knowledge, we were able over the last couple of years to invest in initiatives and programs ... so that they did have that feeling of belonging and that sense of community,"" she said.

To boost inclusivity, the company hosts initiatives like an informal 'coffee date' program where female employees are paired up and meet regularly for (you guessed it) coffee. There's also more formal peer mentoring and 'emerging leaders' programs that female employees can utilise.

As a result of specific programs and initiatives aimed at attracting Australia's top female talent, the multi-billion dollar enterprise said its proportion of female graduates jumped this year from 17 percent in 2016 to 55 percent.

""From what I've seen working in this space, one of the biggest things existing companies can do is to start showing off the amazing work that women in technology are already doing,"" Blanche said.

""When you lack a role model it's incredibly hard to choose a career path ... From a representation or numbers perspective -- what you've seen is two years ago we were hiring about 10 percent of women into our technical role and we've seen an 80 percent improvement.

The multi-billion dollar software enterprise has seen incredible growth in the representation of women in leadership.

""We've also seen incredible growth especially in the representation of women in leadership -- more than a third of the leaders brought on in the last year were women.""

Like everything though, the company isn't perfect -- and it acknowledges that. Indeed, Blanche knows that it's always important to be brutally honest while remaining committed to learning about initiatives that have worked and letting go of those that haven't.

Both the ANC and the ANC Women's League (ANCWL) on Friday afternoon sharply criticised an artwork by controversial artist Ayanda Mabulu depicting presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma engaged in sexual activity, as President Jacob Zuma stands with his genitals exposed.

In pictures of the artwork, widely shared on social media, Zuma is seen with his genitals exposed as Dlamini-Zuma lies in a compromising position on her back.

Zuma holds a chain tied around a woman's neck.

In a statement, ANCWL spokesperson Meokgo Matuba said Mabulu was ""a rented tool used by the enemies of the ANC to assassinate characters of ANC leaders"".

""Mr Mabulu is just an unfortunate mentally colonised artist who has been brainwashed [to think] that the political leaders, in particular Africans, must be attacked without shame and remorse,"" Matuba said.

""He is one of the lost souls in the hands of the exploiters advancing their wishes for the return of the pre-1994 apartheid and colonialism system.

""[The painting] is a desperate move by the white monopoly capital and their praise singers, using a rented black painter to tarnish the image of these leaders hoping that it will stop the winding wheels of radical economic transformation.""

Freedom of expression comes with reponsibility

ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa called the painting an ""affront not only to the individuals he regularly defiles but to the very founding values of our nation and an insult to our collective morality"".

""Mabulu has no conception of our societal mores and is a disgrace to any attempt that may or may not have been made to socialise him on our shared morality,"" Kodwa said in a statement.

He called on the South African National Editors' Forum (Sanef) and ""others who profess to stand for the defence of the Constitution"" not to turn a blind eye to the painting.

Sanef secretary-general Reggy Moalusi said the organisation respected the artist's right to freedom of expression.

""With the right to freedom of expression, however, comes the responsibility to ensure we do not defame people,"" he said.

Mabulu could not be reached for comment.

This is not the first time Mabulu has attracted criticism for depicting South African leaders in a sexual manner.

Mabulu made headlines in 2012 when he painted several works depicting Zuma naked and in compromising positions.

A painting titled Umshini Wam (bring my machine), showed the president wearing traditional Zulu regalia with his right leg raised and his genitals exposed.

In July 2016, Zuma's son, Edward, threatened to assault Mabulu after he painted Zuma engaging in a sexual act with one of the Gupta brothers.

In April this year, Mabulu was criticised by the Nelson Mandela Foundation after he painted Zuma raping former president Nelson Mandela.

The foundation said while it respected the artist's right to freedom of expression, it found the artwork ""distasteful"". -- News24",The ANCWL Is Not Having It With Ayanda Mbulu's Latest Depiction Of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/10/14/the-ancwl-is-not-having-it-with-ayanda-mbulus-latest-depiction-of-nkosazana-dlamini-zuma_a_23243190/?utm_hp_ref=za-homepage

On October 2, the 148th birth anniversary of M.K. Gandhi, millions of Indians awoke to visuals of Prime Minister Narendra Modi paying homage to him at Rajghat. Gandhi's favourite prayers were played on the radio, and black-and-white documentaries were shown across television channels. However, this saccharine and dutiful homage to the Father of the Nation only hides the stark fact that Gandhi is, in fact, dead to India, to 'official' India.

What did Gandhi stand for and how is his legacy faring in today's India? Above all, the Mahatma believed in the power of dialogue. The situation in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, a blood-red blot on India's soul, embodies the absence of dialogue and epitomises the power (and failure) of brute force. What would Gandhi have thought of pellet guns being used by Indian security forces against unarmed protesters that have ended up blinding hundreds? How many hunger strikes would he have undertaken to end this scourge?

Gandhi used religious symbols to unite India's diverse communities, reading from the Bible, the Koran and the Gita in his prayer meetings. Today, only Hindu religious symbols are used.

Gandhi held that the success of any policy should be measured by whether or not it benefited the poor. On September 17th, Prime Minister Modi celebrated his birthday with the 'gift' of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, aspiring to be the world's largest dam. Originally conceived of to benefit the drought-prone districts of four states, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra, the waters of the dam are now being disproportionately directed towards a few chosen corporates and companies like Coca-Cola and the Tata Nano car. The waters will submerge areas inhabited mostly by tribals, the poorest of Indians. Despite decades of promises of rehabilitation packages to the displaced, the ousted tribals continue to be short-changed.

Gandhi believed that the Press had a particularly critical role to play in a democracy, and he founded and edited several regional and English language publications. In India today, subtle and blatant methods are regularly employed to intimidate critics of the government, from the murder of journalists to the forced resignation of independent editors. Gandhi used religious symbols to unite India's diverse communities, reading from the Bible, the Koran and the Gita in his prayer meetings. Today, only Hindu religious symbols are used in the public sphere, with the express purpose of polarising different communities.

Although it is true that Gandhi was devoutly opposed to cow slaughter, he never accepted that his religion could be forced on non-Hindus in India. He was also keenly aware of Hindus who ate beef, and who traded in cow hides for business. He repeatedly pointed out that India was home to multiple religious communities: Muslims, Parsis, and Christians, with different culinary tastes and traditions. Today's India, with its cow vigilantes roaming the streets day and night is a travesty to everything Gandhi represented.

And yet, Gandhi lives

Gandhi lives in Prime Minister Modi's movement for a clean India, the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan, which was inaugurated on his birthday in 2014. Gandhi emphasised the dignity of manual labour and in setting a personal example, the ministers in the Modi government are more interested in photo-ops with brooms than in practising rules of sanitation.

Gandhi lives in the desire of Prime Minister Modi to willfully appropriate one of his signature campaigns to empower the poor: the use of homespun cotton, or Khadi. Earlier this year, a photograph of Modi replaced the classic picture of Gandhi spinning cotton in the 2017 calendar and diary published by the Khadi Village Industries Commission, a body created by parliament in 1956 to promote khadi and associated village industries. The attempt to erase Gandhi's association with something so quintessentially Gandhian signifies that the current Indian government wants to be associated with anything iconic, great or small, even if the comparisons are inept.

Unrelated to government propaganda, however, among millions of Indians, Gandhi lives. In the 1970s, he was the inspiration behind the Chipko movement, when forest-dwellers who were adversely affected by commercial logging tied themselves to trees to protest the depredations of contractors and successfully showed the power of peaceful protest. He has been the inspiration behind the numerous water satyagrahas, peaceful protests by tribals who have stood immersed in the waters of the Narmada to protest increasing the height of the dam that would destroy their homes and livelihoods with little-to-no compensation.

Gandhi lives on in the peaceful march of activists to the homes of victims of cow vigilante violence, even if their caravan of love has met with opposition of the sort that Gandhi, too, encountered in his marches to meet victims of communal violence. And Gandhi lives in the silent but powerful protest of journalists who met on October 2 to speak out against the targeting of journalists across India.

Across the world, Gandhi's ideas of peaceful protest have been put to work and given renewed meaning by African-Americans during the civil rights movement in the United States, by Green Party workers in Germany, protesters during the Arab Spring, student protesters, antiwar activists everywhere, and most recently, by women marchers in the United States.

Gandhi's physical death

The renewed and repeated death of Gandhi in, and by, 'official' India is of a piece with the sanitizing of his life, and indeed, his death. In Battle for Peace (2007), the Gandhian educationist Krishna Kumar wonders why busloads of schoolchildren who visit Rajghat, the official memorial to Gandhi, are never taken to Birla House, the place of his carefully planned assassination at the hands of a Hindu right-wing fanatic, Nathuram Godse (whose name is now being obliterated from school textbooks). Indian and foreign dignitaries also never visit Birla House. Kumar concludes that a 'silent agreement... has shaped India's life since Gandhi's assassination,' and that entails not asking difficult questions such as the reasons behind Gandhi's assassination.

Yet this was not always the case. In the immediate aftermath of Gandhi's assassination, the offices of the Hindu Mahasabha, an organisation to which his assassin Godse owed allegiance, were closed and its papers confiscated (later housed in the manuscripts section of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library). Thousands of workers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), another Hindu right-wing organization, were arrested, and the organisation was banned.

The ban on RSS worked only to a limited extent

A year later, RSS workers were released from prison. They now worked in secret to strengthen the Hindu community, and when they collected donations, they learned not to keep written records. Meanwhile, the Gandhi murder trial commenced, and Godse's fiery and unrepentant defence of his actions reportedly brought tears to the eyes of those in the courtroom. Years later, one of the judges who served the death sentence on Godse, Justice G. D. Khosla, would record that, ""had the audience of that day been constituted into a jury and entrusted with the task of deciding Godse's appeal, they would have brought in a verdict of 'not guilty' by an overwhelming majority.""

Therein lie the clues to why Gandhi's death has been the subject of such deafening silence. Godse's statement to the court was published posthumously and promptly banned by the Indian government led by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. There was to be no discussion; the wounds were too raw, the absence of guilt too unsettling.

As the years passed, many roads were named Mahatma Gandhi Marg, and many more Gandhi statues built across India. But the message of the Mahatma for an inclusive India was neglected, especially as the RSS soon found itself in government, in alliance with so-called secular parties, from 1977-79. The ideological question of ""dual membership"" (to the RSS and the Janata government) would go on to break India's first non-Congress coalition government. In the politicking and horse-trading of these years, there was simply no place for any sustained examination of the ambivalent place of Godse in India.

In his life and practice of politics, Gandhi embodied dialogue, even if he used the hunger strike to occasionally end negotiations. It is also important to underline that Gandhi's own practice of continuous reflection and self-critique, that led to dramatic reversals of opinion on important questions of Hindu social reform and inter-caste marriage, are in sync with the practice of academics who question several of the myths surrounding his status as Mahatma. As other contemporary Indian figures such as the anti-colonial revolutionary Bhagat Singh and constitutionalist B.R. Ambedkar find their space in the nationalist pantheon, Gandhi as Mahatma continues to resonate among diverse groups of people in India, and around the globe. In contemporary India, it is this quality of dialogue and reflection that is sought to be stifled, with ever-renewed vigour.

President Trump's belligerent approach in muddying the water with Iran is yet another ploy to remain true to populist promises he made to right-wing audiences, at home and abroad, in the course of his 2016 campaign for the White House. However, despite all his rhetoric, what remains obscure at the end of the day is what is to be gained by 'decertification of the nuclear agreement' and how such a move is likely to chastise Iran while enhancing US or Western interests?

The truth of the matter is that since the ratification of the nuclear deal in July 2015, Iran, despite having complied with all its obligations, has continued to suffer from persistent US obstructions. These obstructions have essentially prevented international banking and financial institutions from actively participating in what is generally believed to be the world's largest foreign investment market. Hence, all 'antics' aside, the only real difference in US position vis-à-vis Iran is that while the Obama administration made promises that it did not keep, President Trump, intends on passing the buck to Congress so that it can then re-impose the kind of robust measures, which the Treasury Department under his predecessors had never removed.

What is even more unclear is how exactly the pursuit of such gratuitous belligerency, which could potentially result in the cancellation of the nuclear agreement, benefit the US, its allies, and the cause of non-proliferation at a time when all parties are engaged in a serious crisis over international security with North Korea. Trump's message is clearly in contradiction to positions enunciated by all senior military officials as well as his key cabinet members who have spoken on the record about the need to honor the commitments which the US has made in conjunction with Russia, China, France Britain and Germany to the nuclear agreement that has also been endorsed by the UN Security Council.

Moreover, Trump's actions in this regard will not even satisfy regional players such as Israel or Saudi Arabia. They see this empty and inconsequential gesture on the part of the US President as a ploy for not living up to the kind of expectations he had created in advance of his election. In the case of Israel, such a ploy that is incapable of making any material short to mid-term difference to Iran's overall strategic disposition in the region is hardly any compensation for not moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, or openly validating Israeli settlement policies in the occupied territories. For Saudi Arabia, Trump's 'bad mouthing' of the Iranian regime in the absence of any direct military action against Iranian targets, falls way short of the kind of US support that would help resurrect their fortunes from the downward spiral of their bankrupt policies on Yemen and Qatar, while Iran consolidates its position in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

There is no question that Trump's exacerbation of a situation that hinders the flow of capital and investments needed for economic reconstruction into Iran, will seriously affect the lives of millions of ordinary Iranians. They had hoped that on the back of the nuclear agreement, the road would be paved for further agreements with the West that would assist Iran's complete rehabilitation and reintegration into the world community.

Sadly the Iranian people's overwhelming support for the re-election of Hassan Rouhani in the recent presidential election in face of hardline elements bent on frustrating his moderate and progressive agenda is being rewarded by policies and pronouncements that enhances the position of only those who want to emulate the North Korean model in dealing with the US.

In the final analysis, any move to dismantle the nuclear deal will not have the support of world public opinion or that of any of the other major signatories to that agreement. It will only relinquish the high moral ground to Iran, leaving the US as the isolated party.

Par le choix de ses mots, Hillary Clinton a fait référence à plusieurs polémiques survenues pendant la campagne présidentielle où elle était opposée au candidat républicain l'année dernière, notamment un enregistrement où Donald Trump tenait des propos dégradants envers les femmes. Elle a aussi commenté et comparé l'attitude du Président américain lors de sa rencontre avec Angela Merkel et celle avec Theresa May pour démontrer le sexisme et la misogynie de celui-ci.

Presidential frontrunner Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is kicking it up a gear in her campaign, spearheading the drive for support in the North-West province.

The former African Union chairperson is certainly walking the walk and talking the talk in her path to be the next president of South Africa.

Under the banner of the African National Congress Women's League, which has openly endorsed Dlamini-Zuma, she arrived in the province on Tuesday, certainly looking like a force to be reckoned with.

She began at the Madibeng municipality in Britz, speaking in a closed meeting to municipal leaders about the issues plaguing the area. Outside, hundreds of ANCWL members gathered on the roadside, cheering in support of Dlamini-Zuma.

The slogan ""NDZ for president"" marked on their shirts.

But it was her entourage that spoke to her increasing stature as a presidential frontrunner.

Dlamini-Zuma was escorted from the municipality by at least eight blue-light vehicles, behind which at least a dozen cars carrying ANCWL officials followed.

Her supporters were bussed between different venues where she would be appearing. They were ferried in at least two dozen minibus taxis.

Gutsy appearance at royal household

Her second visit was gutsy: a courtesy appearance at the royal house of Bapo Ba Mogale.

In the past, Dlamini-Zuma came under criticism from royal households, when Xhosa King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu told her the country was not ready for a woman president. She was at Sigcawu's Nqadu Great Place in Willowvale near Mthatha in the Eastern Cape when the king shunned her with his remarks.

But she was welcomed with open arms in the North-West.

CEO of Bapo Ba Mogale Investments Lehlohonolo Nthontho said they supported her policies on radical economic transformation and land redistribution.

Adorned in her usual 'doek' and smart two-piece suit, Dlamini-Zuma went on to speak to a small congregation of traditional leaders, members of the royal family and officials from the ANCWL.

She reverted to her usual rhetoric on land redistribution, economic transformation, industrialization and the empowerment of the youth and women.

""If we are to eradicate poverty, we cannot do it without ensuring women are empowered. We also, in this month, say we are going to continue the struggle to ensure that women are safe. It is a struggle that we have to fight all together, men and women,"" she said.

""We are also very mindful of the fact that 23 years into our democracy, we have a government of the ANC which has political power, but we cannot say we have economic power. We are admitting that we don't have economic power.""

It is the same themes she highlighted back in May when campaigning in KwaZulu-Natal, and has continued with the same vocabulary as a basis for her campaign throughout.

No mention was made of problems currently plaguing the ANC like state capture or the outcome of the vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.

Always smiling in front of her supporters, and strong in her demeanor, Dlamini-Zuma ended her visit at the royal household by addressing crowds of supporters before heading to Marikana, where she was due to lay a wreath in commemoration of fallen miners from the area.

That is where her campaign was dealt a blow.

Dlamini-Zuma and her entourage had to make a quick getaway when a small group of Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) members blocked them from initiating their ceremony, hurling insults and gesturing for the group to leave.

Marikana activist Napoleon Webster said they could not allow Dlamini-Zuma to exploit the tragedy.

""She is trying to use our pain to pave her way to the presidency, just like Cyril Ramaphosa did,"" he said.

""We cannot allow her to come her and use us when it's convenient for her.""

Dlamini-Zuma did not even exit her vehicle before the entourage sped off, five minutes after arriving at the site.

She was due to end her day of campaigning at the University of the North West, Mafikeng Campus, where she would speak on the role of education in influencing radical economic transformation.",Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Was Starting To Look Presidential -- Before It All Went Wrong In Marikana,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/08/22/nkosazana-dlamini-zuma-was-starting-to-look-presidential-before-it-all-went-wrong-in-marikana_a_23157741/?utm_hp_ref=za-homepage

Um die Rechten zu verstehen, lohnt ein Blick nach Österreich und in die Schweiz

Denn die rechtsnationale FPÖ und die völkische SVP haben nicht nur eine ähnliche Geschichte, wie die AfD - sondern auch ähnliche Schwächen

Von Österreich lernen heißt manchmal auch zu lernen, wie man es nicht macht.

Es war im Mai 2016, der Abend nach dem zweiten Wahlgang zur österreichischen Bundespräsidentenwahl. Noch weiß niemand, dass dieses Votum Wochen später annulliert werden sollte, weil es zu Unregelmäßigkeiten bei der Briefwahl kam.

Für die österreichischen Grünen war der Politiker Alexander Van der Bellen ins Rennen gegangen. Im zweiten Wahlgang wurde er auch von den österreichischen Sozialdemokraten unterstützt. Van der Bellens Anhänger feierten in einem piekfeinen Palais am Wiener Ring. Goldverzierter Stuck an den Wänden, aufwändige Malereien. Die Decken so hoch die die Fabrikhalle eines mittelständischen Maschinenbaubetriebs.

Zutritt gab es nur durch eine Eingangsschleuse. Und während das linke Österreich auf die knappen Wahlergebnisse wartete, hielt es sich vornehmlich am Sekt- oder am Weinglas fest.

Einige Kilometer weiter, im Prater, feierte die FPÖ mit ihrem Kandidaten Norbert Hofer. Einlass gab es für jeden, der kommen wollte. Auf der Bühne sang eine volkstümliche Kapelle. Hendl und literweise Bier wurden gratis serviert. Noch vor Sonnenuntergang, und lang bevor es irgendwelche Ergebnisse gab, begann Österreichs Rechte zu tanzen und zu singen.

Es war ein Bild wie bei Don Camillo und Peppone, das Wien an diesem Abend abgab. Ein schauriges Spiegelbild eines total verunglückten Wahlkampfs.

Gute Argumente sind wichtig – aber manchmal reichen sie nicht

Auf der einen Seite das linke Establishment, das sich selbst mit Pomp und Prunk feierte. Auf der anderen Seite die ewig attackierende Rechte, die selbst in den Stunden der Ungewissheit von sich behaupten konnte, dass sie etwas kommuniziert: Nämlich, dass sie die Sache mit der Volkstümlichkeit besser versteht als die alte Arbeiterpartei SPÖ.

In Österreich, und auch in der Schweiz, sind rechtsradikale Positionen schon seit Jahren in den Mittelpunkt der öffentlichen Debatte gerückt. Das drückt sich auch in den Wahlergebnissen aus: Die FPÖ schaffte es im vergangenen Jahr, beinahe den Bundespräsidenten zu stellen.

Und die SVP ist mit 29,4 Prozent der Stimmen bei der Nationalratswahl 2015 die mit Abstand stärkste Kraft geworden.

Der Aufstieg der Rechtspopulisten in unseren Nachbarländern zeigt uns, was schief laufen kann im Kampf gegen fremdenfeindliches Gedankengut, so wie es die AfD in Deutschland bisweilen vertritt. Gute Argumente sind wichtig – aber manchmal reichen sie nicht.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 8 Dinge, die jeder tun kann, um den Aufstieg der AfD zu stoppen



Immer wieder beruft sich die Alternative für Deutschland etwa auf die SVP in der Schweiz – was nicht selten Unmut bei der Volkspartei hervorruft.

In der Schweiz gibt man sich als Rechter gerne bürgerlich, in Deutschland operiert die AfD gezielt mit Bildern der Revolution und des Umsturzes – zuletzt im Wahlkampf, als Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel im Rahmen einer Kampagne als „Eidbrecherin“ bezeichnet wurde.

Beide Parteien jedoch beherrschen geschickt das Spiel mit den Ängsten der Bürger. Sie stoßen damit jeweils in eine Lücke auf dem Markt der politischen Ideen, die durch jahrelange Konsenspolitik erzeugt wurde.

Stimmungsmache gegen die Konsenskultur

In der Schweiz war der Konsens jahrzehntelang das wichtigste Mittel der Politik. Der Bundesrat, das Äquivalent zur deutschen Bundesregierung, wird aus Vertretern aller größeren Parteien gebildet. Die Große Koalition in Berlin wiederum repräsentierte 80 Prozent der Abgeordneten. Mehr Konsens geht in der deutschen Politik kaum.

Seit den 1990er-Jahren hat es die SVP geschickt verstanden, gegen die Konsenskultur Stimmung zu machen. Dadurch sind Positionen sagbar geworden, die noch vor einigen Jahren allenfalls an Stammtischen auf Unterstützung getroffen werden.

Die AfD hat diese Strategie schon im Namen: Sie will eine ""Alternative“ zu den so genannten ""Altparteien“ sein.

Eine ""Alternative“ zu sein reicht jedoch noch nicht. Ob eine ""Alternative“ auch vom Wähler als solche wahrgenommen wird, hängt maßgeblich davon ab, welche Zukunftsbilder sie im Angebot hat.

Die Autorin Charlotte Theile zitiert in ihrem Buch ""Ist die AfD zu stoppen?“ den Werbestrategen der SVP, Alexander Segert, der im Vorfeld des Bundestagswahlkampfs 2017 auch mit der AfD zusammengearbeitet hat: ""Ich gebe der Angst eine Stimme.“

Die deutschenParteien haben verlernt, die Bürger direkt anzusprechen

Man kann sich zurecht über die Plakatkampagnen der SVP echauffieren: Sie zeigen Minarette, die wie Schwerter aussehen oder schwarze Schafe, die aus der Schweiz heraus gekickt werden. Aber sie sprechen eine klare, eindringliche Sprache, die von der Zielgruppe verstanden wird. Wer für die Begehren der SVP stimmt, weiß am Ende, welche Schweiz er bekommt.

Das haben die deutschen Parteien verlernt. Dabei konnten sie es mal sehr gut: Adenauer, der sich 1957 mit dem Slogan ""Keine Experimente!“ plakatieren ließ. Das traf den Nerv, denn Deutschland hatte damals die Wahl zwischen einer Fortsetzung der Unionspolitik und dem Wechsel zur damals noch sozialistisch-marxistischen SPD.

#Merkel's pressekonference og kommende valgkamp synes inspireret af Konrad Adenauer fra 1957 - Keine Experimente efter Brexit, Trump etc pic.twitter.com/9gsXMnx3mB — Lykke Friis (@lykkefriis) 20. November 2016

Oder 1998, als die SPD das Bild von Gerhard Schröder mit dem Slogan ""Ich bin bereit!“ versah. Deutschland war es damals auch, nach 16 Jahren Kanzlerschaft von Helmut Kohl wollten viele Bürger einen Wechsel. Seitdem war wohl nie wieder so viel Zukunft in der SPD zu spüren.

Dabei wollen die Menschen wissen, in welche Richtung sich ihr Land in politisch unruhigen Zeiten entwickelt.

Die Rechten spielen die Metropolen gegen die Provinz aus

Die FPÖ wiederum beherrscht meisterhaft das Spiel mit den Gegensätzen zwischen Stadt und Land. Österreich hat acht Millionen Einwohner. Die Mehrheit davon lebt außerhalb Wiens, und doch hat die Stadt mit ihren knapp zwei Millionen Einwohnern eine dominante Stellung in Österreich.

Der frühere Bürgermeister von Hamburg, Klaus von Dohnanyi, merkte kürzlich bei Sandra Maischberger an, dass in Zeiten der Globalisierung nicht umsonst die Tracht eine Renaissance erlebt. Die Leute sehnten sich nach Identität. Dafür erntete er viel Gelächter. Doch er traf genau den Punkt.

In Österreich wird die globalisierte Metropole Wien von den Rechten gegen die ländlichen Regionen ausgespielt. In Deutschland schafft es die AfD ebenfalls sehr geschickt, die Komplexe der deutschen Provinz gegenüber dem florierenden Berlin für ihre Zwecke zu instrumentalisieren.

Das hat auch damit zu tun, dass selbst die Union ihre Stammwähler in den ländlichen Regionen vernachlässigt hat. An dieser Stelle sei nur an das Komplettversagen von Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) erinnert, den Breitbandausbau auf dem Land voranzutreiben.

Was Österreich und die Schweiz Deutschland voraushaben

Übrigens: Was Schweizer und Österreicher den Deutschen voraushaben, ist jeweils eine politische Gegenbewegung zum rechten Populismus. In beiden Ländern engagieren sich junge Menschen mit liberalen Ansichten sehr erfolgreich gegen den Siegeszug der Menschenfeinde.

In der Schweiz ist es die ""Operation Libero“, die maßgeblich am erfolgreichen Wahlkampf gegen die ""Ausschaffungsinitiative“ (etwa: ""Abschiebungsinitiative“) im Jahr 2016 beteiligt war. In Österreich sind es die ""Neos“, denen im Oktober der Wiedereinzug ins Parlament gelingen könnte.

In Deutschland dagegen wanzt sich FDP-Chef Christian Lindner mit seinen Aussagen zur Russland-Politik an AfD-Wähler heran. Auch hier gibt es noch einiges zu tun.

Su primer destino será el poblado de San Juan Pilcaya, ubicado en la Sierra Nororiental de Puebla, donde más de 300 familias viven en campamentos improvisados en el patio de sus viviendas, gravemente dañadas por el sismo de magnitud 7.1.

EFE

La localidad está ""en ruinas"" y ""la necesidad, además de las despensas, tenía que ver con un lugar donde pasar la noche"", dice Saulo Meis, director de la organización la Esperanza del Mañana.

Gracias a la donación de bambú de productores locales de la Sierra de Puebla, arquitectos, especialistas de la planta, estudiantes y beneficiarios empezaron a trabajar para armar estos espacios en el menor tiempo posible.

Las estructuras miden 3x4 metros y ofrecen un espacio habitable hasta por periodo de un año y medio. El costo por módulo oscila entre los 15 y 20 mil pesos, dependiendo del tamaño requerido por familia.

En cuestión de horas, un equipo de 10 personas -entre militares, voluntarios y expertos- trabajan codo a codo para construir cada módulo, la mayoría de los cuales son colocados en los patios de las viviendas.

""Le dimos preferencia a personas mayores, adultos con alguna enfermedad y familias donde hubiera niños, porque estaban durmiendo en casas de campaña con lonas"", explica Saulo Meis.

El objetivo es construir hasta 100 módulos en San Juan Pilcaya y, de forma paralela, se trabaja en la capacitación de personal para que estas estructuras lleguen a más comunidades.

Además, en una última etapa del proyecto se prevé la construcción de viviendas permanentes con bambú, ya que Puebla es el segundo estado a nivel nacional en producción de este material, lo que detonaría la economía local.

""Hoy hay una oportunidad de ser un apoyo para Pilcaya y un instrumento para mover la economía en la Sierra Nororiental"", señala Saulo Meis.

Las familias que necesitan este apoyo se cuentan por cientos. ""No sabemos cuándo vengan a hacer la casa"", señala Jesús Tapia mientras observa cómo un grupo de jóvenes ultima los detalles de su nuevo ""cuarto"" de bambú.

El sismo le tocó cuando se encontraba en el interior de su vivienda y sostiene que está vivo de milagro, pues le cayeron varias tejas en la cabeza.

""Al no ver a mi esposa no quise salir, dije: 'si se va a morir mi esposa, me muero yo también aquí adentro'"", recuerda Tapia, quien después de varias semanas tendrá un lugar propio donde dormir con su esposa.

""Estos señores vinieron y me ofrecieron esto. Les dije que quería casa y, gracias a Dios, ya la están terminando"", señala.

Unas calles más abajo vive Paz con su madre de 82 años. Desde el sismo ambas pasan la noche en una tienda de campaña instalada en el patio de lo que queda de su vivienda.

Emocionada, Paz agradece a quienes les están apoyando. ""Siento que me va ayudar mucho porque, como viene la temporada de frío, ya no estamos a la intemperie"", comenta.

Estos espacios de bambú permitirán dar cobijo temporal a los damnificados en los próximos meses, cuando bajan las temperaturas, y hasta que las viviendas puedan ser reparadas o reconstruidas.

Yedu Krishnan, the first Dalit priest of Kerala, scripted history when he performed prayers at the Manappuram Mahadeva temple at Valanjavattom in Pathanamthitta district on Monday.

Challenging centuries of discrimination and prejudice against Dalits in India, the 22-year-old opened the sanctum sanctorum of Shiva temple at Keecherival.

Krishnan is one of the six Dalit priests who have been recruited by the Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages over 1,000 shrines in the state, including the famous Lord Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Krishnan, who hails from the C Pulaya community in Thrissur, said, ""I never felt any discrimination over caste. For the past five years, I was working as a priest at Devi Temple at Valiyakulangara in Ernakulam district. Today, when I left, many non-Dalit visitors to the temple turned emotional.""

Krishnan, who was born to daily-wage laborers Ravi PK and Leela, told The Times of India that he was fascinated with temples since age six and that he had started learning Sanskrit from Class V. The young priest is presently pursuing his MA in Sanskrit Literature.

Krishnan told TOI, ""This is the culture of Kerala. The nation should follow this.""

The new Dalit recruits have reportedly been told to join their allotted temples in 15 days.

Kerala Hindu Aikya Vedi general secretary E S Biju told The Indian Express that there have been protests against the appointment of Dalits as priests in the past. ""However, now there is a change in the mindset of people. The concern of the faithful is that the priests should be well-versed in temple matters and should lead a life becoming of a priest,"" he said.

The recruitment of the Dalit priests comes ahead of the 81st anniversary of the historic Temple Entry proclamation on November 12. PTI pointed out that the royal decree opened temples in the erstwhile state of Travancore to those who were regarded as lower caste Hindus.

VADODARA -- Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday targeted the RSS and BJP alleging that they did not give any importance to women and asked how many of them were seen attending the Sangh's 'shakhas'.

He said in contrast, women work at every level in the Congress.

""The BJP's thinking is that till women are silent they are good, when they start speaking up they try to shut them (women) up,"" Gandhi said at a gathering of students here on the second day of his election campaign in Gujarat.

""Their organisation is the RSS. How many women are there in the RSS... Have you ever seen any woman in shakhas wearing shorts?"" he said in a sarcastic tone.

""In the Congress you will see women at every level in the organisation,"" he said.

Meanwhile, former Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel has asked Congress for an apology:

Appearing on the show alongside Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell and Matt Lucas, the ‘Breaking Bad’ actor explained that a travel agent recommended that Bryan and his wife, Robin Dearden, go through the Alps on a train as the couple’s trip was to be their honeymoon.

PA Wire/PA Images

He explained: “There’s a flatbed truck, it takes three cars bumper-to-bumper on a flatbed, and then you go through the Alps.

“‘By the way,’ he [the travel agent] says, wink wink, ‘There are three tunnels. The first tunnel, it is about five minutes, the second tunnel is about eight-to-ten minutes. The third tunnel is 50 minutes long, if you’re a honeymooner’.

“We’re on the train, there’s a van in front of us with a bunch of Italian families. Behind us… two Italian couples. We start going into the tunnels and it’s a massive experience, emotionally and physically.

“The wind is whipping through and it’s pitch dark. You cannot see anything. It’s fascinating. We come out of the tunnel and into the station, and I say to [my wife] Robin, that’s one.

“We go up, we start again. Pitch dark, can’t see. We come out of it, that’s two. She’s like, oh god! Start the third tunnel, wait until it’s absolutely pitch dark, here we go! It’s a small rental with the stick shift, and I’m like trying to get my trousers off.

PA Archive/PA Images Robin and Bryan in February 2016

“She’s trying to lower her chair. You cannot see anything, so it’s all by feel. One thing I learned is never be completely nude when transferring one seat over the stick shift.

“Keep your trousers on and do it afterwards… So we are inflagrante, as they say, I don’t know where to put my hands.

“Now what’s happening is that my eyes are adjusting. I can see her profile, she’s a beautiful woman. Love her with all my heart. I can see her, her pretty face, and it’s great. The eyes weren’t getting used to total pitch black. What happened is we were coming to a station! Boom! Sunlight!

“My wife says those three words to me that every husband wants to hear: ‘Get off me!’”

Bryan then pondered whether the travel agent had lied and played a joke on them - knowing the tunnel was really only 15 minutes long - and quite frankly, we’re surprised he didn’t ask him this question himself after returning to the US.

So far this series, the ‘Graham Norton Show’ has already played host to a number of unexpected moments and last month, we saw Margot Robbie tattoo a fan(!) when she stopped off for a chat.

Tricia Lee (right) with actress Steph Song.

The Toronto native is the director of three award-winning horror films. Her most recent feature, ""Blood Hunters,"" had its world premiere at Horror Channel's Frightfest in London, U.K. last year and won Audience Choice Best Feature at Fright Night Film Fest.

I grew into horror as opposed to growing up with horror.

Although Lee has found success with horror films, she wasn't always a fan. ""I grew into horror as opposed to growing up with horror,"" she told HuffPost Canada via email. ""After 'Carrie' and 'The Exorcist,' I shied away from it. But when I made my first feature 'Clean Break' in 2011 and did some research, I found a lot of genre films that were up my alley.""

Since then, Lee has come to appreciate all that horror has to offer. ""I enjoy working in elevated genre because I get to hold a microscope up to humanity, create new worlds, and explore how humans react to extraordinary circumstances,"" she said of her films.

""While my stories might seem larger than life, the over-the-top genre conventions allow us to explore real world issues in a fun way and discover deeply emotional situations that our audience can relate to.""

With this in mind, here are Lee's top horror picks based on genre. What are you in the mood for?

1. Classic Horror

Lee's pick: ""Carrie""

Why: ""The ending scene still haunts me until this day.""

2. Psychological Thriller

Lee's pick: ""Silent House""

Why: ""This movie was shot all in one take and yet tells a compelling story and ramps up the tension and suspense.""

3. Slasher

Lee's pick: ""Scream""

Why: ""I know it's a slasher movie about slasher movies, but that's what makes it great. It plays on our love of slasher movie tropes.""

4. Comedy-Horror

Lee's pick: ""Get Out""

Why: ""I've heard a lot of people categorize this movie as comedy-horror, and while it's not laugh-out-loud funny, it is satire at its best mixed with the horrors of humanity.""

5. Supernatural

Lee's pick: ""Oculus""

Why: ""I saw this at TIFF Midnight Madness in the front row and it still had me literally on the edge of my seat. The tension is ratcheted up throughout the movie with only short bursts of relief.""

6. Zombie Flick

Lee's pick: ""Train to Busan""

Why: ""The best genre film of 2016 where you care about every character that dies. And there is a large body count.""

7. Sci-Fi Horror

Lee's pick: ""Cube""

Why: ""What a brilliant concept that takes place in one location — shot in one room, in fact — but unravels a mystery that keeps us guessing all the way to the end.""

8. Japanese Horror

Lee's pick: ""Audition""

Why: ""From 1999, this is the film I think of when people say Japanese Horror. Don't mess with that girl, she'll stick needles in your eyes!""

Valparaiso, Chile 17 de marzo del 2016.

Por Larissa Arroyo Navarrete, profesor de Derechos Humanos de la Universidad de Costa Rica

Tres cuartas partes de todos los abortos en América Latina se hacen de forma ilegal. Junto con África y Asia, esta región reúne gran parte de los 17.1 millones de abortos realizados de manera insegura cada año alrededor del mundo, según el nuevo informe del journal The Lancet, publicado en conjunto con el Instituto Guttmacher, un ONG internacional.

Si bien es inquietante, el dato no es sorprendente. Seis países en la región prohíben terminantemente el aborto en cualquier circunstancia: República Dominicana, El Salvador, Haití, Honduras, Nicaragua y Surinam. Esta prohibición total, incluso para salvar la vida de la mujer, se sostiene aún tan solo en dos países más del mundo, Malta y el Vaticano.

Los estudios confirman que las leyes restrictivas de ninguna forma previenen o impiden que las mujeres sigan recurriendo al aborto. Y en la gran mayoría de países en esta región, entre ellos Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador y Venezuela, y desde agosto del 2017 Chile, este procedimiento médico es legal pero usualmente restringido a ciertas causales como la salud de la madre o casos de violación sexual.

Pero no en Centroamérica, región que cuenta con tres de los ocho países donde el aborto es ilegal en toda circunstancia. Como abogada costaricense y feminista, no me parece cosa menor que a la mayoría de mujeres en estados vecinos no tengan acceso a este servicio básico de salud.

Centroamérica: retrocesos mortales

¿Cómo llegó esta región a omitir el reconocimiento de las mujeres como personas plenas sujetas de derechos? A mi criterio, la relación entre democracia y derechos reproductivos de las mujeres es evidente en los tres países: Honduras, Nicaragua y El Salvador.

En Honduras, como resultado de un shock político, no solo la prohibición del aborto en todas circunstancias incluso para salvar la vida de las mujeres, se reafirmó sino que además, tras el golpe de estado contra el presidente Zelaya en 2009, la anticoncepción de emergencia se penalizó totalmente también.

A pesar de los esfuerzos incansables de las defensoras de derechos humanos y pronunciamientos vehementes del sistema de Naciones Unidas, sus personas expertas independientes y ONGs como Amnistía Internacional, no se ha visto ningún avance concreto con respectos a los derechos reproductivos de las mujeres.

Esto no debería extrañar. En Honduras hoy, la violación a los derechos humanos –desde la violencia y la pobreza hasta la impunidad– es algo de todos los días, para toda la población. La galopante desigualdad de género es simplemente otro síntoma de este escenario triste.

Justo al sur, en Nicaragua, la situación es similar. Ahí, la interrupción del embarazo por la causal salud se sostuvo desde 1837 hasta hace relativamente poco. Pero bajo el actual gobierno del Comandante Daniel Ortega, quien ha modificado la Constitución para poder eligirse una tercera vez, se hicieron enmiendas al Código Penal, con el resultado de una prohibición total del aborto.

Ortega apoyó los derechos reproductivos durante su primera administración en los 80, pero desde entonces se ha alineado con la Iglesia católica, que rechaza fuertemente este procedimiento médico.

Una normativa de 2006, aún vigente, le niega a las mujeres con embarazos que impliquen riesgo para su vida y/o su salud la posibilidad de sobrevivir, ya que la ley no contempló ninguna excepción.

Esto ha tenido y tiene repercusiones letales para las mujeres en Nicaragua. En 2010 a una mujer embarazada, cuyo seudónimo fue ""Amelia"", le fue negado el tratamiento para un cáncer metastático porque, según el estado, el tratamiento podría provocar un aborto. Esto a pesar de que el personal médico había recomendado que iniciara quimioterapia o radioterapia de manera urgente.

Eventualmente, la Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos le otorgó medidas cautelares a Amelia pero el daño ya estaba hecho. Ella murió en 2011.

En Nicaragua la corriente política contra el aborto es fuerte.

Aunque parece imposible, las mujeres tal vez sufran más en El Salvador, país que estuvo bajo una guerra civil devastadora con crímenes que permanecen en la impunidad e infiltración criminal de la policia.

En 1997, con un cambio en el Código Penal, se penalizó todo tipo de aborto, y actualmente se persiguen aún aquellos abortos espontáneos, bajo sospecha de que hayan sido inducidos. En 1999, El Salvador reconoció constitucionalmente como persona humana al embrión desde el momento de la concepción, argumento jurídico usado para sostener la penalización completa del aborto, obviando la necesidad cuando haya riesgo para la vida de la mujer, casos de violación o graves malformaciones en el feto.

La corriente social en contra del aborto es tan virulenta en El Salvador hoy en día que algunas mujeres han sido acusadas –hasta por sus propios familiares– de homicidio agravado a pesar de que lo que tuvieron fue una pérdida espontánea. En 2016, la persecución llegó a tal punto que incluso Suecia brindó asilo político ""a una mujer sentenciada a 40 años por perder el embarazo.""

Notando esta clase de injusticia social, en 2014, el Comité de las Naciones Unidas para la Eliminación de todas las formas de Discriminación contra la Mujer pidió a El Salvador despenalizar el aborto, ya que la gran mayoría de mujeres perseguidas y condenadas por abortar, son precisamente aquellas en mayor grado de vulnerabilidad: jóvenes, sin educación formal, sin trabajo y solteras.

La ciudadanía de las mujeres

Hay diferencias culturales, políticas y económicas entre estos tres países, por supuesto, pero la relación entre la degradación del estado de derecho y la falta de reconocimiento y garantía de los derechos de las mujeres es notable.

Es así porque al negarles a las mujeres la posibilidad de decidir sobre sus cuerpos se les niega sus derechos humanos, ya que resultan ser valiosas en tanto son percibidas como depositarios de potenciales vidas, vidas que la ley reconoce como dignas de ser protegidas.

La Corte Constitucional de Colombia lo dijo acertadamente en el 2006, para despenalizar el aborto fundamentó que: ""La dignidad de la mujer excluye que pueda considerársele como mero receptáculo"".

La historia de Chile confirma esta realidad. En 1931, el Congreso aprobó la excepción de la interrupción voluntaria del embarazo con fines terapéuticos en casos de peligro para la mujer o inviabilidad del feto, y se mantuvo por más de 50 años.

No obstante, se volvió ilegal con la regimen del General Augustin Pinochet en 1973, y en la Constitución Chilena de 1980 se estableció que la ley protegía la vida ""del que está por nacer"" bajo la interpretación de que la vida de la mujer valía mucho menos que la de un embrión.

No fue sino hasta este año, agosto 2017, que se regresó a la sensatez de proteger la vida y salud de las mujeres. La reciente ""relegalización"" del aborto en Chile muestra que una vez que las mujeres han perdido su valor ante el estado, como persona frente al de los embriones y fetos, es muy difícil volver atrás pero es posible.

Diputadas del partido Socialista y Comunista celebran su victoria pero también se preguntan por qué llevó tanto tiempo recuperar sus derechos.

El pulso de poder en los regímenes centroamericanos donde aún se encuentra la prohibición del aborto, deja al descubierto que lo que está en juego no es solamente el reconocimiento a las mujeres de su condición de personas, sino también el sistema político de nuestra sociedad.

Pues, ¿cómo seguir llamando democracias a estados que no reconocen a las mujeres como personas?

Verantwortungsbewusst haben sie sich deshalb entschieden, sich nicht mehr selbst hinters Steuer zu setzen, sondern per Uber einen Fahrer zu bestellen.

Ihr Auto ließen sie deshalb auf dem Parkplatz des Restaurants stehen.

Als Grzelak-Schultz zwei Tage später ihr Auto abholen wollte, entdeckte sie einen Zettel an ihrer Windschutzscheibe. ""Ich dachte, ich würde Ärger bekommen, weil ich mein Auto vor der Einfahrt des Lokals stehen gelassen hatte"", schrieb sie auf Facebook.

""Das Auto stand dort fast 48 Stunden, buchstäblich direkt vor der Einfahrt. Als ich wieder kam, war das Auto unter zehn Zentimetern Schnee. Das war ein richtiger 'Walk of Shame'"", sagte Grzelak-Schultz gegenüber dem amerikanischen Nachrichtenportal ""Today"".

Tatsächlich stammte der Zettel von dem Restaurant. Jay McLean, der Managing Partner des Lokals, reagierte allerdings anders als Grzelak-Schultz das erwartet hatte.

""Ich wollte Ihnen danken, dass sie das Auto über Nacht haben stehen lassen"", hatte McLean auf den Zettel geschrieben. ""Ich weiß nicht, ob sie Alkohol bei uns getrunken haben, wir wollten Ihnen aber auf jeden Fall danken, dass Sie sich nicht betrunken ans Steuer setzen.""

Bei einem bloßen Dankeschön blieb es allerdings nicht. McLean fügte noch einen Gutschein für das Restaurant bei.

""Anbei ist ein Gutschein für einen Pfund unserer leckeren Chicken Wings. Bitte nehmen Sie ihn an und vielen Dank dafür, dass Sie verantwortungsbewusst sind"", schrieb McLean weiter. ""Das Leben ist wertvoll. Haben Sie ein tolles Wochenende.""

""Wow, ich bin so beeindruckt"", freute sich Grzelak-Schultz auf Facebook. ""Ich werde definitiv wieder dort hin gehen. Nicht nur wegen dem Gutschein, sondern auch weil der Mann seine Gäste so toll behandelt.""

Jedes Kind braucht die Chance auf Bildung

Egal wo auf der Welt: Ohne Bildung haben Kinder aus armen Familien in der Regel keine Chance. Doch die ist mitunter teuer - und so vergrößert sich vielerorts das Ungleichgewicht. Dieses Problem versuchen Organisationen in aller Welt zu lösen.

Eine ebenso simple wie geniale Idee steckt hinter dem Projekt World Bicycle Relief. Diese nämlich lautet: ""Fahrrad = Mobilität = Bildung"". So einfach kann Hilfe tatsächlich sein.

World Bicycle Relief stellt Menschen in Entwicklungsländern Fahrräder zur Verfügung, damit sie ihr Leben aus eigener Kraft verändern können. Denn in ländlichen Regionen Afrikas bedeutet ein Fahrrad ein großes Maß an Lebensqualität: Es verkürzt die Transportwege und erleichtert seinem Besitzer den Zugang zu Bildung und Gesundheitsversorgung.

Mit über 200.000 Fahrrädern, die in Afrika montiert werden, und 1000 ausgebildeten Mechanikern hilft WorldBicycleRelief vor Ort dabei, Armut zu bekämpfen und fördert Bildung und die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung in Gegenden, die sonst von der Infrastruktur abgeschnitten wären.

Ihre Haut ist dünn und verletzlich. So wie die Flügel eines Schmetterlings. Es gibt nur wenige Momente im Leben der Zwölfjährigen, in denen sie ihre Krankheit vergessen kann. Die meisten davon erlebt sie an einem Ort, der im ersten Moment nicht danach klingt, als könnte es für ein an Epidermolysis bullosa leidendes Mädchen ein Happy Place sein: auf dem Rücken eines Pferdes.

Knöpfe oder Nähte, kleine Stöße. Dinge, die uns im Alltag begleiten und passieren können, stellen für Alinas Haut eine enorme Gefahr da. Eine unbedachte Bewegung, ein Moment der Unachtsamkeit – und schon reißt ihre Haut auf. „Unser Leben ist ein einziges Aufpassen“, sagt Alinas Mutter, Michaela Schierholz. Kleinigkeiten, die gesunde Menschen kaum kümmern, können für ihre Tochter gravierende Folgen haben. Selbst in der Schule. Wenn sie zu lange am Stück schreibt, fängt ihre gesamte Hand an zu bluten.

Und dann äußert Alina den Wunsch, reiten zu wollen. Reiten. Einer viel größeren Gefahr könnte sich Alina kaum aussetzen. Wo doch selbst der Gartenschlauch im heimischen Garten, über den sie im vergangenen Sommer gestolpert war, für Wochen voller Kummer und Sorgen gesorgt hatte. Doch auf dem Rücken von Therapiepferd Maggy ist die Zwölfjährige ein ganz normales Mädchen. Nur ein kleines Fell, das auf dem Sattel liegt, und zu harte Stöße dämpfen soll, unterscheidet sie von anderen pferdeverrückten Fast-Teenagern.

„Wenn ich auf Maggy reite, merkt sie sofort, wenn ich unsicher bin. Dann hält sie sofort an.“ Alina findet ihr Glück auf Maggys Rücken. Und allmählich ist auch Mama Michaela deutlich entspannter, wenn sie zum Reitunterricht fahren. „Anfangs bin ich tausend Tode gestorben“, erzählt sie. Immer hatte sie bange Fragen im Hinterkopf: Was passiert, wenn Alina vom Pferd fällt? Was, wenn im Stall etwas passiert? Passiert ist in den anderthalb Jahren, in denen Alina nun schon Reitunterricht nimmt, aber noch nichts.

Michaela Schierholz vertraut nicht nur Maggy, sie sieht auch, wie das Reiten ihre Tochter verändert hat. Alinas Gleichgewichtssinn hat sich deutlich verbessert. Die Folge: Sie fällt seltener hin als noch vor der Verwandlung zum „Pferdemädchen“. Und selbstbewusster ist die Zwölfjährige geworden. Nicht nur in der Arbeit mit dem Pferd. Sondern generell. „Maggy ist einfach toll“, sagt Alina. Das zarte Mädchen und das massige Kaltblut. Ein Bild voller Gegensätze – und voller Liebe.

Porträt: Reit-Therapiezentrum der Stiftung Synanon Berlin

Einmal in der Woche, immer freitags, fahren Alina und Mama Michaela auf den Hof der Stiftung Synanon in Berlin-Frohnau. In dieser Einrichtung werden unter anderem Suchtkranke betreut. Und seit drei Jahren wird dort auch heilpädagogisches Reiten angeboten. 13 Kinder und 3 Erwachsene mit unterschiedlichsten Krankheiten nehmen hier regelmäßig Reitunterricht. Autisten, Querschnittsgelähmte, Gehörlose, eine Frau mit multipler Sklerose und Alina.

Sie alle vereint, dass sie ein Leben leben, das sich zu einem großen Teil in Arztpraxen, Krankenhäusern und bei Physiotherapeuten abspielt. Doch der beste Therapeut, darin sind sich alle einig, heißt Maggy. Die 18-jährige Tinker-Stute ist eins von drei Therapiepferden auf dem Hof. Fernab vom Großstadt-Lärm schafft dieses sanfte Wesen etwas, das ihren Reitern weder Ärzte noch Medikamente geben können. Einen Moment der Freiheit, in dem sie den Augenblick genießen – und ihre Krankheiten keine Rolle spielen.

Auch Reitlehrerin Petra Mächold sieht, dass sich Alina in den vergangenen anderthalb Jahren verändert hat. „Ihre ganze Körperhaltung war zusammengekauert. Sie hatte permanent Angst, sich zu stoßen.“ Wer heute sehe, wie selbstbewusst und gerade Alina auf dem Pferd sitzt, könne sich kaum vorstellen, dass sie einmal anders gewesen ist. Was Alina beim Reiten am meisten Spaß macht? „Galoppieren natürlich! Da fühl ich mich so herrlich frei.“

Das einzige Manko: Hippotherapien werden nicht von Krankenkassen übernommen. Weil laut Bundesministerium für Gesundheit „ein therapeutischer Nutzen der Hippotherapie nicht nachgewiesen ist und die Therapie daher als nicht verordnungsfähiges Heilmittel zu führen ist“. Das heißt: Betroffene, die diesen Weg der Therapie gehen wollen, müssen ihn aus eigener Tasche bezahlen oder versuchen, ihn über Spenden zu finanzieren.

This year, there are plenty of notable pop culture moments and on-screen characters that will surely make an entrance at your Halloween party. From Queen Bey to Taylor Swift to the nightmare-inducing Pennywise, here are some epic costumes and how you can sport them like a pro.

1. Beyoncé's twin pregnancy announcement

A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST

We still remember the day this happened. It was one of those viral moments that had everyone talking. Since then, several people have tried reenacting Beyoncé's epic shoot, including CBC TV host Jessi Cruickshank, who shot a similar photo when she was pregnant. All you need for a Queen Bey makeover is a burgundy bra, blue underwear and a veil wrapped with flowers. Oh, and don't forget the belly.

2. Riverdale

We '90s kids need no further explanation. After ""Riverdale"" hit Netflix, Archie and his gang became the kids to hang out with. You and your squad could dress up as Archie, Betty, Veronica, Jughead and Reggie. We'll just catch you at Pop's Diner, then?

3. Zombie Taylor Swift

A post shared by Spankie Valentine 💜 (@spankievalentine) on Oct 1, 2017 at 12:18pm PDT

Taylor Swift is all the rage right now. From the moment her heavily-coded ""Look What You Made Me Do"" video dropped, all we could do was debate which one of her personas we should channel this Halloween. The video tapped into many creative minds, and channeling Zombie Taylor (sans her reputation) is definitely one of her most wild looks yet. You and your girl squad can go all out and dress up as Tay's 13 demons personas for a Swifty look.

4. The Handmaid's Tale

A post shared by Justina di Silvestri (@justinagoblin) on Oct 2, 2017 at 3:34pm PDT

This year's popular series ""The Handmaid's Tale"" has given us an easy DIY costume. Simply use a red dress or robe and a white bonnet to channel your inner Offred.

5. Beyonce's twin birth announcement

A post shared by Alexa Jade | Nava Rose (@thenavarose) on Sep 6, 2017 at 10:30am PDT

Of course, Queen Bey had to unveil her newborns to the world in an epic photo shoot. A gorgeous purple dress and blue veil are all you need. And two babies, of course.

6. Pennywise

A post shared by Cinefagia México (@revistacinefagia) on Sep 26, 2017 at 7:01am PDT

No words needed here. Probably because this is going to scare the bejesus out of anyone. Pennywise from the hot horror film ""It"" is going to be the most popular Halloween costume this year.

7. Marvel's The Defenders

A post shared by Ewan Anderson (@ewanjanderson) on Sep 16, 2017 at 5:41pm PDT

This Netflix show has given us #squadgoals. Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones and the Iron Fist are the superheroes you can choose to dress up as this year. Plus, they'll be on-point and within budget. After all, they are humans who dress just like us.

8. Pregnant Kylie Jenner

A post shared by Yandy.com (@yandy) on Sep 25, 2017 at 4:51pm PDT

Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Fan or not, there's going to be a few girls sporting the pregnant Kylie Jenner look, given how three of the ""K"" clan are currently expecting. But it was Kylie's pregnancy rumours that got everyone talking, as many tried to decipher her every Instagram photo.

And of course, inevitably, there's already a sexy pregnant Kylie costume retailing at Yandy. It's called ""Reality Star in the Making"" and comes with a classic Kylie white dress and a faux belly. No lip kits included, unfortunately. Simply plump up those lips and pout all night long with endless selfies and you're Jenner-approved.

9. Belle and Beast

A post shared by Apollonie (@apolloniecorsets) on Sep 22, 2017 at 12:25pm PDT

""Beauty and the Beast"" is the epic couple's costume that you and your partner can try this year. It's a classic and with a little effort, you'll be ballroom dancing in no time. To the Beast in question: don't forget the rose. Your life depends on it.

10. Wonder Woman

A post shared by Alyson Tabbitha (@alysontabbitha) on Oct 8, 2017 at 2:04pm PDT

With the release of ""Wonder Woman"" this year, there's bound to be a ton of Gal Gadots running around. It's sexy, independent and you'll slay.

11. Beyonce's Grammys look

A post shared by Michelle Treen (@39andpregnant) on Jun 24, 2017 at 6:13pm PDT

Another look from Bey that was epic was her 2017 Grammys outfit. Remember the gold dress with the head crown? An easy look to pull off for expecting moms or if you stan Bey.

Junge Aktivisten bereiten sich auf einen längeren politischen Kampf vor

Die HuffPost berichtet aus Barcelona: Wie geht es dort nun weiter?

Barcelona im Oktober 2017. Ganz Europa blickt auf die Metropole im Nordosten Spaniens, als am Mittwoch den 5. Oktober Präsident Puidgemont eine Art ""Unabhängigkeit Light"" ausruft. Er erklärt die Abspaltung von Spanien – und setzt den Prozess dann gleich wieder aus.



Der spanische Staat hatte über Monate hinweg versucht, ein Referendum zu verhindern. Deshalb wurden im Verborgenen Urnen gefertigt, nach Katalonien geschmuggelt und in Wahllokale gebracht. Am Tag des Referendums kam es zur Konfrontation.



Aktivisten besetzten Schulen, um dort die Abstimmung zu ermöglichen, Foto: Michael Trammer



Ungeheuerliche Bilder von Polizeigewalt gingen um die Welt. Nun scheint sich die Lage zu beruhigen. Die aufrührerischen Katalanen, die nach Sezession rufen, wollen an den Verhandlungstisch. Die Zentralregierung bleibt hart und will klare Kante zeigen: Kein Dialog mit denen, die sie als Verfassungsfeinde brandmarken.



Doch was sind die Motive junger Leute sich trotz aller Hindernisse, trotz der drohenden Gewaltspirale der Unabhängigkeitsbewegung anzuschließen? Was sind die Hoffnungen in einen neu-gegründeten Staat? Wie bereiten sich die Menschen auf die drohende Konfrontation vor?



""Kein Blut-und-Boden-Nationalismus""



Lluc ist Kunststudent an der Universität in Barcelona. Er hat geholfen, das Referendum durchzuführen, auch durch die Besetzung von Schulen, die dann als Wahllokale dienten. Für ihn bedeutet eine Sezession von Spanien, deutlich mehr als nur die Gründung eines neuen Staates.



Lluc kämpft für die die katalanische Unabhängigkeit, Foto: Michael Trammer



Er sieht die Unabhängigkeit als einzige Chance, um einen Schlussstrich zu ziehen. Auch mit dem in seinen Augen ungenügend aufgearbeiteten Erbe des Francoregimes. Seine Hoffnung und Anspruch an einen katalanischen Staat ist vor allem: Mehr direkte Demokratie – ein basisdemokratischer Staat.

Doch was ist dran an den kritischen Stimmen, die die Separatisten für gefährliche Nationalisten halten?

Lluc zumindest streitet das vorsichtig ab. Laut seiner Einschätzung handelt es sich bei der katalanischen Ideologie nicht um einen Blut-und-Boden Nationalismus. Für ihn ist Katalane wer sich zum multikulturellen Leben in der spanischen Region zugehörig fühlt. Lluc gibt aber auch zu, dass sicher nicht alle Leute in der Unabhängigkeitsbewegung so denken wie er.

""Ich rede über eine soziale Revolution!""



Die wirtschaftlichen Konsequenzen, die Katalonien bereits jetzt zu spüren bekommt, kümmern ihn nicht. Mehrere Banken haben ihre Sitze aus der Region verlagert. Jobs werden gekündigt.



Eine Frau beim Public Viewing – kurz bevor das Ergebnis des Referendums verkündet wurde

Lluc ist das egal. Er träumt ohnehin davon, dass sich alles ändert: ""Ich rede hier über eine soziale Revolution! Die allererste Grundbedingung für genau so eine ist, dass Banken aus Katalonien verschwinden müssen und wir die Steuerung der Wirtschaft selbst in die Hand nehmen!“

Es ist eine radikale Position, die viele Katalanen teilen. Denn sie haben das Gefühl, dass von der wirtschaftlichen Stärke der Region wenig bei ihnen ankommt. Tatsächlich ist die Arbeitslosenquote in Katalonien, nach der Eurokrise kaum niedriger als im Rest von Spanien.

Auf die eine oder andere Art und Weise wird es in Llucs Augen eine Konfrontation zwischen der spanischen und der katalanischen Regierung geben. Er geht auch davon aus, dass die katalanische Regierung in naher Zukunft ihre realpolitische Macht verlieren wird. Dann wäre auch ein Militäreinsatz in Katalonien denkbar.

""Es wird große Generalstreiks geben!""

Wie genau es weitergeht, kann auch der Aktivist nicht absehen. Was seine Freunde und er planen, wenn die Unabhängigkeit final erklärt wird, weiß er aber genau: ‘Wir haben unsere Kräfte bereits vorbereitet und es wird Streiks geben – Generalstreiks! Ein Datum kann ich euch nicht nennen – aber es wird bald Generalstreiks geben! Große Generalstreiks!“



Tausende junge Katalanen träumen von der Unabhängigkeit.

Diese sollen wohl auch einen verfassungsbildenden Prozess befürworten und beschleunigen. In seinen Augen, kann die Zentralregierung in Madrid zwar das Militär nach Katalonien schicken. Doch wie sollen sie gegen die Massen auf den Straßen vorgehen?

Gewaltsame Ausschreitungen in den Straßen von Barcelona wären auch für die spanische Regierung ein Fiasko.



Auszuschließen sind sie nicht: Denn die Lage in Katalonien scheint ganz und gar nicht beruhigt. Zwar sind die Protestwellen abgeebbt und momentan findet ein Konflikt auf parteipolitischer Ebene statt, doch erst am Donnerstagabend riefen nun auch bürgerliche Gruppen zu einer finalen Lossagung von Madrid auf.

“Those are the people that we have to negotiate with. We have to negotiate hard to get the very best deal for Britain.”

Hammond, who is one of the most vocal advocates of a “soft Brexit” later said he regretted his “poor choice of words”.

He tweeted that the UK will work “with our friends and partners in the EU, adding #NoEnemiesHere.

We will work with our friends and partners in the EU on a mutually beneficial Brexit deal #noenemieshere (2/2). — Philip Hammond (@PhilipHammondUK) October 13, 2017

Hammond was speaking in Washington on the sidelines of a series of International Monetary Fund meetings.

His comments came just hours after EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK “has to pay” if Britain wants talks to begin on a future trade deal with the EU.

Hammond was criticised this week by some Conservatives, including former finance minister Nigel Lawson, for not agreeing to spend money now on preparations for the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal.

Lawson said on Thursday that Hammond’s position on Brexit was “close to sabotage” and called for the chancellor to be sacked.",Philip Hammond 'Regrets' Calling The EU The 'Enemies' In The Brexit Negotiations,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/13/philip-hammond-regrets-eu-enemies_n_18257888.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&amp;ir=UK

로즈 맥고완이 트위터로 컴백했다.

로즈 맥고완의 트위터 계정은 지난 수요일 갑자기 정지됐다. 그는 인스타그램에 ""트위터가 내 계정을 정지했다""며 ""뭔가 강력한 힘이 작용하고 있다. 내 목소리가 되어달라""고 올렸다.

그리고 목요일, 트위터는 맥고완의 계정을 임시로 정지한 이유는 그가 누군가의 전화번호를 올렸기 때문이라고 해명했다. 해당 트윗이 삭제되자마자 로즈 맥고완의 계정은 다시 원상복귀됐다.

아래는 트위터의 연속적인 해명이다.

""우리는 맥고완의 팀과 연락을 주고 받았고, 그의 트윗에 개인적인 전화번호가 있어서 임시로 정지됐다고 설명하길 원했다. 전화번호를 올리는 행위는 트위터 약관을 어기는 행위다.""

The Tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked. We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future. 2/3 — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 12, 2017

""해당 트윗은 삭제됐고, 맥고완의 계정도 정상으로 돌아왔다. 앞으로는 우리의 이런 약관에 대해서 더 명확하게 하겠다""

트위터가 맥고완의 계정을 풀자마자 그는 트럼프의 북한에 대한 트윗을 예로 들며 트위터 측에 의문을 표했다.

로즈 맥고완은 트위터에서 하비 웨인스타인의 가장 강력한 비판자였다. 맥고완은 지난 1997년 선댄스 영화제 기간 중 호텔 방에서 발생한 성추행 사건으로 10만 달러에 웨인스타인과 합의했다.

그러나 뉴욕타임스가 웨인스타인에 대한 기사를 낸 다음날, 맥고완은 트위터에 웨인스타인의 당시 행동에 대해 폭로하기 시작했다.

트위터가 로즈 맥고완 계정 정지가 약관 위반 때문이라고 해명하기 전까지, 트위터 이용자들은 트위터 보이콧을 선언하고 나섰다(지금은 멈춘 것으로 보인다).

Alors si l'amour du football ne doit pas pour autant nous rendre aveugles, croisons les doigts pour que Nasser Al-Khelaifi ressorte indemne de l'enquête en cours.
Mais il en va aussi de celui du PSG et du football français.","Le PSG est-il coupable? La presse du monde entier présente l'enquête ouverte contre Nasser Al-Khelaifi par les autorités suisses, pour des soupçons de corruption, comme une procédure visant le Président du PSG. Alors même que l'enquête ne semble concerner, en réalité, ""que"" BeIn Media, dont il est également le PDG, voire l'Etat du Qatar.

La confusion des intérêts

La confusion règne. Mais comment pourrait-il en être autrement, alors que les différents intérêts représentés par Nasser Al-Khelaifi sont aussi convergents? Celui que l'on appelle familièrement ""Nasser"" dans le milieu du football est, sans contestation possible, l'homme de Doha pour tout ce qui concerne le ballon rond.

Lorsque les caméras se braquent sur lui, elles le filment, la plupart du temps, devant les emblèmes du PSG. Mais on le retrouve parfois devant le logo de BeIn Sports. Quand on ne le voit pas à Doha vêtu de la tenue traditionnelle qatarie, à savoir une thawb, un izar et coiffé de la traditionnelle ghutra.

Quand un Etat, le Qatar, possède un club de football de premier plan, une chaîne de TV qui retransmet ses matches et qu'il s'apprête de surcroît à organiser la Coupe du Monde de football 2022, il n'est pas incompréhensible que les frontières, nécessairement poreuses, entre ces différents intérêts puissent interroger.

C'est ce qui pousse aujourd'hui la justice suisse à s'intéresser au rôle que Nasser Al-Khelaifi, et à travers lui le groupe BeIn Media et le Qatar, auraient pu avoir dans l'octroi des droits télévisés des prochaines Coupes du Monde.

Une enquête attendue

Un intérêt qui s'explique aussi par un contexte judiciaire chargé pour le football mondial. La FIFA est empêtrée dans un scandale sans fin. Et si on peine à démêler l'essentiel de l'accessoire, l'illégal de l'immoral, la fraude avérée de l'erreur excusable, il semble acquis qu'une partie substantielle des agissements répréhensibles reprochés à la FIFA concernerait des faveurs indûment octroyées lors de l'attribution de Coupes du Monde, et des contrats qu'elles génèrent. Dont les droits de retransmission télévisés.

Par ailleurs, le rapport Garcia de 2014, du nom de l'ex-procureur américain ayant depuis lors démissionné de la FIFA, pointait déjà vers Doha. Et la plupart des observateurs s'accordent pour dire que l'octroi, le 2 décembre 2010, de la Coupe du monde 2022 au Qatar est une farce sans nom qui ne cessera probablement jamais de poser question.

Le Qatar est géographiquement 3 fois plus petit que la Belgique et 4 fois moins peuplé? Pas grave. Attribuer la Coupe du Monde au Qatar c'est l'attribuer à une région du monde qui ne l'a jamais organisée. Soit.

Le cahier des charges prévoyait qu'il fallait l'organiser en juillet 2022, alors qu'il fait 50°C au Qatar à cette période de l'année? Les votants, y compris français, s'en rendent comptent 4 ans plus tard? Pas grave. On organisera la Coupe du monde 2022 en hiver et on demandera aux fédérations du monde entier d'adapter leurs calendriers aux conditions météorologiques de Doha.

Heureusement que les ballons de football n'explosent pas en hiver au Qatar, sinon tout laisse à penser que la FIFA aurait recommandé d'organiser la Coupe du Monde de foot 2022 avec des ballons de rugby.

Un doute raisonnable

Et pourtant... Nasser Al Khelaifi est un homme important à Doha. Mais c'en est également un à Paris. Pour BeIn Media, qui est aujourd'hui dans le viseur de la justice suisse, mais aussi – et surtout - pour le PSG.

Car il s'est progressivement imposé dans le football français comme un président compétent, efficace et élégant. Un modèle dont le football français a clairement besoin aujourd'hui. De Marseille à Lille et de Rennes à Strasbourg, en passant par Lyon. Un exemple de professionnalisme, à même de faire du club parisien une réussite sur le marché, désormais mondialisé, du football professionnel.

""Nasser"" construit à Paris une locomotive pour l'ensemble des autres clubs français, qu'il entraîne dans son sillage, signant la naissance d'un ""foot business à la française"", compétitif au plan sportif, rentable financièrement et existant au plan international. Une ambition qui pourrait empêcher, demain, le football hexagonal d'être marginalisé ou de disparaître, écrasé par les clubs étrangers, et notamment anglais.

Alors si l'amour du football ne doit pas pour autant nous rendre aveugles, croisons les doigts pour que Nasser Al-Khelaifi ressorte indemne de l'enquête en cours. Il y va, bien entendu, de l'intérêt de BeIn Media. Mais il en va aussi de celui du PSG et du football français.

Im neuen ARD-Deutschlandtrend geht es mit der Popularität des Chefdiplomaten bereits steil bergab.

Seine Frau Anke stimme ihn längst auf die Zeit nach dem grellen Scheinwerferlicht ein, sagt Gabriel. ""Na, hast Du Dich schon daran gewöhnt, nicht mehr wichtig zu sein?"", bekomme er seit der Bundestagswahl in Goslar zu hören.

Der eigentliche Kampf finde eben nicht im Wahlkampf, sondern zu Hause statt, scherzt Gabriel bei der Veranstaltung in Hannover, die den Titel ""Auf ein Wort mit..."" trägt.

Edmund Stoiber, der frühere CSU-Ministerpräsident, richte immer schöne Grüße an Anke aus. Sie sei ""der einzige Mensch mit Verstand"" im Hause Gabriel - die Zahnärztin, mit der der 58-Jährige gerade erst noch ein kleines Mädchen bekommen hat, ist Bayern-Fan. Gabriel drückt Werder Bremen die Daumen.

Die im Minutentakt in freier Rede den Jusos und Omas dahingeworfenen Anekdoten sollen den Schmerz überspielen, der ihn ohne Frage plagen dürfte.

Gabriel trat hinter Schulz zurück

Siebeneinhalb Jahre war der frühere Lehrer, der als Kind unter einem hasserfüllten Nazi-Vater litt, SPD-Vorsitzender. So lange wie keiner seit Willy Brandt. Anfang Januar, nach Monaten des Zauderns, trat er zurück. Gabriel überließ Martin Schulz die Bühne.

""Mach Du es, mich wollen sie nicht"", sagte er da zu Schulz, der nur kurz im 100-Prozent-Glück baden durfte. Die Partei, die mit Gabriel stets haderte und er mit ihr, applaudierte. Die Rede war von einer heroischen Tat.

Mittlerweile sind andere Töne zu vernehmen. Spitzengenossen glauben, Gabriel habe nicht ganz uneigennützig gehandelt. Als er Frank-Walter Steinmeier gegen den Willen der Kanzlerin zum Bundespräsidenten machte, war für ihn selbst der Weg ins Auswärtige Amt frei.

Schulz sollte sich als Kanzlerkandidat abstrampeln, um dann Seit' an Seit' mit Gabriel in einer neuen Groko zu landen. Daraus wurde nichts. Drei, vier Prozentpunkte fehlten der SPD, sonst wäre Gabriels Kalkül aufgegangen.

Noch ist Schulz als Parteivorsitzender da, Olaf Scholz, Manuela Schwesig warten ab. Das neue Machtzentrum liegt in der Fraktion, bei Andrea Nahles. Und Gabriel? Kann er damit seinen Frieden machen?

Nach der Wahl tauchte Gabriel ab

Nach der Wahl fiel er in Loch. Am Abend des 24. September stand er im Willy-Brandt-Haus ganz hinten auf der Bühne. Geduckt, erschüttert. Zehn Tage lang tauchte Gabriel ab. Seine Mitarbeiter machten sich Sorgen. Dann meldete er sich zurück. Wo? Natürlich in der Heimat.

Vom ""roten Klops"" spricht Gabriel stolz. Während die SPD überall den Bach runterging, verteidigten Gabriel und seine Mitstreiter die Bastion Braunschweig und Umgebung. Er holte mit knapp 43 Prozent wieder sein Direktmandat - das zweitbeste Ergebnis eines SPD-Kandidaten im ganzen Land. ""Wir kümmern uns jeden Tag, nicht nur vier Wochen vor der Wahl.""

Er gab dem Kreml-nahen TV-Sender ""Russia Today"" ein umstrittenes Interview, um die Russland-Deutschen in seinem Wahlkreis zu erreichen: ""Mit denen redet doch sonst keiner.""

Demnächst, wenn er nicht mehr ""Mister Wichtig"" in Berlin ist (""Ich hab' ja jetzt Zeit""), will er einen VW-Bus mieten, einen pensionierten Arbeits- und Sozialrechtler einladen und jene Stadtteile abklappern, wo 40 Prozent der Menschen AfD gewählt haben.

Die SPD dürfe der schwierigsten aller Fragen jetzt nicht ausweichen: ""Warum waren wir so sehr zufrieden mit unserem Programm, aber die Wählerinnen und Wähler nicht?"" Der Fokus auf soziale Gerechtigkeit habe die Menschen nicht überzeugt.

Die Deutschen hätten auf Stabilität geschaut - und dort, wo der Staat Schulen, Krankenhäuser und Bushaltestellen dichtgemacht habe, aus Protest die Rechten gewählt.

Nach der Wahl tauchte Gabriel ab

Gabriel kennt die Mechanismen in der SPD. Unter seiner Führung wurden die Pleiten von 2009 und 2013 verdrängt. ""Die Lieblingsausrede ist, die Plakate waren schlecht."" Einfach werde es nicht, es gebe sicher viele Gründe: ""Viele Hunde sind des Hasen Tod.""

Die SPD sei nicht nah genug an den Alltagssorgen der Bürger, zu elitär. Gabriels Funktionärs-Bashing ist berüchtigt. ""Könnt ihr Euch vorstellen, im SPD-Ortsverein steht einer auf und sagt: Ich bin Raucher, gucke RTL und finde das mit den Flüchtlingen schwierig"", fragte er dieser Tage in Helmstedt in die Runde. ""Oder schließen wir ihn unmittelbar aus der SPD aus?""

""Irgendwann"" werde er sich mit Vorschlägen zur SPD-Erneuerung zu Wort melden. Für viele in der Partei dürfte das wie eine Drohung klingen.

In der Fraktion hoffen sie, Gabriel, der Architekt der Groko 2013, habe kapiert, dass seine große Zeit vorbei sei. Aber ist das wirklich so? Gabriel, der brave Hinterbänkler? Wie eine Abschiedstournee wirken seine Auftritte in Niedersachsen, wo SPD-Ministerpräsident Stephan Weil am Sonntag eine überraschende Titelverteidigung winkt, keineswegs.

Gabriel wird beobachten, was Andrea Nahles (die er lobt) an der Fraktionsspitze macht. Was aus dem angeschlagenen Schulz wird, den er bei seinen jüngsten Auftritten mit keinem Wort erwähnt.

Nach der Wahl tauchte Gabriel ab

Am Montag fliegt Gabriel noch mal zum EU-Außenministertreffen nach Luxemburg. Andere Auslandsreisen sind in Planung, bis Jamaika die Regierungsgeschäfte übernimmt.

Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU), der Bundestagspräsident wird, knallt er noch vor den Latz, die CDU wolle das Auswärtige Amt ""plündern"" und in der Europapolitik entmachten. Ein kostenloser Tipp für Cem Özdemir, sich nicht über den Tisch ziehen zu lassen.

Nach dem Kaffekränzchen in Hannover taucht Gabriel in Einbeck auf. Südniedersachsen, ""Hotel Panorama"", Publikum 60 plus, viel weißes Haar. Dort schließt sich für ihn gewissermaßen ein Kreis. Als junger Mann arbeitete er als Bierkutscher bei der ortsansässigen Brauerei, übrigens die älteste in Deutschland.

Fast jeder Sozialdemokrat hat von Gabriel schon mal die Geschichte erzählt bekommen, wie er als Fahrer täglich ein ""Deputat"" von sechs Flaschen Bier bekam. ""Der schönste Job meines Lebens"", sagt er auch jetzt. ""Ich hab' da nur aus gesundheitlichen Gründen aufgehört.""

Einem Jungsozialisten rät Gabriel, den alten Hasen zu widersprechen, mutig zu sein, den Laden aufzumischen. Wie er sich da so reden hört, sagt Gabriel grinsend: ""Ich schaufle mir mein eigenes Grab."" Um spöttisch nachzuschieben: ""Das ist auch schon ausgehoben.""

Aber wer weiß, bis zur Beerdigung seiner politischen Laufbahn könnte noch einiges passieren.

Therapists say nothing livens up a couple’s sex life quite like channeling those hot-and-heavy early days through role playing.

If you need inspiration, watch this scene from “Modern Family,” where married couple Claire and Phil pretend to be strangers meeting up for a hookup. Things get a little dirty at the hotel bar (and later, super awkward at the hotel elevator, but that’s beside the point).

Below, marriage therapists from around the country share six reasons feigning an affair with your spouse could change your sex life for the better.

1. It’s a good reminder that your spouse is pretty damn sexy.

“So often, we take our partners for granted and get caught up in a negativity bias: we notice all of the things they aren’t doing or could do, versus what they already are. That probably doesn’t inspire you to show up as your best, flirty and sexiest self. So consider having an affair: Instead of hanging out in sweats or your most comfortable PJs, think about what you would wear and how you would greet and engage your partner if it was a first date or the man you’d want to have an affair with. Bring your A-game, leave your history behind for the night and step into the anticipation of what’s possible.” ― Megan Fleming, a New York City-based sex therapist and the author of Invisible Divorce: Finding Your Way Back to Connection

2. It helps keep the kinky, dirty, raunchy side of you alive.

“For most, long-term relationships dictate that the we should only be attracted to, fantasize about and be sexual with the person that we marry. We then trade in that dirty, animalistic side for a romantic love, which kills sex in the bedroom. This also lends to other societal conditioning about how you’re suppose to treat your spouse (case in point: the Madonna/whore complex). We feel bad treating someone we respect in a kinky or dirty way, yet oftentimes, these very visions are what entice us and arouse us. Role-playing is a great way for couples to reignite that which may have been lost, by stepping out of their role as dutiful wife, husband and caregiver and getting back to that place where they can throw caution to the wind and embrace that raw, lewd side of themselves.” ― Moushumi Ghose, a sex therapist and author of Classic Sex Positions Reinvented

3. Bringing something “forbidden” to the forefront can be surprisingly sexy.

“Many people may think this idea could be throwing gasoline on the fire ― and it is. But that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. If a couples is stable in their relationship and trusting, this could bring a new level of heat and beauty. When we bring in the forbidden and play with it consciously, it brings with it a strong sexual charge that drives arousal off the charts.” ― Keeley Rankin, a sex therapist in San Francisco, California

4. It gives you an opportunity to work on your flirting skills.

“Most of the long-term couples I see have forgotten the art of flirting and seduction. I often will create exercises for couples to take on new or fantasy roles which help them get back to playing with one another in a more erotic fashion. The scene in ‘Modern Family’ shows how important it is for couples to leave the domestic behind (both literally ― by going on a date to a location that elicits frisson, and psychologically ― by not discussing to-do lists, the kids schedule or finances). Many couples find their minds are not present to the erotic chase or the experience of teasing due to their minds being distracted by the day’s responsibilities and routines. Playing requires a kind of mindful focus to the role at hand.” ― Sari Cooper, a couple’s therapist in New York City and host of the web show “Sex Esteem.”

5. Dressing up for your spouse can pay off in a major way.

“Perhaps you don’t usually take the time to prepare at all for sex. Knowing you’ll be having a special getaway ― or meeting someone ‘new’ ― could inspire you to take that extra step. You wear that sexy lingerie, shave your beard (or anything else that needs a little trim), wear a scent that’s enticing or try out a new style of suit or dress. Then, you take the time to actually undress each other, enjoying each new layer as it is uncovered. Little things like that can be extremely arousing.” ― Celeste Hirschman, sex expert and author of Making Love Real, co-authored by Danielle Harel

6. It could open up your mind to new opportunities in the bedroom.

“This is an opportunity to try new things you’re not used to: explore new pleasures and play with dynamics of power. See how it feels both to give and receive in different ways. If it’s a ‘new’ or ‘side’ relationship, why not use that mindset to ask for what you want? Creating a little space for the unknown ― for wanting and longing ― can spice up any relationship.” ― Megan Fleming",The One Person It Always Pays To Have An Affair With,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/one-person-to-have-an-affair-with_us_59d6bd15e4b0f6eed34f4aaa

Malayalam filmmaker Sanal Kumar Sasidharan's contentious film 'Sexy Durga' has finally been cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), or, as it is more popularly known as, the Censor board. But not before the maker agreed to drop 'Sexy' from the title and mute 21 cuss words and sanitise the film and make sure it doesn't hurt the fragile sentiments of India's gatekeepers of culture.

The movie will now be released in theatres with a U/A certificate as S Durga with 21 audio mutes, but will retain its original title and audible abusive words when it is eventually screened online, reported Scroll.in.

The movie became a point of contention last month when it was refused censor exemption for screening at the Mumbai Film Festival because the Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry felt that it may ""affect the law and order as it hurts the religious sentiments,"" claimed Sasidharan. Without the exemption, the film would not have been eligible to be shown without censorship at the festival.

Upset and angry by this institutionalised attempt to muzzle the creativity of artists, the filmmaker had criticised the decision, saying India is ""a land that's becoming like Iran"".

Sasidharan may have agreed to change the film's title and mute the words to ensure that the movie gets screened, his words make it amply clear what he really thinks about the CBFC-mandated cuts.

""""Sexy Durga"" will be released in Indian Cinemas as ""S Durga"". S is a letter open for your imaginations. Bakths are specially requested to not imagine it as ""Sexy"" as they will be cursed by Durga. Be nice and come and watch the film,"" he wrote in a Facebook post.

According to the filmmaker, the reason for naming the film 'Sexy Durga' was not to hurt religious sentiments or defame the Hindu goddess, but to point out the irony that on the one hand our society worships goddesses and on the other, we treat women around us so poorly.

""Now when I see the name, I feel really crazy because it is a representation of typical mindset,"" news agency IANS quoted Sasidharan as saying. About the abusive words that he's been made to mute, he says, ""It is just insignificant words. It was only to show that the characters are raw. The mutes are beeped so people will understand the words are something bad. That's more effective.""

S Durga, starring Rajshri Deshpande and Kannan Nayar, is the first Indian film in 23 years to win the Tiger Award at the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR), where it premiered.

75 statuettes remportées aux Oscars

Les œuvres de la Weinstein Company et de Miramax (""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""The Artist"", ""Carol"", ""Shakespeare in love"", ""Le patient anglais""...) ont accumulé 303 nominations et récolté 75 statuettes aux Oscars, entre autres récompenses prestigieuses.

Le scandale a également emporté plusieurs grands projets de production. Apple a annulé un projet de série sur Elvis Presley et Amazon a indiqué jeudi être en train ""de réviser (ses) projets avec la Weinstein Company"" concernant deux co-productions.

Selon les médias, des dirigeants du studio ont également discuté de la possibilité de repousser la sortie prévue le 24 novembre du film ""Current War"", le dernier long-métrage programmé par la société en 2017. Si cette fresque historique avec Benedict Cumberbatch incarnant Thomas Edison et Michael Shannon l'inventeur George Westinghouse est repoussée à 2018, le film ne pourrait pas être sélectionné pour les différentes récompenses, dont les Oscars.

A review of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data obtained through right-to-information requests shows banks' total stressed loans — including non-performing and restructured or rolled over loans — rose 4.5 percent in the six months to end-June. In the previous six months they had risen 5.8 percent.

While banks remain the main source of funding for India's companies, the stubborn bad debt problem has eaten into bank profits and choked off new lending, especially to smaller firms, at a time when an economy that depends on them is stalling.

India grew at its slowest pace in three years in April-June - a concern for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces elections in 2019 and has pledged to create millions of new jobs before then.

Banks are having to take higher provisions to account for more defaulters being pushed into bankruptcy. And margins are likely to be squeezed further by proposed new rules to encourage commercial banks to pass on central bank interest rate cuts.

To be sure, the bulk of India's sour loans are in the state banks and stem from lending to large conglomerates, especially in steel and infrastructure. But analysts say the rise in bad loans among small firms, and even retail borrowing, is worrying and will do little to encourage new loans to help fuel growth.

""On the corporate side, we think it's a recognition cycle which is nearing an end,"" said Alka Anbarasu, senior analyst at Moody's Investor Service, referring to more bad loans being recognized as such, as banks come under pressure from the RBI and other regulators.

""But it's really those data points beyond corporate that are causing some worry.""

Anbarasu forecast weak quarters ahead for banks before profitability picks up, and several senior bankers from public sector lenders - which account for more than two-thirds of Indian banking assets - agreed the months ahead would be strained.

Stressed loans as a percentage of total loans reached 12.6 percent at end-June, according to the RBI data, the highest level in at least 15 years.

HIGHER PROVISIONS, WEAKER LOANS

Part of the issue for banks and the government is a strict provisioning regime: the RBI wants banks to provide for at least 50 percent of the secured loans to companies taken to bankruptcy proceedings, and 100 percent for the unsecured part.

A dozen of the biggest such cases account for nearly 1.78 trillion rupees, or a quarter of total non-performing assets.

For those companies, banks will need to provide 180 billion rupees on top of existing provisions, according to July estimates from India Ratings and Research, the local affiliate of Fitch Ratings.

More than 20 other sizeable companies are at risk of being taken to bankruptcy court.

Bankers say these and other pressures - including rising government bond yields that forced banks to post mark-to-market losses - have added to the squeeze, and hit new loans.

According to RBI data, new loans grew at just about 5 percent in the year to March, the lowest growth rate in more than six decades. Several banks have already cut back their loan books to conserve capital.

""What are they (RBI) thinking while they're taking these steps all at the same time?"" said a treasurer at a state-run bank, who didn't want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. ""Do they want banks to wind up their businesses, or do they want to save the banks?""

Treasury income accounted for 22.7 percent of banks' operating profits in the last financial year, doubling its share from a year earlier, India Ratings estimates.

""The almost zero treasury income will hit provisioning ability and, in turn, make it more difficult for weaker banks to give loans as capital becomes more scarce,"" said Soumyajit Niyogi, an associate director at the rating agency.

A senior policymaker, who requested anonymity as the discussions are not public, said the government would have to help to sufficiently capitalize the banks.

Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks will need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules. Moody's expects the top 11 state lenders alone will need nearly $15 billion. The government has just $3 billion left in its budget for bank recapitalization.

""We think capitalization is the biggest challenge for the banks at the moment, given that earnings will remain subdued and will not support any capital generation,"" said Moody's Anbarasu.

Le même jour, le fondateur de la ""Taverne 2.0"" renchérit, en informant les utilisateurs qu'une solution de repli a été trouvée.","POLITIQUE - Lundi 9 octobre, les administrateurs de la ""Taverne des Patriotes"", forum de discussion sur la plateforme Discord, lançaient un sondage à destination de ses cybermilitants. Objectif: ""mieux connaître la population"" de cet entre-soi de l'extrême droite numérique où se retrouvaient jusqu'à un millier de supporters de Marine Le Pen pendant la campagne présidentielle. Une consultation rendue nécessaire par la crise identitaire que traverse une partie de cette ""fachosphère,"" bousculée par les remous qui agitent le Front national depuis le mois de juin.

Sous l'apparence d'un sondage en ligne classique, la diversité des options idéologiques proposées (""national bolchevisme"", ""nationalisme néopaïen"", ""ligne Philippot"", ""paléo-frontisme"", ""national-lesquenisme"" etc.) témoigne des interrogations d'une communauté écartelée entre une multitude de courants -aussi obscurs soient-ils- et que ces ""patriotes"" tentent malgré tout d'agréger.

Qui sommes-nous? Où allons-nous? Voilà ce qui ressort de ce questionnaire, dont certaines questions font peu de cas de la dédiabolisation revendiquée par le Front national. À l'image de celle consistant à afficher son degré d'adhésion à la phrase suivante: ""Mieux vaut un noir patriote qu'un blanc gauchiste"".

Plus loin, les mêmes ""patriotes"" sont invités à renseigner leur vote au premier tour de la présidentielle. Comme si la réponse ""Marine Le Pen"" n'avait plus rien d'une évidence pour cette communauté qui a pourtant bataillé pour soutenir la fille de Jean-Marie Le Pen sur les réseaux sociaux. Depuis la fin de la campagne, rien ne va plus dans la ""Taverne"" comme au Front national.

Une scission dès le mois de mai

Elle paraît loin l'époque de la présidentielle où ""La Taverne des Patriotes"" était considérée comme l'avant-garde numérique du FN, dont certains cadres entretenaient des liens plus ou moins assumés avec ces cybermilitants ultra-organisés et appuyés par des trolls Pro-Trump (dont le pouvoir de nuisance pendant la campagne américaine continue de faire débat). Pour rappel, on leur doit des campagnes de déstabilisation de type ""Ali Juppé"" ou ""Farid Fillon"" ainsi que des opérations de manipulation à l'image de la ""Fake news"" sur le pseudo-compte de Macron au Bahamas, que les pensionnaires de la ""Taverne"" ont contribué à faire buzzer sur les réseaux sociaux.

Depuis, la défaite de Marine Le Pen ainsi que son débat très critiqué sur cette même plateforme ont laissé des traces. ""La Taverne des Patriotes"" canal historique n'a pas survécu à ce revers électoral. Dès le mois de mai (donc avant les élections législatives), cette communauté explosait. Les membres du forum ont été invités à rejoindre la ""Taverne 2.0"", à cause de ""la folie"" d'un administrateur de la première version qui aurait ""pété un câble"".

Ceux qui donnaient une visibilité énorme à la propagande du Front national sur les réseaux sociaux pendant la campagne sont subitement devenus atones. Finis les ""raids"" ou autres ""opérations"" pour servir Marine Le Pen. Alors que ""La Taverne des Patriotes"" était érigée en arrière cuisine officieuse de la campagne numérique de la candidate frontiste, sa réplique ""2.0"" s'est muée en banal repaire d'extrême droite, où se croisent visuels racistes et caricatures antisémites que nous ne reproduisons pas ici.

Une activité pauvre qui tranche avec la foison d'actions réalisées par le Discord insoumis, un autre influent forum, lui proche de Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Pendant la campagne, la ""Taverne"" affichait près de 1000 membres.

La fracture du départ de Philippot

Dès la refondation de la ""Taverne"" au mois de mai, une mise au point sur la ""ligne"" a été publiée. ""Notre serveur est, en clair, un rassemblement des nationalistes français. Notre but affiché est de 'ratisser large', afin de faire grossir les rangs et de pouvoir mener des opérations de grande ampleur, de quelque nature que ce soit, mais également d'amener à se confronter un maximum d'opinions divergentes lors des débats entre partisans de la droite nationale"", écrivent les administrateurs, listant cinq grands principes qui doivent être partagés: le ""nationalisme culturel"", le ""souverainisme"", le ""conservatisme sociétal"", l'""opposition à l'immigration"" ainsi que ""l'opposition à l'islam"".

Soit peu ou prou la ligne du Front national, avant le départ de son aile souverainiste incarnée par Florian Philippot. Ainsi, comme l'a montré Slate, le départ de l'ex-numéro du Front national a considérablement divisé les membres de la ""Taverne"", certains n'hésitant pas à tomber dans l'insulte alors que d'autres dénonçaient le comportement ""stalinien"" du parti lepéniste. Depuis, la division n'a cessé d'agiter ces cybermilitants.

""Après les récents troubles politiques qu'ont connu notre camp"", un membre a proposé le 1er octobre ""un débat vocal"" dont l'intitulé résume les interrogations qui traversent l'extrême droite française: ""L'avenir politique de la droite nationale en France : demain le philippotisme global ou la révolte des natios?"" (nationalistes NDLR). Quelques jours plus tard, les administrateurs de la plateforme ont mis en ligne le questionnaire sur les préférences politiques des utilisateurs de la ""Taverne"".

""La Taverne"" vouée à disparaître?

Comme l'a montré le destin de la première version du Discord frontiste, la pérennité de la plateforme est largement dépendante des histoires personnelles. Autrement dit, le pouvoir que concentrent les administrateurs de la ""Taverne"" est énorme, dans la mesure où ils peuvent la supprimer en un seul clic. Dès lors, il suffit de très peu de choses pour que tout explose. C'est ce qui s'est passé avec le forum pro-Trump, grand frère américain de la ""Taverne des Patriotes""' également hébergé sur Discord. Comme l'explique Mashable, ""Centipede Central"" (chat-room très active pendant la campagne de Donald Trump) a fini par se dissoudre à cause de désaccords persistants entre le fondateur et les administrateurs du forum.

N'ayant plus d'objectifs à partager, cet entre-soi extrémiste semble plus difficile à gérer hors période électorale. Un incident survenu dans la nuit du 29 au 30 septembre dans ""la Taverne des Patriotes"" en atteste, comme l'explique un membre, avec un vocabulaire qui montre que les obsessions de l'extrême droite n'ont pas vraiment changé. ""Cette nuit l'un des modérateurs du staff, Riyrr, a lancé la ""Solution Finale"" pour tous les patriotes des lettres A à E, ces derniers ont été bannis abusivement"", écrit-il. Dans une autre publication aux références tout aussi claires, on apprend que ce modérateur a décidé de ""mettre en œuvre la Shoah des patriotes"". Publication accompagnée d'un visuel pour le moins explicite.

Le même jour, le fondateur de la ""Taverne 2.0"" renchérit, en informant les utilisateurs qu'une solution de repli a été trouvée. ""Suite aux récents événements, nous vous demandons de rejoindre ce serveur de secours, au cas où vous seriez expulsé de celui-ci ou s'il venait à disparaître"", prévient-il. Ainsi est née une ""Taverne 3.0"". Elle réunit pour le moment moins d'une soixantaine de membres.

That’s blogger Anne Victoria Clark’s genius “life hack” for men “who don’t want to be accused of sexual harassment.”

High-profile sexual harassment scandals, such as the one engulfing movie producer Harvey Weinstein, have led some men to shy away from mentoring women for fear of being accused of inappropriate conduct, Clark wrote in a Medium post shared online Monday.

It boils down to men imagining how they’d treat Johnson. Clark advises them to close their eyes when grabbing coffee, taking a meeting or having after-work drinks with female colleagues who they may find attractive — and instead think of Johnson.

“Simply offer them the same respect, admiration, and healthy dose of fear you’d offer anyone who could completely destroy you should you deserve it,” Clark suggested.

Republican Bob Corker, who previously called Trump’s volatile White House an “adult day care centre” and warned the president could start World War Three, said Trump’s tweets dismissing Tillerson’s negotiation efforts were narrowing America’s options on dealing with countries like Iran and North Korea.

Trump, who was condemned worldwide for refusing to certify the nuclear deal with the “fanatical regime” in Iran on Friday, tweeted two weeks ago to say Tillerson was “wasting his time” by trying to negotiate with North Korea and told him to “save your energy”.

The tweet came the day after Tillerson had told a news conference in Beijing that America was directly communicating with North Korea on its nuclear and missile programme but it had shown no interest in dialogue.

“You cannot publicly castrate your own secretary of state,” Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told The Washington Post.

He added that Trump’s undermining Tillerson and diplomatic channels pushed America towards a “binary” choice of either going to war with countries like North Korea or leaving them to develop nuclear weapons.

Corker said: “When you jack the legs out from under your chief diplomat, you cause all that to fall apart... Us working with [Beijing] effectively is the key to not getting to a binary choice.

“When you publicly castrate your secretary of state, you take that off the table.”

Corker has already been a target of Trump’s Twitter tirades. Trump has claimed Corker wanted to be his Secretary of State and said he was responsible for the “horrendous” Iran deal.

Tillerson is among the most senior officials in Trump’s Cabinet and White House who remains in his job, after a series of high profile resignations and firings.

L'occasion de découvrir de nouveaux plats, comme le Dhal. Ou bien Dal, Dahl, Daal... les variantes orthographiques du nom de ce grand classique d'Asie du sud ne manquent pas. Le mot se traduit par ""légumineuses"", mais c'est aussi un curry de lentilles très populaire en Inde. Dans un pays où le végétarisme concerne près d'un tiers de la population, cette préparation sans viande n'est autre que l'un des basiques de l'alimentation quotidienne.

Il existe une quantité impressionnante de variantes de ce plat préparé traditionnellement avec des lentilles corail et une combinaison d'épices, grâce à la cinquantaine de légumes secs différents utilisés, parfois inconnus chez nous. On peut par exemple remplacer les lentilles par des pois chiches, des pois cassés, des haricots noirs ou des haricots mungo. Il est aussi possible de mélanger plusieurs légumineuses comme dans le dhal Makhani, qui associe haricots rouges et lentilles du Puy.

La sauce comporte pour sa part plusieurs versions, avec ou sans lait de coco, ou avec de la sauce tomate. Le reste de la garniture se compose de différents légumes comme des épinards, courges, patates douces, tomates ou champignons.

L""association des lentilles avec du riz ou d'autres céréales en fait un repas complet naturellement végétalien, et permet de mieux assimiler les protéines végétales et acides aminés contenus dans les légumes secs. Les épices comme le curcuma, la coriandre ou l'asafoetida (une résine séchée) et autres herbes aromatiques ne sont pas uniquement utilisées pour rehausser les saveurs, mais aident aussi à éviter les problèmes digestifs souvent attribués aux légumineuses. Ces dernières sont d'ailleurs largement recommandées par l'ANSES (Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail) à la place des protéines animales, qui à haute dose acidifient et épuisent l'organisme.

Racist abuse and threats to “bomb the mosque” feature heavily among the hate crimes, as do incidents of offenders smashing windows on buildings and parked cars.

Other records include offensive graffiti sprayed on to buildings, violent assaults on worshippers, two cases of arson and two cases of individuals leaving bacon on door handles at mosques.

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called the figures “deeply troubling”.

“Attacks on any religious group or minority are abominable,” she said, adding: “These anti-Muslim attacks will be condemned by all decent people.”

The data was obtained by the Press Association through Freedom of Information requests to UK police forces. The figures, based on 42 responses from 45 forces, also show:

25 forces saw a year-on-year increase in hate crimes directed at mosques, with the biggest rise reported by Greater Manchester Police (nine crimes, up from zero) and London’s Metropolitan Police (17 crimes, up from eight). Threats, harassment or other intimidating behaviour more than tripled, from 14 crimes in 2016 to 49 in 2017. Violent crime against individuals more than doubled from five recorded crimes against worshippers at mosques in 2016 to 11 crimes in 2017. Crimes recorded as vandalism or criminal damage increased from 12 in 2016 to 15 in 2017.

Britain endured a number of terror attacks claimed by Islamic State over the period in which the crimes were recorded, at London Bridge, Westminster and Manchester.

The figures come to light within weeks of separate incidents in which an imam and surgeon who treated Manchester bombing victims was stabbed outside a mosque in Cheshire and a 14-year-old boy was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck outside a mosque in Birmingham.

Other high-profile cases of hate crime at mosques this year include the Finsbury Park terror attack in June, a Manchester mosque gutted by fire in an arson attack in July and the sending of a white powder and bomb threats to three mosques across London in July.

More than 50 places of worship, almost half of them mosques, applied for the most recent round of anti-hate crime funding from the Government, which ended in June.

Applications for funding, intended to provide security measures, were made available to all places of worship in April and May but extended into June after terror attacks at the start of the summer.

Abbott called on the Home Office to publish data on hate crimes against all places of worship “as a matter of course” after “worrying reports of attacks on synagogues as well as mosques”.

She said: “Politicians have a particular responsibility in the language they use, the policies they advocate and the climate they create.

“There should be a unanimous message that violence against any section of our society is unacceptable.”

Tell Mama, a charity who monitor and record anti-Muslim incidents, said “sadly these figures have not come as a shock”.

The group’s director, Iman A’tta, told HuffPost UK that between June 2013 and May 2017 it had recorded 160 incidents against mosques.

“As anti-Muslim hatred has sadly become more vocal and noticeable, mosques are seen as the visible symbol of local Muslim communities and are therefore targeted. However, the impact of the wider Muslim community using the mosque is significant.”

Tell Mama told HuffPost that terrorism is a “major driver” for anti-Muslim attacks, but added there were other factors such as “inflammatory media headlines and far right extremism and rhetoric”.

“However, the largest impact on Muslim communities is through terrorism and that can’t be denied since some seem to believe that the media is the major cause of anti-Muslim attacks.

Inflammatory headlines may play a role, but they do not come anywhere near the real world impacts that Islamist terrorism causes. Sadly, British Muslims are then caught and squeezed between those who use their faith to murder and those who target them and those who use such situations to play to exclusionary mindsets.”

A Home Office spokesman said: “All forms of hate crime are completely unacceptable and the UK has some of the strongest laws in the world to tackle it.”

A report by Hope not Hate in August highlighted that Britons’ attitudes towards Muslims and Islam had “worsened” with more than half of all respondents to a new survey believing the religion “poses a threat” to the West.

“The fear and hostility displayed towards Muslims is deeply worrying, despite most people claiming that they stand firm against extremists’ attempt to conflate their heinous actions with that of an entire religion,” Hope not Hate (HnH) chief executive Nick Lowles said of the finding’s of the charity’s Fear And Hope 2017 report.",Hate Crimes Targeting Mosques In UK More Than Doubles In A Year,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/hate-crimes-targeting-mosques-in-uk_uk_59db1893e4b046f5ad9935c2

Earlier this month, actor Deepika Padukone revealed that her past battles with depression have left her in constant fear of a relapse. This isn't the first time Padukone has spoken about mental health, but she's one of the few celebrities to openly discuss something that makes the majority of us squeamish. Mental health has always been a taboo topic in India, not to mention rife with misconceptions. For example, mental disorders are considered a largely urban phenomenon, despite the fact that they are equally prevalent in rural India. In fact, the situation in villages is far worse because mental disorders often go under the radar due to lower awareness and the lack of facilities to diagnose and treat them.

For some time now, India has been teetering on the brink of a mental health crisis. According to official estimates, 6-7% of India's population lives with minor to major mental health concerns (ranging from depression and anxiety, to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and others). The actual numbers could be much higher, suggests a report released by NIMHANS last year, which puts the figure of mental health sufferers at a whopping 13.7% of India's adult population. The report adds that nearly 11% of people over 18 are suffering from a mental disorder necessitating ""active interventions"".

Sadly, most of them never get it. Only about 1 in 10 Indians with mental health disorders receive treatment. With less than 4000 psychiatrists in the country, and very low budgetary allocation to mental healthcare, the lack of treatment options and institutional support for victims has taken a heavy toll, particularly in India's rural regions.

Suffering in silence

Rural India is home to nearly 70% of India's population, but has dismally low mental healthcare treatment rates compared to urban India. There are a number of causes for this, and the lack of health infrastructure is just one among them.

Even where facilities are available, a major challenge to mental healthcare delivery in rural India is the mindset. A potent mix of superstition, notions of family 'honour', and reliance on 'faith healers' makes it nearly impossible for rural patients with mental disorders to get the care they need. The fear of being socially ostracized makes people chary of publicly discussing the mental health issues of a friend or family member, let alone seeking help on the latter's behalf.

Low literacy and awareness levels in rural areas also prevent people from coming forward to claim government benefits or facilities for those suffering from mental illnesses. Therefore, despite the best intentions of the authorities, welfare schemes like disability cards, pensions or free or subsidised medicines often never reach the intended beneficiaries.

Crushing poverty also takes a toll on mental health in rural India. Most agricultural suicides in India's villages occur due to sustained economic stress and indebtedness, which drives farmers and farm workers into extreme despair. This despair also manifests itself in alcohol or drug abuse, which only tends to exacerbate the problem.

And finally, distances and the lack of proper roads also compound the problem, since they hinder access to treatment centres, which are often located in larger towns several miles away from the villages.

So what is the solution?

Rural mental healthcare in India needs a whole new, grassroots-focused approach. The government's National Mental Health Programme and National Rural Health Mission have laid the ground for interventions by various organisations working in the field of mental health. One of them is The Live, Love, Laugh Foundation, which has partnered with The Association of People with Disability (APD) and Minds Foundation to run and also expand existing rural programmes. These community health programmes build on the existing infrastructure to identify patients, get them access to mental health care, and rehabilitate them socially and economically.

Efforts like these prove that it is possible to close the mental healthcare gap in rural India by increasing awareness, improving social acceptance of illnesses, and delivering solutions directly to the beneficiaries. Supporting more such initiatives is critical for enabling millions of rural Indians to overcome the dark and debilitating effects of mental disorders, and get back on the road to living happy, productive and fulfilled lives.

Millions of people with mental disorders in rural India never get the help they need. The Live, Love, Laugh Foundation (TLLLF), started by actor Deepika Padukone, has partnered with The Association of People with Disability (APD) to take mental healthcare to rural India.

The beneficiaries of this programme have typically been economically disadvantaged rural or slum dwellers in the age group of 16-60 in Davangere district, Karnataka. The foundation has supported this programme since 2016-17; during which the reach spread from 2 talukas to 6 talukas and from 200 patients to 800 patients. In the past, TLLLF has undertaken other initiatives, namely a school awareness programme, 'You Are Not Alone', a doctor awareness programme, 'Together Against Depression', and India's first public awareness campaign on mental health, 'Dobara Poocho'.

The video posted by NDTV India shows how badly the man was attacked:

There have been several such incidents against people from African nations in the national capital region.

Students, belonging from African countries, were beaten up in several areas of NCR in March after residents of a Greater Noida society had alleged that a group of African student living there had kidnapped and drugged a teenager who later died.

A raging mob had beaten up helpless students in Greater Noida's Ansal Plaza mall.

The African Heads of Mission posted in New Delhi had strongly condemned the attacks and had called them ""xenophobic and racial in nature"".

A statement issued after a meeting of the envoys following the incident and dated March 31 said: ""As regards the recent unfortunate incident in Greater Noida, the African Heads of Mission strongly condemn the incident and express their deep concern and also take note that these reprehensible events both outstanding and unresolved cases against Africans, were not sufficiently condemned by the Indian authorities. The meeting unanimously agreed that those re-accumulated attacks against Africans are xenophobic and racial in nature.""",Nigerian National Brutally Assaulted In Delhi's Malviya Nagar On Suspicion Of Theft,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/09/nigerian-national-brutally-assaulted-in-delhis-malviya-nagar-on-suspicion-of-theft_a_23237072/

This week, Sophie Stevenson from Stoke-On-Trent, claimed she was the subject of an elaborate ‘pigging’ prank that saw her travel to Holland to meet former holiday fling, Dutch student Jesse Mateman, but he failed to meet her.

Although Mateman denies the claims, Stevenson told ITV’s ‘This Morning’, that the only explanation she ever received for his behaviour was a text message that said: “You’ve been pigged”, with two pig emojis.

For the uninitiated, pigging refers to the hideous practice (instigated by young men) of asking women out as a joke or a prank. The term coming from the fact that the woman in question is deemed to be less unattractive and/or overweight (hence the hugely witty reference to farmyard animals).

But make no mistake, this isn’t something that is officially recognised - there are no official statistics on this sort of casual dating behaviour to refer to.

Speaking to sex and relationship expert, Suzi Godson, she admitted that she hadn’t come across it herself, and neither had relationship charity, Relate.

HuffPost also found a lack of people willing to come forward to officially discuss their experiences of pigging with us. But just because it isn’t being talked about on record, it doesn’t mean it isn’t happening in the background - there are plenty of examples on social media and various forums.

Although it might sounds extreme, there is a wealth of evidence that suggests this is just the latest reincarnation of a dating practice that has long plagued women.

It has been defined on Urban Dictionary since at least 2004, lending weight to that evidence that this is no recent phenomenon.

Media reports of the so-called trend, also referred to as ‘fat girl rodeo’, seem to date back to 2013 but this has been around in popular culture for decades.

For any child of the nineties, you will be familiar with something very similar to pigging appearing in film plot line of ‘She’s All That’ (yes Freddie Prinze Junior we’re looking at you), which was released in 1999. Also released the same year, was ‘10 Things I Hate About You’ where Heath Ledger dates Julia Stiles because he is being paid by his friends.

Before last night I never even thought of myself as ugly. Now apparently I know what other people actually think about me...""

Reddit forums were sources of endless cases where people asked for help in dealing with this behaviour, although it is not explicitly referred to as pigging.

One example from 2015, sees a teen girl recall being asked to a high school dance by a boy from the basketball team, only to find out he was just taking part in a truth or dare game with his teammates.

“Before last night I never even thought of myself as ugly. I look in the mirror and see flaws but not some horribly ugly person who people would be embarrassed to take to a dance. Now apparently I know what other people actually think about me,” she said.

Writing in 2013, a woman said a man asked her out as an April Fool’s joke, even though he already had a girlfriend.

To which, another woman responded saying that she had been dating a man for six months, and considered him her ‘boyfriend’, before he broke up with her: “We went on lots of group dates where they could all make fun of me when I wasn’t paying attention. I wish I was making this up.”

There were over 200 comments on the post from 2013, with most agreeing they had similar experiences during their school years.

On Twitter people were also not shy about sharing their experiences of men they knew doing similar things.

There were even men themselves who were unashamed in admitted they had taken part in the game (although admittedly with some unintended consequences).

Even just the understanding of someone being in the same ‘league’ as their partner - a concept that all single people are cripplingly aware of - and use as a gauge for where to set their sights physically.

Even just a simple Google search brings up endless articles telling people how to date in their ‘own league’ and why they don’t have a hope in hell with people far more attractive than themselves.","Pigging Isn’t A New Trend, This Abusive Behaviour Has Long Happened To Single Women",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/pigging-is-the-awful-new-dating-term-but-does-it-really-happen_n_18256852.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Lighthizer gather for a trilateral meeting at Global Affairs on the final day of the third round of the NAFTA renegotiations in Ottawa, Ont., Sept. 27, 2017.

Trade is quickly dominating the public agenda in Canada.

Trade with the United States and Mexico, trade with Pacific Rim countries, trade with Europe, trade with China, trade in auto and auto parts, trade in dairy, trade in culture, trade in, well, everything, it seems.

Consider that Canada is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. and Mexico. The latest round in those talks opened this week.

As if that weren't enough, the Canadian government announced last week that it is seeking the public's input on reviving the currently dead Trans-Pacific Partnership. At the same time, the trade deal with Europe, referred to as CETA, is now partially in effect, and Canada is exploring a trade pact with China.

In short, trade deals seem to be breaking out everywhere, and it is vital the progressive left in Canada remain active and alert to all the threats that free trade agreements may pose.

For too long, trade deals have not really been about trade, but about restricting the role of government to set social policy or influence economic development

For too long, free trade deals have been written to serve the needs of corporations and wealthy investors, with fingers crossed that this would trickle down to help working people and their communities.

This has not happened. Instead, with free trade we have continually seen a race to the bottom that has pitted worker against worker. Making it easier and cheaper for firms to move products back and forth across borders hardens the stick corporations wield over its workers. This sort of ""free trade discipline"" is on full display right now at the Chevy Equinox facility in Ingersoll, Ont. — as General Motors arrogantly announced a ramping up of car production in Mexico in response to our striking members' call for greater job security. GM will meet North American market demand for Equinoxes simply by exporting them from Mexico instead of Canada, duty free under NAFTA. They can threaten Canadian workers with impunity.

The TPP, on the other hand, was never a good deal for Canada, but Canadians were told we needed to be part of the deal because we couldn't allow the U.S. to have privileged trade access to the region.

When the U.S. dropped out, the deal seemed to die. Now the federal government seems to have a new plan and is asking whether it should try reviving the TPP with the remaining countries.

Unifor sign saying Moving to Mexico, China. The sign is protesting General Motors moving CAMI Automotive assembly plant jobs out of Canada in Ingersoll on June 30, 2017.

In a word, no, we should not revive the TPP. Rather, Canada should focus its efforts on overhauling NAFTA, a chance to reset Canada's trade priorities and craft a new template for free trade agreements moving forward.

Unifor and other unions, as well as progressive NGOs, have put forward many bold ideas on how to fix NAFTA and begin to reform the rules of international trade. To their credit, the Trudeau government has staked important ground on social issues. Strong positions taken on labour rights, for instance, are positive steps. There's a lot rotten with trade agreements, however. As always, we can do better.

I have been fortunate to be part of the team advising the Canadian negotiators at the NAFTA talks. As a labour leader, it is not surprising that I am often asked to comment on labour issues.

All workers, wherever and whoever they are, deserve decent work. Trade deals have held back progress on worker's rights by giving too much power to big corporations and by establishing meaningless protections. This has to change in a big way.

None of this can be resolved by a special clause here or a chapter there, whether it's matters of labour rights, gender equity, the environment or indigenous rights. This commitment to make trade work for people instead of corporations needs to be part of the very fibre of modern trade deals.

For too long, trade deals have not really been about trade, but about restricting the role of government to set social policy or influence economic development. Having been close to NAFTA negotiations, I've seen just how entrenched this view is. To truly address the shortcomings of our trade deals and address the equity needs of our society, that must change.

As Canada steps up its trade agenda, we need all progressive voices, individuals and groups, to speak out and be prepared to stand up. Now is the time to make our voices heard and help ensure any future trade deals help build more equitable communities for all.

""Je n'ai jamais eu le sentiment d'avoir quitté [le premier plan politique], même s'il est vrai que je me suis moins exposé médiatiquement"", affirme au Figaro l'élu breton, qui se dit ""libre de parler à nouveau de l'avenir de notre pays"".

Pour autant, l'intéressé assure qu'il ne nourrit pas d'ambitions ministérielles. ""À l'heure actuelle, j'ai le sentiment de servir à la fois mon pays et le projet porté par le président de la République. Je ne cours après rien"", jure-t-il, précisant également qu'il ne se porte pas candidat à la présidence d'En Marche.

Projet Montréal réplique que les taux d'inoccupation des locaux ont drastiquement chuté depuis les crises des dernières années. Qui, de Denis Coderre ou Luc Ferrandez, attire le mieux les commerçants? Qui les fait fuir?

Vendredi, le maire Coderre a convoqué les médias devant un local vide de la rue Saint-Denis, durement affectée par des travaux l'an dernier. Il accuse les élus de Projet Montréal – seul parti aux commandes de l'arrondissement depuis 2009 – de négliger l'artère.

«Regardez la rue Saint-Denis: aucune action de l'administration de Projet Montréal n'est venue régler les enjeux que vit cette importante artère commerciale», lance-t-il, flanqué entre autres de son candidat à la mairie, le jeune entrepreneur Zack Macklovitch.

En déambulant sur la rue, on voit de nombreuses affiches «À louer». Le HuffPost Québec en a dénombré 42 entre Sherbrooke et Gilford. Selon la Société de développement commercial (SDC) Rue Saint-Denis, le taux d'inoccupation atteint 15,5%.

Dans le Quartier Latin, au cœur de l'arrondissement Ville-Marie où règne Denis Coderre, ce taux varie entre 7 et 8%.

Qui blâmer?

M. Coderre voit là un «effet Ferrandez». Or, Luc Ferrandez, maire du Plateau, peut-il être blâmé pour les locaux vides? Non, répond la directrice générale de la SDC, Caroline Tessier. Le taux d'inoccupation est d'ailleurs en baisse depuis la fin des travaux de réfection des infrastructures souterraines, après un sommet de plus de 27% l'an dernier.

«Un des facteurs qui expliquent le retour des commerçants, c'est la fin des travaux. Il n'y a plus de chantiers sur Saint-Denis et les entrepreneurs sont certains de ne pas revivre ce qui s'est passé l'an dernier», affirme Mme Tessier.

Ces travaux ont été commandés par la ville-centre et non par l'arrondissement. Les commerçants avaient réclamé une réduction du taux de taxes pendant la durée du chantier, mais le maire Coderre a répondu que la loi ne lui permettait pas d'appliquer une telle mesure.

La donne a changé avec le statut de métropole et M. Coderre a promis de compenser les pertes financières dues aux grands travaux.

Selon Mme Tessier, le taux de taxation est d'ailleurs le plus grand obstacle des commerçants. Ces taxes sont principalement contrôlées par la ville-centre.

M. Ferrandez ne s'en tire pas indemne pour autant. Selon Mme Tessier, la rue Saint-Denis souffre de règles qui ne s'appliquent pas aux autres artères.

«Les autres artères du Plateau n'ont pas des règles aussi restrictives pour les permis d'alcool. Sur Saint-Denis, on ne peut qu'avoir un permis par 150 mètres. Sur Mont-Royal et Saint-Laurent, c'est un permis par 50 mètres», déplore-t-elle.

Valérie Plante, chef de Projet Montréal, réplique que toutes les artères de tous les arrondissements ont des règles distinctes selon leur vocation, leur histoire, leur architecture, etc.

Mieux sur le Plateau ou dans Ville-Marie?

Ailleurs sur le Plateau, les choses vont plutôt bien, souligne Mme Plante. Sur le boulevard Saint-Laurent, le taux d'inoccupation est de 7% après avoir vécu des années d'enfer, encore une fois à cause de travaux d'infrastructure successifs. Sur l'avenue du Mont-Royal, c'est 6%.

Sur la toute petite rue Prince-Arthur, désertée par les restaurants grecs au cours des dernières années, un début de relance est entamé. On y compte plusieurs bars et restaurants ouverts depuis moins d'un an.

«Allez voir les locaux inoccupés sur Saint-Laurent au nord et au sud de Sherbrooke», lance Mme Plante en conférence de presse.

Vérification faite, c'est moins les locaux vides que les trous béants laissés par les travaux de construction ou de rénovation qui marquent le boulevard Saint-Laurent dans Ville-Marie.

Ailleurs dans Ville-Marie, la situation est difficile à évaluer. La SDC du Village n'a pas rappelé le HuffPost Québec et Destination Centre-Ville, qui gère plusieurs artères dont la rue Sainte-Catherine, a refusé de répondre à nos questions.

Un rapport produit en 2014 par la firme CBRE note que la rue Sainte-Catherine avait des taux d'inoccupation allant de 5% entre Guy et University (aujourd'hui Robert-Bourassa) à 13% ou même 17% dans les tronçons situés immédiatement à l'ouest et à l'est. À la même époque, les artères commerciales du Plateau affichaient entre 4% (Saint-Laurent et Mont-Royal) et 10% (Saint-Denis).

Dans le Quartier latin, où le taux est demeuré bas au fil des années sauf pendant la grève étudiante de 2012, on affirme bénéficier d'une situation particulière à cause de la présence continue d'étudiants l'hiver et de festivals l'été. La flexibilité de la réglementation serait aussi un atout.","Commerces: qui est le champion, qui est le cancre?",http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/10/13/commerces-qui-est-le-champion-qui-est-le-cancre_a_23243043/

The winners of the Nikon Small Worlds Photography Competition were announced recently, and some of the results are absolutely stunning.

Over 2,000 entries from 88 countries were received, and the judges had to narrow that down to just a few key winners. The competition, which is in its 43rd year, celebrates the best images captured with a microscope annually.

Here are some of the most spectacular:

1. The eye of a Daddy Longlegs

This picture placed 12th in the Nikon Small World Photography Competition 2017. It was taken by Charles Krebs, of Charles Krebs Photography from Issaquah, Washington, USA. The photo shows the eye of an Opiliones (or Daddy Longlegs) and uses reflected light and image stacking to get a photo that is 20x zoomed.

2. The head of a tapeworm

At a spectacular 200x zoom, this image by Teresa Zgoda of Rochester Institude of Technology shows the everted scolex of a tapeworm (or Taenia Solium). The photo came 4th in the competition.

3. The seed head of a plant

This photo shows the seed head of a plant that is just flowering, known as a Senecio Vulgaris. The shot was captured by Dr. Havi Sarfaty of Eyecare Clinic, and it landed the photographer 2nd place in the Small World competition. It uses a technique called stereomicroscopy, which employs a microscope with two eyepieces - letting the photographer grab a shot that has a lot more contrast and perception of depth.

4. Mould on a tomato

This image, by Dean Lerman of Netanya, Israel, is a close-up of mould growing on a tomato. It's zoomed in 3.9x, and came 5th in the Nikon Small World Photography Competition.

5. The face of a Jumping Spider

Taken in Istanbul, Turkey, this picture by Emre Can Alagoz shows the face of a Jumping Spider in insane detail. In fact - if you look closely, you can even see the lens of the camera reflected in each eye.

6. The minerals Nsutite and Cacoxenite

Emilio Carabajal Márquez, Madrid, Spain, Nikon Small Worlds Photography Competition

At 5x zoom, this photo by Emilio Carabajal Marquez captures the minerals Nsutite and Cacoxenite in a stunning natural formation. It was noted as an Image of Distinction in the Nikon Small Worlds Photography Competition.

7. An Orchard Cuckoo Bee

Der Vorwurf: Einkommensschwache Deutsche werden im Stich gelassen

Jetzt meldet sich der Mieterbund zu Wort - mit einer klaren Ansage

Es ist nur ein Ausschnitt einer Zeitungsseite, aber er wird gerade tausendfach von Rechten im Netz geteilt.

Darauf zu sehen sind vier Wohnungsgesuche von Flüchtlingshelfern für syrische Familien, außerdem eine Anzeige einer alleinerziehenden Mutter.

Die Anzeige wurde schon im Frühjahr in der ""Südwestpresse"" geschaltet, sorgt allerdings jetzt erst für Aufregung.

Flüchtlinge erschwerten ""Normalbürgern"" die Wohnungssuche, weil deren Miete ""nicht vom Amt"" komme, schreibt etwa die neurechte Bloggerin Anabel Schunke auf Facebook. Der hier lebende Bürger sei der Dumme.

""Ich kann den Ärger verstehen""

Solche Kommentare landeten auch bei den Flüchtlingshelfern, die in der Anzeige aufgeführt sind. Im Umlauf ist der Ausschnitt nämlich ohne geschwärzte Namen, Telefonnummern und Mailadressen.

Einer* sagte im Gespräch mit der HuffPost: ""In einem Fall wurde mir von einem Anrufer gesagt, dass er es ekelhaft fände, was ich mache. Meine Antwort war: Ich finde es ekelhaft, was Sie machen. Und dann habe ich aufgelegt.""

Eine* andere sagte: ""Ich kann den Ärger verstehen. Nicht nur Flüchtlinge, sondern viele andere in Deutschland haben Hilfebedarf bei der Wohnungssuche. Es gibt viel Not, und je mehr Leute sich in irgendeiner Weise für andere stark machen und das in vielen Bereichen, nur dann wird die Not geringer.""

Falscher Eindruck

In den Kommentaren auf Facebook jedoch soll der Eindruck erweckt werden, dass Deutsche, die es ohnehin schwer auf dem hartumkämpften Wohnungsmarkt haben, bei ihrer Suche alleine gelassen werden.

Die rechten Nutzer glauben, dass deutsche Staatsbürger chancenlos um Wohnungen konkurrieren würden und am Ende gar auf der Straße landen könnten, während der Flüchtling mit seiner Familie im Warmen sitze.

Was ist dran an diesen Vorwürfen?

Der Mieterbund jedenfalls sieht das Problem der Wohnungsnot nicht bei den Flüchtlingen - sondern darin, dass n den vergangenen Jahren in Deutschland viel zu wenige Wohnungen gebaut wurden.

In Deutschland fehlen rund eine Million Wohnungen

""In den letzten Jahren ist viel zu wenig neu gebaut worden, insbesondere in Städten ist die Nachfrage nach Wohnungen deutlich höher als das Angebot"", sagt Ulrich Ropertz, Geschäftsführer des Deutschen Mieterbundes, der HuffPost.

400.000 neue Wohnungen müssten pro Jahr gebaut werden, rechnet Ropertz vor. Davon mindestens 80.000 Sozialwohnungen. Nach Wohnungen würden unter den Asylbewerbern eigentlich nur die anerkannten Flüchtlinge suchen. ""2017 dürften es 140.000 sein"", sagt Ropertz.

Zum Vergleich: Studienanfänger, die ebenfalls in vielen Fällen nach einer Wohnung suchen, gab es in diesem Studienjahr 507.779. Flüchtlinge leisten so nur ein kleinen Beitrag zu einem großen strukturellen Problem.

In Deutschland fehlten zurzeit rund eine Million Wohnungen – ein Fehlbestand, der sich über Jahre aufgebaut habe und jetzt Schritt für Schritt abgebaut werden müsse.

Aber haben Flüchtlinge tatsächlich einen Vorteil, weil ihre Mietzahlung vom Amt gesichert ist?

Ropertz findet das ""zweifelhaft"". Zumindest habe noch nie jemand behauptet, dass es ein Vorteil auf dem Wohnungsmarkt sei, ALG-II-Bezieher zu sein. ""Auch hier übernimmt die Stadt die Wohnkosten zu 100 Prozent"", sagt Ropertz.

""Flüchtlinge dürften es ausgesprochen schwer haben""

Mehr noch: ""Tatsächlich dürften es Flüchtlinge auf dem Wohnungsmarkt ausgesprochen schwer haben"", sagt Ropertz.

Wie alle einkommensschwächeren Personen hätten sie Probleme, eine Wohnung zu finden. ""Hinzu kommen auch Vorurteile potenzieller Vermieter und Sprachschwierigkeiten.""

Mein Name ist Katarina und ich bin die Mutter der niedlichen Zwillinge und der tollen großen Schwester, die Sie letztens im Zoo angesprochen haben. Eine Sache wollte ich Ihnen noch unbedingt sagen, aber sie haben mich nicht zu Wort kommen lassen.

Sie sprachen mich einfach an, obwohl Sie sahen, dass ich mit meinem Mann und den Kindern im Gespräch war. Dies war Ihnen augenscheinlich nicht bewusst, als sie uns mitten im Satz unterbrachen und fragen, ob die Zwillinge denn eine natürliche Geburt gewesen wären. (Nein, wobei Geburt ist Geburt finde ich, schmerzlos ist das auch nicht.)

""Natürlich war sie das!"" implizierten Sie sofort und sprachen ohne Punkt und Komma weiter. Wie schmerzhaft es denn genau gewesen wäre, wie lange die Geburt gedauert habe und ob denn alles gut gegangen sei.

Ehrlich gesagt konnten wir es gar nicht fassen

Mein Mann und ich starrten verlegen uns und neben uns das Schild ""Großer Rundgang"" an. Wir versuchten, uns freundlich zu verabschieden, aber da hatten Sie schon die Hände in unseren Kinderwagen verkrallt und plapperten ungeniert weiter. Ob es denn Geburtsverletzungen gab und ob die Kinder Frühchen gewesen wären.

Ehrlich gesagt konnten wir es gar nicht fassen. Sie wurden von Minute zu Minute distanzloser und selbst als wir langsam den Kinderwagen versuchten wegzurollen, krampften sich ihre Finger nur noch fester um den Griff.

Ich verstehe wirklich, dass Sie alle Fragen haben.

Aber dann fragen Sie Ihren Partner oder den Brockhaus/Wikipedia/ihren Allgemeinmediziner oder schauen Sie in die ""Apotheken Umschau"". Weder ich noch mein Mann MÖCHTEN uns mit Ihnen zwischen Tiergehegen im Zoo, im Supermarkt neben Margarine und KitKat oder in einer Bank zwischen Anzugträgern über Details über unsere Familienplanung im weitesten Sinne und Geburtsvorgänge im speziellen unterhalten. Es greift furchtbar ins Privatleben ein und hinterlässt einen ein bisschen überfahren und nackt.

vielleicht wird das ganze für Sie nachvollziehbar, wenn ich Ihnen noch ein paar Fragen stelle:

Haben Sie eigentlich Probleme mit Ihrer Blase? Schaffen Sie es noch immer bis zur Toilette, oder geht auch ab und zu was daneben? Bestimmt, oder? Wie ärgerlich.

Aber Sie tragen doch bestimmt Inkontinenzeinlagen? Vielleicht sind es auch schon Windeln. Welche Marke können Sie denn da empfehlen? Ist der Mann dort hinten Ihrer? Ja?

Wie, auf die Fragen wollen Sie gar nicht antworten?

Sagen Sie mal, Sie wirken noch recht fit, haben Sie und ihr Mann noch manchmal... na Sie wissen schon? Ist das nicht merkwürdig, nach so vielen Jahren?

Ja, wir stehen mitten in einem belebten Zoo am Nachmittag, wieso schauen Sie sich denn so um? Ist doch völlig in Ordnung, sowas zu fragen.

Wissen Sie, ich bin Mutter und nicht meine Kinder sondern andere Menschen sorgen dafür, dass meine Schamgrenze drastisch gesunken ist. Wie, auf die Fragen wollen Sie gar nicht antworten? Zu privat sagen Sie?

Es müsse in Deutschland möglich sein, Vorschläge seriös zu diskutieren

Der Vorschlag von CDU-Innenminister Thomas de Maizière, in Gegenden mit vielen Muslimen auch muslimische Feiertage einzuführen, stößt bei den Sozialdemokraten auf offene Ohren. ""Man muss über den Vorschlag nachdenken"", sagte SPD-Chef Martin Schulz am Samstag der Deutschen Presse-Agentur.

Schulz geht es dabei offenbar weniger um den konkreten Vorschlag, als um eine faire Debatte um die Idee.

""Ich hab vor allen Dingen zur Kenntnis genommen, in welcher Art und Weise sofort gegen den Herrn de Maizière aus seinen eigenen Reihen losgekoffert wird"", sagte der SPD-Chef.

""Wo es Moslems gibt, kann man darüber nachdenken""

De Maizière hatte sich bei einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung in Wolfenbüttel offen gezeigt, in bestimmten Regionen Deutschlands muslimische Feiertage einzuführen.

Allerheiligen sei auch nur dort Feiertag, wo viele Katholiken lebten, erklärte er. ""Wo es viele Moslems gibt, warum kann man nicht auch mal über einen muslimischen Feiertag nachdenken.""

Er war dafür aus den Reihen der Union heftig kritisiert worden.

CDU-Innenexperte Wolfgang Bosbach etwa sagte der ""Passauer Neuen Presse"": ""Wir haben eine christlich-jüdische religiöse Prägung, keine islamische. Daher verstehe ich auch nicht, warum wir jetzt diese Debatte führen.""

Weiter sagte der ehemalige Bundestagsabgeordnete: ""Ich würde etwas anderes thematisieren: Wann haben endlich Christen in allen islamischen Ländern die gleiche Religionsfreiheit wie die Muslime bei uns?""

CSU-Mann Stephan Mayer betonte in der Diskussion ebenfalls die ""christliche Tradition"" Deutschlands.

Das Video oben zeigt, wie ihr das ZDF-Programm im Internet sehen könnt

Ironman-WM im Live-Stream: Auf Hawaii stellen sich Sportler aus den unterschiedlichsten Ländern dem härtesten Triathlon. Acht Stunden, vielleicht sogar weniger, vielleicht ein bisschen mehr. Immer am Limit und darüber.

Jan Frodeno ist bereit für ein epochales Rennen. Selbst eine Entscheidung auf den letzten Metern nach 3,8 Kilometern Schwimmen, 180,2 Kilometern Radfahren und 42,195 Kilometern Laufen könnte den Weltmeister von 2015 und 2016 nicht überraschen. 2017 will Frodeno den Hattrick perfekt machen, womöglich sogar in unter acht Stunden, was noch keinen auf Hawaii bisher gelang.

Sein erster Widersacher ist Sebastian Kienle, WM-Zweiter vor einem Jahr und Weltmeister 2014. Da gibt es aber auch einen Patrick Lange, den WM-Dritten von 2016 mit der Marathon-Rekordzeit von 2:39,45 Stunden.

Deutsche unter sich? Keineswegs. Frodeno und alle anderen rechnen auch mit Lionel Sanders. Kanadier und so extrem wie ein brutal schwerer Ironman mit Schwimmen im Pazifik, Radfahren und Laufen entlang von Lavafeldern mit dem gefürchteten Mumuku (heftige böige Winde) bei glühender Hitze in Romantik-Paradies Hawaii.

Drogen, Alkohol, kurz vorm Suizidversuch. Der 29-Jährige hat all das hinter sich gelassen, nun zählt er auch dank eigenwilliger Indoor-Trainingsmethoden zu einem der großen Herausforderer Frodenos.

Gewinnen wird keiner den Ironman auf Hawaii auf den ersten 3,8 Kilometern, vorentscheiden kann sich ein Rennen aber schon dort. Denn danach werden die starken Radfahrer, aber eher schwächeren Schwimmer wie Kienle oder Sanders, versuchen, davonzufahren oder das Tempo so hoch zu halten, dass der Konkurrenz beim Laufen die Kraft ausgeht. Vor einem Jahr fuhr keiner schneller als Boris Stein, am Ende landete der 32-Jährige auf Platz sieben.

Gilbert Carrasquillo via Getty Images Ronan Farrow had reportedly been told by NBC News executives that he didn’t have enough reporting to go on air with his Harvey Weinstein story.
But Farrow was told by multiple NBC News executives and producers that the reporting and interviews he had conducted weren’t sufficient for a televised story.
By July, Farrow was ready with a bombshell story about Weinstein that included on-camera interviews with accusers and interviews with four female and male former Miramax and Weinstein Co. executives.
NBC insiders have told HuffPost that this has led some employees to wonder if this was an internal talking point that NBC executives were using to justify the lack of coverage.","In mid-August, Ronan Farrow, an NBC News contributor, had secured an interview with a woman who was willing to appear on camera, in silhouette, her identity concealed, and say Harvey Weinstein had raped her, according to four people with close knowledge of the reporting. It was a pivotal moment in a testy, months-long process of reporting a story that had bedeviled a generation of media and Hollywood reporters.

Farrow had a lot of material already. In March, he had acquired a damning and much-coveted audio recording in which Weinstein admits to having groped an Italian model. He had interviews with former executives and assistants who’d worked closely with Weinstein who spoke about the culture of harassment and abuse he perpetrated. And now he had someone ready to accuse Weinstein of rape, on camera.

But at that moment Farrow was also caught in the pincers of an NBC News edict. He had been told by executives at NBC News that he didn’t have enough reporting to go on air with his Weinstein story, according to four sources, and he had been told by the network to stop reporting on it. NBC tried to put a stop to the interview with the woman accusing Weinstein of rape. The network insisted he not use an NBC News crew for the interview, and neither was he to mention his NBC News affiliation. And so that was how Ronan Farrow wound up paying out of his own pocket for a camera crew to film an interview.

As a project for NBC News, Farrow’s story was effectively dead. Later that month, he received permission to take his reporting to another news organization. The story that resulted, published Tuesday by The New Yorker, was a blockbuster: multiple women accusing Weinstein of rape and other sexual misconduct, accompanied by the audio of Weinstein admitting to sexual assault.

Jacopo Raule via Getty Images An audio of Harvey Weinstein arguing with a young model at a hotel was included with The New Yorker article.

At an NBC News town hall Wednesday, NBC News President Noah Oppenheim said: “The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us. We were on that long list of places that chased this thing, tried to nail it, but weren’t ultimately the ones who broke it.”

Then he struck a rueful tone, suggesting that the NBC iteration of the story had died of natural causes. “We reached a point over the summer where we, as an organization, didn’t feel that we had all the elements that we needed to air,” he said.

Yet interviews with 12 people inside and outside NBC News with direct knowledge of the reporting behind Farrow’s story suggest a different cause of death. All of the sources who spoke to HuffPost asked not to be named, either because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media about the story or because they were fearful of retribution from NBC News executives. These sources detailed a months-long struggle within NBC News during which Oppenheim and other executives slow-walked Farrow’s story, crippling it with their qualms and irresolution.

Toward the end, the concerns seemed to take on a personal tone, and it became difficult to tell where the Weinstein team’s attempts to discredit the story left off and NBC News’ editorial forbearance began. According to multiple sources inside and outside of NBC News who worked on the aborted story, Oppenheim related to Farrow what Weinstein’s lawyers had said in complaint to NBC: that Farrow had a conflict of interest because Weinstein had helped revive the career of Farrow’s estranged father, director Woody Allen. Weinstein’s representatives would later use a similar line of attack when the story landed at The New Yorker. The magazine, known for its rigorous vetting process, saw no conflict of interest.

Oppenheim’s statement and the pushback that NBC News has been sharing on background to reporters conflicts significantly with the accounts of people who worked on the story inside NBC News and elsewhere, according to several sources with close knowledge of the reporting.

Farrow, who began reporting the story in January and by late July had interviewed at least eight women, some on the record, had been told twice that the story was “reportable,” meaning it had passed the network’s stringent fact checking and legal process, according to four people with detailed knowledge of the process. A separate NBC investigative journalist was also asked to re-report his work, and her review raised no flags, these people said.

Gilbert Carrasquillo via Getty Images Ronan Farrow had reportedly been told by NBC News executives that he didn’t have enough reporting to go on air with his Harvey Weinstein story.

Farrow scored his first major reporting coup in January: an on-camera interview with actress Rose McGowan during which she accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her when she was 23 years old. The Times has reported that McGowan settled her sexual assault claim with Weinstein for $100,000 in 1997. Ultimately, McGowan withdrew her permission for NBC News to use the footage after she’d received legal threats from Weinstein.

In March, Farrow obtained audio in which Weinstein admits to having sexually assaulted Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez. The audio was recorded a day after Gutierrez had gone to the New York Police Department and told officers that Weinstein had groped her breasts and attempted to put a hand up her skirt.

The NYPD fitted Gutierrez with a wire, and she recorded her conversation with Weinstein at the Tribeca Grand Hotel in New York.

Weinstein is heard on the recording pressuring Gutierrez to join him in his hotel room, and toward the end of the tense exchange he admits he’d sexually assaulted her. When Gutierrez asked Weinstein why he had groped her breasts the day before, he answered, “Oh, please, I’m sorry, just come on in,” and “I’m used to that. Come on. Please.”

Gutierrez asked, “You’re used to that?”

“Yes,” Weinstein said, adding, “I won’t do it again.”

For two years, reporters from numerous publications had been attempting to obtain that damning audio. To many publications, the audio on its own would have merited a stand-alone news story. And even if the network had deemed it unworthy of television, NBC News could have published the story online, which Farrow, along with Rich McHugh, an NBC News investigative producer, also pursued. In fact, Farrow was said to be eager to get some of their reporting out in hopes that it would break the dam and other sources would come forward.

By April, NBC News had two big scoops in its pocket: an on-record interview with McGowan and the explosive audio of Weinstein admitting to sexual assault. But Farrow was told by multiple NBC News executives and producers that the reporting and interviews he had conducted weren’t sufficient for a televised story. According to four sources, Farrow and McHugh also prepared a lengthy text story to run on the NBC News website, but Farrow was told it wouldn’t run.

By July, Farrow was ready with a bombshell story about Weinstein that included on-camera interviews with accusers and interviews with four female and male former Miramax and Weinstein Co. executives.

At this point, Farrow and McHugh were ready to move forward with the story but were told by NBC executives that the story had to go up to NBC News Chairman Andy Lack for approval and that the story would be under review by Steve Burke, executive vice president of Comcast and president and CEO of NBCUniversal, and his office. Communication reviewed by HuffPost confirms that this message was communicated to Farrow, McHugh and others, but HuffPost cannot independently confirm that Burke reviewed the story. Three NBC News staffers that spoke to HuffPost said that they had never heard of Burke’s office needing to review a story and said it was highly unusual. An NBC Universal spokeswoman denied that Burke ever reviewed the story and said that he does not interfere in NBC News editorial decisions.

In August, according to four sources familiar with the conversations, Farrow was repeatedly told by the network that he didn’t have enough reporting done to go to air but that he should also stop reporting on Weinstein’s story, putting him in an untenable position.

One of the people Farrow had interviewed on camera for the story was veteran media reporter Ken Auletta. Earlier in his career, Auletta had tried to break the story of Weinstein’s predations. According to two sources familiar with the interview, and as reported in slightly different form by the Daily Beast’s Lloyd Grove, Auletta, after having reviewed Farrow’s reporting, said on camera something along the lines of, “If NBC News sits on this evidence Ronan has, it is a black eye for the organization and a huge scandal.”

Farrow ultimately brought his reporting to The New Yorker, which published his blockbuster account on Monday after putting his piece through its gauntlet of editors and fact checkers.

“Ronan Farrow, who came to us about two months ago, had very serious reporting already accomplished,” said David Remnick, editor in chief of The New Yorker. “And with extremely hard work, and with work with a lot of my colleagues here at The New Yorker, he deepened the piece and made it publishable. And it is something that exemplified great investigative journalism.”

NBC had initially been reticent about reporting on other news outlets’ stories on Weinstein as well. Last Thursday, when The New York Times first broke the story of Weinstein’s long history of alleged sexual abuse, both CBS and ABC carried the Weinstein story on their evening broadcasts. But NBC was conspicuously absent among its competitors and didn’t air a Weinstein piece that evening on “NBC Nightly News,” despite having had seven hours to put together a story (the Times article was published at 11 a.m. EDT).

Some NBC sources said that the broadcast was jam-packed with breaking news, including reporting on the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting and the NBC News report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called President Donald Trump a “moron.” But the broadcast also had room for a segment on NFL player Cam Newton’s sexist remarks to a female reporter and a segment about Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees.

Two sources familiar with the production told HuffPost that Oppenheim made the final decision not to include a Weinstein story in the broadcast, telling staff that Weinstein wasn’t a nationally recognizable figure. That weekend, when “Saturday Night Live” executive producer Lorne Michaels was criticized for not including any Weinstein jokes, he told The Daily Mail that “it’s a New York thing,” suggesting something similar. NBC insiders have told HuffPost that this has led some employees to wonder if this was an internal talking point that NBC executives were using to justify the lack of coverage.

Slaven Vlasic via Getty Images NBC News President Noah Oppenheim said at a town hall: “The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us.""

The next morning, NBC was, once again, bested by its competitors when ABC’s “Good Morning America” ran a segment that was 10 minutes long and CBS’ “This Morning” ran a five-minute segment. NBC’s “Today” show simply had anchor Craig Melvin read off a teleprompter part of a story that largely included Weinstein’s pushback as opposed to the detailed allegations made in the Times.

The news that NBC had the audio of Weinstein admitting to sexual assault shocked and frustrated NBC News employees who spoke to HuffPost, saying that the mood in the newsroom had grown dark over the missed opportunity to break a big story.

It reminded several people who spoke to HuffPost of another time that NBC lost the chance to break a story involving a man admitting to alleged sexual misconduct.

In October 2016, NBC News had the now infamous “Access Hollywood” tape of Trump saying he liked to grab women “by the pussy.” While the footage was owned by NBC, it was ultimately published by The Washington Post.",How Top NBC Executives Quashed The Bombshell Harvey Weinstein Story,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/10/11/nbc-harvey-weinstein_n_18241592.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&ir=UK

Accusing someone ― especially a higher-up at work ― of sexual abuse is not easy.","Actress and director Asia Argento, one of more than 20 women who have spoken out about their experiences, has had a fierce defender in her camp: Boyfriend Anthony Bourdain.

“I am proud and honored to know you,” the celebrity chef tweeted on Tuesday, alongside a link to The New Yorker exposé Argento was interviewed for. “You just did the hardest thing in the world.”

.@AsiaArgento I am proud and honored to know you. You just did the hardest thing in the world. https://t.co/i2Lsb6h5vU — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) October 10, 2017

Bourdain’s support of Argento highlights an important, but rarely discussed side of sexual assault and harassment: How spouses and partners of victims respond and support their significant others.

While there’s no “right” way to respond, there are things you can do that are helpful rather than hindering. Below, therapists and experts in sexual abuse share seven tips.

1. Validate their experiences.

Many abuse survivors doubt the severity of what happened to them or feel like they’re somehow to blame because of what their abuser told them or made them feel in the aftermath of the incident.

As their partner, your job is to listen, be in their corner and remind them that you believe them, 100 percent, said Virginia Gilbert, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles, California.

“Survivors’ self-doubt and shame grows exponentially if their family or culture colludes with abusers ― if everyone around the survivor normalizes and enables abuse,” she said. “The first step in helping your partner heal is to validate their experience by calling out abuse.”

That means talking about what happened in matter-of-fact terms, Gilbert said: “You were raped;” “People knew what was happening to you and didn’t stop it;” “You were in a vulnerable position and were afraid of the consequences if you spoke up.”

That kind of directness can help clear up any self-doubt your partner may be experiencing in the wake of the abuse.

2. Listen without interrupting and reacting.

The revelation will very likely leave you feeling shaken up. While it’s natural to feel protective and react with anger, remind yourself to stay calm. The last thing your partner needs is to feel like they need to support you emotionally now instead, said Martha Lee, a Singapore-based clinical sexologist and relationship coach.

“It’s very important that they feel heard and that there’s space for them to articulate what happened and how they feel,” she told HuffPost. “You don’t want your reaction to make it about you because that can short-circuit their processing and healing process. Just listen. Sometimes, just telling yourself, ‘this is not about me’ can help.”

3. Avoid downplaying the harassment.

Don’t try to downplay what happened or worse, suggest your partner could have done something differently to avoid the situation, said Laura Palumbo, the communications director at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

“You may think you’re trying to help by saying, ‘I’m sure he didn’t mean it like that,’ but instead, it just makes them question their perceptions or feel silly for sharing. It’s better to say supportive things like, ’I believe you’ or ‘You did nothing wrong and I am here for you.’”

4. Remind them that they have options.

Sexual assault and harassment disempowers victims and emboldens abusers. That’s why it’s so important to remind your partner that they’re not powerless, said Sandra Henriquez, the CEO of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault.

“If a physical assault occurred within the last 72 hours, contact a local sexual assault agency for guidance and advocacy in dealing with hospitals and law enforcement,” she said. “Remind your S.O. that there are avenues for redress that are available when they feel ready and able to explore those options.”

And regardless of when the assault happened, free and confidential counseling is always available through local rape crisis centers. For a full list of crisis centers and hotlines for sexual assault survivors, head here.

5. Respect their decisions without pushback.

Accusing someone ― especially a higher-up at work ― of sexual abuse is not easy. Recognize the difficulty your partner may feel in bringing charges or coming forward, said Janet Brito, a psychologist and sex therapist at the Center for Sexual and Reproductive Health in Honolulu, Hawaii

“There could be apprehension since it’s not uncommon for others to deny the victim’s experiences or minimize it,” she said. “Ask your S.O. what you can do to make them feel supported and respect the choices they make along the way. The goal is to limit your opinions about what you think is best for them and not pressure them.”

6. If you feel like you’re in over your head, say something.

Your support likely means the world to your partner. That said, don’t be afraid to say something if you feel overwhelmed by the situation, said Kurt Smith, a therapist who works with men and women at Guy Stuff Counseling & Coaching.

“Because of how traumatizing it can be to hear these details, sometimes, it’s best to limit how much you try to help and leave it to trained mental health specialists who have worked with sexual abuse survivors,” he told HuffPost.

You can be supportive by listening to your partner and encouraging them to speak with a professional in a non-pressuring way.

“It’s ultimately their call but encourage them to find a therapist to speak with to get the help and support they need,” Smith said. “The common response is to bury the memories and pain and move on with life. But that’s a mistake because oftentimes, the trauma doesn’t go away and negatively impacts survivors in ways they don’t fully recognize until they address it with a professional.”

7. Be patient.

Farage has hinted at another potential comeback, and it could well prove to be that Ukip's survival is dependent on the return of their biggest beast. Journalist and political scientist

This Vote Will Go Down In History As 'The Brexit Election' We've heard many times that 'Brexit means Brexit' but with negotiations with the EU scheduled to start just 11 days after the vote, in the next two weeks we should all be clearer on what Brexit really means. Head of Birmingham City University's Centre for Brexit Studies.

Letter To Ukip Voters: Make History Once More On Thursday, take one last swipe at the elites - Re-Brexit this country - take back the power they stole from you and prove - yet again - that the establishment will not dictate the course of this country and it is we - the people - who will determine its future. On June 8th, make history once more - break the establishment, vote Labour - and change this country forever. Politics. Campaigns. Analysis.

I Want The Lib Dems To Be Kingmakers, Not EU Lobbyists The perception of a single issue has caused sliding polls for the SNP and the desecration of UKIP as they have become assimilated into the Conservatives. Lib Dem campaigner in Cambridge, bodyman for Susan van de Ven. Toby Ziegler wannabe.

Six Policies In Ukip's Manifesto That Are Actually Pretty Good (And One That Was Mysteriously Dropped) If you can get past the headlines and random mentions of Vitamin D deficiency in a policy about cultural integration, Ukip's manifesto contains a few gems which even the most ardent left-winger would struggle to argue with. UKIP MEP for the North East of England

Forget The 'Progressive Alliance', A UKIP-Conservative Alliance Is Already Happening Clearly this isn't a formal 'alliance' like the SDP-Liberal Alliance or other such electoral pacts, and a lot of it comes down to the simple fact that UKIP can't muster the candidate numbers to fight every seat. But given Theresa May's rhetoric since becoming Prime Minister, pitching to UKIP voters, it's clear why UKIP would have little reason to oppose the Conservatives.

I Will Not Stop Challenging Ukip's Racism This call has nothing to do with defending women's rights. It has everything to do with UKIP demonising the Muslim community, just like in France last year when politicians campaigned to ban the Birkini. Why should anyone have the right to tell Muslim women what to wear? UKIP and their kind are constantly targeting people who just want to get on with their lives. It shows the nature of their party, it shows their racism. Student and Stand Up To Racism campaigner.

Burka Ban Or The Start Of A UK Muslim Ban? Most people cannot comprehend the magnitude of telling someone to remove a religious article of clothing. The burka is not just a piece of cloth. It is a part of an identity. Worn with the understanding of the creed and for the love of religion. There is a spiritual and emotional connection. By having a ban implemented, it will create further barriers preventing the interaction between the wider social group and stigmatising the minority. Writer, Reader, Tea drinker

Brexit, The NHS And The Question Of Which Leader Is Fit To Govern Will Dominate The General Election Campaign May will continue to maintain that a vote for her is a vote for economic stability and a secure Brexit process. On the other hand the PM will assert that a vote for Corbyn's Labour is a vote for a divisive and unstable government propped up in coalition by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP, and the Lib Dems. This message will resonate with vast swathes of the electorate. Senior Political Consultant at the Whitehouse Consultancy

Ukip's Burqa Ban - The Nastiest Type Of Politics This is about the worst kind of politics. This is politics that picks on minorities who cannot defend themselves in order to gain votes and says more about Paul Nuttall and UKIP's polling numbers than it does about a small number of ladies who cover their faces when they go shopping.

In the four days that have passed since the publication of The Wire's article on the proliferation of Jay Shah's businesses, the publication and the journalist have been sued for Rs 100 crore by the BJP president's son, Congress has jumped on the revelations demanding immediate probe and several union ministers have issued statements in defence of the Shahs.

On Thursday, Amit Shah spoke to Aaj Tak and claimed that his son's businesses are completely legitimate. NDTV reports that Shah told the channel that his son has not done any business with the government. He also added, ""If you have documents to prove your allegations, bring them to court.""

Based on documents filed by Shah with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), The Wire had reported: ""Company balance sheets and annual reports obtained from the RoC reveal that in the financial years ending March 2013 and 2014, Shah's Temple Enterprise Private Ltd. engaged in negligible activity and recorded losses of Rs 6,230 and Rs 1,724 respectively.

The unnamed 16-year-old, who has since recovered, went to hospital in Texas when she felt short of breath the next day.

A series of tests lead doctors to diagnose her with three separate conditions, which they believed could be linked to her overzealous cheering.

Her story recently appeared as a case study in the Journal of Emergency Medicine.

EMPICS Entertainment

The doctors noted that while the girl was breathing quickly, her breathing sounded normal.

However, they noticed signs of crepitus - a cracking or clicking sensation that occurs under the skin - when they pressed down around her neck and chest.

Speaking to Live Science, report author Dr J. Mack Slaughter Jr. described the sensation as “feeling Rice Krispies”.

Following x-rays the doctors diagnosed the girl with pneumothorax, which is the term given when air builds up between the outside of your lung and the inside of your ribcage. This is also known as a collapsed lung.

After further examination she was also diagnosed with pneumomediastinum, which is when abnormal gas or air is contained within the mediastinum (the space in the chest between the lung sacs).

Finally, doctors identified rogue air in a third place, near the back of the throat, and diagnosed her with pneumoretropharyngeum.

The team said there was no evidence to suggest an underlying lung condition caused the three problems and noted that shouting could have prompted the damage, although this was impossible to conclude for certain.

“Spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoretropharyngeum are uncommon diagnoses individually, and furthermore, the combination of all three diagnoses has yet to be described in medical literature,” they said in the report.

Commenting on the case study, GP Dr Clare Morrison, from online doctor service MedExpress, said it’s important to remember the girl’s experience is extremely rare.

“I cannot think of another time when lungs have collapsed due to screaming at a pop concert - but there’s a first time for everything,” she told HuffPost UK.

“So it’s important not to panic and for parents to get too judicious.”

She said smokers and recreational drug users have a higher chance of a pneumothorax - or lung collapse - than the general popualation.

“Also, if you’re suffering from a condition like asthma or pneumonia, your chances increase,” she added.

She pointed out that symptoms of a collapsed lung include:

Chest tightness

Tiredness

Rapid heart rate

Nasal flaring

Blue-coloured skin

“A small pneumothorax will likely go away on its own - you could only need oxygen treatment and rest,” Dr Morrison added.

“Often a needle will be used to pull the air out from around the lung so it can expand fully. If the pneumothorax is large, a chest tube will be placed between the ribs into the space around the lungs to help with draining the air and allow the lung to re-expand.

“In such an instance, you could need to stay in hospital. In some more extreme cases, patients may need lung surgery.”

Immer wieder störte zuletzt ein wütender Mob die Wahlkampfauftritte der CDU-Chefin

Oben im Video seht ihr Bilder der Proteste gegen Merkel

""Volksverräter"". Dieses Wort hört Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) derzeit häufig im Wahlkampf. Immer wieder stört ein wütender Mob die Auftritte der Kanzlerin.

Die AfD gibt nun offen gegenüber der Wochenzeitung ""Die Zeit"" zu: Die Partei unterstützt die Proteste bei Wahlkampfauftritten von Merkel, und zwar regelmäßig.

""Bei der AfD gehört es zum Pflichtprogramm, zu Veranstaltungen mit Regierungspolitikern zu fahren"", sagt René Springer gegenüber der ""Zeit"". Springer ist der persönliche Referent von AfD-Spitzenkandidat Alexander Gauland.

Daraus müsse man kein Geheimnis mehr machen, sagt er. Zu jedem öffentlichen Wahlkampfauftritt von Angela Merkel, vor allem im Osten des Landes, reise eine Gruppe wütender Protestler.

So läuft die Organisation ab

Nach Darstellung von Springer, der Gaulands Wahlkampf koordiniert, laufe das meist nach einem Muster ab:

Einer aus dem AfD-Kreisverband, in dessen Gebiet Merkel auftreten wird, melde offiziell eine Gegen-Demo an. Der Landesverband verschicke dann eine E-Mail an alle Mitglieder mit der herzlichen Einladung, sich am Protest zu beteiligen.



Hauptziel sei es, sagt Springer, Merkel klar zu machen, wie viel Ablehnung ihr entgegenschlage. Aber es gebe noch ein zweites Motiv: ""Die Parteifreunde sagen: Wenn wir schon in den Medien nicht vorkommen, dann stellen wir uns hin und protestieren lautstark – so wird man schon über uns berichten.""

CDU: ""Rechtspopulistische Bratzen""

Zuletzt hatten AfD-Anhänger und Rechtsradikale die Auftritte von Merkel in Torgau und in Finsterwalde massiv gestört. Die Politikerin zog ihre rund 30-minütige Rede unbeirrt durch - trotz ""Buh""- und ""Volksverräter""-Rufen.

CDU-Generalsekretär Peter Tauber sagte kürzlich auf Twitter über die Proteste: ""Wenn man die Rechtsradikalen unter dem Banner der AfD auf unseren Veranstaltungen sieht, dann weiß man, wofür man kämpft.""

Appearing on the show alongside Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell and Matt Lucas, the ‘Breaking Bad’ actor explained that a travel agent recommended that Bryan and his wife, Robin Dearden, go through the Alps on a train as the couple’s trip was to be their honeymoon.

PA Wire/PA Images

He explained: “There’s a flatbed truck, it takes three cars bumper-to-bumper on a flatbed, and then you go through the Alps.

“‘By the way,’ he [the travel agent] says, wink wink, ‘There are three tunnels. The first tunnel, it is about five minutes, the second tunnel is about eight-to-ten minutes. The third tunnel is 50 minutes long, if you’re a honeymooner’.

“We’re on the train, there’s a van in front of us with a bunch of Italian families. Behind us… two Italian couples. We start going into the tunnels and it’s a massive experience, emotionally and physically.

“The wind is whipping through and it’s pitch dark. You cannot see anything. It’s fascinating. We come out of the tunnel and into the station, and I say to [my wife] Robin, that’s one.

“We go up, we start again. Pitch dark, can’t see. We come out of it, that’s two. She’s like, oh god! Start the third tunnel, wait until it’s absolutely pitch dark, here we go! It’s a small rental with the stick shift, and I’m like trying to get my trousers off.

PA Archive/PA Images Robin and Bryan in February 2016

“She’s trying to lower her chair. You cannot see anything, so it’s all by feel. One thing I learned is never be completely nude when transferring one seat over the stick shift.

“Keep your trousers on and do it afterwards… So we are inflagrante, as they say, I don’t know where to put my hands.

“Now what’s happening is that my eyes are adjusting. I can see her profile, she’s a beautiful woman. Love her with all my heart. I can see her, her pretty face, and it’s great. The eyes weren’t getting used to total pitch black. What happened is we were coming to a station! Boom! Sunlight!

“My wife says those three words to me that every husband wants to hear: ‘Get off me!’”

Bryan then pondered whether the travel agent had lied and played a joke on them - knowing the tunnel was really only 15 minutes long - and quite frankly, we’re surprised he didn’t ask him this question himself after returning to the US.

So far this series, the ‘Graham Norton Show’ has already played host to a number of unexpected moments and last month, we saw Margot Robbie tattoo a fan(!) when she stopped off for a chat.

All of the women in the study were healthy, with healthy babies. Using infrared cameras to track sleep position, and electrocardiogram (ECG) devices to monitor the heart-rate of the mothers and the babies, researchers found that the fetuses were only in an active state when the mothers slept on their left or right sides.

Fetal activity is a measure of its well-being, the researchers said.

Researchers recommend lying on your side during pregnancy.

""In the situation where the baby may not be healthy, such as those with poor growth, the baby may not tolerate the effect of maternal back sleeping,"" Peter Stone, one of the lead investigators, said in a release.

We are suggesting that there is now sufficient evidence to recommend mothers avoid sleeping on their back in late pregnancy, not only because of the epidemiological data but also because we have shown it has a clear effect on the baby. Lead Investigator Peter Stone

The study is part of a growing body of research that links a mother's sleep position with stillbirth. Researchers in the U.K. recently found that women who slept on their back were twice as likely to suffer a stillbirth as those who slept on their left side.

But for women who find sleeping on their side unnatural or uncomfortable (what isn't uncomfortable in the third trimester, though?), this news could just add to their sleepless nights. According to the National Sleep Foundation, 78 per cent of women report disturbed sleep during pregnancy.

The good news? Body pillows can help make side-sleeping ""slightly-less horrible.""

Calls to the dedicated phone number for Universal Credit cost up to 55p per minute from some mobiles, while calls to an HMRC number for self-described tax avoiders cost up to 40p per minute.

Labour’s shadow treasury chief secretary Peter Dowd accused the government of being “on the side of tax dodgers and not hard working families”.

HuffPost UK Calls to the Universal Credit helpline cost claimants up to 55p per minute, more than tax avoiders calling HMRC

It comes as the government on Thursday was forced into an embarrassing backtrack after admitting Universal Credit claimants did need to call a costly helpline to receive welfare payments.

That admission followed just a day after the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said claimants could manage accounts entirely online, and only after HuffPost UK confronted officials with detailed accounts of hardship caused by phone fees.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged Theresa May at Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions to “show humanity” and scrap the call fees, a move Downing Street has thus far resisted.

But now HuffPost has found those who describe themselves as tax avoiders and wish to discuss their tax status with HMRC are asked to call a special 0300 helpline.

0300 numbers count towards inclusive minutes on phone contracts, and cost up to 40p per minute for pay as you go users, according to a government call charge list.

HM Government 'Phone HMRC if you're in a tax avoidance scheme and want to leave,' the government's website advises

As an 0345 number, the Universal Credit helpline can count as inclusive minutes for phone contracts, and costs up to 55p per minute for pay as you go users.

Universal Credit claimants who contacted HuffPost this week said they couldn’t afford a monthly phone contract with inclusive minutes, or didn’t have good enough credit to apply for one.

Dowd, MP for Bootle, said: “The stark contrast between the amount HMRC charges for tax avoiders calling for advice and families who are struggling to access Universal Credit is sadly indicative of this out of touch Conservative Government, who find themselves once again on the side of tax dodgers and not hard working families.”

In an earlier defence of the call fees, a spokesperson for the prime minister said there was an option for a callback “straight away” for those Universal Credit claimants concerned about costs.

But HuffPost revealed on Wednesday how the request of a call back “straight away” was refused after a reporter who tested the helpline spent 12 and a half minutes of waiting on hold.

After eventually reaching an advisor, the reporter was told an immediate call back was not possible due to data protection rules.

In the end, the 12-and-a-half minute call would have cost as much as £7.51 to someone calling from a mobile.

That’s more than 11 percent of the weekly allowance of someone aged under 25 without children.

And claimants have said they are forced to rely on the helpline to set up accounts and make simple changes to appointments.

Donna Plant, 33, from Walsall told HuffPost: “To do anything, to set up, to make an appointment you have to ring the Universal Credit line.

“If you can’t attend an appointment you have to ring the helpline.

“The job centre don’t really do anything any more. There is no other option.”

Letters sent to people requesting them to call the helpline and seen by HuffPost do not outline alternative options to manage Universal Credit accounts.

Many said they had got rid of landline phones, which provide cheaper call rates but often require line rental, in a bid to cut costs.

And the head of the Public and Commerical Services Union Mark Serwotka told BBC Radio 4′s World at One that job centre closures were making matters worse.

“What I am absolutely against is that you make assumptions that everybody can use the technology, or use the telephone lines, often where there are huge delays aside from the cost,” Serwotka said.

A spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said: “Most people claim Universal Credit online, but for those who want to call us, they are charged at local rates which are free for many people as part of their call package. People can request a call back at no charge.”",Universal Credit Claimants Charged More Than Tax Avoiders To Call Government,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/universal-credit-claimants-charged-more-for-helpline-than-tax-avoiders_n_18260316.html

A cruise company is now offering a novel feature for its Australian passengers alongside its sun lounges, on-deck pools and cocktail bars -- an offer to conduct same-sex marriages services once in international waters.

LGBTQ Australians wanting to get married currently have to make long and expensive trips overseas to foreign countries where marriage equality has already been legalised (for the time being, at least, until the federal government gets around to legislating same-sex marriage here).

Celebrity Cruises, however, is now planning to host weddings onboard its ships, claiming it is the ""first cruise line in the world to offer legalised same-sex marriages at sea"".

While same-sex marriage is still not legal in Australia, the company skirts around the Australian government dragging its heels on the reform because Celebrity's ships are mostly registered in Malta. Malta recently legalised marriage equality, which ""opens the door for Celebrity to legally recognize same-sex marriages performed onboard, and have the fleet's captains officiate the ceremonies"", the company said in a release.

Same-sex marriages performed outside Australia are not officially recognised in Australia, so therefore the Celebrity weddings will not be recognised once local passengers return home.

""These legal, captain-led ceremonies are performed under the Maltese flag,"" the company said on its website.

Other cruise companies including Princess offer on-board weddings, but Celebrity claims it is the first to perform same-sex weddings. Celebrity Cruises told HuffPost Australia that they will hold their ceremonies once the ships reach international waters, 12 nautical miles off shore.

""The announcement refers to all international waters and every single one of Celebrity Cruises cruises through international waters,"" a Celebrity spokesperson said in a statement.

While the same-sex marriages will not be legally recognised in Australia, Celebrity said it hopes LGBTQ couples would take up the opportunity.

""Australia is a significant market for Celebrity Cruises, ranking as the third largest source market worldwide.

Zwei Männer boten einer Gruppe Jugendlicher eine angebliche Zigarette an

Nach nur einem Zug davon sollen zwei 18-Jährige zusammengebrochen sein

Jetzt ermittelt die Berliner Polizei

Die Nacht zum Freitag nahm für zwei Jugendliche in Berlin ein unschönes Ende: Nach dem Zug an einer angeblichen Zigarette sind die beiden 18-Jährigen auf offener Straße zusammengebrochen. Die Zigarette - möglicherweise ein Joint - sei ihnen am S-Bahnhof Warschauer Straße von zwei Männern angeboten worden, teilte die Polizei am Freitag mit.

Nach den bisherigen Ermittlungen und Aussagen von Zeugen boten die beiden Männer einer Gruppe von vier 18-Jährigen die verhängnisvolle Zigarette zum Mitrauchen an.

Zwei Jugendliche aus der Gruppe sollen daraufhin einen Zug genommen haben. Nur Sekunden später brachen sie dann zusammen und wurden bewusstlos.

Die Rettungskräfte mussten einen Jugendlichen beatmen

Die Begleiter alarmierten Rettungskräfte, die einen der Bewusstlosen beatmen mussten. Beide wurden zur stationären Behandlung in ein Krankenhaus gebracht.

Die beiden Männer konnten nach dem Vorfall zunächst fliehen. Ein Verdächtiger wurde festgenommen, wenig später aber wieder entlassen. Gegen den 25-Jährigen wird jetzt wegen gefährlicher Körperverletzung und Verstoßes gegen das Betäubungsmittelgesetz ermittelt. Welche Substanzen die Zigarette enthielt, konnte die Polizei zunächst nicht sagen.

Die Untersuchungen von Blut- und Urinproben der Opfer werden wahrscheinlich noch längere Zeit andauern.

Speaking with Christiane Amanpour in an interview set to air on CNN Friday, Fonda expresses regret that she didn’t call him out sooner.

“I found out about Harvey about a year ago, and I’m ashamed that I didn’t say anything back then,” she said.

The “Our Souls At Night” star says she was first made aware of Weinstein’s actions by actress Rosanna Arquette, who detailed an incident of alleged sexual assault at the hands of the producer in a report by The New York Times. According to Arquette, Weinstein invited her to his hotel room one night in the 1990s under the guise of picking up a script for a new role and then forced her hand on his crotch.

When asked about why she chose to stay silent, Fonda said, “I was not that bold. I guess it hadn’t happened to me, so I didn’t feel it was my place.”

The 79-year-old actress, who revealed she’s only met Weinstein once, explained that she never personally experienced feeling uncomfortable around him.

“I only met Harvey when was old, and Harvey goes for young because that’s more vulnerable,” she surmised.

Despite her previous silence on the matter, Fonda is “glad” the allegations of sexual harassment and assault are finally coming to light.

“I’m so proud of those fellow actors that are speaking up. I know that it has taken a long time,” she said. “It is a very, very, very hard thing to do. You don’t get anything out of it as the person who has been victimized, but it is important that it comes out.”

The Kangana-Hrithik affair, imagined or otherwise, can only be likened to an interminably long nine-course dinner. The first couple of courses were fun, tickling the taste buds of an audience sniffing the air in anticipation. After all, how often do we get to see our proper, put-together, not a toe-out-of-line (at least publicly) 'stars' roll up their sleeves and fling fistfuls of mud at each other over the terminology used to describe their apparently clandestine affair? It is hard to believe, and remember, that the whole sordid mess became a matter of public record with someone calling someone else a ""silly ex"".

By the time you reach the sixth or the seventh course, you start to tire of even the most exotic ingredients. And by the eighth or the ninth course, the pants begin to pinch and chafe at the waist, making you secretly wish you'd stayed home in your holey pyjamas and eaten leftovers from lunch instead of signing up for the gourmet nightmare you can't politely exit from.

Even as one can't wait for the final course of this no-longer-palatable meal to roll in so we can all go home and go to sleep, for now, we must fork what's in front of us and swallow it. And right now, that happens to be Farhan Akhtar with an eloquently worded open letter about an open letter. How meta. Without naming either Hrithik Roshan, or Kangana Ranaut, he weighs in with his opinion of everything that's wrong in the way the public responded to the affair.

Indian actors Kangana Ranaut and Hrithik Roshan

In the letter, Akhtar spends a lot of time talking about how, when it comes to victim-blaming and repression, traditionally, it is the woman who is the victim, which he finds unacceptable, as evidenced by the foundation of MARD (Men Against Rape & Discrimination) by him. He then goes on to helpfully explain the difference between ""all"" and ""most"", a concept too difficult to grasp for the average human brain, apparently.

Akhtar then says that in the interest of ""objectivity and fairness"" he absolutely ""must speak up"" in this particular instance.

And so he does — about how reputed journalists have, possibly without realising it, pushed Ranaut's side of the story, effectively painting Roshan as the guilty party. Akhtar finds it worrisome that Ranaut's version has been taken at face value. Ironically, all the inconsistencies he points out in her narrative are things that have been widely reported, questioned and commented upon by the very media he so unhesitatingly chastises.

At the heart of Akhtar's soliloquy is the prospect that in giving the benefit of the doubt to the woman in this case, the man may have, inadvertently, been discriminated against.

All of these are noble intentions, undoubtedly. As a person with immense power to shape public opinion, Akhtar should absolutely stand up for those that he believes to be victims of unfairness. But discrimination is a big word to throw around, especially without completely understanding its ramifications.

And reading Akhtar's letter, one can't help but feel that he, like so many others in Bollywood, just doesn't get it.

As national celebrities with immense reach and star-power in their own right, neither Ranaut nor Roshan is what one can call ill-equipped to defend themselves, or hire a battery of lawyers, publicists and spin doctors to do it for them. Not naming them, or simply calling them ""a man"" and ""a woman"", like Akhtar did, is not going to change the fact that both come from a place of incredible power and privilege. By virtue of that fact alone, the thought that the media — that frankly doesn't care for either one more than the other — would randomly decide to discriminate against one of the two is slightly perplexing.

Does Akhtar believe that journalists have some strange anti-men agenda that they are unable to fathom or rise above? As a rank insider of an industry so extensively covered that actors, without a hint of irony, send out press releases about their 'airport looks', knowing full well that it will get them some press, somewhere, it is laughable that Akhtar would seriously propose it is we who haven't allowed Roshan's voice to be heard.

The only reason Ranaut's narrative has dominated news cycle every time the topic has come up is that she has been around, exercising her right to speak about her life the way she deems fit, just as Roshan exercised his to remain silent. He chose not to defend himself for reasons best known to him. When you do that, you always run the risk of people believing your adversary because theirs is the only voice they get to hear. That's logic, not a secret media conspiracy.

Unfortunately, that's just how news and commentary work. Just as Ranaut has had to bear the brunt of being too outspoken about her alleged mistreatment at the hands of her various past lovers by being ridiculed by wholly unconcerned third parties, Roshan has had to pay the price of silence. Each bears the burden of their choices. Where is the discrimination in that?

Now that Roshan has finally decided to speak up and put forth his truth, every news platform in the country is clamouring to interview him and get his side of the story. All it took was one Facebook post from him. If Roshan's version of the events that unfolded is true, he is a victim of cyber stalking and harassment, but certainly not of discrimination

It is true that Ranaut has the uncanny ability to land on her feet no matter how ugly the controversies she gets embroiled in. It is also true that she has managed to cement her position as the poster-girl of feminism in an industry as sexist as Bollywood. That's not always because everyone uniformly agrees with her opinion, but simply because she dares to speak about topics no one else does. How many Bollywood stars, the ones that enjoy a lot more wealth and power than her, would be willing to risk their neck and make enemies of the very people they depend on to give them work? Her fearlessness in addressing unpleasant issues is what made her admirable to so many women who grapple with similar situations in their own lives, not this odious never-ending saga with Roshan.

In the case of who cyber stalked and hacked whose account, Ranaut might enjoy the benefit of doubt because she's a woman, but it certainly hasn't insulated her from being called a liar when the situation has warranted it.

To insinuate that feminists are so blinded by their zeal to ensure that a woman gets justice that they are willing to knowingly sacrifice an innocent man in the pursuit is a grievous insult to sane, fair-minded equal rights crusaders like Akhtar himself.

Même si ce rêve n'avait aucune logique, j'ai continué à y penser après mon réveil. Un jour, j'ai eu l'occasion d'interviewer une psychologue de l'école jungienne, Cathy Pagano, et je lui ai demandé ce qu'elle y voyait.

Carl Jung et Sigmund Freud sont les pionniers de l'interprétation des rêves. Un siècle plus tard, des milliers d'ouvrages ont été publiés sur l'analyse des rêves, des dictionnaires grand public aux thèses de doctorat. Il est vrai que le désir de les comprendre est presque universel. De nombreuses cultures indigènes se tournent vers la quête de vision pour percer leurs mystères. Les utilisateurs Facebook du monde entier contribuent quant à eux au World Dream Atlas. Lorsqu'un rêve nous touche, nous sommes tous curieux de savoir ce qu'il signifie.

""L'énigme du rêve s'accompagne souvent de sentiments qui semblent entrer en résonance avec quelque chose d'insaisissable"", explique Tina Goodin, fondatrice du Centre de Psychologie de Palm Beach. ""Notre voulons savoir, et nous sentons pertinemment qu'il se passe quelque chose au plus profond de nous-mêmes.""

Cathy Pagano, qui a recours à l'analyse des rêves, m'a expliqué que mon rêve contenait de nombreux symboles: les enfants représentent les idées nouvelles et les envies créatives. Les symboles qui viennent par trois évoquent un événement sur le point de se produire (tandis que le chiffre quatre évoque une manifestation au long cours). L'âge des enfants – entre 5 et 10 ans – indique qu'un projet sur lequel j'ai travaillé ces cinq ou dix dernières années va porter ses fruits. Quant à l'eau, elle symbolise le bonheur absolu.

Les symboles en eux-mêmes ne signifient pas grand-chose, mais avec l'éclairage de Cathy Pagano, j'étais au bord des larmes.

Voici ce que j'ai compris: ces derniers temps, j'ai été beaucoup travaillée par l'idée de quitter les Etats-Unis pour rejoindre une petite communauté au bord d'une rivière au Canada, mon pays d'origine. J'étais préoccupée par les conséquences que ce déménagement pourrait avoir sur ma carrière, que j'ai mis huit ans à construire. D'après tous les symboles de mon rêve, mon subconscient me dit que je serais plus heureuse au bord de cette rivière et que mes efforts seraient couronnés de succès dans cette communauté.

Les psychanalystes intègrent souvent l'interprétation des rêves à leur pratique, sous un angle freudien ou jungien. D'autres écoles de psychologie, comme la thérapie cognitivo-comportementale, l'approche centrée sur la personne et la Gestalt-thérapie, accordent moins d'important à l'analyse des rêves. Pourtant, après ma conversation avec Cathy Pagano, je dois dire que j'y crois.

Pour comprendre comment les psychologues interprètent les rêves pour aider leurs patients à mieux se comprendre et à connaître leurs désirs profonds, j'ai parlé à plusieurs experts.

Les rêves révèlent nos vérités enfouies

Pour Cathy Pagano, les rêves font appel aux symboles et aux archétypes pour faire émerger ce que nous sommes incapables de saisir au quotidien à cause de nos croyances, de nos peurs, des normes sociales et de tout ce qui nous empêche de nous connaître. Les psychologues utilisent l'interprétation des rêves pour aider leurs patients à se libérer de ce bagage afin de se découvrir et de comprendre leurs désirs. ""On est bien plus lucide sur notre propre vie lorsqu'on rêve"", assure-t-elle. ""Un rêve, c'est de l'énergie à l'état pur.""

Tout est une question de contexte

L'interprétation des rêves se fait au cas par cas. Différents rêves peuvent partager les mêmes symboles mais, en fonction du contexte de votre vie, le sens de ces symboles changera. Par exemple, si la peinture écaillée d'une maison peut symboliser un désir d'amélioration extérieure, la nature de ce changement dépendra de vous.

D'après Cathy Pagano, tenir un journal pour répertorier ses visions nocturnes aide à comprendre le fonctionnement du subconscient et les messages qu'il essaie de faire passer. Elle conseille de commencer par ""explorer"" un rêve en particulier, c'est-à-dire de prêter attention à ce qui se passe dans le rêve, à l'endroit où l'on se trouve et aux personnes présentes. Vous pourrez ensuite analyser votre relation aux autres et votre ressenti.

""Si des personnes que vous connaissez sont présentes dans votre rêve, quel est leur rôle? Qu'est-ce qui les caractérise? Si vous vous dites que vous n'appréciez pas quelqu'un ou qu'il se croit supérieur, comprenez que c'est une part d'ombre en vous"", dit-elle. ""Où êtes-vous? À l'école? Dans une maison? Si c'est une maison, est-ce chez vous? Une maison que vous connaissez? Les rêves sont généralement en lien direct avec ce qui se passe dans votre vie.""

Prêtez une attention particulière à vos rêves récurrents

Selon Tina Goodin, un rêve qui revient plusieurs fois peut être une injonction de votre subconscient à régler un problème. Souvent, les rêves récurrents pointent du doigt une question non résolue, et il suffit de creuser un peu pour découvrir qu'un blocage psychologique vous empêche d'avancer ou que vous devez résoudre un conflit.

""Le rêve récurrent est un signe d'urgence, il nous invite à le comprendre"", poursuit-elle. ""L'analyse commence en surface, à partir de la manifestation du contenu latent du rêve. Elle peut être littérale ou symbolique.""

Pour Shain Miller, psychologue californienne, le sens d'un rêve récurrent peut évoluer avec le temps. ""Un rêve récurrent dans lequel on perd son porte-monnaie peut ainsi avoir un sens différent ou plus complexe à 23 ans qu'à 14 ans"", indique-t-elle.

Tous les rêves n'ont pas un sens caché

Même si l'analyse des rêves peut s'avérer très utile, la psychologue Anjhula Mya Singh Bais souligne que tous n'ont pas le même statut. Certains peuvent révéler des désirs cachés, des dangers dont on n'a pas conscience ou des idées à étudier, mais d'autres se produisent simplement lorsque notre esprit est trop stimulé.

""Nous faisons le tri dans le bombardement quotidien d'images, de pensées, d'idées et de rencontres pour en évacuer le surplus"", précise-t-elle.

Ne prenez pas vos rêves au pied de la lettre

Les rêves peuvent avoir un sens caché, mais il vous apparaîtra sous forme de symboles et non au premier degré. Ces symboles ont un sens différent d'une personne à l'autre, en fonction de sa situation et de son environnement culturel.

Rêver de la mort, par exemple, ne signifie pas forcément que vous ou l'un vos proches va mourir bientôt, ajoute Mme Bais. Cela symbolise souvent la fin de quelque chose d'important, comme un projet ou une relation, ou tout simplement le début d'autre chose.

Oubliez les ouvrages de psychologie grand public

D'après Emily Anhalt, docteur en psychologie clinique et consultante psychologue, les livres d'introduction à l'analyse des rêves peuvent être divertissants et nous inciter à réfléchir au sens de nos rêves, mais leur approche s'apparente davantage à des horoscopes qu'à des outils d'analyse sérieux. ""L'interprétation des rêves ne saurait se satisfaire de généralisations"", affirme Anhalt.

Elle conseille plutôt de suivre une formation en psychothérapie avec un spécialiste en psychodynamique ou en psychanalyse qui maîtrise l'interprétation des rêves et peut vous aider à les comprendre en fonction de votre situation personnelle.

Certains rêves ont un sens assez courant

La psychologue Nancy Mramor Kajuth note qu'il existe des ""rêves classiques"": être en retard à un examen et ne pas être prêt, être en retard au travail et ne pas savoir comment s'y rendre, essayer de courir ou de crier et ne pas y parvenir, etc. Le message sous-jacent de ces rêves est simple et il est généralement identique pour tout le monde (dans le cas des rêves mentionnés, il s'agit de la peur de l'échec).

Mais même ces rêves revêtiront un sens particulier d'une personne à l'autre.

""Une personne qui rêve qu'elle est perdue peut tout simplement ne pas savoir où elle en est dans sa vie"", ajoute-elle. ""Rêver de quelqu'un peut évoquer quelque chose dans votre relation à cette personne ou des aspects qui ne se rapportent qu'à vous.""

Vous pouvez programmer vos rêves

Cela peut paraître étrange, mais vous avez peut-être déjà fait l'expérience d'un ""rêve programmé"" sans vous en rendre compte. D'après elle, s'il vous est arrivé de réfléchir à un problème particulier ou à votre relation avec quelqu'un juste avant de vous endormir, il est probable que vous ayez rêvé de cette personne ou de ce problème. Se concentrer volontairement sur une question avant de se coucher peut activer votre subconscient et vous apporter des réponses pendant votre sommeil.

Elle évoque le cas d'un patient qui rencontrait des difficultés dans son travail et qui s'est endormi une nuit en y pensant. Il a rêvé d'un vieil homme à son travail et d'un réveil. Une analyse l'a amené à se rendre compte qu'on ne lui témoignait pas le respect qu'il méritait au travail. En tant que jeune salarié, on ne le considérait pas comme un spécialiste de son domaine en raison de son âge, ce qui se retrouve dans les symboles du vieil homme et du réveil. Ces symboles lui ont révélé ce qu'il ne pouvait deviner dans sa vie éveillée.

Every few months (or weeks, it's difficult to say these days) news of another mass-shooting in the world's only global superpower, the United States, makes headlines around the world. This time, the venue was the glitzy streets of Sin City, Las Vegas, as 58 people attending a music concert were shot dead. Stephen Paddock, from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, shot innocent bystanders to death as if picking fish in a barrel.

The Vegas shooting has now become the worst such crime in US history. The immediate reactions in the US, and around the world, were similar to previous such incidents in the country as much of the narrative in the hours following the atrocity was based around the usual debate of gun ownership laws. It is perhaps not contestable in a civilised world that current American gun laws allowing people to buy weapons from grocery stores in some-sort of a dystopian stage play hiding under the guise of the country's second amendment, which in turn liberally allows anyone to own guns under the ruse of 'self-protection', is indigestible. However, many debated on why Paddock was not being labelled as a terrorist.

The term 'terrorist' has a heavy weightage to it and has a complex web of attempts that try to define the same. At the United Nations, almost the entire gambit of nation-states, big or small, democratic or autocratic, come together in New York every year with one of the main unsolved questions to assess what the term and ideas behind 'terrorism' really are. The term itself is plagued by its own malice, with countries around the world unable to decide what constitutes terrorism, and how to politically define it as a global phenomenon.

The fact remains his crime does not fit within the parameters of what we know as terrorism.

For example, the United States today is looking to sanction and declare the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC), an elite force under the Ayatollah of Iran's command as a terror group with President Trump looking to exit the Iran nuclear deal. Meanwhile, the same American State Department, till date, despite a 14-year-long war in Afghanistan, has not officially declared the Afghan Taliban a designated sponsor of terror. This highlights the fractures and complexities of the global 'terrorism' debate and the politics around it.

Ideology is a critical aspect when it comes to the definition of terrorism, which separates the same from other crimes such as mass-murder, assassination and so on. Much of the debate around Paddock's heinous crime has now come to the fold of him not being labeled as a 'terrorist' because he is white, and while this may have some degree of truth, the fact remains his crime does not fit within the parameters of what we know as terrorism, or what the discourse of the studies around the topic is attempting to translate both the violence and intent behind the terminology and those who use it as a tool of coercion and political chaos.

One of the definitions of terrorism that this author considers closest to being acceptable comes from Professor Yonah Alexander, Senior Fellow and Director; International Center for Terrorism Studies, Potomac Institute for Policy Studies based in Arlington, Virginia, USA. As a foremost theorist in the field, Alexander defines terrorism as 'the use of violence against random civilian targets in order to intimidate or create generalised pervasive fear for the purpose of achieving political goals'.

The 'political goals' terminology, which finds itself in many other theorists' definitions and research, is an important point. Others such as Alex Peter Schmid, a Dutch terrorism scholar, further highlights that the eventual targets of a terror attack serve as 'message generators' for further political or ideological ends. In her article for The New Yorker, journalist Masha Gessen highlights the Irish political scientist Louise Richardson's seven main characteristics for an act of terror, these are: 1) It is politically inspired, 2) use of violence, 3) deliverance of a message to the enemy, 4) symbolism of the violence and its victim, 5) the attack is carried by a sub-state group, 6) distinction between victims and audience of the message of the attack and lastly the act deliberately targets civilians.

By the above standards, unless Paddock was identified as a neo-Nazi or a white-nationalist, or acting on behalf of ISIS, which oddly, has claimed that he converted to Islam six months ago and carried the attack in the name of the caliphate (refuted by investigating agencies till now, however, latest issue of ISIS's weekly newsletter al-Naba advertised the attack as its own), it is not wise to club him under the bracket of a terrorist.

The Guns & Guitars shop where Stephen Paddock, the gunman who attacked the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival in a mass shooting in Las Vegas, was a customer, is pictured in Mesquite, Nevada, U.S.

The term 'terrorism' itself has been more ingrained in American society and culture only in the post 9/11 era, specifically with the moniker of 'War on Terror', which saw the US invade Afghanistan and Iraq as a fallout of the attacks on New York. The term has perfected itself into the American subconsciousness as a broad stroke for largely Islamist violence. To counter this fallacy ridden narrative, which was a tool of American foreign policy, many attacks that are racist, xenophobic, mass-murders are labelled under the 'terrorist' ambit. In fact, India is much more accustomed to using the term 'terrorism' closer to what it is meant to be than America, thanks to decades-long suffering from cross-border terrorism sponsored by Pakistan. In India terrorism has clear, example led narratives and the distinction between mass-shootings (which largely do not occur thanks to guns not being available for sale on the same counters as chocolates) and terrorism-related attacks.

In India terrorism has clear, example led narratives and distinction between mass-shootings and terrorism-related attacks.

In the US, the fact remains that even as labelling people like Paddock as a terrorist pacifies internal rage at some level, it is the debate of gun control that remains paramount. While Paddock's crime led to the biggest mass-shooting in American history, if the US was not moved to a war-footing to ban guns after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, which saw the murder of 20 children in Newtown Connecticut, then labeling mass-shooters as 'terrorist' for narratives' sake is nothing but trivial victories.

A censored version of the ad with a bandeau top Photoshopped onto the models’ back, is currently plastered across the Underground.

Ellie Howard, head of community at Heist, told HuffPost UK the fashion brand was told to make the modification to the image because TFL’s media partner deemed the shot to be “overtly sexual”.

“We’re feeling pretty indignant about this,” she said.

Heist Studios

A TFL spokesperson explained that its media partner Exterion was responsible for the request to add a black strap to the model’s back.

“We were not sent the advert which is being referred to,” they said.

“Every advertisement is reviewed by our agents [Exterion] against our advertising policy to make sure it is compliant.

“In cases where an advertisement is deemed not to be compliant, we work with the advertiser to amend it.”

TfL’s advertising policy was updated in January 2016, when London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, promised stricter guidelines relating to adverts which promoted problematic body image ideals.

This followed outrage over a Protein World advert in 2015, which featured a bikini-clad model and the slogan: “Are you beach body ready?”

However, Howard argues that the Heist advert should not have fallen foul of these guidelines because it is not sexualised.

“We use dancing and movement in our imagery precisely because we are trying to challenge the way that women are sexualised in underwear adverts, yet it seems that the back of a female dancer is unacceptable,” she said.

“This is a huge shame and something that we think urgently needs to change”.

Heist Studios

Howard added that she felt censoring the image, conveyed a message about how women’s bodies are viewed as sexual objects in society.

“For a brand that’s passionate about progressing the conversation about female bodies, censorship is an issue,” she said.

“Are images of topless male models banned? No. Are images in women in seductive poses and clothes screened out? Oftentimes not.

“How can we provide an alternative view of women’s bodies and women in underwear if we’re effectively banned from showing it?

“We’re just not used to seeing agency in female photography - so many images are shot in a static way, but for us, it’s all about movement and progress, as opposed to aesthetics alone.

“This, it seems, is ‘offensive’. Perhaps that’s because depicting women in this way isn’t commonplace.”

The edited version of the advert will still be shown on the Tube until the 22 October 2017 and again between the 4 December 2017 and 17 December 2017.

But don’t think that the drawn on bandeau is a sign that Heist will be changing its messaging around the female body.

“We think that we certainly need to challenge the status quo when it comes to how women are depicted in advertising,” said Howard.

“We were super excited to share our positive image of a strong dancer, leaping through the air in our tights, and we chose to shoot our product in this way precisely because we want to present women’s bodies in an empowering way.",Heist Tights Advert Featuring Topless Woman Censored On London Tube,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/13/heist-tights-london-tube_n_18257556.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

I graduated from my university seven years ago, but every time something comes up about the National University of Singapore on Facebook, particularly the Mechanical Engineering department, I invariably follow that link. What happens at the place I spent four years of my life is still of interest to me.

At work, I often see communities come together working for larger causes. People want to help someone they perceive as their own, even if they have never met. To me, it is a much-needed re-forging of identity for a positive and constructive goal.

Recently, students of NIT Warangal raised close to 30 lakh rupees on Milaap to help their classmate Mangilal, the son of a poor farmer, battle cancer. They came up with a simple plan--find 4,000 people who would relate to their cause and these supporters will come forward and contribute Rs 1,000 each (NIT Warangal has about 5,000 students).

The fundraiser was organised by Sujeeth, Mangilal's close friend. Typical of any NIT student, Mangilal has worked very hard to get there. His treatment mattered just as much to the 3000+ student backers of his campaign as Mangilal himself. Mangilal and Sujeeth met in their class 12 coaching class, and it is through this class and their school's class 12 network that they were able to gather thousands of supporters in a short time.

We live with these important relationships dormant within us until a situation comes up where we decide to act.

Bike racer Sebastian Selvaraj's campaign raised Rs 19 lakhs when a fellow biker started a campaign for him after he met with a brutal accident and needed funds. Most of the contributors were other bike enthusiasts who followed Indian and international bike-racing. The common thread here is that supporters connect different facets of their life that are otherwise separate from what they do.

The best and the most authentic part of our online and offline personae is the one that decides to come forward and help another person in need.

In a sense, this is precisely what we look for when we put an update on Facebook or post the latest on Instagram. Why post that minor update about finding the right can of beans at the supermarket? The thing is, this post is not for all my 589 friends/followers but for the section of people from this list who may be interested in that recommendation even if it is as mundane as can of beans in the supermarket. This kind of grouping may only happen in very specific contexts, but it is super efficient in enabling a call-to-action. From our shared interests, we band together to do what defines us as a community.

It can even directly affect our lives, like participating in community lake cleanups or providing immediate relief in times of natural disasters like the TN floods of 2015. Close to 100 people used Milaap to meet their urgent requirements in Chennai. People were fundraising for food, water, blankets, medicines, and even to fix damaged roofs. Being online directly connected the people working on the ground to a community of their supporters, giving relevant, impactful aid during a natural disaster.

What is most exciting about the crowdfunding space is the affirmation of the best part of our identity. The best and the most authentic part of our online and offline personae is the one that decides to come forward and help another person in need. This is the part that draws strength from communities for purely altruistic reasons. These positive actions are what make us, and together, we make a better world.

But critics say the federal government's shake-up of the system will mean little difference for families and older Australians.
""People will be able to access mental health services earlier through private health insurance,"" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the Seven Network.
""There is absolutely no guarantee in this package there will be a lower private health insurance rise in April next year.""
""The biggest problem in the affordability of private health insurance is the amount that's going into the pockets of the for-profit insurers,"" he told ABC radio.","Australians with private health insurance are being promised simpler policies, more affordable premiums and easier access to mental healthcare from next year.

But critics say the federal government's shake-up of the system will mean little difference for families and older Australians.

Health Minister Greg Hunt on Friday announced several new measures aimed at curbing rising costs, with those under 30 set to be the biggest beneficiaries.

They will be offered a two per cent discount on their premiums every year up to a maximum of 10 per cent, which they will keep until they are 40.

""By bringing more young people in, that lowers the average cost of premiums,"" Mr Hunt told reporters in Melbourne.

The government has also struck an agreement with makers of hip and knee prostheses and cardiac devices to cut the price insurers pay for their products.

That will save them about $1 billion over the next four years and is expected to be the biggest driver of lower premium rises, starting from April 2018.

Premiums have increased an average of 5.6 per cent a year since 2010, but the minister wouldn't put a figure on how much that could fall.

The changes will allow some people to increase their excess in exchange for lower premiums - up to $750 for singles and $1500 for families.

The government will also take alternative therapies like homeopathy and yoga off the list of items covered, while the waiting period for mental health services will be scrapped.

""People will be able to access mental health services earlier through private health insurance,"" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the Seven Network.

Insurers will have to re-categorise policies as either gold, silver, bronze or basic packages and provide a one-page summary.

""It's about information and simplicity; ensuring that all Australians are able to understand the impact of their policies, what they are covered for and what they aren't covered for,"" Mr Hunt said.

Labor's health spokeswoman Catherine King says young people will only save about 70 cents a week, while older Australians won't receive any returns to their back pocket.

She believes families and older Australians are still going to see their premiums rise in April next year.

""There's very little in this package for them,"" she told reporters in Melbourne.

""There is absolutely no guarantee in this package there will be a lower private health insurance rise in April next year.""

Labor does, however, welcome cuts to the cost of devices on the prostheses list.

Australian Medical Association president Michael Gannon says the move won't solve the issue of affordability, but it is a step in the right direction.

""The biggest problem in the affordability of private health insurance is the amount that's going into the pockets of the for-profit insurers,"" he told ABC radio.

Den 1. Juli 2017 wird Deutschland so schnell nicht vergessen. So sehr bewegte der Abschied von Helmut Kohl (†87) die Menschen. Bill Clinton (70), Angela Merkel (62) – die bedeutendsten Politikgrüßen unserer Zeit hielten in Straßburg bewegende Reden auf den „Kanzler der Einheit“.

So groß der Trauerakt war, so schlicht ist das Grab des Altkanzlers. Im Video oben zeigen wir euch seine letzte Ruhestätte.

Hintergrund Bill Clinton Emotionale Rede für Helmut Kohl (†87): „Ich habe ihn geliebt"" Etwa 800 geladene Gäste sind zum Trauerakt für Helmut Kohl (†87) in Straßburg erschienen. Der ehemalige US-Präsident Bill Clinton hielt eine emotionale Rede - und fand trotzdem noch die Kraft, über seinen verstorbenen Freund zu scherzen.

Noch emotionaler wurde es einige Stunden später beim Trauergottesdienst in Speyer. Es war der ausdrückliche Wunsch des Altkanzlers in der Domstadt beigesetzt zu werden. Bereits 2015 hatte er sich für seine Beerdigung in Speyer entschieden, sie sollte seine Bindung zu der Stadt und dem Dom zum Ausdruck bringen.

Tief hatte seine Witwe Maike Kohl-Richter (53) ihren schwarzen Hut ins Gesicht gezogen. Ihre Augen versteckte sie hinter einen dunklen Sonnenbrille – und trotzdem war ihre tiefe Trauer nicht zu übersehen. Die bewegenden Bilder zeigen wir euch im Video:

Wie sehr die Familie von Helmut Kohl litt, blieb der Welt dagegen verborgen. Denn sowohl seine beiden Söhne, wie auch Schwiegertöchter und Enkel des Altkanzlers fehlten bei der Trauerfeier. So wie es Walter Kohl (53) bereits angekündigt hatte.

Wie zerrüttet die Familie ist, zeigte sich auch, als sein älteste Sohn Walter mit den Enkelkindern vor dem Haus seines toten Vaters von der Polizei verwiesen wurde. Die unglaublichen Szenen seht ihr im Video:

Doch nicht nur das Fehlen seiner Familie sorgte für Wirbel. Auch über drei Monate nach der Trauerfeier ist eine Angelegenheit noch immer nicht geklärt: Die Rechnung in Höhe von 57.000 Euro ist nämlich bisher nicht bezahlt.

Dabei handelt es sich jedoch nicht um die Kosten für die Beerdigung. Wie sich die stolze Summe zusammensetzt, erklärt ein Pressesprecher des Bundesinnenminsteriums gegenüber BUNTE.de: „Die Erstattung betrifft umfangreiche Leistungen der Stadt Speyer im direkten und mittelbaren Zusammenhang mit dem staatlichen Trauerzeremoniell und diesbezüglichen Erfordernissen an Infrastruktur und Sicherheit.“

Bedeutet konkret: „Beispielsweise die Nutzung und notwendige Ertüchtigung städtischer Flächen, Gebäude und Einrichtungen, die Maßnahmen von Ordnungsamt, Straßenverkehrsbehörde, Feuerwehr und Sanitätsdienst sowie entsprechende Personaleinsatzkosten.“

Die bewegendsten Momente des Gedenkgottesdienstes und die Gründe für das Fernbleiben seiner Verwandten zeigen wir euch im Video:

Aber wer muss denn nun zahlen? Ausgelegt hat die Kosten zunächst die Stadt Speyer. Doch tatsächlich zahlen wird die Domstadt am Ende „nur“ 4.000 Euro. Denn „das Bundesministerium des Innern als formeller Träger und Ausrichter des Trauerzeremoniells in Speyer hat mittlerweile eine Kostenübernahme in Höhe von rund 53.000 € zugesagt“, erklärt der Pressesprecher der Stadt auf Anfrage von BUNTE.de.

Beim Bundesinnenministerium bestätigt man die Kostenübernahme und teilt mit: „Sobald die entsprechende Rechnung im Bundesministerium des Innern eingegangen ist, wird der Betrag an die Stadtkasse überwiesen.“

Zumindest die Kostenfrage sollte damit geklärt sein. Schade nur, dass man das über die familiären Verhältnisse in der Familie Kohl wohl weiter nicht sagen kann ...

Wenigstens das Erbe des Altkanzlers ist inzwischen geregelt.

Adults have an instinctive need to protect children. It is a worthy goal, but when adults begin to sanitise the world children are exposed to, it is analogous to keeping them in a sterile environment. They are deprived of a chance to develop, and to understand the world. Sanitising stories of things that are uncomfortable to discuss begs the question: what are we protecting the child from? Is there an appropriate age, for example, at which to let children learn that grown-ups like becoming close friends, dating, falling in love, marrying each other, separating from a partner, not necessarily in that order? Whether we wish it or not, children see these things all around them and interpret their place or value in their own lives, in their own way.

Children are not simple. In his book The Uses of Enchantment, Bruno Bettelheim tells us how fairy tales play a crucial role in relieving the subconscious pressures a child faces but is unable to recognise or articulate. The child does this by projecting onto these stories and characters the emotions they feel. Fairy tales of substance are for that very reason not sanitised of the darker or deeper aspects of our lives that are a very real, unavoidable part of growing up. This also subliminally prepares children for what lies ahead. In the world of Harry Potter, which children are able to enter and inhabit with ease, unfairness and death is a constant presence. JK Rowling also revealed that she had always envisioned a complex and well-loved character in Harry Potter as being gay after a generation of children had grown up surrounded by all of the characters in the books.

We see that often it is adults who read too much into the nature of stories and characters, while children are not given credit for the open-mindedness with which they accept them.

A child—any child—has moments of feeling confused and lonely. Imagine the confusion and fear for those children who do not find characters like themselves reflected in stories they read: 'am I the only one who feels this way?' And as they read more stories all of which are sanitised, the confusion and fear grows: 'is there something odd about me? This is certainly true of children who know at a very young age that they are different from others, but this could also be true for a child at a later stage of growing up.

Queer children should be able to find quirky, colourful, even lovable characters who, like themselves, are different in one crucial aspect of who they are.

Here is what is at the heart of this piece — we never know who a child is going to be. Pigeonholing does not work well for people in general and particularly not for children, who have plastic minds and personalities that defy the taxonomy of 'straight' 'bi' or 'gay'. I call 'queer' or 'questioning' any child who feels the need either to expand definitions of gender (some prefer the term 'gender-expansive') or to push against the boundaries of who they are allowed to find attractive. Queer children should be able to find quirky, colourful, even lovable characters who, like themselves, are different in one crucial aspect of who they are. It is important that we make accessible to them books that have such characters in them.

In her 1990 article 'Mirrors, Windows, and Sliding Glass Doors' Rudine Sims Bishop says: ""When children cannot find themselves reflected in the books they read, or when the images they see are distorted, negative, or laughable, they learn a powerful lesson about how they are devalued in the society of which they are a part."" It is one thing to be able to see queer characters in films or on television as children today can, but in reading children are able to know those characters at their own pace, in a deeper and far more sensitive way. There is a strong need to have queer characters in children's stories, queer literature in children's libraries—meant not just for queer kids but all kids—or even to create children's queer libraries. For a child to know, for instance, that it is possible for them to express their gender as they experience it, or to feel deeply for a person of any gender, whether those feelings go on to be physically expressed or not once they grow up, is a reassurance that is priceless.

Such books do exist. Princess Princess Ever After by Katie O'Neill and King and King by Linda de Haan and Stern Nijland queer the usual pairing of different-gender royal couples by having same-gender ones live happily ever after. The Boy & the Bindi by the Toronto-based writer Vivek Shraya is about a young Indian boy's fascination with his mother's bindi, who doesn't chastise him for wearing one. One of a Kind, Like Me by Laurin Mayeno is the story of Danny, who knows exactly what he will be in tomorrow's school parade: a princess. He and his mom race to a thrift store to find him a costume.

In two articles on bookriot.com, Kelly Jensen has listed 26 English-language LGBTQ books for middle-school children while adding that some of these books are either out of print or hard to find in print format. Some with different strands of queerness are: The Boy in the Dress by David Williams, about a boy who among various interests like soccer also enjoys wearing dresses; George by Alex Gino and Gracefully Grayson by Ami Polonsky, each about a child who knows she's a girl inside but is seen by everyone else as a boy. The Other Boy by M.G. Hennessey is about a trans boy who is threatened by a classmate with having his secret revealed. In Kiss by Jacqueline Wilson, a girl has a crush on a boy, but he is interested in another boy. When he kisses him resulting in gay-bashing, she and another friend try to protect his feelings.

Noddy and Big Ears who share a house and a bed got censored in England. George in The Famous Five is fairly clearly 'different.' So are the main characters in the Wizard of Oz

Books need not be exclusively or explicitly classified as ""LGBTQ"" either for a queer child to identify with the characters. Such books may still face opposition for addressing or including queerness. Ruth Vanita, the author who has extensively researched queer representation, draws attention to characters in children's literature ""who are now read as gay and even get censored for that. For example, Noddy and Big Ears who share a house and a bed got censored in England. George in The Famous Five is fairly clearly 'different.' So are the main characters in the Wizard of Oz, barring Dorothy. The two lead characters in the children's Hindi comics and videos, Motu Patlu, are single and live together, sometimes sharing a bed. In other words,"" she concludes, ""before the current labels there were plenty of such 'different' characters.""

Queerness, in the sense of outside the normative, can also include such realities as alternate family structures or intense friendships between children of the same gender. In Heather Has Two Mommies by Leslea Newman, Heather and her classmates draw their respective families - and no two look the same. An article by Mridula Chari talks about the challenges facing such books in India while listing some of them: Shals Mahajan's Timmi in Tangles touches on families with single parents. Balaji Venkataraman's Flat Track Bullies has a child who takes off over the summer holiday to spend time with Durai, the son of his family's domestic help. These books are important milestones in Indian children's literature, but it must be remembered that they are few and far between, and the ones mentioned here are restricted to English language publishing. They would be a welcome addition to any library, and there are many shelves to be filled.

A queer book can be a place for confession and validation. In there lie the possibilities of a communion between just the child and the book.

How is a queer-inclusive library to be envisioned? It would mean, for one, a place where adults are more supportive than not. No child is kept from reading a particular age-appropriate book because an adult doesn't approve of the story. Nor are they scolded for reading something related to bodies, gender and sexuality, as happens all too often. Adults don't realise that such attitudes result in an internalised fear in children of talking about these things and they end up becoming more vulnerable to abuse. As it is growing up is a lonely experience for kids who feel they do not fit in. A queer book can be a place for confession and validation. In there lie the possibilities of a communion between just the child and the book. It is in there that the child may whisper little secrets, secrets that do not face the danger of being betrayed or exploited. A queer library would also make accessible these books to children of parents who cannot afford to buy them but are open to them.

Finally, why should a 'straight' child read such stories, some may ask. As Danika Ellis says in her wonderful article Kids Need Queer Books, ""Because some kids are queer. And those kids who aren't will be sharing a planet with people who are."" It is no secret that children learn to make value judgments about markers of identities: skin colour, food habits, class, caste, relationships. It is in childhood that we learn the process of 'othering' and so, in childhood that the interventions must begin. By crossing these seemingly insurmountable barriers of talking about non-normative gender identities or same-gender desire, we can normalise them and start to make a difference in the attitudes and lives of children.

The very act of reading stories written and illustrated especially for children is one of the children identifying with the characters or creatures in the book, empathising with their experiences. Children will have to live among all sorts of people--queer, disabled or of a different faith. If a child is told the story of two princes who kiss, or two women who together bring up a child, they will be the better for it. The question: 'Is there something odd about me?' may happily disappear in the shelves of the queer-inclusive library.

En resumidas cuentas, tu ansiedad personal no produce ningún efecto positivo en el mundo que te rodea.
Tal y como le dijo una activista a la que entrevistó, ""la acción es el antídoto contra la desesperación"".","Escrito por Julie Beck.

Cuando el New York Magazine publicó un artículo a principios de julio sobre los peligros del cambio climático, mucha gente de todo el mundo lo compartió con preocupación. Tuiteaban cosas como ""Lean esto y empiecen a preocuparse de verdad"" y demás comentarios que querían imponer el temor y la preocupación como la única reacción moralmente válida.

Reproducían el tono dramático del artículo, que empieza diciendo: ""La situación es, lo prometo, mucho peor de lo que piensan"" y añade: ""Por muy informados que estén, seguro que aún no estan lo suficientemente alarmados"".

Resulta extraño que sugiera que existe un nivel de alarma que sería ""suficiente"". ¿Suficiente para qué? Aunque el objetivo sea preocupar a la gente para ponerla en marcha, hay un importante error de planteamiento: la ansiedad no es un prerrequisito para la acción.

Mi compañero, Robinson Meyer, ha puesto en duda cómo de realistas son las sombrías perspectivas que expone el artículo, lamentablemente no en el plano científico, sino con respecto a su llamada explícita (y la de quienes le hacen caso) a la histeria colectiva. Aunque la intención pueda ser buena, convertir la preocupación en una cuestión moral distrae del objetivo real: hace que la gente se centre en su estado emocional para sentirse bien en lugar de mover a la acción para abordar el problema real.

Renee Lertzman, psicóloga experta en comunicación sobre el cambio climático, explica: ""Damos por hecho que si la gente se preocupa por lo urgente y aterrador que es un problema, esa preocupación se traducirá automáticamente en un: '¡Oh, Dios mío! ¿Qué acciones concretas puedo hacer para ayudar a solucionarlo?' Y la cosa no funciona así"".

Cuando las personas tienen ansiedad o miedo, quieren que los demás también lo tengan. Es algo contagioso. Renee Lertzman

Apelar a los sentimientos ha sido un pilar fundamental tanto en el mundo político como en el activismo, pero en la actualidad son nuestros propios contactos en las redes sociales quienes emplean constantemente esa estrategia.

Una cosa son los llamamientos de asociaciones antirracistas como Black Lives Matter para concienciarnos y darnos un toque de atención, y otra muy distinta es que algunos vayan mucho más allá y difundan publicaciones destinadas a sembrar la histeria colectiva sobre los asuntos que les preocupan. Comparten artículos sobre el cambio climático y hacen una especie de llamado a la preocupación. Comparten casos reales sobre injusticias y animan a todo aquel que los vea a enojarse.

Ahora, con cada nuevo escándalo del presidente Donald Trump, sus opositores hacen llamamientos a la indignación. Desde distintos flancos del Internet, hay gente empeñada en difundir el miedo de que los inmigrantes nos quiten los puestos de trabajo, de que Trump inicie una guerra nuclear o de que los liberales les quiten el derecho a poseer armas.

Este tipo de comentarios en las redes sociales son ""una manera que tienen algunas personas de manejar la ansiedad. Cuando las personas tienen ansiedad o miedo, quieren que los demás también lo tengan. Es algo contagioso"", intuye Renee Lertzman.

Conforme las redes sociales han permitido que las noticias falsas se difundan sin ningún tipo de filtro a través de grupos de gente que opinan muy parecido sobre un tema, también han permitido que la ansiedad circule y se convierta en un remolino.

""Tanto los republicanos como los demócratas debaten sobre lo que más temen. Esa ansiedad llega cuando la gente tiene miedo. Así que hay que tener cuidado"", opina Morrow Carter, presidenta de la empresa de comunicación y estrategia política Cater Communications.

Las redes sociales y su flujo de noticias falsas han permitido que la ansiedad circule y se convierta en un remolino.

Yo pensaba que pasarse el día entero preocupado por los problemas del mundo era imposible, pero Scott Woodruff, director del programa de tratamiento de la ansiedad y de trastornos obsesivos compulsivos en el Instituto Americano para Terapia Cognitiva, me sorprendió: ""Una mente preocupada o con ansiedad se las puede apañar para seguir dándole vueltas a los mismos temas una y otra vez, así que sí que es posible que haya gente que pase una gran parte del día preocupándose por los problemas mundiales"".

Los estudios han demostrado que la ansiedad puede influir negativamente en la toma de decisiones y en la memoria de trabajo: ""Una preocupación excesiva puede provocar cansancio, falta de concentración y rigidez muscular. Lo curioso es que el cansancio y la falta de concentración son justo lo contrario de lo que quieren conseguir quienes reivindican la preocupación"", explica Scott Woodruff.

Si el estrés y la preocupación pasan a ser crónicos, Renee Lertzman advierte que ""la gente acaba desbordada. Se consumen, cortocircuitan y acaban dándoles la espalda a los problemas que más les preocupan"".

Así sucede en ocasiones con grupos activistas. Cher Weixia Chen, catedrática en la Universidad George Mason de Virginia (Estados Unidos), estudia el fenómeno del desgaste por compasión de los activistas. En diversas entrevistas realizadas a activistas, se ha percatado de que las causas más comunes de este fenómeno son las disputas internas del grupo, la ""cultura del martirio"" (que elogia el exceso de trabajo por encima del cuidado personal) y ""un exceso de sensibilidad a las injusticias, que hace que el lento proceso del cambio social sea complicado de afrontar"".

Los activistas depositan una gran carga emocional en su trabajo, algo que, según esta catedrática, ""incrementa el riesgo de desilusión y desesperación cuando los objetivos les superan"". En ocasiones, por su propia salud, se ven en la obligación de dar un paso al lado y dejar el activismo.

Los síntomas de este desgaste emocional incluyen depresión, ansiedad, dolores de cabeza y demás dolencias físicas, consumo de sustancias, pérdida de productividad y problemas de concentración. La experiencia de uno de los activistas de su estudio va en la línea de lo que más arriba defendía Scott Woodruff sobre cómo empeñarse en estar preocupados puede resultar contraproducente:

""Estaba perdiendo la capacidad de pensar con normalidad y la creatividad. No era capaz de ver qué estaba pasando ni de idear una estrategia efectiva para evitarlo. Estaba como si hubiera perdido el rumbo. Tenía la mente farragosa y me sentía incapaz de hacer nada de provecho"".

Cher Weixia Chen, quien se considera tanto educadora como activista, opina que aquellas personas que tratan de concienciar a los demás en las redes sociales podrían ser susceptibles de sufrir un desgaste similar: ""Esta nueva era del activismo ciudadano es una noticia positiva para el activismo social, históricamente hablando, pero hay que hallar la manera de que sea sostenible. Estoy muy preocupada"".

Parte del problema es que las personas piensan que deben estar preocupadas, que preocuparse es una buena forma de contribuir a la causa. Se conectan a su Twitter y Facebook y ven que sus amigos insisten en el mensaje: ""Sí, preocúpate"". ¿Y qué pasa si no lo haces?

Muchos tenemos a veces la sensación de que si algo nos parece importante, debemos preocuparnos por ello, porque eso nos hace mejores personas, pero no, no necesitamos estar preocupados para ser buenas personas. Scott Woodruff

Sobre las ocasiones en que la gente incita a los demás a alarmarse, comenta Scott Woodruff: ""Lo traduzco en que creen que cuanta más preocupación y ansiedad sientan, más nobles son. Muchas personas tenemos a veces la sensación de que si algo nos parece importante, debemos preocuparnos por ello, porque eso nos hace mejores personas, pero no, no necesitamos estar preocupados para ser buenas personas"".

A veces la preocupación funciona como una especie de superstición o pensamiento mágico. Nos puede ""dar una ilusión de control"", argumenta Scott Woodruff. ""Ese pensamiento puede desarrollarse: 'Si me preocupo por esto, estaré a salvo"". Pero así, muchas personas pueden confundir ansiedad con acción.

Rosemary Randall, psicoterapeuta residente en Cambridge (Inglaterra), declara que ha detectado esta actitud en aquellas personas que tienen miedo a volar. Aunque trate con ellos ese tema a fondo y consiga que sus pacientes reconozcan de forma consciente que su preocupación no puede impedir un accidente, ""les sigue resultando muy muy difícil superar el 'debo preocuparme o el avión se estrellará'. Piensan que si dejan de preocuparse no estarán a salvo"".

Muchas personas pueden confundir ansiedad con acción.

Aunque varias de las personas con las que he hablado aseguran que apelar al miedo para mover a la acción no funciona y puede resultar incluso contraproducente, hay pruebas de que sí funciona. Dolores Albarracín, profesora de psicología en la Universidad de Illinois, realizó un metaanálisis en 2015 de todas las investigaciones disponibles sobre llamadas al miedo y descubrió que, en términos generales, provocar miedo sí que cambia la actitud de la gente, sus intenciones y su comportamiento. Además, no detectaron ningún tipo de efecto contraproducente.

Sin embargo, los estudios analizados por la profesora Albarracín incluían actuaciones recomendadas. ""Si el mensaje no tiene medidas que se puedan llevar a la práctica, no vas a lograr ningún efecto"".

Aunque hay gente que sí que publica propuestas concretas, no deja de haber publicaciones del estilo de ""todo el mundo a escandalizarse con esto"", que provocan emociones, pero no mueven a la acción. Seguro que cuando estas personas irritan y sacan de quicio a otras personas lo hacen con la intención de encontrar una solución al problema que les preocupa, pero no lo van a conseguir si no proponen algo que puedan hacer.

""Asustan a los demás porque están asustados ellos. Todo tiene que ver con el pánico"", explica Rosemary Randall, que ha estudiado los comportamientos derivados de las noticias del cambio climático: ""Es como gritar ¡fuego! en un recinto cerrado, algo que sabemos que no es una buena idea. Es mucho más sensato decir: 'señoras y señores, tenemos un pequeño problema en el cine. Rogamos que la primera fila se levante y salga. Ahora la segunda fila, etcétera"".

Cuando una persona está expuesta a demasiado sufrimiento o a demasiadas peticiones de ayuda, se produce en su mente una reducción de la empatía y una pérdida de interés.

Si al entrar a Facebook te da la sensación de que alguien ha abierto la puerta del cine para gritar ""¡fuego!"", esa abrumadora cantidad de mensajes podría perder su eficacia. ""Al final, la compasión de la gente puede cansar"", indica Cher Weixia Chen, quien explica que es un fenómeno por el que, cuando una persona está expuesta a demasiado sufrimiento o a demasiadas peticiones de ayuda, se produce en su mente una reducción de la empatía y una pérdida de interés en el sufrimiento ajeno.

""No creo que los mensajes que incitan al miedo sean responsables ni respetables, simplemente considero que nos encontramos en un momento de la historia en el que aún no dominamos la influencia de la tecnología en nuestra forma de comunicarnos, así que es la tecnología la que nos domina a nosotros"", piensa Morrow Carter.

""Considero que hay estrategias mejores que meter miedo, pero eso no significa que el miedo sea ineficaz"", declara la profesora Albarracín.

Según los metaanálisis de la profesora Albarracín, las llamadas al miedo funcionan mejor para promover comportamientos aislados como ir a hacerse un análisis al médico para ver si has contraído una enfermedad, pero pierden eficacia cuando se trata de propósitos continuados a largo plazo.

Sería mucho más fácil asustar a alguien para que realizara una única donación grande que para que se enrolara en una organización benéfica en la que tuviera que asistir a reuniones periódicas, por ejemplo.

Necesitamos muchas menos publicaciones y mucho más diálogo.

En cuanto a cuál sería el mejor modo de comunicar, Renee Lertzman sostiene: ""Necesitamos muchas menos publicaciones y mucho más diálogo. En lugar de mandar un mensaje que diga: 'Urgente, dona dinero o firma aquí si no quieres que las secuoyas se extingan', sería mejor algo como 'Parece que todo está en peligro y quizás te sientas impotente y triste. Por eso ahora es más importante que nunca que trabajemos juntos'. Es un enfoque más orientado a crear una cierta relación con el interlocutor.

Para aquellas personas que quieran proteger su salud mental y no sentirse tan desbordadas como para perder el interés en aquello que les importa, Scott Woodruff aconseja distinguir entre ""ansiedad y actuación positiva, así como discernir entre la preocupación productiva y la improductiva"".

En resumidas cuentas, tu ansiedad personal no produce ningún efecto positivo en el mundo que te rodea. Preocuparse no es actuar, y saber lo que pasa tampoco lo es. Rosemary Randall advierte de los peligros de caer en la trampa de obsesionarse con un problema: ""Sea cual sea el problema, una vez que hayas descubierto de qué trata, detente, es suficiente. En ese momento tienes que decidir qué vas a hacer al respecto"". Tal y como le dijo una activista a la que entrevistó, ""la acción es el antídoto contra la desesperación"".

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the chance for a feminist revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement is something that Canada and Mexico ""can't afford"" to miss.

Trudeau addressed Mexico's Senate Friday, where he lauded the country for supporting Canada's push to see a gender chapter added to NAFTA .

""With the opportunity in front of us to update a decades-old agreement, this is a progressive step forward that we can't afford not to take,"" Trudeau said.

The prime minister also called for more to be done to advance gender equality in both countries. As he did at the United Nations weeks ago, Trudeau touched on why many Indigenous women and girls feel unsafe in Canada.

Violence against women and girls is prevalent in all facets of life, from the studios of Hollywood to the digital public squares to our own halls of Parliament. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

""We're dealing with an ongoing national tragedy related to missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls,"" he said. ""We must do better at home.""

But the prime minister added that civil society leaders in Mexico City Thursday told him other ""unacceptable"" tales of abuse faced by women and girls.

Trudeau obliquely referenced the numerous sexual harassment and assault allegations levied against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and drew a parallel to accusations that have also rocked Canada's Parliament in recent years.

""Everywhere we look, violence against women and girls is prevalent in all facets of life, from the studios of Hollywood to the digital public squares to our own halls of Parliament,"" Trudeau said.

Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Mexico's first lady Angelica Rivera make a toast during a dinner ceremony at the presidential palace in Mexico City, Mexico on Oct. 12, 2017.

""As a gender-balanced Senate, I challenge you to use your position of power to continue to strongly push for the rights of women and girls, in Mexico and around the world.""

Those remarks drew a standing ovation from those in the chamber.

Trudeau removed two Liberal MPs from his caucus in 2014 amid accusations of sexual harassment made by two female NDP MPs. In August, MP Darshan Kang resigned from the Liberal caucus after two women, including a staffer, accused him of harassment.

Disgraced senator Don Meredith resigned from the upper chamber in May when he was facing possible expulsion for having a sexual relationship with a teenage girl. Members of Meredith's former staff also told HuffPost Canada the former senator sexually harassed and mistreated aides for years.

Canada won't abandon NAFTA, Trudeau says:​

Trade experts have suggested a gender chapter in NAFTA could end up being largely symbolic.

The Canadian Press reported last month that such a chapter would likely be modelled after Canada's trade deal with Chile, which reaffirmed each nation's commitment to international agreements on gender rights and set up a committee to oversee that work.

However, the pact also made clear that nothing in the gender chapter would be subject to the dispute resolution mechanisms that apply to the rest of the deal.

Conservative foreign affairs critic Erin O'Toole urged Liberals last month to focus on job creation in NAFTA negotiations, and cautioned against what he dubbed ""virtue signalling"" on gender, environmental and Indigenous issues.

It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to.
Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals.","For a long time, the way philanthropy worked was simple: Rich people gave their money to museums and churches and opera houses and Harvard. Their names went up on buildings, charities gave them made-up awards, their grandkids went to rehab, the Earth went around the sun. But philanthropy is changing. Today's billionaires are less interested in legacy institutions, less obsessed with prestige and perpetuity. Part of this is a function of their age: In 2012, 4 percent of America’s biggest charitable donations were made by people under 50 years old. In 2014, a quarter of them were. The other factor driving the new philanthropists is how they earned their money in the first place. Last year, six of the 10 largest charitable donations in the United States came from the tech sector, solidifying Silicon Valley’s place as the epicenter of the newer, bigger, disrupty-er philanthropy. There, tech billionaires form “giving circles” to share leads on promising charities, and they hire the same consultants to vet them. They use terms like “hacker philanthropy” and “effective altruism.” These guys—they are mostly guys—believe that they became successful businessmen by upending existing institutions, by scaling simple ideas, by ""breaking shit."" And, with few exceptions, that is how they plan to become successful philanthropists, too. All of this became much more relevant in December, when Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they were giving 99 percent of their wealth to charity. The total amount they pledged, around $45 billion in Facebook shares at current valuation, exceeds the endowments of the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations combined. If Zuckerberg gives away the upper limit of what he announced in December, $1 billion per year for the next three years, he will likely become the world’s second-largest charitable donor after Bill Gates. He is 31 years old.

Give Early, Give Billions 4 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 25 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 2012 2014 Percentage of the biggest philanthropic donations that came from people under 50.

Zuckerberg’s ability to remake the world in his own image, in his own lifetime, is unprecedented. Andrew Carnegie opened his first library when he was 68, and only managed to get around $5 billion in today’s dollars out the door before he died. John D. Rockefeller, generally considered the most generous industrialist in history, launched his foundation when he was 76, and only gave away around half his fortune. If he wanted to, Zuckerberg could eradicate polio, or de-neglect half a dozen tropical diseases, or fix all the water pipes in Flint, or give $9,000 to every single one of the world's refugees. But $45 billion, as a former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grantee put it, is ""a 1,000-pound gorilla."" You don't give away that much money without changing the places and institutions and people you give it to, sometimes for the worse. Zuckerberg should already know this. In 2010, he donated $100 million to the Newark Public Schools on a promise from Cory Booker that he could, according to Dale Russakoff's The Prize, ""flip a whole city."" Zuckerberg rode into Newark with the suddenness of a software update. He was determined to end the stalemate between the teachers’ union and the district, establish dozens of new charter schools and close down failing public ones. Oh, and establish a model that could be replicated in urban school districts all over the country. All in just five years. Needless to say, it didn't happen. Up to $20 million of the donation went to consultants, scrappy little MBAs charging $1,000 a day to develop, among other things, an algorithm that assigned thousands of children to new schools. And nobody bothered to ask parents or teachers whether they wanted to be flipped, causing a ton of resentment that ultimately slowed everything down. By 2015, Zuckerberg was touting Newark's charter schools, with 14,000 students, as a success. Meanwhile, its public schools, with 35,000 students, were announcing a budget deficit of $65 million and layoffs of up to 30 percent of their staff. As Antony Bugg-Levine, the CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, told me, the hard part about social change “is that it doesn’t scale like a social network.” I’ve spent the last few months talking to more than 40 researchers, development practitioners, foundation employees and other Silicon Valley philanthropists, asking them about the difficult business of giving money away. They told me about their own Newarks: Promising ideas scaled into oblivion, donations that disappeared into corrupt governments, groupthink disguised as insight. But they also told me about projects that worked, that scaled, that matched the ambitions of the new philanthropy while avoiding its blind spots. And it turns out that some of the best ideas are the ones Zuckerberg is the least likely to hear in Silicon Valley.

Don’t Be Seduced By Technology

Since December I've been studying Zuckerberg’s Facebook posts like a Talmudic scholar, looking for hints of what he's interested in, trying to figure out the investments and bets and mistakes he's going to make. So far he’s light on specifics, mostly speaking in gushy bromides about ""connecting people"" and ""building strong communities."" But if there is one clear, undeniable, overriding theme that emerges, it is this: Zuckerberg believes in the power of technology to transform the world. ""We must build technology to make change,"" he wrote last fall. ""Many institutions invest money in these challenges, but most progress comes from productivity gains through innovation."" He's not wrong. Nearly every social advance in history has technology somewhere near the center of it—the aqueduct, the steam train, the birth control pill. And whenever you start asking people about the life-altering potential of Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and the tech-based philanthropy he represents, the first words you're likely to hear are “The Green Revolution.” In 1975, nearly three out of five people in Asia lived on less than $1 a day. Rains at the wrong time of year meant the difference between starvation and survival. Then, researchers funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations created new crops—varieties that grew taller, needed less water and could be planted year-round. Over the next 30 years, this innovation radically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Rice yields spiked by 1,000 percent. Wheat got cheaper, healthier and more abundant. Norman Borlaug, the scientist who developed the new wheat varieties, won the Nobel Prize.

It's understandable to be seduced by this story. America spent more than 100 years going from a poor agrarian society to a rich urban one. Technology, the development agencies and the foundations tell you, has the potential to ""leapfrog"" this process for the next batch of countries, to boost poor communities into the middle class without all the messy slave labor and cholera we went through on the way. But as Kentaro Toyama, a former Gates Foundation consultant and the author of Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology, points out, it’s not the development of technology that leads to social change, but the application of it. The Green Revolution, he says, wasn't just a case of ""new crops, big changes."" At the same time the farmers were planting the higher-yield crops, governments were dramatically reforming their agricultural policies. Between 1972 and 1990, Asian countries nearly tripled their investments in agriculture. They provided subsidized loans for farmers to buy fertilizer, trained them in how to plant the new crops and built roads and canals to get their produce to markets. In 1970, only 12 percent of the agricultural land in Bangladesh was irrigated. By 1995, 38 percent of it was. ""Technology,"" Toyama says, ""is the easiest part of any solution."" The hard part is everything that comes afterward. Take car crashes, which kill more people every year than tuberculosis or pulmonary disease. The technology to prevent these deaths—seat belts, motorcycle helmets—is not rocket science. It's just that no one has figured out how to make it appeal to the people who need it, especially in the developing world, where 90 percent of these deaths occur. Sometimes technological solutions aren't up against indifference, but outright resistance. In the ’80s, a global health NGO called PATH got a grant to develop Uniject, a pre-filled, single-use syringe designed for midwives or birth attendants to inject patients in their homes. The syringe was ready in the mid-1990s, but more than 15 years later, it had only been rolled out in one developing country. The others had laws that prohibited anyone but doctors from giving injections. ""Lots of new technologies require policy changes to be effective,"" says Michael Free, the former director of product development for PATH. ""Getting buy-in for that takes a lot longer."" All these snags, though, are too complicated for the clean ""leapfrogging"" narrative you hear from the techno-utopians—and from Zuckerberg himself. ""A few months ago I learned about a farmer in Maharashtra called Ganesh,"" Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed in the Times of India in December. ""Last year Ganesh started using Free Basics [Facebook's no-cost Internet service for developing countries]. He found weather information to prepare for monsoon season. He looked up commodity prices to get better deals. Now Ganesh is investing in new crops and livestock."" This, too, is tempting to swallow whole. If farmers knew the prices they'd get for their produce, they could choose the market offering the highest price, or plant more profitable crops in the first place. Entire communities could be changed by the simple injection of information. The only published evidence of this effect in the real world, though, is a 2007 study that showed fishermen in Kerala, India, checking prices for their fish before deciding which port to sell them to. These fishermen sell a perishable good. They have to sell it to someone, they have to sell it today and it's the same distance back to the shore regardless of which port they pick. But the typical African or Indian farmer does not live perfectly equidistant from several produce markets. One might take an hour to get to, the other 10. And when farmers in developing countries buy seeds, they are not comparison-shopping between dozens of stores. They have just a few options, and often have to go through village middlemen or loan sharks. ""Even when you have the information,"" Toyama says, ""you're not in a situation where you can get any benefit from it."" Also, when “leapfrogging” happens, it can be less of a jump and more of a step. The Kerala study, which sounds so transformative, only boosted incomes for fishermen by around 8 percent, and reduced the price of fish for consumers by 4 percent. It didn’t turn poor fishermen into white-collar workers, and it didn’t give a broad swath of the population access to more nutritious food. And guess what? That's fine! If there's one piece of advice that emerges from the last 50 years of the tech-for-the-poor hope and disappointment cycle, it is this: Chase the 8 percents. Zuckerberg has interest and expertise in technology, and there's nothing inherently wrong with making bets on gadgets or innovations that have the potential to help the poor. But as he does so, he should acknowledge that the silver-bullet promise of technology only works at changing the world when it's combined with political will and popular demand. Until he finds a way to engineer those (please don't), he should focus on the small ways, at the margins, where technology can improve people's lives, 8 percent at a time.

$45 Billion Isn't That Much Money

In 2001, the Gates Foundation gave PATH and the World Health Organization $70 million, 10 years and a simple objective: Develop a vaccine for meningitis A and make it affordable for every single person who needs it. At the time, meningitis A was concentrated in one part of the world, a stripe across the middle of sub-Saharan Africa known as the ""meningitis belt."" The disease mostly affected children, causing them to die or become paralyzed in minutes. The yearly outbreaks were predictable. Where they would happen, and how severely, were not. Eventually, PATH developed a vaccine that gave patients 15 years of immunity. At a cost of around 50 cents a dose, public health departments in every country in the meningitis belt could afford to procure it at scale. By 2013, less than a decade after an outbreak killed 25,000 people, the meningitis belt had just four reported cases. Marc LaForce headed the team in charge of bringing the vaccine to market. He says it wasn't just the scale of the Gates donation that mattered, but its duration. In those days, most grants were capped at two or three years, with check-ins every six months. Years of work could be wiped away if a donor decided progress was moving too slowly and pulled out. ""If you want to do something major,"" LaForce says, ""you need the ability to go two steps forward, then one step back."" Plus, the Gates team left LaForce alone. Back then, the foundation only employed about a dozen people who worked out of a small office in a residential neighborhood of Seattle. Staffers spent their time making lists of diseases, ranking them by annual fatalities, then calling around to find out which ones were closest to being cured. “We didn’t need to be specialists,” says Gordon Perkin, the foundation’s first director of global health. “We just needed to know which organizations had the judgment and the infrastructure, and we gave them money.” This story doesn't just illustrate the potential of philanthropy. It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to. Because one way to look at his $45 billion is that it's a lot of money. Another way to look at it is that it's about what the United States spends on prisons every six months. Or education every four weeks. Or health care every five days. Even at a scale that large, efficiency matters. It’s shocking just how unusual that early Gates grant was. Most legacy foundations pay consultants millions of dollars to study and re-study problems before they give grants toward solving them. The Ford Foundation spends nearly $1 for every $4 it gives away. In 2013, the Rockefeller Foundation’s largest grant recipient (other than its offshoot, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors), was Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm. “All the work was to provide advice on internal decision-making,” a former Rockefeller employee told me. “To make it seem charitable we'd ask them to write a blog on our website, and that would frequently be the only public or charitable thing to come out of these multimillion-dollar so-called grants.” (In a statement, the Rockefeller Foundation defended its approach, saying that it “has developed a rigorous model on how to determine the problems we support, and ultimately the solutions that we believe will create the most impact.”)

Won't Somebody Please Think of the Consultants? $146.4M What the Ford Foundation spent in 2013 deciding how to give its money away $539.1M What the Ford Foundation gave away

The Gates Foundation, as it's expanded to more than 1,300 employees, has become prone to the same bloat, the same ""expert-itis,"" as a former grantee calls it. ""They hired Ph.D.s in biotech and all they wanted to do was the science that the grantees were doing."" As the staff proliferated, so did the conditions on the donations. The foundation started requiring grantees to keep track of baggage fees and told them they couldn't buy laptops or let their overhead go above 15 percent. ""Grant approval processes went from 48 hours to 48 months,"" the former grantee told me. (The Gates Foundation responded, too: “While each grant agreement is unique, we have policies in place to help ensure that our funds are spent as effectively as possible."") It’s hard to overstate just how un-Silicon Valley all of this is. ""Money is sitting there to make the world a better place, and to dole it out cautiously is antithetical to why it’s there,"" says Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, a foundation set up by Mitch Kapor, an early investor in Uber and other unicorns. I heard similar arguments from almost all the tech people I talked to: Zuckerberg shouldn't be afraid to fail; he should approach philanthropy like a venture capitalist, testing out ideas to scale up later on. Bypassing legacy institutions is what Silicon Valley CEOs are good at, right? All those consultants must strike them as the charity equivalent of taxi medallions. Still, running a charity does require fully understanding problems before you try to solve them. ""Move fast and break things"" is a fine mentality for Facebook, where the consequences of a few bad lines of code are mostly limited to a drop in revenue or an exodus of users to Snapchat. Applying the same philosophy to health or education or criminal justice has consequences that can't be shrugged away. In the 1990s, Western donors' emphasis on HIV/AIDS in Africa resulted in chronic under-funding of less-visible conditions like pneumonia, anemia and diarrhea. Zuckerberg's donation in Newark resulted in public schools being closed and some kids having to walk through rough neighborhoods to charter schools far from their homes. And it’s this neglected zone, somewhere between bloat and ""break things,"" where Zuckerberg has the opportunity to do something quietly, unsexily awesome. The U.S. has more than 85,000 foundations and 1.5 million charities. Most major charitable causes, things like curing cancer, regularizing immigration and providing early education, are already covered by dozens of capable—and overlapping—organizations. In its annual survey of philanthropists, Grantmakers for Effective Organizations reported that 80 percent of donors wanted to see more collaboration between their grantees. But only 13 percent were willing to consistently pay for it. The need for coordination is obvious when you look at the scale of the problems that philanthropists want to solve. Again, studying Gates’ early years is instructive. When he decided he wanted to vaccinate hundreds of millions of African kids, he didn't set up an organization that would replace WHO or UNICEF or all the other agencies already handing out vaccines. Instead, he founded something called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—a funding pipeline designed to help those agencies work more effectively. Gavi pays pharmaceutical companies to research tropical diseases, it issues ""vaccine bonds"" so poor countries can buy millions of treatments on layaway, it orders medications in such bulk that the cost comes down to pennies. In short, it connects a network of actors who have similar interests—something Zuckerberg knows a thing or two about. So if he really wants to leverage the limited funding he has, Zuckerberg shouldn't think of himself as a venture capitalist. He should think of himself as a mutual fund manager. Find promising organizations, perform due diligence, link them to a portfolio of other agencies doing good work—then give them money and get out of their way. Or, as Patricia Stonesifer, the current CEO of Martha's Table and the former CEO of the Gates Foundation, puts it, “Don’t expect to be the only solution out there.”

Capitalism: The Cause of, and Solution to, All of Life’s Problems

What Zuckerberg actually announced last December wasn't a big fat donation to charity. All he did was establish a limited liability company (LLC) and issue a promise that he would use it for good. Much of the reaction at the time was suspicious, speculating that an LLC was a scheme for Zuckerberg to avoid taxes (which isn't true) or that it would allow him to spend mountains of money without disclosing how he was doing so (which is). But the corporate approach actually makes a lot of sense. Under the standard philanthropic model, billionaires set up a foundation and give it a huge endowment. Every year, the foundation has to give away at least 5 percent of its total value. Meanwhile, the other 95 percent gets invested in blue chip stocks, hedge funds, foreign currencies, whatever will keep the total endowment the same size. That's how foundations like Rockefeller and Ford exist in perpetuity: Do-gooders work on one side of the building finding things to donate to, while bankers work on the other side, making sure there's more to donate next year. Recently, though, donors have started to reject this model. Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals. Besides, why should 95 percent of your money just sit there in hedge funds and Halliburton stock, especially if you think you can do just as much good with the money you invest as the money you give away? ""This idea that philanthropy is only about nonprofits is an outdated model,"" says Paula Goldman, a vice president at the Omidyar Network. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, was one of the most prominent tech billionaires to merge his investing and grant-making. The foundation still gives donations, but the LLC provides loans and seed capital and invests in things like solar-powered lighting startups, Brazilian test-prep companies and funds that discover Indian entrepreneurs. Zuckerberg is going even further, giving up on a foundation entirely and putting all of his charity money in a corporate form with no limits on how to spend it. He’s not interested in making his money back. He just wants the flexibility to fund charities or companies or both. Which explains why one of Zuckerberg’s most recent donations wasn’t a donation at all. It was $10 million in seed capital for an education startup called Bridge International Academies, a chain of private elementary schools that wants to deliver education to the world's poorest students. Bridge’s model, which has only been rolled out in Kenya so far, is based on standardization and accountability. Teachers get a centralized curriculum from Bridge experts, then deliver it to kids from an e-reader. Students—and teachers—are tracked in real time, principals notified of everything from attendance rates to busted pipes. The latest class of Bridge students just took their exams. Sixty percent passed, compared to the national average of 49 percent

It's tempting to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either.

The primary appeal of Bridge, especially to investors like Zuckerberg, is the $6 per month it says it charges its students. Operating as a business rather than a charity gives each school an incentive to deliver a decent education and ensures that it’s not going to wither away when development agencies or donors move on to the next idea. But the problem with dispatching private companies to supply basic services is that they replace the public systems already tasked with providing them. Last year, 116 African NGOs signed an open letter to Bridge International Academies and the World Bank, pointing out that $6 per month is in fact a lot of money for a lot of Kenyans. Bridge schools charge extra for uniforms and lunch. Its teachers earn around $90 per month, teaching classes as large as 70 students. Those pass rates 11 percent higher than the national average are great, but the letter also noted that Bridge, with 400 schools, has attracted more than $100 million in international investment. Meanwhile, Kenya's public system, with almost 20,000 schools, has gotten just $88 million. Lucy Bradlow, Bridge's global director of public relations, counters that the majority of Kenyan kids already attend private schools, many of which cost even more than Bridge and provide even less. In public schools, teacher absentee rates are so high that the average kid only gets two hours of instruction per day. She’s right: Bridge is a little bit better than what's already there. But the troubling part about the company isn't the service it provides now, but the one it wants to provide later. Bridge sees itself as a “model,” one that its backers believe can be spread across the entire developing world. It plans to be profitable once it serves 500,000 students. Eventually, it hopes to reach 10 million. Bridge's own marketing materials describe it as “a scalable Academy-in-a-Box solution.” But the history of philanthropy is littered with projects that helped the poor at a small scale, then made them worse off at a larger one. Microfinance started out small, too. The early trials were non-profit, and revenues were invested back into services that would help borrowers pay back their loans. Then, in the late 2000s, responding to donor pressure to be “sustainable,” microlending went private. Citibank, Barclays and Deutsche Bank established microfinance divisions. In 2007, one of the largest microlending banks, Mexico’s Compartamos Banco, even had an IPO, its executives earning millions loaning out money to women and poor farmers and charging interest rates as high as 195 percent. Since most loans were capped at a few hundred dollars, borrowers could only get enough money to set up informal businesses, stuff like selling fruit on the side of the road or giving rides on a scooter. As microloans flooded the market, small-scale services flooded entire economies. In Bangladesh, nearly 25 percent of the population took out a microloan. In Mexico, Compartamos’ customers were taking out new microloans to pay back the ones they already had. By scaling up too fast, microfinance ended up trapping people in the exact cycle—informal work, bottomless debt, low productivity—from which it was designed to free them.

How Microfinance Traps the Poor *As illustrated by someone we’ll call Joey Joey lives in a village. He earns $5 a day working on a farm. He doesn't want to do that anymore. One day, he takes out a microloan for $100. He opens a fruit stand that sells apples for 50 cents each. He sells around 20 a day, so now he’s earning $10. Success! But then the bank starts giving loans to lots of other people in the village, too. Suddenly everyone is selling apples, and Joey has to sell his for 25 cents each to compete. Now, he’s earning $5 a day again. And starting tomorrow, he owes the bank $10 every week to pay off his loan.

It's tempting to stop there, to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to just go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either. One of the most successful private-sector development projects of the last 10 years is M-PESA, the mobile-money system that allows people in Kenya to transfer money via their cell phones. Before the system launched, Kenyans sent money to each other by mail, or by giving envelopes full of cash to bus drivers. Replacing an inefficient, expensive system with a regularized one made everybody better off. That's not as easy to argue, in the long run, about education. So, when Zuckerberg hears pitches from companies seeking to solve the world's problems, he shouldn't ask them if they have a plan to grow, or an ambition to exist in perpetuity. He should ask himself whether he really wants them to replace the systems that already exist, or simply make them better. Because successful companies don't just disrupt other companies—they disrupt economies, governments and the people who depend on them. That's not something that Zuckerberg ever had to worry about, but he has to start.

Go Beyond Giving Directly

In 2009, four grad students came up with an audacious idea: Instead of giving poor people the things we think they need—bags of food, stacks of clothing, a pair of goats—what if we gave them enough money to decide for themselves? They called their charity GiveDirectly, and in 2011 they started doing exactly that. They went to villages in Kenya, found the poorest people living there and transferred $1,000 straight to their cell phones. Later, they came back to ask the villagers what they did with the money. Mostly, it turns out, the villagers spent it on better roofs, better food, paying off debts, starting up businesses. All the stuff the development system used to buy for them—but without any overhead. At first, no one wanted to fund an idea this outlandish. But then, GiveDirectly went to Silicon Valley. Google got in early, awarding the charity its Global Impact Award and dispatching the head of Google.org to sit on GiveDirectly’s board. Since then, GiveDirectly has grown like a Y Combinator startup, its budget ballooning from $700,000 in 2012 to $17.4 million in 2014. In 2013, Chris Hughes, Zuckerberg’s Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, hosted a coming-out party for the charity with the heads of Dropbox and General Catalyst Partners. Dustin Moskovitz, Zuckerberg's other Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, just handed GiveDirectly $25 million. At five years old, GiveDirectly is the most buzzed-about charity in Silicon Valley. What all this hype ignores, though, is that GiveDirectly's audacious idea has been around for decades. Post-disaster charities have been experimenting with cash transfers since the 1990s. In 2010, when floods deluged one-third of Pakistan, aid workers handed out 1.7 million debit cards pre-loaded with $230. As early as the 1980s, Latin American countries were handing out ""conditional"" cash grants, paying parents to send their kids to school or feed them balanced meals. Even the World Bank, not exactly a laboratory of revolutionary thinking, has poured more than $25 billion into ""social safety nets""—unemployment and pension benefits, basically—in developing countries. ""Welfare"" sounds a lot less “break shit” than transferring money to people via their cell phones, but it is, sorry everybody, the same thing. And that's exactly why Zuckerberg should be excited about giving money directly to poor people: Not because it is a new and revolutionary idea, but because it is an old and effective one—that’s only fulfilling a fraction of its potential. The challenge with direct cash payments, says Owen Barder, the director of Europe for the Center for Global Development, is getting them to all of the people who need them. The places where this strategy has worked well already had functioning banking sectors and national identification systems in place before a disaster struck. In Pakistan, humanitarian agencies used government data to identify the areas with the worst damage, then checked IDs to make sure the debit cards got to the people living there. Most poor countries, though, don't have these pipes laid down. Kenya's Hunger Safety Nets program, which gives cash to people at risk of starvation, took months to establish because payouts were distributed through local agents, whom people didn't trust, or ATMs, which people had never used before. Barder describes a scenario where, 10 minutes after an earthquake hits Nepal, all the people within five miles of the epicenter get $500 on their cell phones. That's a great idea. But it is, he says, a lot harder than it sounds. After the 2005 tsunami, low-caste populations in India were almost entirely excluded from cash transfers because they weren't registered in the national welfare system. In Indonesia, cash transfers were distributed through community leaders who had to come to a central planning center, then travel back to their constituencies with an envelope full of cash. In at least one case, bandits were waiting for them on the bus. The need for modernizing these systems is obvious. In 2009, India launched an ambitious—and largely unheralded—project to issue a 12-digit identification number to all 1.3 billion of its citizens. So far, it has spent around $880 million and registered 970 million people. The numbers are already being used to distribute unemployment checks and disaster relief. But as this effort moves to more remote populations, registering them gets harder. Some farmers have hands so worn the scanners can’t read their fingerprints. Laying down the pipes to get cash transfers to the first 75 percent of a population, the people who have birth certificates and cell phones, is relatively easy. Getting to the last 25 percent, the people one charity could never reach, is technical, slow, expensive and absolutely critical—a perfect project for Zuckerberg.

Directed by Raja Krishna Menon, who previously directed the Akshay Kumar blockbusterAirlift, Chef, is a film about Roshan Kalra, an Indian chef, working abroad. Roshan gets fired for assaulting a White man who had complained about the quality of food served. The chef who has a son back in India travels to Kochi to spend some time with him and learns that his ex-wife, a professional dancer, is dating a rich landlord. What ensues is a journey of self-realization for Roshan as he tries to start afresh while desperately trying to mend his old relationships. With a cast that also includes Padmapriya Janakiraman, Sobhita Dhulipala, Svar Kamble, Milind Soman, and Chandan Roy Sanyal, Chef is a remake of a 2014 American film of the same name, directed by Jon Favreau.

Although Chef is a modern slice-of-life film it offers much more. Without relying heavily on flashbacks, the movie succeeds in presenting us with the back stories of the key characters. For example, we are told how a young Roshan had run away from his house with the dream of becoming a cook and struggled to survive until he finally fulfilled his dream. This is achieved quite effectively through voiceovers, dialogues, and without any flashbacks. It is precisely what a film likeJab Harry Met Sejallacked. Today, Bollywood films are breaking free of the conventions while experimenting with more unconventional narrative tropes.

Chef is a cute little film about life, and what it takes to follow one's dreams. Saif Ali Khan shines in this flawed film marred by occasional pacing issues. The acting is solid all around. Chef features some memorable performances from the likes of Padmapriya Janakiraman, Svar Kamble, and Milind Soman. The film features a cameo from a promising young actor named Abhishek Kumar who is quite active on the Delhi theatre circuit, certainly one to look out for. Perhaps, the only weakling in the acting department is actress Sobhita Dhulipala who fails to match the intensity she exuded inRaman Raghav 2.0. The screenplay is rather weak but the direction and cinematography more or less make up for what the film lacks in the writing department. Chef is not your run-of-the-mill commercial entertainer but it is certainly a film that has enough to keep one engaged for the most part.

Indeed, most larger Canadian metros face a lower risk from automation.
The previous era of automation and ""robot shock"" struck manufacturing workers and communities hardest.
But the next wave promises to hit more vulnerable places and lower-paid service workers in particular.","Robots and automation promise to fundamentally transform our economy and society. The fear is that even as they liberate us from dangerous tasks at work and drudgery at home, they will eliminate most of the high-paying manufacturing jobs we have left today.

Canada and its metro areas, like most advanced countries, have already suffered a massive loss of good, family-supporting manufacturing jobs. Back in the 1970s, almost a fifth of Canadians were employed in manufacturing, today less than 10 per cent are.

The reality is that the new era of robots — and automation and computerization more generally — will not only likely lead to further losses of manufacturing jobs, but will hit hardest at the even larger number of routine service jobs which currently employ 6.3 million Canadians, 40 per cent of the workforce. Indeed, the jobs most at risk from future automation are not in manufacturing, but routine service positions like waiters and bartenders, taxi and limousine drivers, and retail jobs in clothing stores, department stores, sporting goods and musical instrument shops, and jobs in the motion picture and video industries.

But which of Canada's cities and metros face the greatest risk from robots and automation?

New Martin Prosperity Institute research conducted in collaboration with our colleague Shade Shutters of Arizona State University uses detailed occupational data from Statistics Canada's 2011 National Household Survey to identify the types of jobs most at risk from automation across Canada's 149 metros.

The dark purple circles on the map indicate the share of the population whose jobs are most at risk of automation; the larger the circle, the greater the risk.

The places where automation poses the greater risk to jobs are all smaller metros with between 6,000 and 50,000 total jobs. They are mainly concentrated in the manufacturing hub of southern Ontario, where seven of the 10 metros most at risk are located in this region.





Conversely, topping the list is Ottawa-Gatineau, which is one of Canada's most advanced knowledge economies with a large percentage of college grads and a large share of people employed in knowledge and professional jobs. Petawawa, Ont., home to a major Canadian military base, is next, followed by Kingston, Ont., home to Queen's University. Rimouski, Que. and St. John's, Nfld. round out the top five. Victoria, B.C. (a provincial capital and home to the University of Victoria is sixth. Lacombe, Alta., is seventh followed by Cape Breton, N.S., Fredericton, N.B., and Montreal.

Indeed, most larger Canadian metros face a lower risk from automation. In addition to Ottawa and Montreal, which number among the 10 metros least at risk, Toronto ranks 108 (57.9 percent), Vancouver 119 (57.3 percent), Calgary 132 (56.5 percent), and Edmonton, 120 (57.3 percent).

At the end of the day, the risks from automation fall most heavily on small metros with large shares of workers in blue-collar manufacturing and service jobs. Larger, denser cities and metros with more educated populations and greater shares of knowledge, professional, management, technology and creative jobs are far better poised to cope with automation.

The previous era of automation and ""robot shock"" struck manufacturing workers and communities hardest. But the next wave promises to hit more vulnerable places and lower-paid service workers in particular.

Unfortunately, automation — and the risk of job loss that comes with it — is just one more factor reflecting the deepening spatial inequality dividing the country, hitting hardest at the most vulnerable groups in the least advantaged places.

Dieser berühmte Satz von Franz Josef Strauß klang am Sonntag, den 24. September um 18.01 Uhr vielen in der Union in den Ohren. Die Union sollte das zweitschlechteste Ergebnis aller Zeiten erhalten, während sich die AfD als drittstärkste Kraft im Bundestag zum eigentlichen Wahlsieger erklärte.

Wenige hätten damit gerechnet, dass dem ""Schlafwahlkampf"" ein derart böses Erwachen folgen würde: keine eindeutige Koalitionsmehrheit, historischer Absturz der Volksparteien, die populistischen Neurechten als drittstärkste Kraft.

Klar ist: Nach dieser Wahl ist nichts wie zuvor. Das gilt trotz des vierten Wahlsieges in Folge (!) insbesondere für die Union: nach einem Verlust von über acht Prozentpunkten ist ""business as usual"" keine Option. Umso lauter werden die Rufe nach Veränderung.

Das ""Ob"" ist also nicht die Frage - entscheidend bleibt das ""Wie"": schon jetzt mehren sich die Stimmen, die die Geißel der Union in der AfD, als Ergebnis einer ""misslungenen"" Flüchtlingspolitik und dem Liberalismus der Bundeskanzlerin, sehen. Nur ein konservativer Rechtsruck könne die Union wieder in höhere Gefilde und die AfD ins politische Nirvana befördern.

Verführerisch, wie diese Auffassung angesichts des Wahlergebnisses scheint, sollte man in der Debatte jedoch all die Emotionen und voreiligen Gedankenspiele beiseitelassen. Denn nüchtern betrachtet wirkt diese Schlussfolgerung nicht nur falsch, sondern tatsächlich brandgefährlich - sie riskiert langfristig genau das Gegenteil von dem zu erreichen, was sie sich erhofft.

Irrglaube 1: Merkel hat das sicherheitspolitische Profil der Union zunichtegemacht

Widmen wir uns zunächst dem populärsten in konservativen Unionskreisen: Die Bundeskanzlerin ist für die Verluste ihrer Partei verantwortlich.

Leider übersehen die Merkel-Kritiker dabei, dass die Bundeskanzlerin einen erheblichen Anteil daran hatte, dass sich die Union den Wahlsieg sicherte: der ""Merkelfaktor"" lag hinter der Wahlentscheidung von sage und schreibe 38% der Unionswähler - bei keiner anderen Partei spielte der Spitzenkandidat eine so entscheidende Rolle.

Ebenso wird der Union - mehr als jeder anderen Partei - die größte Kompetenz dabei zugestanden, die Migrationskrise zu managen: der Vorsprung auf die zweitplatzierte SPD ist dabei nahezu doppelt so groß.

Auch in der Terrorismus- und Kriminalitätsbekämpfung liegt die Union in den Augen der Wähler sehr weit vorne. Dass Merkels Flüchtlingspolitik das sicherheitspolitische Profil der CDU schlagartig zunichtegemacht hat, ist ergo schlicht falsch.

Irrglaube 2: Die Flüchtlingspolitik der Kanzlerin ist schuld am Aufstieg der AfD



Zwar lässt es sich kaum leugnen, dass die Flüchtlingskrise einen erheblichen Anteil am Wandel der Parteienlandschaft hatte. Trotzdem es ist ein fataler Irrglaube, hierin den einzigen Faktor hinter dem Aufstieg der AfD zu vermuten - denn wer die Flüchtlingspolitik zu bemängeln hatte, hatte eine echte Alternative: die FDP.

Das Wahlergebnis deutet darauf hin, dass viele enttäuschte Unionswähler diese Initiative ergriffen. Es darf nicht vergessen werden, dass die Union mehr Stimmen an die Liberalen, als die AfD verloren hat. Das ist nicht Makulatur.

In der Wahl zwischen Liberalen und Nationalisten lag ein gewichtiger Unterschied, den die Union beim Umgang mit der AfD beachten muss: denn während die FDP unter Lindner die Flüchtlingspolitik stets mit Blick auf die Wiederherstellung von Recht und Kontrolle, ergo Sicherheit, argumentierte, ging die AfD mit ihren Thesen zur drohenden ""Überfremdung"" und ""islamischen Invasion"" weiter.

Und hierfür wurde sie von vielen gewählt: ganze 95% der AfD-Wähler fürchten einen Verlust der deutschen Kultur, 92% geht der Einfluss des Islams zu weit. Derlei Sorgen über Kriminalität, Terrorismus und Überfremdung suggerieren, dass die fundamentale Unzufriedenheit der AfD-Wähler der Flüchtlingskrise vorausging - sie hat sie lediglich verschärft.

Irrglaube 3: Die AfD ist ein Sammelbecken enttäuschter Unionswähler

""Die AfD gewinnt, was die CDU verloren hat."" Diese Schlussfolgerung könnte die These stützen, dass es sich bei den AfD-Wählern mehrheitlich um einen konservativen Kern handle, den die Union unter Merkel aufgegeben habe - nicht zuletzt angesichts der 60%, die ""Enttäuschung"" als Grund für ihr Kreuz hinter der AfD angaben.

Tatsächlich ergibt eine nähere Betrachtung jedoch ein entschieden anderes Bild: selbst wenn man 2013 miteinrechnet, hat die Union im Laufe dieses Jahrzehnts nicht mehr als 2% an die AfD verloren.

Auch eine schleichende Abwanderung konservativer Wähler, die CDU und CSU schon vor Jahren den Rücken kehrten und nun aus dem Nichtwählermilieu zur AfD stoßen, wird wohl nur marginal ausgefallen und durch das Hinzustoßen neuer Wählergruppen kompensiert sein.

Das bedeutet jedoch im Umkehrschluss, dass gut 9-10% der AfD-Wähler keine abtrünnigen Christdemokraten oder Christsozialen sind, die mittels einer Rückkehr zu angestammten bürgerlichen Werten wieder in den Schoß der Union zurückkehren würden.

Wie fehlgeleitet die Wahrnehmung der AfD als konservativem Zufluchtsort ist, wird deutlich, wenn man die Wählerschaft der Nationalisten unter die Lupe nimmt: denn tatsächlich hat die AfD diesen September im selben Maße dem linken Lager - SPD, Linke und Grüne - Stimmen abgejagt wie der Union: knapp eine Million. Hinzu kommen satte 1,47 Millionen Stimmen aus dem Nichtwählermilieu.

Wie erklärt sich diese breite Unterstützerbasis? In Anbetracht besagter 60% ist die Sachlage eindeutig: die AfD hat eine Koalition der Unzufriedenen zusammengerauft, bei denen die ""konservative Wertopposition"" nur einen vergleichsweise geringen Teil darstellt.

Die Enttäuschung der AfD-Wähler richtet sich nicht gegen eine ""sozialdemokratisierte Union"", sondern die gesamte politische Führungsriege der Bundesrepublik. Mit anderen Worten: It's The System Not The Flüchtlinge, Stupid!

Der Erfolg der AfD liegt nicht einfach in ihrer Opposition zur Flüchtlingsaufnahme, sondern ihrer Ablehnung des ""Systems"" - und für viele galt die Flüchtlingskrise als Symbol für ein im Kern dysfunktionales System. Hinzu kommt eine starke Prise nationalistische Überfremdungsangst, die jedoch nicht gleichbedeutend ist mit bürgerlichem Konservatismus.

Wenngleich nicht alle diese Wähler für die Union unerreichbar sind, gehören sie nicht zu ihrer Stammklientel und werden mit einer Rückkehr zu ""konservativen Werten"" wohl nicht bezirzt.

Irrglaube 4: Alles neu macht der Rechtsruck

Nicht wenige vertreten die Ansicht, die ""rechte Flanke"" zu schließen, sei der Schlüssel zum Erfolg für die Union und zur Entzauberung der AfD. Und genau in dieser Schlussfolgerung liegt die Krux. Was die AfD ihren Wählern bietet, sind nicht schlüssige Konzepte, sondern eine Möglichkeit, Unmut über eine Politikerklasse zu äußern, die sie als korrupt und selbstsüchtig betrachten.

Dieses Misstrauen ist so tief verankert, dass es sehr unwahrscheinlich ist, dass ein Großteil der AfD-Wähler den Weg zu den demokratischen Parteien zurückfindet, nur weil diese Sprache und Maßnahmenkatalog der Nationalisten zu imitieren suchen.

Sie werden es den Politikern schlicht nicht abnehmen - und sich eher in ihrer Entscheidung für die AfD bestärkt fühlen. Im Gegenzug könnte sich die Mitte, welche der Union die letzten Wahlsiege gesichert hat, von dieser abwenden.

Nicht zuletzt daher wird der Versuch, die AfD rhetorisch zu übertrumpfen, mit nahezu hundertprozentiger Wahrscheinlichkeit nach hinten losgehen. Denn Fakt ist, dass die Union kein Monopol mehr auf die Themen hat, die den Erfolg von Gauland, Höcke und Konsorten untermauernt - und letztere haben einen entscheidenden Vorteil gegenüber der Union: sie sind nicht durch unausgesprochene Gesetze der Mäßigung und Verantwortung gebunden.

Jede Offerte der Union nach rechts kann sie daher doppelt und dreifach überbieten. Auf diese Weise kann die AfD die Union mittelfristig vor sich hertreiben, ohne an Zustimmung zu verlieren. Wer sich länger mit der Neurechten auseinandergesetzt hat, wird dieses Schema kennen: Der Trick der Populisten ist es, den politischen Gegner dazu zu bringen, rote Linien zu überschreiten.

In einem offenen Schlagabtausch mit der AfD um die rechte ""Pole-Position"" kann die Union nur verlieren. Denn für die AfD gibt es einfach keine roten Linien. Wer die Sprache und Agenda der Populisten übernimmt, stärkt diese nur - oder wird selbst zum Populisten.

Noch immer Zweifel?

Dann genügt nur der Blick nach Großbritannien oder in die USA. Die Länder liefern ein Paradebeispiel für diese Dynamik: dass Großbritannien momentan im Brexitchaos versinkt, beruht darauf, dass sich die Konservativen unter David Cameron auf einen Spießrutenlauf mit Nigel Farages UKIP einließen.

Über mehrere Monate hinweg diktierte die Sorge vor einer Massenabwanderung der Wähler gen UKIP den Kurs der Tories, die immer weiter nach rechts rückten. Dieses Katz-und-Maus-Spiel mündete im berüchtigten, wenig durchdachten EUReferendum, von dem sich Cameron die Besänftigung seiner Parteirechten und der UKIP-Wählerschaft erhoffte.

Stattdessen zerrüttete es den politischen Konsens im Land und hinterließ die populistische Flanke der Konservativen, die mittlerweile unverhohlen UKIP-Parolen propagiert, stärker denn je. In den Vereinigten Staaten rief das permanente Hofieren der Tea Party-Bewegung und der ultrarechten Presse um Fox News durch die Republikaner die Geister, die zum Wahlsieg Donald Trumps führten.

Vielleicht braucht man jedoch auch nicht so weit ins Ausland zu blicken, wenn die CSU schon am eigenen Leib erfahren durfte, wie wenig es hilft, sich Populisten anzubiedern.

Und was heißt das jetzt im Klartext? Vor allem eines: die Union hat durch eine Schließung ihrer ""rechten Flanke"" nur wenig zu gewinnen, wenn sie verlorenen Boden bei der AfD gutmachen will.

Im Gegenteil, sie hat wohl tatsächlich viel mehr zu verlieren, sollte sie sich vom Erfolg der AfD verleiten lassen, eine ""konservative Kehrwende"" einzulegen.

Daraus könnte man nun schließen, dass die Union der ""rechten Mitte"" entsagen sollte. Dass sie AfD-Protestwähler ihrem Schicksal überlassen muss. Das wäre allerdings ebenfalls ein fataler

Trugschluss.

Das Hauptaugenmerk muss darauf liegen, Vertrauen in die Institutionen der Bundesrepublik wiederherzustellen

Einige Abwanderer lassen sich durchaus durch eine inhaltliche Erneuerung zurückgewinnen, indem die CDU ihr marktwirtschaftliches und ordnungspolitisches Profil schärft. Wer jedoch die Protestwähler der AfD wieder in den politischen Mainstream einbinden will, der braucht einen deutlich längeren Atem.

Denn das Hauptaugenmerk muss darauf liegen, Vertrauen in die Institutionen der Bundesrepublik und ihrer Repräsentanten wiederherzustellen. Dies gelingt nicht durch Aktionismus, brachiale ""Obergrenzen""-Rhetorik ohne schlüssige Konzepte, von der Realität abgekoppelte Phantomdebatten über ""verbotenes Schweinefleisch"" und Maßnahmen, die der Lebenswirklichkeit in Deutschland nicht gerecht werden.

Dass die AfD mit ihrem ethnonationalistischen, antipluralistischen Gedankengut und autoritären Gehabe kein Modell für eine reformierte Union darstellen kann, weiß man nach diesem Wahlkampf zur Genüge. Vielmehr geht es doch im Kern darum, die Union zukunftsfähig, volksnah und schlagkräftig zu machen.

Das geht nur mit einer umfassenden strukturellen Reform - und ja, auch einer personellen Erneuerung. Der Kampf um die Wählerstimmen darf jedenfalls nie mit der Aushöhlung oder gar Aufgabe der freiheitsliebenden Prinzipien der Christdemokratie einhergehen. Das sollte auch nach dieser Wahl feststehen.

As allegations against Harvey Weinstein continue to surface, other men in Hollywood are being called out for their own lewd behavior toward women.

This week, a 2011 video of Jason Momoa uttering a tasteless joke began making its rounds around the web again. The actor and his fellow “Game of Thrones” co-stars were speaking on a panel at Comic-Con when he made the comment.

“As far as Sci-Fi and Fantasy, I love that genre,” Momoa says in the video. “There’s so many things you can do, like rip someone’s tongue out of their throat, and get away with it, and rape beautiful women.”

After he made the crude joke, a few of his cast members appeared to laugh nervously before literally face-palming.

Now, people on Twitter are not having it. Some users simply condemned Momoa’s behavior, while others were clearly distraught over the fact that, well, yet another of their faves has very problematic opinions.

Sollte man aus einem demokratiepolitischen Verantwortungsbewusstsein heraus eine Kleinpartei wie Neos oder die Liste des Ex-Grünen Mandatars Peter Pilz wählen, um sicherzustellen, dass sie nicht aus dem Parlament fliegen? Kann man die Grünen noch irgendwie retten?

Und was soll ich bitte mit den ganzen Umfragewerten anfangen? Ganz ehrlich, ich habe keine Ahnung.

Wovon ich Ahnung habe - so wie mein Bruder, der ein politikinteressierter Mensch ist - ist jedes einzelne Wahlprogramm. Ich kenne jede Aussage jedes Spitzenkandidaten, habe unzählige Interviews, Leitartikel gelesen, Facebook-Postings geliked, geteilt, weggewischt, you name it.

Und so wie viele, die die jüngste Dirty-Campaigning-Affäre desillusioniert hat, was die politische Kultur in diesem Land betrifft, freue ich mich richtiggehend auf den Wahltag. Weil es dann endlich vorbei ist. Wir sind satt, haben genug gehört und gesehen.

Das Problem ist mittlerweile wahrscheinlich: Wir wissen zu viel, wir sehen den Wald vor lauter Bäumen nicht mehr. Deshalb lautet mein Vorschlag an meinen Bruder so: Vergiss das alles. Es ist eigentlich ganz einfach. Wähl den, dem du - so kitschig das klingt - dankbar bist. Dankbar dafür, wie das Leben hier in Österreich aussieht, und was dir woanders fehlt.

So war das mit dem Wahlkampf vor einer gefühlten Ewigkeit - lange vor diese Dirty-Campaigning-Sache - ja gedacht: Dass die Partei versucht, dich, und zwar dich ganz persönlich, von ihrem Plan zu überzeugen.

Im Endeffekt ist es ein gut informiertes Bauchgefühl.

”Kein Volk der Erde würde eine so erfolgreiche Regierung abwählen. Wir laut Umfragen schon”

Livia Klingl, Journalistin und Autorin

Wir haben einen Kanzler, der ist in der Welt sehr angesehen. Nur nicht bei uns.

Wir haben ein sehr gutes Wirtschaftswachstum und eine sinkende Arbeitslosigkeit. Kein Regierungspolitiker auf der Welt würde so eine Regierung sprengen. Bei uns schon.

Kein Volk der Erde würde eine so erfolgreiche Regierung abwählen. Wir laut Umfragen schon.

Wien ist seit Jahren in den Rankings eine der lebenswertesten Städte der Welt. Die Wiener sind darüber böse. Sie ahnen, wir sind ein seltsames Volk.

""Das ist nicht mein Österreich!""

Menerva Hammad, Bloggerin

Ich würde nicht sagen, dass ich mich vor der Zukunft fürchte. Was ich in den Medien höre und im Internet lese, das ist nicht mein Österreich und schon gar nicht mein Wien.

Ich konzentriere mich auf die zwischenmenschliche Beziehung und da haben mich die Österreicher niemals enttäuscht. Ich habe immer das Zitat von Mr. Rogers im Kopf: “Look for the helpers.”

Ich schaue mich in der Öffentlichkeit um. Sei es im Supermarkt, in der U-Bahn, oder einfach auf der Straße. Menschen lächeln mich an, fragen, ob sie mir helfen können und stehen auf, wenn ich mit meiner Tochter in der Straßenbahn einsteige.

DAS ist mein Wien und so lebt mein Österreich. Ganz egal wie die Wahl am Sonntag ausgeht: “I will be looking for the Helpers.”

""Die drei Parteien werden die Prozente unter sich ausmachen und im Moment bin ich über keine Kombination so richtig glücklich""

Pascal Stegemann, Fußball-Redakteur

Als Wahl-Österreicher blicke ich mit gemischten Gefühlen auf die kommenden Wahlen und die Zukunft Österreichs. Der Grund dafür ist, dass für mich keiner der Wahl-Kandidaten der drei großen Parteien (SPÖ, ÖVP, FPÖ) auch nur im Entferntesten wählbar erscheint.

Während mit HC Strache ein gefährlicher Mann an der Regierung beteiligt werden könnte, dem Neonazi-Verbindungen nachgesagt werden und dessen rechtspopulistisches und rassistisches Gedankengut in wackligen Zeiten nur zu gern von der Angst-Gesellschaft übernommen wird, sind die Alternativen unwesentlich besser.

Mit Kanzler Kern steht ein Politiker zur Wahl, der dünnhäutig auf Kritik reagiert und bestimmten Medien den Mund verbietet. Wer als Politiker das Land steuern will, muss in der Lage sein, mit medialer Kritik - wie unsachlich diese auch sein mag - umzugehen. Wer jede zweite Berichterstattung mimöslich aufnimmt und sogar Versuche der Zensur unternimmt, ist im Kanzleramt fehl am Platz!

Zu guter Letzt steht mit der ÖVP jene Partei zur Auswahl, die für mich lediglich als verlängerter Arm der Wirtschaftslobby dient. Der ÖVP geht es darum, Österreich als Wirtschaftsstandort attraktiver machen, mittelgroße und Riesenkonzerne zu unterstützen.

Doch Kurz und Co. vergessen, dass man mit Geld und Kapital eben nicht alles erkaufen kann. Der Zugang zu den Sorgen des kleinen Mannes ist den Herren in Schwarz scheinbar ziemlich gleichgültig. Als Handlanger der Wirtschaftsbosse geht es der ÖVP um maximalen Ertrag.

Wie und ob es dem kleinen Mann gut geht, scheint zweitrangig.

Leider bin ich nicht wahlberechtigt. Diese drei Parteien werden die Prozente unter sich ausmachen und im Moment bin ich über keine Kombination so richtig glücklich.

”Die Solidarität in der Gesellschaft sind dann wichtiger denn je, um gegen das Aushölen der Menschenrechte aufzutreten”

Raphaela Nije, Kindergartenpädagogin, Bezirksrätin

Ich sehe ein Erstarken der Zivilgesellschaft, da aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach Österreich eine rechts-rechte Regierung haben wird.

Der Zusammenhalt und die Solidarität in der Gesellschaft sind dann wichtiger denn je, um gegen den Sozialabbau und das Aushölen der Menschenrechte aufzutreten.

”Österreich läuft Gefahr, in eine gespaltene, von Angst, Neid und Hass geprägte Gesellschaft zu zerbrechen”

Michael Huber-Strasser, Angestellter

Meine Vision ist, dass die Gehälter (im Handel, Verkauf) steigen, die Arbeitslosigkeit sinkt und das Bildungssystem verbessert und ausgebaut wird und dadurch die Zukunftsangst und Abstiegsangst der Menschen sinken und damit auch Fremdenangst, Neidgesellschaft und die Anfälligkeit für Rechtspopulismus.

Dann kann sich eine Gesellschaft entfalten, in der das gemeinsame und respektvolle Miteinander gelebt wird und alle Menschen ein wertgeschätztes, chancenreiches Leben führen können.

Dafür braucht es einen Wahlsieg von Christian Kern, andernfalls läuft Österreich Gefahr in eine gespaltene, von Angst, Neid und Hass geprägte Gesellschaft zu zerbrechen.

”Ich bin optimistisch und schaue mit Zuversicht in unsere gemeinsame Zukunft”

Mirsada Zupani, Sozialarbeiterin

Ich bin 1992 als Flüchtling nach Österreich gekommen. Dieses Gefühl von Sicherheit nach monatelanger Angst ist einfach unbeschreiblich. Bis heute erlebe ich es nirgendwo so stark wie hier. Ich liebe das Land und die Leute. Hier habe ich geheiratet, meine Kinder bekommen, hier arbeite ich, hier lebe ich.

Ich bin überzeugt, dass auch die Zukunft von Österreich, trotz allem was uns derzeit beschäftigt und/oder Sorgen macht, eine großartige wird.

Österreich hat bewiesen, nicht nur einmal, dass Menschen hier ein großes Herz haben und die richtigen Entscheidungen treffen. Ich bin optimistisch und schaue mit Zuversicht in unsere gemeinsame Zukunft.

”Wir werden auch das überleben, was uns der Wahltag bringt!“

Brigitte Hornyik, Juristin und Feministin

Österreich ist reich und schön - nur nicht alle Menschen hier. Wir haben schon viel überstanden, auch eine schwarz-blaue Regierung, einen Burschenschafter und Tierarzt als Frauenminister, und vieles mehr.

Wir werden auch das überleben, was uns der Wahltag bringt!

Und ganz persönlich: Ich lass’ mir dieses schöne Land und meine Heimatstadt Wien sicher nicht nehmen - von nix und niemand! Lieber geh’ ich halt wieder auf die Straße, wie schon so oft, weil: Siamo tutti Antifascisti - Alerta - No pasaran! (zu Deutsch?)

""Ich sehe die Zukunft nur in der gemeinsamen Gestaltung unseres Landes""

Simon INOU, Journalist und Herausgeber von “Fresh Magazine""

Es gibt keine gemeinsame Zukunft solange Österreich nach dem Prinzip ""WIR"" und die ""ANDEREN"" funktioniert. Ich sehe die Zukunft nur in der gemeinsamen Gestaltung unseres Landes.

Wie es woanders im Lande funktioniert: Viele Menschen in ganz Österreich zeigen es tagtäglich auf individueller sowie gesellschaftspolitischer Ebene mit ihrem Engagement und ihrer Solidarität. Das ist für mich Zukunft.

”Die immer schwerer zu kontrollierenden Kräften des Raubritterkapitalismus”

Gernot Galib Stanfel, Musiktherapeut

Die wohl größte Gefahr ist ein aufkeimender Provinzialismus, der die starke Identität Österreichs nur in sich selbst und nicht in einem starken Europa verorten will.

Damit nimmt man sich unter anderem automatisch die Mitgestaltungsmöglichkeit unserer ureigensten Umgebung und setzt sich noch Methoden immer schwerer zu kontrollierenden Kräften des Raubritterkapitalismus aus, der keine geregelten Beiträge zu Gesamtgesellschaft leisten möchten.

Als zweites Problem sehe ich nachhaltige Versuche, eine aus dem christlichen Glauben abgewandelten politische Machtbewegung zu etablieren, die den christlichen Glauben ähnlich pervertiert und missbraucht wie der IS den Islam. Nur nicht mit martialischen Mitteln, sondern mit dem manipulativen Gebrauch von Wissenschaft, Kapital und wirtschaftliche Netzwerken.

Man könnte das in etwa als ""apostolisch christliche Politik"" beschreiben, die durchaus einen gewissen Retrofaktor hat. Diese Politik baut sich offenbar bewusst als Gegensatz zu einem christlichen Pendant eines wahrgenommenen eines ""politischen Islam"" auf.

Das produziert im Endeffekt ein gefährliches Weltbild, in dem Religionen in einer fix zugeordneten Kombination mit Kulturen ausschließlich bestimmter geographischer und territorialer Gebiete zugeordnet werden.

”Ich denke die Wahl wird Österreich nicht allzu dramatisch verändern - das ist leider schon vorher passiert”

Dorothea Schwab, Lehrerin

Ich denke die Wahl wird Österreich nicht allzu dramatisch verändern - das ist leider schon vorher passiert. Gegenseitige Anschuldigungen und Beleidigungen haben auch in Österreich zu einem Klima der Aggression geführt. Jeder ist jedem allein neidig, jeder vermutet hinter allem eine Intrige.

Das Miteinander ist völlig verloren gegangen in unserer Gesellschaft. Die politischen Kleinkriege haben das nur verstärkt.

Nach der Wahl wird es für die Politiker nicht einfach werden, das Vertrauen der Bevölkerung zurück zu gewinnen, vor allem von jenem Teil, der sie nicht gewählt hat. Das wird die politische Arbeit nicht einfacher machen.

""From the time this government has come to power, they tend to touch upon such issues that make Muslim anxious which makes the people of our religion believe that this government is against Muslims.

Tina Gayle received an official rebuke and a ban over the coloured printed cups which Charnworth Council in Leicestershire said “breached trading rules”.

Vintage book seller Gayle said she had been told the council “had a complaint that the mugs might be offensive to Muslims”.

SWNS.com Tina Gayle was left dumbfounded by the council's decision

A letter stated she was in breach of trading terms and conditions and had to leave her pitch of three years at Loughborough Vintage Market.

The mugs, also stamped with the Christian chivalric order’s Latin motto which translates as: “Not to us Lord, not to us, but to your name give the glory”, brought a single complaint.

But now the council appears to have re-considered its approach, summoning Gayle for a meeting with market bosses next week.

(Tina Gayle/PA)

The council said it had “got this one wrong”, and apologised for the way it handled the matter.

In a statement, it added it was the fact the mugs were not vintage which had been at issue, but this fact had been communicated “poorly” to Ms Gayle.

Gayle, 57, from Didcot, Oxfordshire, who also travels the country selling Second World War vintage books, said she was “appreciative” for the council’s change of approach.

“I’ve been summoned to a meeting with the markets manager on Thursday. They haven’t apologised to me directly, but have called me to that meeting,” she said.

“I’m very optimistic.

“But I realise it’s a very big thing for the council to issue a public apology and I’m appreciative.

“Should I be offered my pitch back, I’ll obviously be very happy.”

(Tina Gayle/PA)

Her ban had come in the form of a letter handed to her on October 6, after a previous run-in over the sale of some mugs bearing Second World War-era Nazi symbols.

Gayle said she had been told the council “had a complaint that the mugs might be offensive to Muslims”.

She added: “The person who complained wasn’t offended himself, but thought Muslims might be.

“I’ve never had a Muslim come into my stall and say they were offended by the mugs.”

However, Gayle said she has “no bad feelings” towards the council, and understood it had been put in a “dilemma”.

The council had previously formally told Gayle to stop selling mugs bearing what it described as “Nazi symbols” in August or new items which may cause offence, following a separate complaint.

Market authorities then received the complaint about the Templar mugs, and when Gayle refused to remove them from sale, she was banned.

In a statement reported by the Press Association, the council said: “Firstly, we would like to apologise. We are open and honest enough to say we got this one wrong.

“We did receive a complaint because someone was offended by the mugs, but we do not find the mugs offensive.

“Our main issue was that it is a vintage market and these items were new when we only want vintage or used items on sale.

“We communicated that poorly to the trader and we will be reviewing how this happened to learn lessons for the future.

Zwar war das Material im Besitz von NBC, veröffentlicht wurde der Artikel jedoch von der ""Washington Post"".","Der NBC-Reporter Ronan Farrow hat seit Anfang des Jahres über Fälle von sexuellem Missbrauch durch Hollywood-Produzent Harvey Weinstein recherchiert

Eine Recherche der HuffPost US zeigt nun: Farrows Sender blockierte monatelang die Veröffentlichung seiner Erkenntnisse

Farrow sah deswegen keine andere Möglichkeit, als sein Material einer anderen Medienorganisation zu übermitteln

Die Enthüllung der sexuelle Übergriffe von Hollywood-Produzent Harvey Weinstein auf junge Frauen empört ganz Amerika. Vor knapp einer Woche berichtete erstmals die ""New York Times"" über die Taten des 65-Jährigen.

Dabei hätte die Story schon vor Monaten ans Licht kommen können.

Denn Mitte August gelang es Ronan Farrow, einem Reporter des US-Senders NBC News, eine Frau zu interviewen, die berichtete, von Weinstein vergewaltigt worden zu sein. Sie stimmte einem Interview vor laufender Kamera zu, dabei wurde ihre Identität allerdings nicht preisgegeben. Zu sehen war nur ihre Silhouette.

► Es war ein Schlüsselmoment in einem aufgeheizten, monatelangen Prozess der Berichterstattung zu einer Story, die eine ganze Generation von Hollywoodreportern und Medienangehörigen schockiert.

Doch eine Recherche der HuffPost belegt nun: Der Reporter Farrow wurde von NBC News abgehalten, seine Recherche zu senden. Der Sender versuchte aktiv, die Verbrechen von Harvey Weinstein zu vertuschen.

NBC verlangte von Farrow, die Arbeit an der Weinstein-Story einzustellen

Farrow hatte eine Menge Material gesammelt: Im März dieses Jahres gelangte er an eine brisante Tonbandaufnahme. Darin gab Weinstein zu, ein italienisches Model begrapscht zu haben.

Außerdem hatte der Reporter Interviews mit ehemaligen engen Mitarbeitern von Weinstein geführt, die zahlreiche sexuelle Übergriffe bestätigten.

Doch das reichte offenbar nicht. Dem Reporter waren durch einen NBC-News-Erlass die Hände gebunden: Ihm wurde mitgeteilt, dass es nicht genügend Beweise gebe, um seine Weinstein-Story zu senden, so berichten es vier Quellen der HuffPost.

Außerdem teilte ihm der Sender mit, dass der Reporter seine Arbeit an der Story einstellen solle. NBC versuchte, das Interview mit der Frau, die Harvey Weinstein der Vergewaltigung beschuldigte, zu verhindern.

Farrow wurde verboten, für das Interview auf Mitarbeiter und Equipment von NBC zurückzugreifen. Außerdem musste er seine Zugehörigkeit zu NBC verschweigen. Also bezahlte Farrow eine Filmcrew und Equipment aus eigener Tasche, um das Interview zu filmen.

► Als ein NBC News-Projekt war Farrows Story praktisch tot. Erst später erhielt er die Erlaubnis, die Story über eine andere Medienorganisation zu veröffentlichen.

NBC-Chef bestreitet Versuche der Vertuschung

Die Story, die schließlich dabei herauskam, wurde am Dienstag von dem US-Magazin ""New Yorker"" veröffentlicht.

Es war ein gigantischer Scoop. Gleich mehrere Frauen beschuldigten Weinstein darin der Vergewaltigung oder anderer sexueller Belästigungen. Dazu kam noch die Tonaufnahme von Weinstein selbst, auf der er sexuelle Belästigung zugab.



Eine Tonbandaufnahme, auf der Harvey Weinstein mit einem jungen Model in einem Hotelzimmer streitet, war auch Teil der Reportage von ""The New Yorker""

Am Mittwoch sagte NBC-Präsident Noah Oppenheim: ""Der Gedanke, dass wir versuchen würden, eine mächtige Person zu decken, verletzt uns alle zutiefst. Wir alle haben diese Geschichte gejagt, wollten die Fakten festnageln, aber letztendlich waren es nicht wir, die die Geschichte an die Öffentlichkeit gebracht haben.“

Dann schlug er einen reumütigen Ton an und erklärte, die Story sei bei NBC eines natürlichen Todes gestorben. ""Wir waren im Sommer an einem Punkt angelangt, an dem wir als Organisation das Gefühl hatten, dass wir nicht über all die Einzelteile verfügten, die für eine Veröffentlichung nötig gewesen wären.“

► Interviews mit 12 Personen, innerhalb und außerhalb von NBC, die Kenntnisse von den Hintergründen zu Farrows Story hatten, legen allerdings einen anderen Schluss nahe.

Hochrangige NBC-Mitarbeiter blockierten die Veröffentlichung von Farrows Enthüllungen

Alle Quellen, die mit der HuffPost gesprochen haben, baten darum, anonym zu bleiben: Weil sie nicht die Erlaubnis hatten, mit den Medien über die Geschichte zu sprechen, oder aber aus Angst vor NBC.

Diese Quellen berichteten ausführlich von einem monatelangen Kampf innerhalb von NBC News, bei dem Oppenheim und andere hochrangige NBC-Mitarbeiter Farrows Story durch Zweifel und Unschlüssigkeit blockierten.

Schließlich nahmen diese Zweifel und Bedenken auch einen persönlichen Ton an. Es war schwer zu sagen, wo die Versuche von Weinsteins Team, die Story zu diskreditieren, aufhörten und die Blockaden durch NBC News begannen.

Laut einer Vielzahl von Quellen, die an der abgebrochenen Story mitgearbeitet hatten, erklärte Oppenheim bezüglich Farrow, dass dieser sich in einem Interessenskonflikt befände.

Genau das hatten Weinsteins Anwälte in einer Beschwerde gegenüber NBC zur Sprache gebracht: Dass Farrow sich in einem Interessenskonflikt befände, da Weinstein Farrows Vater, zu dem dieser ein schlechtes Verhältnis habe, zu einem neuen Karrierehoch verholfen habe.

Farrows Geschichte wurde mehrmals überprüft

Sein Vater ist der Regisseur Woody Allen. Weinsteins Anwälte nutzten später abermals eine ähnliche Strategie, als die Story beim ""New Yorker"" landete.

Das Magazin, das für sein strenges Fact-Checking bekannt ist, konnte jedoch keinen Interessenkonflikt Farrows erkennen.

Farrow, der bereits im Januar mit der Arbeit an der Story begonnen und bis Juli mindestens acht Frauen interviewt hatte, wurde von unabhängiger Stelle zweimal bestätigt, dass die Story ""berichtenswert“ sei.

► Das heißt, dass die Story den harten Fakten-Check von NBC und auch die entsprechende juristische Prüfung bestanden hatte. Das berichten vier Personen, die über detaillierte Kenntnisse dieser Prozesse verfügen.

Außerdem wurde eine weitere Investigativjournalistin von NBC darum gebeten, Farrows Arbeit zu überprüfen. Ihre Überprüfung ergab keine Bedenken, so die vier Quellen.



Ronan Farrow wurde Berichten zufolge von NBC-Bossen gesagt, dass seine Weinstein-Story zu lückenhaft sei, um sie zu senden.

Farrow gelangte an brisantes Material über Weinstein

Farrow landete seinen ersten großen journalistischen Coup bereits im Januar. Ein Interview vor laufender Kamera mit der Schauspielerin Rose McGowan. Während des Interviews beschuldigte die Schauspielerin Harvey Weinstein der sexuellen Belästigung als sie 23 Jahre alt war.

Die ""Times"" berichtete, dass McGowan die Anschuldigungen gegen Weinstein gegen Zahlung von 100.000 Dollar im Jahr 1997 beigelegt hätte. Schließlich entzog McGowan NBC die Genehmigung, das Material zu senden, nachdem ihr von Weinstein mit rechtlichen Schritten gedroht worden war.

Im März erhielt Farrow dann eine Tonaufnahme, auf der Weinstein zugab, das italienische Model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez sexuell belästigt zu haben.

Einen Tag, nachdem Gutierrez der New Yorker Polizei von Weinsteins Übergriffen berichtet hatte, wurde das Tonband aufgenommen. Die New Yorker Polizei verkabelte Gutierrez und so konnte eine anschließende Unterhaltung zwischen Gutierrez und Weinstein im Tribeca Grand Hotel in New York aufgezeichnet werden.

Auf dem Band ist zu hören, wie Weinstein Gutierrez drängt, zu ihm ins Hotelzimmer zu kommen. Am Ende der angespannten Unterhaltung gibt er zu, Gutierrez sexuell belästigt zu haben.

Als Gutierrez Weinstein fragt, warum er am Tag zuvor ihre Brüste berührt habe, antwortet dieser:

""Oh bitte, es tut mir Leid, komm einfach rein.“ Und weiter: ""Ich bin das gewohnt. Jetzt mach schon. Bitte.“ Gutierrez fragt: ""Du bist das gewohnt?“ Und Weinsteins Antwort: ""Ja, ich mach’s nicht wieder.“

Die Veröffentlichung sollte andere ermutigen, an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen

Zwei Jahre lang haben Reporter verschiedener Medienunternehmen versucht, das brisante Tonband in die Hände zu bekommen. Für viele Medien wäre allein das schon eine Story wert.

Und selbst wenn NBC das Band als nicht sendenswert abgetan hätte, so hätte NBC die Story immer noch online veröffentlichen können.

Das ist ein Weg, den Farrow zusammen mit Rich McHugh, einem Investigativproduzenten von NBC, ebenfalls in Betracht gezogen hatte. Tatsächlich wollte Farrow sein Material nur irgendwie veröffentlichen, in der Hoffnung, dass dadurch auch andere Frauen ermutigt würden, an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen.

► Im April hatte NBC News zwei dicke Dinger in der Tasche: Ein Kamerainterview mit Rose McGowan und das explosive Tonband, auf dem Weinstein die sexuelle Belästigung eingestand.

Aber Farrow wurde von mehreren hochrangigen NBC-Produzenten mitgeteilt, dass sein Material und die Interviews für einen TV-Bericht nicht ausreichen würden.

Vier Quellen berichten, dass Farrow und McHugh außerdem einen ausführlichen Artikel vorbereitet hätten, der über die NBC-News-Website veröffentlicht werden sollte. Aber dazu sollte es nicht kommen.

Farrow sollte die Arbeit an der Story einstellen

Im Juli hatte Farrow schließlich seine hochexplosive Story über Weinstein zusammengestellt. Sie beinhaltete Videointerviews mit Personen, die Weinstein beschuldigten, sowie mit vier weiblichen und vier männlichen Ex-Mitarbeitern von Miramax und Weinsteins eigener Firma.

Zu diesem Zeitpunkt waren Farrow und McHugh bereit, ihre Story weiter voranzutreiben. Seitens NBC wurde ihnen jedoch gesagt, dass der NBC News-Vorsitzende Andy Lack erst sein OK für die Story geben müsse.

Außerdem müsse die Story noch einmal von Steve Burke überprüft werden, dem Vizepräsidenten von Comcast und Präsidenten und Vorstandsvorsitzenden von NBC Universal.

► Eine so eingehende Überprüfung ist ungewöhnlich. Das berichten drei NBC News-Mitarbeiter, die noch nie davon gehört hatten, dass Burkes Büro eine Story im Vorfeld überprüfen müsse.

Im August wurde Farrow mehrfach von NBC mitgeteilt, dass er seine Arbeit an der Story einstellen solle. So berichten es vier Insider. Das brachte Farrow in eine untragbare Position.

""Vorzeigestück für guten investigativen Journalismus""

Eine der Personen, die Farrow vor laufender Kamera interviewt hatte, war Ken Aluetta, ein erfahrener Journalist. Zu Beginn seiner Karriere hatte Aluetta ebenfalls versucht, eine Story über Weinsteins Taten zu bringen.

Laut zwei HuffPost-Informanten, die dieses Interview kennen, sowie eines Berichts in leicht anderer Form auf der Website ""Daily Beast"", sagte Aluetta, nachdem er Farrows Material gesehen hatte, sinngemäß: ""Wenn NBC die Beweise, über die Ronan verfügt, zurückhält, dann wirft das kein gutes Licht auf das Unternehmen und es ist ein riesiger Skandal.“

► Schließlich übergab Farrow sein Material ""The New Yorker"". Das Magazin brachte Farrows Scoop am Montag, nachdem die Story einer eingehenden Prüfung durch die Redakteure und Fakten-Checker unterzogen wurde.

""Als Ronan Farrow vor zwei Monaten an uns herantrat, hatte er schon sehr sorgfältige journalistische Arbeit geleistet“, sagt David Remnick, Chefredakteur des ""New Yorker"". ""Und mit unglaublich harter Arbeit und der Zusammenarbeit von all den Kollegen hier beim 'New Yorker', hat er dem Bericht noch mehr Fakten hinzugefügt, so dass er veröffentlicht werden konnte. Es ist ein Vorzeigestück für guten investigativen Journalismus.“

NBC hielt sich auch nach der Veröffentlichung zurück

NBC reagierte wortkarg auf ähnliche Berichte über Weinstein auf anderen Medienkanälen. Am vergangenen Donnerstag, als die ""New York Times"" zum ersten Mal über Weinsteins lange Historie angeblicher sexueller Übergriffe berichtete, brachten auch CBS und ABC die Geschichte in den Abendnachrichten.

Doch NBC hielt sich auffällig still zurück und überließ den Konkurrenten das Feld. Obwohl NBC sieben Stunden Zeit gehabt hätte, eine Story zusammenzustellen, fehlte das Thema Weinstein gänzlich in den NBC Nightly News (der Artikel in der ""New York Times"" war um 11 Uhr am Vormittag erschienen).

Einige NBC-Quellen berichten, dass der Sendeplan zum Bersten gefüllt war mit Eilmeldungen, zum Beispiel über die Amoktat von Las Vegas und die Tatsache, dass US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson Donald Trump als ""Idioten“ bezeichnet habe.

► Es gab aber trotzdem noch Platz für einen Bericht über die sexistischen Bemerkungen des Footballspielers Cam Newton gegenüber einer Reporterin und die Nominierten für die Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Zwei Quellen, die mit der Produktion vertraut sind, gaben gegenüber der HuffPost an, dass Oppenheim die finale Entscheidung getroffen habe, Weinstein nicht in das Programm aufzunehmen. Den Mitarbeitern gegenüber sagte er, dass Weinstein keine Person von nationaler Bekanntheit sei.

Als am Wochenende Lorne Michaels, der Produzent von ""Saturday Night Live“ dafür kritisiert wurde, dass er in der Sendung keine Weinstein-Witze aufgenommen habe, sagte er der ""Daily Mail"", dass das ""eine New York-Sache“ sei. Damit argumentierte er ähnlich wie Oppenheim.

NBC-Insider berichteten der HuffPost derweil, dass sich einige Mitarbeiter jetzt fragen, ob es sich dabei um eine interne NBC-Phrase handelt, die NBC-Bosse nutzen, um das Fehlen der Weinstein-Berichterstattung zu rechtfertigen.



NBC-Präsident Noah Oppenheim: “Der Gedanke, dass wir eine mächtige Person decken würden, verletzt uns alle zutiefst“

Verpasste Chance, eine große Story zu bringen

Am nächsten Morgen wurde NBC erneut von seinen Konkurrenten abgehängt. ""Good Morning America“ auf ABC brachte einen zehnminütigen Bericht über Weinstein und in ""This Morning“ auf CBS war ein fünfminütiger Bericht zu sehen.

Die ""Today“-Show auf NBC wartete lediglich mit Nachrichtensprecher Craig Melvin auf, der von einem Teleprompter einen Bericht dazu ablas, wie Weinstein die gegen ihn vorgebrachte Anschuldigungen, von denen in der ""Times"" zu lesen war, weit von sich wies.

Die Nachricht, dass NBC im Besitz des Tonbands war, auf dem Weinstein sexuelle Belästigung zugab, schockierte und frustrierte NBC-News-Mitarbeiter, die mit der HuffPost sprachen. Sie sagten, die Stimmung sei angesichts der verpassten Chance, diese große Story zu bringen, auf dem Tiefpunkt.

► Viele Personen, die mit der HuffPost sprachen, erinnerte diese Geschichte an ein anderes Mal, als NBC nicht die Chance ergriff, eine Story über einen Mann zu bringen, der sexuelle Belästigung eingestand.

Im Oktober 2016 war NBC News im Besitz des nun berühmt-berüchtigten ""Access Hollywood“-Tonbands von Donald Trump, auf dem er zugab, dass er Frauen gerne in den Schritt griff.

Zwar war das Material im Besitz von NBC, veröffentlicht wurde der Artikel jedoch von der ""Washington Post"".

""We did a post on our social media [above] saying something along the lines of 'vote yes,' we said 'fuck homophobia'.
""People say it's not homophobic, I think 'you can say that but I think it is'.
One is a moral absolute, one is on the right side of history and one is not,"" he said.
HuffPost Australia also spoke to Sydney singer-songwriter Montaigne -- real name Jessica Cerro -- who also gave us her thoughts on the marriage equality debate.","Sydney singer-songwriter Montaigne was one of those throwing her weight behind the push for marriage equality at the 2017 Yours And Owls festival.

Wollongong hosted the Yours And Owls music festival on the October long weekend, two days of sun, fun and bands just a stone's throw from the beach on the beautiful NSW south coast. HuffPost Australia has visited the festival before, calling it ""Australia's coolest small festival"", but the ""small"" tag doesn't exactly fit anymore as the event has expanded to a two-day, four-stage format featuring the likes of The Presets, At The Drive-In, The Preatures, Dune Rats and an impressive lineup of Australia's biggest musical acts.

2017 was the festival's biggest and most impressive iteration yet, but the weekend was tinged with a slightly more serious flavour this time around. Yours And Owls landed on the same weekend as the NRL grand final, and another much-anticipated musical performance -- that of U.S. rapper Macklemore, who was bizarrely the hot topic of the political sphere that week as he prepared to sing his hit song 'Same Love', which promotes marriage equality, in the midst of Australia's own postal survey and debate around same-sex marriage.

Little reminders of the survey were sprinkled all around the festival grounds too, from rainbow-striped drink cups at all the bars, rainbow banners hanging from stalls, a stack of 'Vote Yes' stickers being handed out all over the place, large LCD video screens playing behind bands bearing the same message, and even shout-outs from bands on stage to support the push for marriage equality.

""Fuck homophobia,"" called Aussie band Holy Holy during their set.

HuffPost Australia caught up with Tim Carroll and Oscar Dawson from the band for our Uncut podcast following their set, where they opened up on their support for the marriage equality reforms which they have talked about often online and during their performances, as well as the furore over the Macklemore performance.

""We did a post on our social media [above] saying something along the lines of 'vote yes,' we said 'fuck homophobia'. A few people in the comments said 'it's not homophobic to vote no, you're not instantly a homophobe' and this is where the challenge arises,"" Dawson said.

""People say it's not homophobic, I think 'you can say that but I think it is'. It's entirely a phobia. You're afraid. People say 'you are equal but you're just not allowed to get married' and I'm like 'that's the same as not being equal'.""

Carroll laughed at immigration minister Peter Dutton's suggestion just days earlier that ""presumably two songs should be played, one for gay marriage and one against gay marriage"", in response to the Macklemore controversy. Dutton said this should happen to honour ""free speech"", but Carroll disagreed.

""That's a bit like saying, when there was the decision to give women the vote in Australia, let's have a song against women having the vote. In not all issues is it right to give both sides equal weight. One is a moral absolute, one is on the right side of history and one is not,"" he said.

""I find it really hard to sympathise with the no vote campaign because I feel like it's really hateful and cold and misinformed and out of this time, out of date, out of step with where we are.""

HuffPost Australia also spoke to Sydney singer-songwriter Montaigne -- real name Jessica Cerro -- who also gave us her thoughts on the marriage equality debate. She has been talking to her fans about the marriage push, even raising money for the yes campaign, so we asked if she thought artists felt some responsibility to speak up about important social issues like this.

""I think it's appropriate if the issue is of great concern and interest for the artist. You can't fight every battle. There are a lot of battles I don't fight actively or regularly. My things I think are important are queer right, animal rights, veganism and environmental stewardship,"" said Montaigne, who told us she identifies as bisexual.

""If you're a queer person, you ought to at least put a message out there saying 'I'm going to vote, what are you going to do?' because that matters.""

She said she didn't feel artists had an obligation to speak up if they didn't want to, and understood why some keep their noses out of heated debates.

""Don't just jump on the bandwagon. If you're genuinely invested in whatever it is you're speaking about, great, then you should feel compelled to speak out about it. There are some artists who are a bit more timid and don't want to be attacked for their political views and I totally understand that.""

Since Weinstein was named and shamed, the ‘Scream’ actress has been vocal on Twitter, praising other women for coming forward and exposing those who she believes could have done more to highlight the shamed movie boss’s behaviour.

Und mit der Digitalisierung wird möglich, was noch vor wenigen Jahren Zukunftsmusik war: Es wird immer leichter, zukünftige Trends und Entwicklungen zuverlässig vorherzusagen. Big Data und Predictive Analytics machen's möglich.

Auch im B2B-Bereich ist gerade kein Thema spannender: Beim Branchentreffen „Tag der Industriekommunikation"" 2017 drehte sich alles um die digitale Transformation des B2B-Marketings. Big Data und die Erfassung und Auswertung von sehr großen Datenmengen spielt dabei eine entscheidende Rolle: „Daten sind das Rückgrat jeder digitalen Transformation"", so Eva Maria Bieda, Principal Change Manager, Roche Pharmaceuticals.

Das Schlagwort Big Data sollte heutzutage also jeden interessieren. Wirklich spannend wird's für den B2B-Bereich aber beim Analysemodell „Predictive Analytics"": Mit den richtigen Analysetools kann man aus gewonnenen Daten zuverlässig auf zukünftige Trends und Entwicklungen schließen. Nicht ohne Grund sieht Forbes Predictive Analytics als wichtigsten Trend im B2B-Marketing: „Predictive analytics and B2B sales are a match made in heaven"".

Tatsächlich sind Predictive Analytics nicht neu: Forecasting-Systeme im Vertrieb oder die Vorschläge, die Kunden in Webshops erhalten, arbeiten schon länger mit diesem Analysemodell. Doch erst in Verbindung mit Big Data und neuesten Technologien ist es zu einem wirklich einsetzbaren und aussagekräftigen Modell geworden. Wie eine Studie von EY und Forbes Insights zeigt, nutzen viele Unternehmen das enorme Potential noch nicht aus. Dabei ist nicht länger die Frage, ob Predictive Analytics wirklich Vorteile bringen - entscheidend ist, wie sie eingesetzt werden können, um Vorteile zu maximieren.

Im B2B-Bereich gibt es vor allem zwei Einsatzmöglichkeiten von Predictive Analytics:

Die Verbesserung der Unternehmensabläufe:

Heute schon wissen, was der Kunde nächste Woche brauchen wird? Die Abläufe in Unternehmen und auch im B2B-Marketing können enorm davon profitieren, zuverlässiges Wissen über zukünftige Bedürfnisse zu haben. Die Optimierung von Marketing-Kampagnen:

Vorher wissen, was funktioniert: Predictive Analytics können die Reaktion von Kunden und sogar Kaufentscheidungen vorhersagen. Auch den lohnenswerten Einsatz von Cross-Selling kann man so einschätzen. Wissen Sie, wer Ihre wichtigsten Kunden sind? Predictive Analytics helfen Ihnen dabei, Ihre Kunden in anzusprechen, zufriedenzustellen und zu binden.

Die Vorteile liegen auf der Hand - Predictive Analytics werden im B2B-Marketing und in allen Branchen viel verändern. Doch jedes Tool kann nur so gut sein, wie es eingesetzt wird. Was müssen Sie beachten, wenn Sie Big Data und Predictive Analytics in Ihren Arbeitsablauf einbinden wollen?

Mit anderen Worten: Wie gehen Sie am produktivsten an Predictive Analytics heran?

Klare Zielsetzung:

Machen Sie sich bewusst, was Sie anhand der Daten über die Zukunft wissen, verstehen und vorhersagen wollen. Auch Ihre Ressourcen müssen klar sein: Definieren Sie einen eindeutigen Return of Investment. Bereits am Anfang sollte außerdem überlegt werden, wie die Ergebnisse ein- und umgesetzt werden können: Welche Entscheidungen hängen davon ab? Aussagekräftige Daten sammeln:

Woher beziehen Sie Ihre Daten? Sammeln Sie selbst oder lassen Sie sammeln? Entscheidend ist, dass Sie klar definieren, welche Ziele Sie verfolgen. Verzichten Sie hier nicht auf Fachkräfte, nur aussagekräftige und gezielt analysierte Daten bringen Ergebnisse. Entwicklung von vorhersagenden Analysemodellen:

Daten zu sammeln reicht nicht - die wertvollen Ergebnisse erhalten Sie nur mit der richtigen Analyse. Hier ist Teamwork gefragt: Datenanalytiker, IT- und Marketing-Experten sollten zusammen einfache Software-Anwendungen zur Analyse und Bearbeitung der Daten entwickeln.

Predictive Analytics werden zunehmend eine wichtige Rolle im B2B-Marketing spielen. Bleiben Sie auf dem Stand der Technik!

Vergessen Sie bei allen Vorteilen jedoch eines nicht: Technische Möglichkeiten müssen umgesetzt werden, und Tools müssen zum Unternehmen passen.

BANASKANTHA -- Union Minister Uma Bharti on Thursday said Mahatama Gandhi's murder only benefitted Congress.

Bharti told media, ""Mahatma Gandhi's murder only benefitted Congress as he was about to disband Congress.""

She further said, the murder of Mahatma Gandhi needs reconsideration.

""Godsey may have killed Gandhi, but who instigated him?,"" questioned Bharti.

Mahatma Gandhi was murdered on January 30, 1948 in Delhi by Nathuram Vinayak Godse, who was a member of Hindu Mahasabha.

Bharti's comments come after the Supreme Court on October 6 appointed senior advocate and former additional solicitor general Amrender Sharan as amicus curiae on a plea seeking re-probe of Gandhi's murder.

The plea is filed by Mumbai-based Dr Pankaj Phadnis , a researcher and a trustee of Abhinav Bharat.

Bharti, who was here to participate in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Gaurav Yatra, said that the people of Gujarat have given the BJP as well as the nation a sense of pride.

She claimed that the BJP will win 160-165 seats in the upcoming Gujarat Assembly elections.

The 14th legislative assembly election in Gujarat is to be held by the end of 2017 as the term of 13th assembly ends on January 22, 2018.

""BJP President Amit Shah has said about winning 150 seats, but I want to add that we (BJP will get 160-165 seats in Gujarat assembly elections,"" said Bharti.

When asked to comment on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's allegations against the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she refused to comment by saying that ""for his own party, he must be a big leader but for me he is not so big that I comment anything on him.""

“I assumed it would be in a conference room which was very common,” Beckinsale wrote on Instagram. “When I arrived, reception told me to go to his room. He opened the door in his bathrobe.”

“I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him,” Beckinsale continued. The actress said she turned down an offer of alcohol and said that she had school the next morning, leaving the room “uneasy but unscathed.”

The troubling allegations don’t end there. Beckinsale claims that years later, Weinstein asked her if anything had happened between them during their first meeting.

“I realized he couldn’t remember if he had assaulted me or not,” she wrote.

The actress said that she “said no to him professionally many times over the years,” which sometimes led to outbursts, “screaming at me calling me a cunt and making threats.”

Beckinsale believes these alleged incidents with Weinstein “undoubtedly harmed” her career.

Beckinsale also praised the women who came forward before her, such as Cara Delevingne, Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, after the New York Times and The New Yorker released exposés on Weinstein’s sexual misconduct. She also tried to encourage other women to speak out as well.

“For every moment like this there have been thousands where a vulnerable person has confided outrageous unprofessional behavior and found they have no recourse, due to an atmosphere of fear that it seems almost everyone has been living in,” she wrote.

In the week since the exposés on Weinstein, the executive was fired from his position at the Weinstein Company and his actions roundly condemned by Hollywood and political heavyweights, including Barack and Michelle Obama. On Wednesday, Disney announced that Weinstein’s name would be removed as a producer on an upcoming film.",Kate Beckinsale Says Weinstein Came On To Her At 17,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kate-beckinsale-says-weinstein-harassed-her-at-17-and-didnt-remember_us_59dfa166e4b0eb18af070028

Letztere plädierten in ihrem Artikel dafür, dass Deutschland mehr Risikoteilung zulassen solle und Frankreich mehr Marktdisziplin.

Konkret plädierten die französisch-deutschen Schreiber für eine gemeinsame Einlagensicherung für Sparvermögen in der EU und gleichzeitig für eine Risikogewichtung der Banken beim Kauf von Staatsanleihen. Derzeit fehle es an einem gemeinsamen Kapitalmarkt, und die Risiken in der Eurozone würden auf die jeweiligen Staaten und die EZB verteilt.

Wer trägt das Risiko?

Die Einlagensicherung sieht vor, dass Spareinlagen mit 100.000 Euro bei der jeweiligen Bank versichert sind, egal ob in Flensburg, Siena oder Athen.

Die Frage ist: Wer trägt das Risiko einer Bankenschieflage im jeweiligen Land? Ist es die Sicherungseinrichtung in Spanien, Italien oder Griechenland? Oder ist in einem gemeinsamen Währungsraum eine gemeinsame Einlagensicherung dafür verantwortlich, also auch die Einlagensicherungseinrichtungen von Sparkassen und Volksbanken in Deutschland? Um dieses Frage geht es.

Die EU-Kommission hat dafür in dieser Woche einen Kompromiss vorgeschlagen, der zu Beginn eine Art Rückversicherung vorsieht. Erstmal sollen die nationalen Einlagensicherungssysteme greifen.

Haben diese kein Geld mehr, können sie sich von anderen Einlagensicherungssystemen Geld leihen. Erst langfristig sollen die Einlagensicherungssysteme zu einem einheitlichen System verschmolzen werden.

Die Gefahr ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen

Bei der Nullgewichtung von Staatsanleihen doktert die Politik schon lange herum. Letztlich geht es darum, ob aufsichtsrechtlich eine griechische Staatsanleihe ebenso sicher ist wie eine deutsche. Das ist in der Realität natürlich nicht so, doch das ficht die Bankenaufsicht nicht an.

Während Kredite an den Mittelstand mit 20 Prozent Eigenkapital von der Bank unterlegt werden müssen, kann eine Bank Staatsanleihen von Griechenland, Portugal oder Zypern ohne Eigenkapital in ihre Bücher nehmen.

Viele europäische Regierungen, aber auch die italienischen Autoren des FAZ-Artikels, wehren sich gegen eine Risikogewichtung. Sie vertreten die Ansicht, dass dann die folgenden Zinsunterschiede sofort wieder eine neue Krise heraufbeschwören würden.

Die Gefahr ist durchaus nicht von der Hand zu weisen. Denn die öffentliche Verschuldung in Europa ist in den letzten Jahren massiv auf über 90 Prozent der Wirtschaftskraft angestiegen.

Würden die Zinsunterschiede zwischen Italien und Deutschland wieder ansteigen, dann wäre die italienische Verschuldung nicht mehr so einfach, vielleicht gar nicht mehr zu finanzieren. Italiens Staatsschulden erklimmen Monat für Monat einen neuen Höchststand. Er liegt derzeit bei 2.300 Milliarden Euro, im Verhältnis zur Wirtschaftskraft bei 134,5 Prozent (Juli 2017).

Während die Verschuldung steigt, sinken die dafür zu zahlenden Zinsen enorm. In den 1980-Jahren betrugen die Renditen 10-jährigern Italienischer Staatsanleihen über 16 Prozent. Mit der Einführung des Euro sank die Rendite auf 6 Prozent und fiel dann auf 4 Prozent.

Mit der Eurokrise stieg das Risiko wieder auf bis zu 7 Prozent. Erst mit der Intervention der EZB trat eine Beruhigung ein. Heute rentiert die italienische Anleihe mit 2 Prozent. Diesen Zustand will Italien möglichst lange konservieren.

Sie retten sich gegenseitig

Die italienischen Autoren, aber auch die deutsch-französischen Ökonomen in abgeschwächter Form, wollen das tragende Prinzip der Marktwirtschaft von Risiko und Haftung auseinanderfallen lassen.

Wer die Einlagensicherung vereinheitlicht, sei es heute, morgen oder übermorgen, sorgt dafür, dass finnische, deutsche und niederländische Sparer für Schieflagen spanischer, griechischer oder italienischer Banken haften müssen, obwohl sie als Bürger weder auf die dortige Regierungspolitik noch auf die Geschäftspolitik der dortigen Banken irgendeinen Einfluss haben.

Vielleicht wäre es an dieser Stelle viel besser, das Absicherungsniveau in der Europäischen Richtlinie abzusenken. Denn haben Sparer mehrere Konten bei mehreren Banken, dann hängen sie über diesen Weg sehr leicht mit mehreren hunderttausend Euro mit drin.

Muss dieses Risiko über eine staatlich festgelegte Versicherung in der ganzen Europäischen Union abgesichert werden? Wer das will, kann das gerne national oder in der jeweiligen Bank selbst tun. Die Sparkassen und Volksbanken in Deutschland kennen die sogenannte Institutssicherung.

Sie retten sich gegenseitig und schützen damit die Spareinlagen ihrer Einleger faktisch unbegrenzt. Ihre Dachorganisationen überwachen die Institute, damit es zu keiner Schieflage kommt.

Die Beiträge für die Institutssicherung richten sich nach dem Risiko der Bank. Wer weniger solide wirtschaftet, zahlt mehr und umgekehrt.

Irgendwann ist auch die Zeit des free lunch vorbei

Risiko und Haftung fallen erst recht bei der Nullgewichtung der Staatsanleihen auseinander. Ein Wechsel zu einem risikogewichteten Modell ist nicht einfach, aber mit Übergangsfristen möglich und notwendig.

Ansonsten finanziert die EZB die Freibiermentalität der Euro-Staaten immer weiter. Doch irgendwann ist auch die Zeit des free lunch vorbei und die Realität kehr wieder ein. Wie groß der Kater danach ist, hängt davon ab, wie lange der Rausch angehalten hat.

Europa muss mehr Marktwirtschaft wagen - nicht weniger.

This is PART I of a two-part series. Read the second part here.

Indian cities suffer from some of the most polluted air in the world. The causes include vehicle emissions, coal-burning power plants, brick kilns, slash-and-burn agriculture, open burning of waste, and firecrackers. Many find themselves asking what they can do to protect themselves and their families.

What is PM 2.5, and why worry about it?

Exposure to high levels of air pollution leads to health problems, including respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. In 2015, approximately 4.2 million people worldwide died prematurely from diseases directly linked to air pollution. In India alone, over one million died from the effects air pollution. While air pollution can be found in the form of gases or particulate matter, particulate pollution causes the most health concerns in India.

Exposure to small particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter (PM2.5) is more dangerous than exposure to larger particles. The health impact of exposure to these small particles accumulates over a lifetime. Small particles travel deep into the lungs, then either stay there or pass through to the bloodstream, where they contribute to cardiovascular disease. Contrary to popular belief, people cannot develop immunity to air pollution, unlike germs or pathogens, making it critical to take all measures possible to reduce overall exposure. Dr Vikram Jaggi, Director of the Asthma, Chest, and Allergy Centre, Delhi, counters the misconception that air purifiers will weaken an individual: ""if something is bad, more of it is more bad, and less of it is less bad!""

Children are at higher risk of illness from exposure to air pollution than adults. They breathe more air per kilo of body weight than adults, their lungs and brains are still developing, and they are more likely to suffer from asthma. Dr Jaggi confirmed that in over three decades of his clinical experience, he has seen the recovery time from respiratory ailments increase due to the rise in air pollution. A study published in 2012 showed that about one-half of Delhi students studied had suffered irreversible lung damage, and approximately one-third of students studied in 2015 in Bengaluru, Kolkata, Delhi and Mumbai failed lung capacity testing.

In hazardous conditions (PM2.5 above 500 µg/m3), the EPA recommends staying indoors with windows closed, using air filters and reducing activity

What can I do to protect my family?

Choose when to enjoy outdoor activities and when to stay inside.Check online resources for real-time air monitoring stations close to you. There is no safe cutoff that can be declared for everyone, but the air quality index (AQI) established by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a guide. When the AQI is orange/unhealthy for sensitive groups, children, the elderly, and those with heart and lung diseases may experience health effects. When the AQI is red/unhealthy, everyone may begin to experience health effects, increased rates of heart attack are observed within hours to days of exposure, and decreases in life expectancy are anticipated due to the premature mortality.

In most Indian cities in the winter, PM2.5 levels routinely exceed the unhealthy AQI category. In hazardous conditions (PM2.5 above 500 µg/m3), the EPA recommends staying indoors with windows closed, using air filters and reducing activity. Reduce the sources of air pollution generated in the house, such as candles and incense. Close the door to the kitchen and use exhaust fans while cooking, bake or boil food rather than frying.

Air Purifiers: In any building, there is an exchange between indoor and outdoor air, allowing outdoor pollution to enter the home and impact indoor air quality. Air purifiers can bring the levels of indoor air pollution down to acceptable levels. Effective purifiers rely primarily on HEPA filters to remove PM2.5 from the air and activated carbon to remove some harmful gases. Advanced purifiers are now available in India that are able to filter the smallest particles and reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide.

Plants: A number of plants are known to reduce indoor air pollution by absorbing harmful gases through their leaves and roots. However, plants alone are not able to reduce particulate matter effectively enough to make the air in Indian homes safe.

Masks: When you go outside, masks designed to guard against air pollution offer very cost-effective protection (85-99%). Some masks have an active carbon filter and are able to absorb gases as well as particulate pollution-ideal for people walking alongside traffic or riding bikes/motorbikes.

Nasal filters: Nasal filters offer an exciting new type of protection against particulate pollution. They are more discreet and comfortable than masks. The self-adherent films that cover the entire nostril (versus alternatives that must be inserted into the nose) are the most effective (approximately 90%). At Rs100/piece, they are more expensive than masks, and can only be used one time. Researchers at IIT Delhi are working on a lower-cost alternative.

How can I advocate for change?

Parents should demand that the Government of India develop an air pollution action plan for schools that includes installation of air purification systems that allow for fresh air intake to reduce the build-up of CO2. Next to the home, children spend the most time at school, where their health should be protected. Parents' demands for action has led to success elsewhere. Early in 2017, the Chinese Government agreed to install air purifiers in schools in Beijing, and other locales acted independently to do the same. The Singapore Ministry of Education follows official guidelines to close schools and minimize exposure and activities in very unhealthy AQI conditions. In India, certain schools in Delhi/NCR are installing purifiers and require that children wear masks for outdoor sports, but effective safeguards must be extended to all.

A number of groups in India are working to advocate for changes in policy that would reduce the sources of air pollution. Such efforts must be coordinated nationally, regionally, and throughout metro areas that border multiple states. Join or support a local or national group to make a difference for the future.

I think it's clear that being strong isn't just about lifting weights and eating healthy, there are times when in order to be strong you have to make a tough decision, or be brave when you're scared or juggle multiple activities.

Sie ist das neue Gesicht für eine neue Make-Up-Kampagne für ""Wet n Wild""

Damit ist sie das erste Model mit Albinismus, das in einer großen Werbe-Strecke zu sehen ist

Diandra Forrest hat mit 27 Jahren schon Bemerkenswertes vorzuweisen. Das Model war in mehreren Musikvideos von Beyoncé zu sehen sowie auf dem Cover des ""Ebony""-Magazins, das sich überwiegend an afroamerikanische Leser richtet, und sie lief vergangenes Jahr über mehrere Laufstege der New York Fashion Week.

Jetzt schreibt die 27-Jährige Geschichte als Gesicht einer Beauty-Kampagne von Wet n Wild. Damit ist Forrest das erste Model mit Albinismus, das bei einer großen Make-Up-Werbung zu sehen ist

Ein Beitrag geteilt von Diandra Forrest (@diandraforrest) am 10. Okt 2017 um 21:26 Uhr

Die Werbung wurde noch nicht veröffentlicht, aber Forrest zeigte ihren Fans auf Instagram schon vorab eines ihrer Bilder.

Das Unternehmen möchte mit der Reihe ""Breaking Beauty"", die Ende Dezember auf den Markt kommt, die Makel in den Vordergrund stellen, die wir nach Ansicht der Beauty-Industrie eigentlich lieber verstecken sollten.

Wet n Wild hat schon in der Vergangenheit Kampagnen mit Models gemacht, die nicht dem klassischen Schönheitsideal entsprechen. Daher war Forrest besonders begeistert, mit der Marke zusammen arbeiten zu können.

""Du bist seltsam, du wirst nie ein Model werden""

Die gebürtige New Yorkerin hatte selbst schon immer Probleme, wenn es ums Make-Up ging. ""Wenn ich Make-Up kaufe, denke ich immer 'Haben sie meinen Hautton? Wird es an mir gut aussehen?'""sagte sie dem Onlineportal ""Refinery29"".""Ich muss die Farbtöne immer mischen. Entweder sind sie zu dunkel oder viel zu hell.""

Albinismus ist eine Pimentstörung, die sich auf Haut-, Haar- und Augenfarbe auswirken. Weltweit liegt die durchschnittliche Wahrscheinlichkeit von Albinismus bei 1:20.000.

Durch die ungewöhnliche Hautfarbe fällt es vielen schwer, einen passenden Make-Up-Ton zu finden.

Forrest wurde als Kind oft wegen ihres Aussehens gehänselt und musste sich gegen Anfeindungen wehren - selbst, als sie beschloss, in die Fußstapfen ihrer Mutter zu treten und Model zu werden.

""Ich hatte einen Model-Coach, als ich 14 oder 15 Jahre alt war"", sagte sie ""Refinery29"". ""Er war sehr gemein und sagte ständig Sachen wie 'Du bist zu seltsam, du wirst nie ein Model werden'."" Das habe sie lange daran zweifeln, ob sie wirklich diesen Weg einschlagen sollte.

""Albinismus muss normalisiert werden""

Aber ihr Coach lag falsch: Forrest wurde bei einer großen Model Agentur unter Vertrag genommen - sie bekam viele Anfragen und Aufträge, die Kunden waren von ihr begeistert.

Forrest wollte Menschen mit Albinismus vertreten, hatte aber lange das Gefühl, dass es in der Mode-Industrie keinen Platz für sie gab. Vor allem, weil Models mit Albinismus oft als ""mystisch"" und ""aus einer anderen Welt stammend"" verkauft wurden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Lange schämte sie sich für ihr Aussehen - jetzt genießt sie es, wenn man sich nach ihr umdreht

Darum hat sie sich zum Ziel gesetzt: ""Albinismus muss normalisiert werden. Ich mache das für mich und für alle anderen jungen Mädchen, die genau so aufwachsen müssen wie ich.""

Das sogenannte Fuel Dumping ist in Notfällen erlaubt

Die Folgen des Fuel Dumpings sind umstritten

Ein Flugzeug hat vergangene Woche etwa 40 Tonnen Kerosin über Rheinland-Pfalz abgelassen. Das bestätigte die Deutsche Flugsicherung am Freitag, wie ""Focus Online"" berichtet.

Der Airbus von Lufthansa sollte vergangenen Dienstag von Frankfurt nach Houston im US-Bundesstaat Texas fliegen. Doch der Airbus A380 musste nach dem Start wieder zum Flughafen zurückkehren, weil es offenbar Probleme am Fahrwerk gab.

Das Flugpersonal ließ daraufhin das Kerosin ab, um sicher landen zu können.

Fuel Dumping ist in Notfällen erlaubt

Durch diese Maßnahme verliert das Flugzeug an Gewicht - denn wenn es zu schwer für die Landung ist, könnte das Fahrwerk zu stark belastet werden und die Passagiere in Gefahr bringen. Aus diesem Grund ist das sogenannten Fuel Dumping in solchen Notfällen erlaubt.

Schon im Mai hat ein Passagierflugzeug 54 Tonnen Kerosin über der Westpfalz abgelassen, weil es wegen technischer Probleme wieder zum Startflughafen zurückkehren und für die Landung Gewicht verlieren musste.

Das Sprit abgelassen werde, komme in Deutschland pro Jahr nur 20 bis 30 Mal vor - bei insgesamt drei Millionen Flugbewegungen, sagte eine Sprecherin der Deutschen Flugsicherung ""Focus Online"". Das geschehe nur in Fällen, in denen ansonsten eine große Gefahr für das Leben der Reisenden bestünde.

""Es geht hier um Menschenleben. Deshalb müssen wir den Piloten die Möglichkeit geben, über möglichst unbesiedelten Gebieten ihre Runden zu drehen, um entsprechend Treibstoff abzulassen"", sagte die Sprecherin.

Der Pilot darf nicht selbst entscheiden

Der Pilot könne dies auch nicht selbst entscheiden, sondern müsse auf Geheiß der Lotsen über möglichst unbewohnte Gebiete fliegen und dort den Sprit ablassen. Ob der Treibstoff überhaupt am Boden ankomme, sei unter Experten umstritten.

Mit den Risiken von abgelassenem Kerosin für Gesundheit und Umwelt wird sich nach Landtagsangaben der Ausschuss für Wirtschaft und Verkehr am 18. Oktober befassen.

August habe ich mich mit Monika Schulz-Strelow getroffen. Es ging es um Diversity, Frauen und wie wir mehr Frauen in die Aufsichtsräte bekommen. Denn Monika Schulz-Strelow ist Gründungspräsidentin von FidAR e.V. (Frauen in die Aufsichtsräte) und gilt als die oberste Lobbyistin in Sachen Frauenquote. Die Themen Diversity und Frauenquote beschäftigen mich selbst seit vielen Jahren. Deshalb bin ich selbst vor einigen Jahren FidAR beigetreten. Was es heißt, wegen meines Geschlechts in der Unterzahl zu sein, habe ich kürzlich bei der FidAR-Bilanzkonferenz im Juni 2017 erlebt. Dort war ich einer von 34 Männern unter 300 Frauen. Frauen in Führungspositionen erleben das jeden Tag und dies seit Jahrzehnten. Das muss sich ändern! Deshalb meine Botschaft an alle Chauvinisten: Hört Euch an, was Monika Schulz-Strelow zu sagen hat.

Berliner Erklärung: 12 Millionen Frauen fordern gleiche Teilhabe

Auf der FidAR Bilanzkonferenz überreichte der Verein zusammen mit 17 Frauenverbänden die Berliner Erklärung an die Bundesregierung. 12 Millionen Frauen stehen hinter der Erklärung, in der Forderungen an Privatwirtschaft, Wissenschaft, Kultur, Medien und Politik formuliert werden. Frauen müssen in allen Bereichen gleichberechtigt teilhaben können und sie müssen gleich gut bezahlt werden wie Männer, so der Kern der Erklärung. Andernfalls müssen wirksame Sanktionen greifen. Was eigentlich eine Selbstverständlichkeit sein sollte in einer westlichen Demokratie mit einem Grundgesetz, in dem alle Menschen als „gleich"" bezeichnet werden, muss offenbar auch im Jahr 2017 noch erkämpft werden.

Ohne Sanktionen geht es offenbar nicht

Monika Schulz-Strelow ist Feministin und sie ist in der Privatwirtschaft zu Hause. Sie hat jahrelange Berufserfahrung in der internationalen Wirtschaft. Das Letzte was man ihr vorwerfen könnte ist, dass sie nicht weiß, wovon sie spricht, wenn sie von den Unternehmen mehr Geschlechtergerechtigkeit fordert und dazu aufruft, Aufsichtsräte, Vorstandsposten und Führungspositionen im oberen und mittleren Management mit mindestens 30 Prozent Frauen zu besetzen. Ihr Verein FidAR, der 2006 von acht Frauen mit ihr als Gründungspräsidentin ins Leben gerufen wurde, hat mittlerweile 700 Mitglieder und betreibt in Berlin erfolgreich Lobbyarbeit in Sachen Frauenquote. Dabei kommt es ihr vor allem auf die Privatwirtschaft an, denn dort gibt es noch immer zu wenige Frauen in den Top-Positionen. Ihre Bilanz nach zwölf Jahren Lobby-Arbeit: „Dort wo gesetzliche Regelungen erlassen wurden, sind große Erfolge erzielt worden. Überall, wo Unternehmen freiwillig entscheiden können und nicht mit Sanktionen rechnen müssen, bleiben alte Strukturen bestehen.""

30 Prozent Frauenquote in Aufsichtsräten erreicht

Am 1. Mai 2015 trat die 30-Prozent-Quote für Aufsichtsratsposten in börsennotierten Unternehmen mit paritätischer Mitbestimmung in Kraft. 160 Unternehmen waren davon betroffen: frei werdende Aufsichtsratspositionen mussten zum großen Teil mit Frauen nach besetzt werden. Trotz großen Gejammers und Weltuntergangsstimmung ist die Folge des Gesetzes, dass heute 29 Prozent der Aufsichtsratsposten mit Frauen besetzt sind. Und, wie Monika Schulz-Strelow süffisant bemerkt: „Kein Unternehmen ist deshalb in die Insolvenz gegangen.""

Diversität bringt Unternehmen und Menschen weiter. Mit diesem Motiv wirbt FidAR um männliche Mitglieder (Bild: © FidAR)

Damit hat sie Recht. Ich möchte aber sogar noch einen Schritt weiter gehen: Die Unternehmen profitieren von Diversität, von anderen Blickwinkeln, von mehr Diskussionen und neuen Lösungsansätzen für Probleme. Machostrukturen, die ihre Macht und Pfründe sichern wollen, erhalten sich zwar vielleicht die eigenen Privilegien. Aber sie sorgen bestimmt nicht dafür, dass Unternehmen sich positiv entwickeln. Denn dafür braucht es Mut, Neues zu wagen. Dieser frische Wind kommt bestimmt nicht von den immer gleichen alten weißen Männern. Diversity ist deshalb das Gebot der Stunde und dazu gehören auch mehr Frauen in Entscheidungspositionen.

Männliche Strukturen machen es Frauen schwer

Noch immer prägen tradierte männerdominierte Muster Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft. Wenn wir diese unbewussten Denkmuster und Vorurteile nicht endlich durchbrechen, wird sich so schnell nichts ändern.

Wie stark Rollenmuster Meinungen und Einstellungen beeinflussen, habe ich bei der Deutschen Telekom erlebt. Dort war ich u.a. für die Unternehmenskultur verantwortlich und durfte in dieser Rolle die Einführung einer 30-Prozent-Frauenquote für Führungspositionen aktiv mitgestalten - und die Abwehrreaktionen einer tradierten Organisation erleben. Mit dem damaligen CEO René Obermann und dem CHRO Thomas Sattelberger hat sich die Deutsche Telekom AG als erster DAX-Konzern dazu verpflichtet, bis 2015 30 Prozent Frauen in Führungspositionen zu bringen. Ein einzigartiger Schritt mit hoher Strahlkraft. Leider bisher einzigartig.

Wie stark jahrhundertealte, diskriminierende Muster gegen Gleichstellung auch heute noch immer wirken, zeigt die Tatsache, dass sich bis heute kein männlicher Vorstand der deutschen Wirtschaft traut, sich zu einer Frauenquote zu verpflichten. Wovor haben die Chauvis in den Vorstandsetagen nur solche Angst? Davor, sich auf dem Golfplatz in ihrem Old Boys-Netzwerk rechtfertigen zu müssen? Oder davor, in der eigenen Familie das Rollenbild an die Moderne anzupassen? Oder davor sich selbst zu ändern und von Rollenbild Stereotypen Abstand zu nehmen?

Wie lange werden wir FidAR wohl noch brauchen?

Monika Schulz-Strelow bringt für ihr Ziel, mehr Frauen in Führungspositionen zu bringen, viel Energie und Begeisterung mit - „manchmal zu viel für andere"", wie sie selbst sagt. Als Kämpferin für die Frauenquote erwartet sie, dass Frauen, die nun in Top-Positionen kommen, eine Vorbildfunktion für andere ausfüllen. Die Quote sieht sie als Türöffner: Kompetente Frauen mit guter Performance stünden ohne die Quote vor der verschlossenen Tür. Die Quote stößt diese Tür auf - aber durchgehen muss jede Frau selbst. Jeder hat selbst die Verantwortung für seine Erfolge: „Erwartet nicht, dass andere alles für Euch machen. Steht auf und macht es selbst"", fordert sie. So ist die Frauenquote für sie eine Übergangslösung. Nichts wäre ihr lieber, als in einigen Jahren FidAR aufzulösen, die Lobbyarbeit an den Nagel zu hängen und das Gesetz zur Quote wieder abzuschaffen, weil alle Ziele erreicht wurden. Hoffen wir, dass Monika Schulz-Strelows Wunsch bald in Erfüllung geht. Ich setze mich, wie viele andere Frauen und moderne Männer dafür ein.

Immer wieder störte zuletzt ein wütender Mob die Wahlkampfauftritte der CDU-Chefin

Oben im Video seht ihr Bilder der Proteste gegen Merkel

""Volksverräter"". Dieses Wort hört Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) derzeit häufig im Wahlkampf. Immer wieder stört ein wütender Mob die Auftritte der Kanzlerin.

Die AfD gibt nun offen gegenüber der Wochenzeitung ""Die Zeit"" zu: Die Partei unterstützt die Proteste bei Wahlkampfauftritten von Merkel, und zwar regelmäßig.

""Bei der AfD gehört es zum Pflichtprogramm, zu Veranstaltungen mit Regierungspolitikern zu fahren"", sagt René Springer gegenüber der ""Zeit"". Springer ist der persönliche Referent von AfD-Spitzenkandidat Alexander Gauland.

Daraus müsse man kein Geheimnis mehr machen, sagt er. Zu jedem öffentlichen Wahlkampfauftritt von Angela Merkel, vor allem im Osten des Landes, reise eine Gruppe wütender Protestler.

So läuft die Organisation ab

Nach Darstellung von Springer, der Gaulands Wahlkampf koordiniert, laufe das meist nach einem Muster ab:

Einer aus dem AfD-Kreisverband, in dessen Gebiet Merkel auftreten wird, melde offiziell eine Gegen-Demo an. Der Landesverband verschicke dann eine E-Mail an alle Mitglieder mit der herzlichen Einladung, sich am Protest zu beteiligen.



Hauptziel sei es, sagt Springer, Merkel klar zu machen, wie viel Ablehnung ihr entgegenschlage. Aber es gebe noch ein zweites Motiv: ""Die Parteifreunde sagen: Wenn wir schon in den Medien nicht vorkommen, dann stellen wir uns hin und protestieren lautstark – so wird man schon über uns berichten.""

CDU: ""Rechtspopulistische Bratzen""

Zuletzt hatten AfD-Anhänger und Rechtsradikale die Auftritte von Merkel in Torgau und in Finsterwalde massiv gestört. Die Politikerin zog ihre rund 30-minütige Rede unbeirrt durch - trotz ""Buh""- und ""Volksverräter""-Rufen.

CDU-Generalsekretär Peter Tauber sagte kürzlich auf Twitter über die Proteste: ""Wenn man die Rechtsradikalen unter dem Banner der AfD auf unseren Veranstaltungen sieht, dann weiß man, wofür man kämpft.""

Gesundheitsminister Hermann Gröhe (CDU) verurteilte die Proteste scharf.

Das sind rechtspopulistische Bratzen, die Hass verbreiten"", sagte er der ""Rheinischen Post"".

«L'amour gay ou hétéro, pour moi, c'est la même chose, rétorque-t-il.","Le nouvel album de Pierre Lapointe, La science du cœur, est une lettre d'amour dans laquelle les sonorités contemporaines se mêlent à merveille avec des orchestrations classiques. En entrevue, l'artiste-poète évoque ses inspirations et tout le travail accompli sur ses plus récentes créations musicales qu'ils souhaitent éternelles.

L'arrivée d'internet n'aura pas seulement chamboulé nos habitudes de consommation, mais elle nous aura aussi éloignés d'un héritage que Pierre Lapointe fait resurgir dans une nouvelle proposition emplie de magnifiques trouvailles.

«Le but de cet album, co-réalisé par David François Moreau, a été de faire le lien entre une certaine tradition de la chanson française et la musique contemporaine, explique-t-il. Je voulais arriver à faire quelque chose d'actuel tout en rappelant le temps avant l'arrivée des téléphones et des réseaux sociaux qui nous déconcentre aujourd'hui constamment.»

À travers cette réflexion dénuée de nostalgie, jure l'auteur-compositeur et interprète, il y a aussi un retour assumé sur une certaine façon de faire le métier, plus proche de l'artisanat. «De nos jours, je crois qu'il y a plusieurs manières intéressantes de travailler la musique. Je suis obsédé par l'idée de créer une chanson qui ne vieillit pas ou qui vieillit bien. Les titres des années 1980, on les réécoute souvent avec un petit amusement, un peu au second degré.»

Une œuvre totale

Néanmoins, ce qui s'est fait durant les années 1960 est ce qui a vieilli le mieux, croit Pierre Lapointe. «Je pense à de grands artistes comme Charles Aznavour, Jacques Brel ou Léo Ferré. Leurs arrangements allaient se nourrir dans la musique classique. C'est d'ailleurs un peu ce que j'ai essayé de faire avec ce nouveau disque. J'ai mis de côté le synthétiseur. Il y a une réelle volonté de ma part de faire le pont avec le passé et le futur afin d'écrire de nouveaux classiques.»

Le disque, son contenu autant que sa forme, est une œuvre totale, une sorte d'objet non identifié puisant dans l'univers du chanteur porté par la pluridisciplinarité, la danse, la peinture ou le graphisme. «L'idée de base, c'est d'utiliser les codes du passé avec des codes contemporains, voir avant-gardistes comme l'Art déco, le Street art, le post-modernisme, le tout sans être vraiment datable. Par exemple sur la pochette, je porte un habit inspiré d'une combinaison moto des années trente. On a trafiqué les couleurs, je porte des espadrilles, ce qui ne se faisait pas à l'époque, et dans ma pause, je suis presque flottant dans l'espace.»

Le chanteur touche-à-tout – juré dans l'émission La Voix – se considère tel un artiste post-moderne qui «pige» ses influences un peu partout. «Je souhaite réussir à faire des mariages presque impossibles, mais qui au final deviennent harmonieux. J'ajoute une pincée de l'imagerie de Salvador Dalí, un décor design de Charles Eames, ou encore du Memphis ou du futurisme. C'est dans une zone grise intemporelle, hyper référencée et non identifiable que tout le disque s'est construit.»

L'amour!

Un septième album également mathématique doté de plusieurs formules. L'artiste est néanmoins resté dans l'acoustique afin de faire vivre à son auditeur une expérience instinctive qui parfois prend jusqu'aux trips. C'est sans doute pourquoi l'amour irradie toutes les pièces de cet opus. Une enfilade de sentiments romantiques que le dandy québécois explore avec originalité et finesse.

«Quel gros défi de réussir à aborder le thème de l'amour sous des angles nouveaux et contemporains, précise-t-il. Même si l'amour est un thème inépuisable, il peut facilement tomber dans les clichés parce qu'on a tellement parlé. Dans la chanson La science du cœur, je fais le portrait de quelqu'un qui ne veut pas se laisser aller en amour et qui se rattache pourtant à l'amour de sa grand-mère qui est probablement la seule personne qui l'a aimé.»

Une pléthore d'émotions qui vont du narcissisme (Sais-tu vraiment qui tu es) à l'amour comme véritable bouée de sauvetage (Qu'il est honteux d'être humain). Avec Mon prince charmant, Lapointe, engagé à la cause LGBT+, signe un magnifique hymne sur le désir homosexuel.

«L'amour gay ou hétéro, pour moi, c'est la même chose, rétorque-t-il. Je ne vois aucune différence. Je me pose les mêmes questions que mes amis de mon âge qu'ils ont des enfants ou pas, qu'ils soient célibataires ou pas, hétéros ou gays. Je trouve que c'est extrêmement réducteur de catégoriser les humains selon les sexes ou les orientations sexuelles. À la base, on est tous pareils. C'est pour cela que le thème de l'amour reste intéressant pour moi parce qu'il rejoint tout le monde sans exception.»

En touchant à des sujets aussi intimes, l'artiste inhibé se livre, mais pas trop. «J'accepte qu'il y ait une réelle confusion entre ma vraie personnalité, une certaine forme de fantasme et de la romance. Toutefois, je demeure très secret par rapport à ma vie personnelle. J'y tiens vraiment. Il y a des histoires qui parlent de moi, et d'autres qui sont le fruit de mes observations. Il reste que je ne dirais jamais les choses précisément, car au fond, j'aime que les gens se posent des questions.»

Ein mutmaßlich rechter Aktivist schlug auf einen Verleger ein

Auch Rechte klagen über Schikane von links

Auf der Frankfurter Buchmesse ist es zu einem gewalttätigen Angriff am Stand der rechtsgerichteten Wochenzeitung ""Junge Freiheit"" gekommen. Eine Sprecherin der Messe bestätigte am Samstag, dass am Freitag bei einer Lesung ein Zuhörer auf den Verleger des Trikont-Musikverlags zugegangen sei und ihn mit der Faust im Gesicht verletzt habe.

Trikont-Chef Achim Bergmann habe laut der ""Abendzeitung"" aus München dem rechten Buchautor Karlheinz Weißmann zugerufen, er solle die Klappe halten. Danach sei er von einem Mann ins Gesicht geschlagen worden. Den Täter beschrieb Bergmann laut der ""Abendzeitung"" als ""smarten Anzugträger, Typ Christian Lindner"".

Der Verleger erstattete Strafanzeige

Der Verleger ließ sich im Krankenhaus behandeln und erstattete Strafanzeige. Der Münchner Verlag Trikont, vor 50 Jahren als Buchverlag gegründet, widmet sich heute der Musik.

""Das Schlimme ist, dass wir mittlerweile in einem solchen politischen Klima leben, dass es wieder möglich ist, dass Rechte so brutal und arrogant auftreten"", sagte Eva Mair-Holmes von Trikont.

AfD-Politiker stellen Verbindung zur Bücherverbrennung her

Auch Vertreter der Neuen Rechten erheben schwere Vorwürfe gegen linke Aktivisten. Laut der rechten Zeitung ""Junge Freiheit"" haben in in der Nacht zu Freitag Unbekannte einen Stand des Manuscriptum-Verlags, bei dem unter anderen AfD-Politiker Alexander Gauland veröffentlicht, angegriffen.

Die Täter hinterließen laut der ""Welt"" nur einen Sticker: ""Gegen Rassismus auf der Buchmesse. Kein Platz für rechte Verlage und Veranstaltungen.""

Bücher und Werbematerialen seien entwendet worden. Mehrere AfD-Politiker kommentierten den Vorfall. Der Bundestagsabgeordnete Götz Frömming verglich die leergeräumten Regale mit dem Berliner Denkmal zur Erinnerung an die Bücherverbrennung – und die Tat damit mit den Verbrechen der Nationalsozialisten.

Ahí está el caso de las tarjetas Monex, las multas constantes al Partido Verde o los desvíos de dinero público de los estados a las campañas electorales.

Aun así, tenemos que poner en la mesa que la propuesta del Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) de no recibir dinero público y nada más mantenerse del privado es una pésima idea que desgranaré a continuación.

En principio, tienes que tomar en cuenta que esta iniciativa salió del PRI y ellos pertenecen al dark side, son los malosos que nos han robado y violado los derechos por años, como por ejemplo con el fraude electoral de 1988, la masacre de indígenas en Acteal en 1997, recibir una casa blanca de tu amigo contratista como lo hizo Enrique Peña Nieto y hasta desfalcar a un estado completo como lo ocurrido en Veracruz con el exgobernador Javier Duarte. Así que, no seas inocente: algo se traen entre manos al decir que no recibirán dinero público. Pues no son buena onda, no ven por su país y menos por acabar con la corrupción ya que han sido parte de ella por años, no por nada somos el país más corrupto de América Latina.

Con esta iniciativa del PRI les vamos a abrir la puerta para que el cochinero sea mayúsculo.

Aclarado eso, ahora vamos a la discusión del dinero.

En 2018, los partidos políticos recibirán 6 mil 778 millones de pesos para gasto ordinario y de campaña –más lo que reciban por las elecciones estatales-, el presupuesto más alto de la historia del Instituto Nacional Electoral. Pero ojo, esto no es algo que el INE haya decidido, fueron los mismos partidos y sus representantes en el Congreso quienes lo votaron en la Ley General de Partidos Políticos. En efecto, es un dineral que NO se merecen.

Peeero la solución no es dejar que los partidos políticos se financien con dinero privado, pues en primera los másters para conseguir dinero de privados, dígase de empresarios, líderes sindicales, cuotas partidistas y en ocasiones dinero sucio del crimen organizado o del presupuesto de los estados son los propios priistas. Por ejemplo, actualmente existe una investigación de la Fiscalía Especializada para la Atención de Delitos Electorales donde investigan a varios candidatos por el presunto uso de dinero ilícito y al ex gobernador Javier Duarte también lo investigan por haber desviado recursos públicos para campañas.

**Nota, esto no quiere decir que los otros sean unas blancas palomitas, nada más hay unos que tienen más colmillo que otros**

Muchos aquí dirán: ""pues mientras no sea con nuestro dinero que hagan lo que quieran, de todas maneras ya usan dinero sucio"". Pues qué creen: no, esto es una pésima, pésima idea. En un panorama hipotético, digamos que un presidente municipal en Nayarit, llega a ese puesto porque tuvo mucho dinero en su campaña y regaló billetes o todos los que votaron por él. Pero resulta que ese dinero salió del crimen organizado, el cual obvio se va a querer cobrar el ""favorcito"" de alguna manera. O sea, gracias a recibir dinero privado, quienes viven en esa comunidad seguro se verán afectados por deberle un favor al narco.

Otro ejemplo menos radical, un candidato a gobernador recibe millones de una empresa minera, con eso, hace una campañota en su estado y gana. Ahora, le debe un ""favorcito"" a la empresa, la cual casualmente está involucrada en un escándalo de contaminación de un río local y muerte de varias personas por beber de su agua. De verdad ¿crees que los van a llevar ante la justicia para que paguen por lo que hicieron?

En nuestro país los candidatos y candidatas están acostumbradas a violar la ley y si de por sí al INE le ha costado un trabajal fiscalizar lo que ya reciben de dinero público y privado, con esta iniciativa del PRI les vamos a abrir la puerta para que el cochinero sea mayúsculo.

Entonces, sí, reduzcámosles el presupuesto público y privado al mínimo, únicamente para que puedan operar en un país austero pero no, no dejemos que pase la propuesta priista.

Hay was founded in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2002 by husband and wife duo Mette and Rolf Hay. Their aim for this project was to make good design accessible to everyone so customers are getting their high-end designer aesthetic at Ikea prices.

Standouts from the range include the sofa-bed (pictured above), the steel and timber bookshelf (in the top image) and the timber dining table (below).

The design duo also gave the iconic Ikea bag a makeover. Mette wanted to refresh it while still honouring the original and without changing the size or materials, so she worked with the colours and weaving patterns to create six unique colour ways.

Avant que le cours commence, les enfants ont toujours un peu de temps pour se défouler sur le tatami. Cette année, mon tout-petit est dans le cours 1. Fini le baby judo. Je pensais que les élèves seraient moins nombreux et plus disciplinés aussi. Pourtant, ils sont plus de 40 à assister au cours et il y a quelques éléments absolument pas disciplinés.

Durant ce moment défouloir où les enfants courent dans tous les sens comme des fourmis affolées, je suis souvent attristée de constater toute la violence qui émane de certains enfants. Il y a ceux qui sautent à 3 ou 4 sur un seul enfant, celui qui fait semblant de donner des coups de pied à tout le monde, ceux qui tapent sur la tête des autres ... Peu sont ceux qui s'excusent après avoir fait mal, même pendant un petit combat d'entrainement. Il y en a, mais pas assez. Si pendant le cours de judo, le coach est très attentif aux vilains gestes et au manque de respect, avant le cours les enfants font un peu ce qu'ils veulent, sous le regard des parents qui restent.

Je ne vais pas vanter le comportement de Chichi, des défauts il en a beaucoup, mais quand il fait mal, il est gêné et il s'excuse. Bien qu'à la maison il puisse être très agressif envers son frère, sa soeur et parfois même moi (surtout en ce début de CP d'ailleurs), sur le tatami, je ne l'ai jamais observé faire mal volontairement à un autre enfant. Quand il explose (même à la maison), c'est qu'on l'a bien cherché avant (ou qu'on l'a fortement frustré).

Depuis que son meilleur copain ne fait plus de judo, il est un peu moins à l'aise. Heureusement, il y retrouve plusieurs filles de son école qui débutent ce sport cette année. Cela le rassure. Ce sont des filles bien motivées qui écoutent et se donnent à fond dans les minis combats.

Chichi discutait tranquillement avec 2 copines en attendant que le cours débute quand un garçon arrive en courant et le pousse fort avec ses 2 mains vers l'avant. Mon tout-petit ne s'y attendait absolument pas. Vue des gradins, la scène m'a paru violente et mon instinct de maman louve a fait un bond. Chichi s'est retrouvé assis sur le tatami et retenait ses larmes. Il m'a avoué que cet acte lui avait donné envie de quitter le cours et de ne plus jamais revenir. Après avoir poussé Chichi, le petit garçon s'est tourné vers les gradins.

Son père était assis presque à côté de moi, mais ça, je ne le savais pas. Je ne sais pas s'il voulait voir la réaction de son père ou s'il savait que j'étais la maman, mais j'ai capté son regard et du haut des gradins, je lui ai bien fait comprendre ma désapprobation face à son geste. Je ne l'ai pas lâché durant plusieurs minutes et lui me regardait, tranquille. Le père n'a pas bronché, même quand j'ai prononcé le prénom de son fils. Il était trop occupé sur son smartphone.

Ce jour-là, il y a un nouveau qui a tapé dans le dos de 3 enfants dont Chichi, comme ça, sans raison. Un autre que Chichi côtoie à l'école qui lui a fait une pichenette sur le nez. La dernière fois, le garçon avec qui il faisait un combat lui a tapé sur la tête simplement pour s'amuser.

La dernière fois, le coach a dû rappeler les notions de respect et d'humilité, je crois qu'il va devoir rappeler d'autres notions importantes en judo à tous ces enfants surexcités. Bizarrement, ce sont toujours des garçons, jamais des filles.

Vous aussi vous constatez cette violence chez les enfants?

“We did receive a complaint because someone was offended by the mugs, but we do not find the mugs offensive.","A market trader banned from selling Knights Templar crusader mugs over fears they could offend Muslims has been invited to crunch talks with council officials, who look set to offer a reprieve.

Tina Gayle received an official rebuke and a ban over the coloured printed cups which Charnworth Council in Leicestershire said “breached trading rules”.

Vintage book seller Gayle said she had been told the council “had a complaint that the mugs might be offensive to Muslims”.

SWNS.com Tina Gayle was left dumbfounded by the council's decision

A letter stated she was in breach of trading terms and conditions and had to leave her pitch of three years at Loughborough Vintage Market.

The mugs, also stamped with the Christian chivalric order’s Latin motto which translates as: “Not to us Lord, not to us, but to your name give the glory”, brought a single complaint.

But now the council appears to have re-considered its approach, summoning Gayle for a meeting with market bosses next week.

(Tina Gayle/PA)

The council said it had “got this one wrong”, and apologised for the way it handled the matter.

In a statement, it added it was the fact the mugs were not vintage which had been at issue, but this fact had been communicated “poorly” to Ms Gayle.

Gayle, 57, from Didcot, Oxfordshire, who also travels the country selling Second World War vintage books, said she was “appreciative” for the council’s change of approach.

“I’ve been summoned to a meeting with the markets manager on Thursday. They haven’t apologised to me directly, but have called me to that meeting,” she said.

“I’m very optimistic.

“But I realise it’s a very big thing for the council to issue a public apology and I’m appreciative.

“Should I be offered my pitch back, I’ll obviously be very happy.”

(Tina Gayle/PA)

Her ban had come in the form of a letter handed to her on October 6, after a previous run-in over the sale of some mugs bearing Second World War-era Nazi symbols.

Gayle said she had been told the council “had a complaint that the mugs might be offensive to Muslims”.

She added: “The person who complained wasn’t offended himself, but thought Muslims might be.

“I’ve never had a Muslim come into my stall and say they were offended by the mugs.”

However, Gayle said she has “no bad feelings” towards the council, and understood it had been put in a “dilemma”.

The council had previously formally told Gayle to stop selling mugs bearing what it described as “Nazi symbols” in August or new items which may cause offence, following a separate complaint.

Market authorities then received the complaint about the Templar mugs, and when Gayle refused to remove them from sale, she was banned.

In a statement reported by the Press Association, the council said: “Firstly, we would like to apologise. We are open and honest enough to say we got this one wrong.

“We did receive a complaint because someone was offended by the mugs, but we do not find the mugs offensive.

""Lovers built the Taj Mahal for their love. But I couldn't build a loo."" So says Keshav, the lead character of a new Bollywood movie, after his wife leaves him for failing to build a toilet in their home. The film, Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, is a commercial film in support of governmental campaigns to improve sanitation in India.

Access to sanitation has attracted more attention in India over the past few years thanks to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission). Launched in 2014, this project seeks to make the country free of ""open defecation"" – the practice of defecating outside – by 2019. The effort follows the Supreme Court of India which recognised sanitation as a fundamental right in the 1990s, and the UN General Assembly following suit much more recently in recognising sanitation as a distinct human right.

The project will be an immense challenge for India, which was responsible for 60% of the world's open defection five years ago. This is particularly a problem in the country's large rural areas. India has a huge population and a major lack of accessible toilets – both in private households and in public spaces. Roughly half of the rural population are estimated to lack proper access to sanitation. In rural areas, people often go to remote fields to relieve themselves – separate for men and women.

To reach the 2019 goal, the country will need both behaviour change and new infrastructure to succeed. As of now, India appears to be headed towards ensuring that every house has an individual toilet in the next couple of years. But this will only be an important first step in a series needed to ensure the country has interventions covering all dimensions of sanitation.

One of the most important challenges will be to build community and public toilets. In a number of places, community toilets are necessary because building individual toilets at home may not be feasible, for instance, because of lack of space. Also, they are necessary for people without a house, such as homeless people and migrant workers.

The need for community toilets is already recognised as part of current sanitation interventions but is often not implemented. And local authorities often lack the funds to pay someone to undertake the cleaning of the facilities once built.

Attitudes to gender and caste

India has to be careful so that the project does not interfere with its efforts to boost gender equality. Historically, campaigns pushing for more toilets to be built often cite the modesty of women as the main reason – toilets after all prevent women from exposing themselves in public.

This is also problematic as it places the burden of adjustment on women. Indeed, in many households that have built toilets, men do not even necessarily use them. This links with the broader issue of people resisting the introduction of toilets per se.

The regressive nature of such campaigns is now officially recognised with new governmental guidelines urging a rethink of behaviour-change tactics). Yet, much more needs to be done. As long as it is men who plan for toilets, the needs of women are either subsidiary or not taken into account at all.

Clearly, women have specific sanitation needs, for instance, related to menstrual hygiene. This needs to be fully integrated into any goals to boost sanitation – a challenge in a country where periods are associated with shame. Schemes for the provision of sanitary products constitute a definite step forward, but these are limited and environment-friendly disposal facilities and awareness campaigns are even more limited.

Attitudes to caste matter, too. Sanitation work is a very sensitive issue in India because it is mainly carried out by the lowest caste, Dalit – once called ""untouchables"". People from this caste even carry out manual scavenging, the inhuman practice of manually collecting human excrement from dry latrines to clean them – despite the fact that the practice is prohibited by law.

With millions of new toilets, more sanitation workers will be needed to carry out faecal sludge management. This will be difficult, as such jobs are stigmatised. Indeed, the conditions for such workers are often appalling – the media regularly reports on the deaths of sanitation workers who have entered sewers without any protective gear.

Clearly, one of the challenges India is facing is addressing this social stigma to make sanitation work an acceptable and safe career that is not reserved for a specific group in society. Mechanisation of the process could go some way to help ensure that workers do not need to enter the sewers.

Environmental threat

There are also risks to the environment. At present, the toilets that are built are mostly single pit latrines that will need to be emptied at least once every few years. Where the pits are lined at the bottom, the septage will need to be pumped out more regularly, and there need to be measures in place to ensure that it is not simply disposed of in neighbouring fields or rivers.

Where the pits are not lined, one of the concerns is the impact on groundwater quality. In the state of Kerala, where most houses have an unlined pit on one side of the house and a well used for drinking water on the other side, this is a particular problem. In a context where groundwater is the source of drinking water for around 80% of the population in India, the building of so many new toilets needs to be carefully planned.

Overall, the major progress that has been witnessed in access to sanitation over the past few years is a first step forward. It needs, however, to be linked to a series of other actions and an awareness of the social and cultural dimensions of sanitation. Without this, the country is unlikely to achieve full success.

Banks, who ploughed more than a million pounds into the party before being suspended in March, caused a Twitter storm when he accused journalist Jane Merrick of “a lack of character” over the way she dealt with harassment from a politician.

The 51-year-old co-founder of the Leave.EU campaign took a swipe at Merrick, editor of The Spoon and a columnist for The Independent, after she claimed she had been forced to “smile and interview a senior Tory who previously lunged at me”.

Her statement came amid a wider debate about sexism in Hollywood, with Merrick defending Emma Thompson against claims the actress had condoned the behaviour of media mogul Harvey Weinstein.

Reacting to a photo of the A-Listers together, Merrick explained: “It’s not that straight forward”.

But Banks hit back, explaining how she should have dealt with her harasser.

In a spat that followed, the millionaire dismissed Merrick’s claims that speaking out about the incident could have damaged her career, saying: “When you confront people and speak the truth you always feel better.”

Banks’ comments sparked widespread controversy online, garnering biting criticism from Labour MP Jess Phillips.

“You are a privileged idiot who knows nothing about being silenced,” she wrote.

“Some of us fight with our guts, not our money.”

Her views were mirrored by fellow politician Stella Creasy:

Mein Name ist Katarina und ich bin die Mutter der niedlichen Zwillinge und der tollen großen Schwester, die Sie letztens im Zoo angesprochen haben. Eine Sache wollte ich Ihnen noch unbedingt sagen, aber sie haben mich nicht zu Wort kommen lassen.

Sie sprachen mich einfach an, obwohl Sie sahen, dass ich mit meinem Mann und den Kindern im Gespräch war. Dies war Ihnen augenscheinlich nicht bewusst, als sie uns mitten im Satz unterbrachen und fragen, ob die Zwillinge denn eine natürliche Geburt gewesen wären. (Nein, wobei Geburt ist Geburt finde ich, schmerzlos ist das auch nicht.)

""Natürlich war sie das!"" implizierten Sie sofort und sprachen ohne Punkt und Komma weiter. Wie schmerzhaft es denn genau gewesen wäre, wie lange die Geburt gedauert habe und ob denn alles gut gegangen sei.

Ehrlich gesagt konnten wir es gar nicht fassen

Mein Mann und ich starrten verlegen uns und neben uns das Schild ""Großer Rundgang"" an. Wir versuchten, uns freundlich zu verabschieden, aber da hatten Sie schon die Hände in unseren Kinderwagen verkrallt und plapperten ungeniert weiter. Ob es denn Geburtsverletzungen gab und ob die Kinder Frühchen gewesen wären.

Ehrlich gesagt konnten wir es gar nicht fassen. Sie wurden von Minute zu Minute distanzloser und selbst als wir langsam den Kinderwagen versuchten wegzurollen, krampften sich ihre Finger nur noch fester um den Griff.

Es macht mich wahnsinnig, dass wir anscheinend ein Magnet für distanzlose Menschen sind. Denn Sie sind ja nicht alleine, sondern wir treffen viele Menschen, die so sind wie Sie.

Oder die beiden Damen hinter mir in der Kassenschlange, die darüber philosophierten, ob wir denn dem Irrglauben aufgesessen wären, dass Stillen eine Verhütungsmethode wäre oder ob wir schlicht nicht aufgepasst hätten, wie das mit dem Kinder machen funktioniert.

Ich verstehe wirklich, dass Sie alle Fragen haben.

Aber dann fragen Sie Ihren Partner oder den Brockhaus/Wikipedia/ihren Allgemeinmediziner oder schauen Sie in die ""Apotheken Umschau"". Weder ich noch mein Mann MÖCHTEN uns mit Ihnen zwischen Tiergehegen im Zoo, im Supermarkt neben Margarine und KitKat oder in einer Bank zwischen Anzugträgern über Details über unsere Familienplanung im weitesten Sinne und Geburtsvorgänge im speziellen unterhalten. Es greift furchtbar ins Privatleben ein und hinterlässt einen ein bisschen überfahren und nackt.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ein Hirnforscher erklärt, was Kinder mehr als alles andere von ihren Eltern brauchen

Ich bin eine Person, die professionell eine Rampensau sein kann, aber ich bin so nicht, wenn ich mit meiner Familie im Privaten unterwegs bin.

Liebe ältere Dame,

vielleicht wird das ganze für Sie nachvollziehbar, wenn ich Ihnen noch ein paar Fragen stelle:

Haben Sie eigentlich Probleme mit Ihrer Blase? Schaffen Sie es noch immer bis zur Toilette, oder geht auch ab und zu was daneben? Bestimmt, oder? Wie ärgerlich.

Aber Sie tragen doch bestimmt Inkontinenzeinlagen? Vielleicht sind es auch schon Windeln. Welche Marke können Sie denn da empfehlen? Ist der Mann dort hinten Ihrer? Ja?

Wie, auf die Fragen wollen Sie gar nicht antworten?

Sagen Sie mal, Sie wirken noch recht fit, haben Sie und ihr Mann noch manchmal... na Sie wissen schon? Ist das nicht merkwürdig, nach so vielen Jahren?

Ja, wir stehen mitten in einem belebten Zoo am Nachmittag, wieso schauen Sie sich denn so um? Ist doch völlig in Ordnung, sowas zu fragen.

Wissen Sie, ich bin Mutter und nicht meine Kinder sondern andere Menschen sorgen dafür, dass meine Schamgrenze drastisch gesunken ist. Wie, auf die Fragen wollen Sie gar nicht antworten? Zu privat sagen Sie?

Na sowas.

But for some men, the takeaway from these allegations is that men should avoid meeting with women.

Getty/Twitter Ding ding ding! We've found the dumbest take.

On Tuesday night, Seb Gorka, former Deputy Assistant to President Donald Trump, tweeted, “If Weinstein had obeyed @VP Pence’s rules for meeting with the opposite sex, none of those poor women would ever have been abused.” (Mike Pence has previously stated that he follows the “Billy Graham Rule,” and won’t eat a meal alone with a woman except for his wife or attend events where there is alcohol present without her.)

This morning, conservative radio host Erick Erickson wrote a piece asking everyone to “revisit Mike Pence’s rule about meeting with women alone” in light of the Weinstein allegations. “Mike Pence could never be accused of wanting to have sex with someone other than his wife in these sorts of situations because he avoids putting himself and the other person into these situations,” he wrote.

There are a few obvious problems with the suggestion that men must avoid being alone in a room (or at a restaurant table) with a woman in order to avoid committing sexual harassment ― or at least avoid charges of harassment.

First, it implies that men are unable to control their own behavior when in the presence of a woman, and that men have no way of gauging the difference between a professional relationship and a sexual or sexually violating one. (Men, you deserve better than that! I believe in your ability to interact with a woman and not harass or assault her!) It also implies that when women agree to a one-on-one professional meeting with a man, they are putting themselves in harm’s way ― just a hop, skip and a jump away from “asking for it.”

If you think being in the same room with a woman makes it hard to avoid raping or harassing her, perhaps you should stay home. Forever. pic.twitter.com/TN17d1asrN — Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) October 11, 2017

Additionally, when men, who tend to still be the gatekeepers of any industry, decide that they must roll back spending time with their woman colleagues or employees, it can have real, lasting impact on those women’s careers.

A recent New York Times report looked at the ways powerful men across industries have begun scaling back their interactions with female colleagues because of a fear that they might end up facing harassment allegations.

“In Silicon Valley, some male investors have declined one-on-one meetings with women, or rescheduled them from restaurants to conference rooms,” reported Claire Cain Miller. “On Wall Street, certain senior men have tried to avoid closed-door meetings with junior women. And in TV news, some male executives have scrupulously minded their words in conversations with female talent.”

Professional intimacy and relationship-building are key to advancing in any industry. That’s how lower-level employees find mentors or sponsors, or find out about new professional challenges. People give opportunities and recognition to people they trust, and that trust is built through person-to-person interaction ― both at the office and outside of it.

When men decide to limit their interactions with women in order to “protect” women (and themselves), the only people who lose out are those women.","No, The Lesson Of Harvey Weinstein Isn't That Men Shouldn't Meet With Women",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/no-the-lesson-of-harvey-weinstein-isnt-that-men-shouldnt-meet-with-women_us_59de3052e4b0b26332e8746d

A solitary accuser is seen as an opportunist, a gold-digger. Twenty accusers cannot be dismissed so easily. The Weinstein saga is a vivid illustration of the dreary principle that only a community can bring down a man who enjoys a certain kind of power.

It took more than 20 women in all for the full measure of Weinstein’s monstrousness to become known, women who came forward by name with allegations against the Hollywood producer that range from sexual harassment to rape. And that’s to say nothing of the several women who shared their stories with The New York Times and New Yorker anonymously. (Weinstein, via his representatives, has told the press that “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein” and that he considered these “relationships” to be “consensual.”)

Had it been a single accuser, Weinstein would not have been ousted from his own company. We can say this with some certainty because Ambra Battilana Gutierrez had gone to the cops with her story in 2015 and was only smeared in the tabloid press for her troubles. Even though the cops had audio in which the mogul admits to having groped Gutierrez, Weinstein was never charged.

A solitary accuser is seen as an opportunist, a gold-digger. Twenty accusers cannot be dismissed so easily. The Weinstein saga is a vivid illustration of the dreary principle that only a community can bring down a man who enjoys a certain kind of power. It has followed a by-now familiar pattern:

Step 1: A powerful man has a reputation in certain circles for predatory behavior toward women.

Step 2: After years of open secrets (and perhaps even individual stories trickling out in the press), a media outlet manages to report out the allegations, tying them all together.

Step 3: Social media signal boosts these allegations, and mass outrage ensues. The pressure leads to a loss of public standing or the loss of a job or maybe a lawsuit.

These high-profile cases signal a shift in women’s willingness to speak up about sexual harassment and assault, and the cultural reaction to such allegations. This can be attributed to a variety of factors: more transparency surrounding workplace protections, greater media attention to such incidents, and the way social media has changed how we consume and discuss those stories in the first place.

The contagiousness of social media responses can sometimes facilitate swift, sustained outrage. However, not every case of alleged sexual harassment or assault spurs mass anger, and not all that do translate into real consequences for the alleged perpetrator. (See: the President of the United States.) Even in this new era, it takes a critical mass of accusers and witnesses to bring a predatory creep toward the reckoning he deserves. And often the cries have to build up over years, until they are presented in one jarring exhibit.

After all, it’s far simpler to ignore a lone allegation, and there’s far more room to argue over a singular voice’s credibility and motivations ― all of which becomes more difficult when there are five or 15 or 60 eerily similar stories next to each other.

And yet, Trump has faced little-to-no recourse from his supporters and party, outside of some halfhearted condemnations. He was elected to the highest office in the nation. He has proceeded to institute policies that actively hurt women ― like expanding the global gag rule, allowing states to withhold federal funding from Planned Parenthood, and rolling back protections for women workers and the birth control mandate.

On Monday, RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel told Wolf Blitzer that the allegations against Weinstein and Trump are “not even comparable.”

So, what explains this dissonance?

As Rebecca Traister pointed out in The Cut, Harvey Weinstein’s power in the entertainment industry was beginning to show signs of waning. The same could be said about Bill Cosby, who has not (yet) received any legal consequences for the dozens of sexual assault allegations he faces, but whose legacy and reputation have certainly been destroyed.

In contrast, Donald Trump’s star and political power were both on the rise when women began speaking out in large numbers about his allegedly inappropriate conduct. And because the allegations flooded out in the midst of a vicious presidential campaign, it became even easier for Trump’s supporters to convince themselves that the stories were lies, part of a plot by the unconventional candidate’s many powerful detractors.

This speaks to an ugly truth about our cultural “progress” when it comes to grappling with sexual harassment and assault. We are willing to consider the validity of women’s narratives of sexual exploitation ― but only when forced to, and often only when we feel distanced from or oppositional toward the alleged perpetrator.

Essentially, the village doesn’t matter if a man is powerful enough to balance out the costs that might be incurred by keeping him around.

“There’s no evidence that America is unified about how serious and pervasive and damaging sexual violence is,” said Kristen Houser, Chief Public Affairs Officer for the NSVRC. “We’re happy to sit back in our seats and say, ‘Oh gosh, that’s horrible,’ but we as a culture have not yet decided that [sexual violence or misconduct] is a deal breaker. The closer that the perpetrator is to us ― either in reality or in terms of celebrity and hero worship ― [it becomes more] difficult to reconcile those things with allegations of wrongdoing.”",Why (Some) Powerful Creeps Are Finally Starting To Face Consequences,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-some-powerful-creeps-are-finally-starting-to-face-consequences_us_59db90bae4b046f5ad99c1e0

Earlier this year, Apple Music launched a new feature length version of the series with different celebrities standing in for the British actor and preseneter, who serves as executive producer.

Following the news of Chester’s death, James Corden told the Associated Press: “We will approach it in whichever manner his family or the people that were involved in that episode, however they would like it to be handled.

“We will navigate it as delicately as possible and just adhere to whatever wishes they would want because I don’t think there’s any other way we could deal with it.”

우리는 매튜 셰퍼드 같은 사람들을 잊을 수 없다.","ADVERTISEMENT

1998년 10월 6일, 와이오밍 대학교의 게이 학생 매튜 셰퍼드가 잔혹하게 공격당한 동성애 증오 범죄 사건이 있었다. 셰퍼드는 구타와 고문을 당하고 와이오밍 주 라라미 외곽 울타리에 묶인 채 버려졌다. 셰퍼드는 22번째 생일을 50일 앞둔 1998년 10월 12일에 사망했다.

1993년에 태어난 나는 매튜 셰퍼드에게 일어난 일을 알거나 이해할 수 있는 나이가 아니었다. 나는 2007년에 매튜의 죽음에 대한 다큐멘터리 연극 ‘라라미 프로젝트’를 보고서야 그가 누구였는지, 증오 범죄의 구성 요소가 무엇인지 알게 되었다. 그리고 내 자신이 동성애자라는 것을 받아들이고 ‘라라미 프로젝트’에 출연하고 나서야 진정으로 그의 죽음의 심각성에 공감하고 이해할 수 있었다.

나는 매튜 생각을 많이 한다. 23세 게이 남성으로서 그러지 않기란 쉽지 않다. 우리는 여러 모로 비슷하다. 체구가 작고, 여성적이고, 어떤 면으로 봐도 절대 몸이 탄탄하지 않다. 나는 그를 생각할 때 그의 입장에 처하면 어떨지를 상상하지 않을 수가 없다. 내 성적 지향 때문에 죽도록 내버려지는 게 어떨지 상상하지 않을 수가 없다. 우리가 지난 18년 동안 LGBTQ+ 운동으로 큰 진전을 이루었지만, 사실 상황이 많이 나아지지 않았기 때문이다. 트랜스들은 기본적 인권을 부정 당하고 있고, 유색 퀴어들은 소외되고 살해당한다. 게이인 십대들은 이성애자 또래들에 비해 자살율이 8.4배 더 높다.

매튜를 생각하고, 내가 매튜보다 더 오래 살았다는 걸 생각하면 나는 매튜가 지금 우리가 사는 세상을 어떻게 생각할지 궁금해진다. 동성 결혼 합법화, 노스 캐롤라이나 같은 주의 화장실 차별법에 대해 어떻게 느낄까? 우리가 사는 나라를 자랑스러워할까, 1998년 이후 진전이 너무 없었다고 실망할까?

매튜 셰퍼드는 바로 여기 묶인 채 죽었다.

매튜의 18주기를 맞아, 나는 2016년 6월 12일에 일어난 일에 대해서도 생각해 본다. 나는 게이 클럽에 갈 때마다, 동성애 혐오주의자나 트랜스 혐오주의자를 볼 때마다, 나는 오마르 마틴과 그가 펄스에서 학살한 49명을 생각한다. LGBTQ+ 평등을 위한 싸움은 끝났다는 말을 들을 때마다, 나는 그 발언이 얼마나 지독하게도 부정확한지를 상기해야 한다. 우리는 1998년에 싸웠던 것과 똑같은 싸움을 지금도 계속하고 있고, 2034년에도 지금과 같은 장애물을 극복하려 하고 있을 거라고 자신있게 말할 수 있다. 변화는 느리고 고통스럽다. 지금 상황이 좋지 않다는 걸 우리가 인지해야만 상황이 나아진다. 동성 결혼은 합법이지만, 우리가 싸워야 할 추함은 정말 많다. 우리는 이러한 추함을 지속시키는 문화가 우리와 타인들의 책임이라는 걸 인정해야만 싸울 수 있다.

우리는 매튜 셰퍼드 같은 사람들을 잊을 수 없다. 펄스와 같은 비극에서 거리를 두려고 할 수도 없다. 우리는 추함을 우리의 것으로 인정해야 하며, 세상을 더 낫게 만들겠다고 다짐해야 한다. 우리는 우리의 동성애 혐오와 트랜스 혐오를 인지하고 분석해야 한다. 우리의 편견에 의문을 던지고 검토해야 한다. 동료들 사이에서 인기가 없어진다 해도 나설 때는 나서야 한다. 매튜, 무의미하게 학살 당한 크리스털 에드몬즈 같은 모든 트랜스들, 스스로 목숨을 끊은 제이미 로드마이어와 릴라 알콘 같은 모든 LGBTQ+ 청소년들, 펄스에서 우리를 떠나야 했던 49명의 형제 자매들을 위해서 그래야 한다. 그게 우리가 그들에게, 그리고 우리 자신에게 해야 할 일이다.

Deux autres foyers sont entrés vendredi dans le classement des vingt feux aux bilans les plus lourds en Californie: le ""Redwood Valley"" avec 9 morts (10e position) et le ""Cascade"" avec 4 morts (18e position).

Forscher vermuten: Stress während der Schwangerschaft könnte das Demenzrisiko beim Kind erhöhen Wie der Vater, so der Sohn, heißt es. Besser wäre: Wie die Schwangere, so ihr Kind. Denn was eine werdende Mutter isst, wie gestresst und ängstlich sie sich fühlt, prägt sich in Gene und Gehirn ihres Babys ein - und beeinflusst es zeitlebens. Wissenschaftsjournalistin

Ich bin Mutter eines autistischen Kindes - das habe ich euch allen zu sagen Wenn Ihr erfahrt, dass bei einem Kind in Eurer näheren Umgebung eine Autismus-Spektrum- Störung von Seiten einer Fachstelle diagnostiziert wurde, so zweifelt diese Diagnose bitte nicht an!

For hundreds of years, women and girls have been told ridiculous stories about the dangerous super powers they possess when they menstruate. But having a period is a very normal and healthy part of our lives. Despite this, menstruation remains a taboo topic in many settings, and the silence can be damaging.

What you don't know CAN hurt you.

In a recent study involving nearly 100,000 girls in India, almost 50,000 did not know about menstruation until the first time they got their period. Many girls think that they are dying or have a horrible disease the first time they menstruate, as the pain and blood cause confusion and worry.

Some girls are told they cannot participate in certain activities, and others are banished to sleep outside because of these damaging myths. Today, we're busting some of these crazy myths and getting the truth out there.

A group of women from Nepal, who just received UNICEF hygiene kits, learn about maintaining cleanliness during menstruation.

Walking behind someone who has their period might cause your teeth to break.

FALSE.

Not sure where this one came from. In some places in Malawi, people believe that if you are walking behind someone menstruating, there are pretty catastrophic dental consequences.

Showering when you have your period can stop you from having children.

FALSE.

In Afghanistan, some women are told that washing their genitals when they are menstruating can cause infertility.

If you touch a pickle when you have your period, you'll make it go rotten.

FALSE.

In different countries around the world, it is believed that women who menstruate have the power to poison or spoil food.

If you swim when you have your period, sharks will attack you.

FALSE.

If you swim in shark-infested waters, you're going to be at risk of a bite from our grey-finned friends — but that risk doesn't increase when you have your period.

Menstruation is dirty. Girls and women who have their period should be isolated.

FALSE.

Menstruation is a very healthy and normal part of life, but in some places, women are forced to sleep outside or banished to huts to keep them apart from other people and livestock. In Nepal, this practice is known as chaupadi.

When girls are close, they can ""sync up"" and have their period at the same time.

UNCLEAR.

Some research indicates it is true, but other research shows that is not the case. As a sister and female flatmate, I can vouch that synchronized periods do happen, but I would struggle to show you the proof.

Menstrual blood can kill.

FALSE.

In some communities in Burundi, it is thought that contact with a woman who has her period can be deadly for family members.

Girls are weaker when they menstruate.

FALSE.

Women and girls around the world prove this myth wrong every single day. Girls are doing incredible things — even when they don't have a toilet, or sanitary products, to help them manage their period.

You can actually consume more chocolate when you have your period, without taking in any calories.

This is actually a myth that we'd really like to think is true — so we're going to just go ahead and say ""unclear."" Next...

I can play an important role in breaking the damaging silence around periods.

TRUE!

Whether you get your period or not, you can play an important role in breaking the negative taboo associated with menstruation. Strike up a conversation, share a story, ask a question or simply just put it out there — #MenstruationMatters!

La veracruzana, que es más activa en plataformas como Instagram, ha dedicado varios mensajes en el último mes para apoyar a las víctimas del sismo en México, a los ""Dreamers"" de los Estados Unidos en la protección del DACA (Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia) y, en Twitter, al Día de la niña.
Así mismo, Rodríguez dirigirá a la actriz en su próxima película Alita: Battle Angel.
Pero mientras más alto hablemos, menos personas podrán salirse con la suya en el tema del abuso en cada nivel.
Es la crisis de la masculinidad de la que no hablamos.","Las redes sociales, ese ente que se alimenta de la inmediatez, se ha volcado durante las últimas dos semanas en reclamos y condenas contra el productor de cine Harvey Weinstein, señalado por acoso sexual en Hollywood. Pero la respuesta de los miembros más destacados de la comunidad cinematográfica nacional no fue tan rápida.

El llamado dream team mexicano tardó varios días en reaccionar ante la noticia y, hasta el momento, ninguno ha fijado una postura clara en sus redes sociales sobre el tema de abuso sexual y violencia contra las mujeres, a pesar de que varios de ellos han trabajado con anterioridad para este productor.

El cinco de octubre el diario The New York Times publicó una investigación donde se revelan décadas de abuso y hostigamiento sexual contra actrices y personal femenino de las empresas donde Harvey Weinstein es socio fundador junto a su hermano Bob Weinstein. En el reporte del diario estadounidense, la actriz Ashley Judd fue la figura más reconocida en compartir su experiencia de acoso sexual, pero con los días se sumaron otras como Rose McGowan, Mira Sorvino, Asia Argento, Cara Delevingne, Léa Seydoux, Gwyneth Paltrow y Angelina Jolie, por citar solo algunas.

La actriz Mira Sorvino fue protagonista de Mimic (1997), la cinta que le abrió las puertas de Hollywood a Guillermo Del Toro, producida por Dimension Films y Miramax, empresas de Harvey Weinstein. Ella ha hecho declaraciones para diversos medios y más recientemente para Time dijo ""como Embajadora de buena voluntad de las Naciones Unidas y como madre no podía seguir en silencio"".

A Guillermo del Toro, que actualmente está en plena promoción de su nueva película, le tomó aproximadamente una semana opinar sobre el tema. Respondió algunas preguntas en una conferencia de prensa en el London Film Festival, pero se limitó a hablar sobre su experiencia de trabajo con los Weinstein. Más tarde aclaró en Twitter que sólo trabajó para Bob Weinstein y dedicó algunos RT al escándalo, uno de ellos de la actriz Mira Sorvino donde agregó: ""Sobreviví porque valientemente Mira se quedó conmigo"".

May I say this (re: MIMIC): I got a chance to survive because Mira bravely stuck with me. Integrity, intelligence and honesty. https://t.co/Bbovrlouhg — Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) 12 de octubre de 2017

Rose McGowan, protagonista de películas como Scream (1996, Dimension Films) y Grindhouse (2007, The Weinstein Company) apareció en la investigación de The New York Times como uno de los ocho casos de mujeres que sufrieron abuso pero llegaron a un arreglo monetario con los abogados del productor a cambio de su silencio. Esto no le impidió a través de los años hacer declaraciones a medios o escribir mensajes en Twitter donde, sin mencionar nombres, expresaba su molestia. En los últimos días, McGowan ha subido el tono de sus declaraciones e incluso arriesgó su acuerdo de confidencialidad al usar las iniciales del productor y escribir ""HW me violó"".

En un mensaje de 2016 de esta red social, McGowan escribió, refiriéndose al por qué las mujeres no denuncian cuando son violadas: ""Porque mi Ex vendió nuestra película a mi violador para su distribución"". Por años, esta declaración ha sido ampliamente interpretada como una referencia a Harvey Weinstein, pero también a su relación con el director de cine Robert Rodríguez, con quien mantuvo un noviazgo de 2006 a 2009, período en el que filmaron los capítulos de Planet Terror y Death Proof para la película Grindhouse, junto a Quentin Tarantino.

Al cierre de esta edición, Salma Hayek no se había manifestado sobre el caso. La veracruzana, que es más activa en plataformas como Instagram, ha dedicado varios mensajes en el último mes para apoyar a las víctimas del sismo en México, a los ""Dreamers"" de los Estados Unidos en la protección del DACA (Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia) y, en Twitter, al Día de la niña. Pero hasta el momento no había fijado una postura entre la comunidad cinematográfica con respecto a las declaraciones de sus compañeras actrices.

Las que sí se pronunciaron en contra de Weinstein son actrices como Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Kate Winslet y Jennifer Lawrence, todas ellas colaboradoras del productor en varias películas y todas ellas ganadoras de un Oscar gracias a la influencia de Weinstein. Es más o menos el mismo caso de Salma Hayek, quien se lanzó a la fama en Estados Unidos dirigida por Robert Rodríguez en películas como Del Crepúsculo al Amanecer (1996, Dimension/Miramax) y que recibiera su primera nominación al Oscar por Frida (2002, Miramax).

Diego Luna es otro actor que también ha trabajado para los Weinstein, pero que tampoco había externado una opinión sobre el escándalo. Él obtuvo uno de sus primeros papeles protagónicos en Hollywood en Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights (2004, Miramax), donde su coestelar fue la actriz Romola Garai, alguien que también ha declarado a los medios de comunicación haber sido víctima del acoso del productor.

Más recientemente, la actriz Eiza González se abrió camino en Hollywood gracias a la adaptación para televisión de Del crepúsculo al amanecer, interpretando el mismo papel que hiciera famosa a Salma Hayek en 1996. La serie también es producida por Robert Rodríguez para Miramax. Así mismo, Rodríguez dirigirá a la actriz en su próxima película Alita: Battle Angel. Ella escribió un tuit, aunque sin mencionar directamente a Weinstein.

It's a scary world out there for women. In general. But the louder we speak less people will be able to get away with abuse in every level. — Eiza Gonzalez Reyna (@eizamusica) 12 de octubre de 2017

Es un mundo aterrador allá afuera. En general. Pero mientras más alto hablemos, menos personas podrán salirse con la suya en el tema del abuso en cada nivel.

Los que finalmente se animaron a compartir algo sobre este asunto fueron Alfonso Cuarón y Gael García Bernal y también lo hicieron a través de algunos RT. Los mexicanos no han abordado directamente el tema de abuso sexual ni han escrito un mensaje específico en sus redes sociales que se pueda tomar como una postura oficial sobre este tema. También hay que tomar en cuenta que tanto Cuarón como Gael, e incluso Emmanuel Lubezki y Alejandro González Iñárritu, no tenían relación laboral con Harvey Weinstein.

La mayoría de las celebridades mexicanas han estado enfocando su comunicación de las últimas semanas a buscar ayuda para los damnificados del sismo del 19 de septiembre. Sin embargo, en un país como México, donde en promedio mueren cinco mujeres al día víctimas de la violencia, fijar una postura en un caso de alto perfil como este, el acoso sexual de un productor tan influyente como Harvey Weinstein, también debe encontrar espacio en los medios de comunicación nacionales y en la agenda de nuestras celebridades, para que la sociedad mexicana lo sienta como lo que es: algo cercano que nos afecta a todos, y no otra película de Hollywood.

Why Mexico Is Proof Anti-Abortion Laws Don't Work Since January, following President Trump's reintroduction of the Mexico City Policy (an Executive order that withholds American aid from health organisations that provide or even discuss abortion), that hostility has spiked, with abusive tweets filling our social media feeds. This vitriol directed at Mexican women is infuriating on so many levels and inaccurate on at least three.

Según Junqueras, la unidad del independentismo ha sido determinante para haber llegado hasta el actual momento y para haber hecho posible ""el referéndum del 1 de octubre, pese a ser perseguido por todos los medios por parte del Estado español"".

""Pese a todas las trabas y la represión, el referéndum se hizo en condiciones inimaginables en un país democrático, porque no hay ninguna democracia que ordene golpear a los votantes que quieren depositar una papeleta en una urna"", ha subrayado Junqueras.

EVIDENCIAR ""QUIÉN DIALOGA Y QUIÉN SE NIEGA""

""Es importante evidenciar ante los ojos del mundo quién quiere dialogar y quién se niega, quién pide mediación y quién la rechaza, porque esto nos refuerza de cara al mundo y nos da más argumentos para seguir superando obstáculos"", ha explicado el líder de ERC.

Sobre los que ""por desgracia se descuelgan de la unidad"", Junqueras ha recordado lo sucedido con el PSC, ""que el 10 de julio de 2010 se manifestaba junto a las demás fuerzas catalanistas en contra de la sentencia del Tribunal Constitucional sobre el Estatut y que, además, afirmaba que Cataluña tenía el derecho a decidir su futuro"".

""Ahora -ha puntualizado- tenemos un PSC mucho más pequeño, y no por casualidad, la dirección del cual nos dice que no somos los ciudadanos de Cataluña los que tenemos el derecho a decidir, sino que es el PP, y cuya posición no se distingue con este último partido con respecto a la aplicación del artículo 155 de la Constitución"".

En este punto, el presidente de ERC se ha mostrado muy rotundo al descartar cualquier apoyo a una reforma constitucional ""que tendrían que aprobar -ha dicho- los mismos que recortaron el Estatut y que nos niegan el derecho a decidir a los catalanes, y que, encima, estaría tutelada por el mismo tribunal, el TC, que se cargó"" el texto estatutario.

It was the fourth annual conference, having begun in 2014 as a response to the dire state of our ocean's health and the recognition of the importance of the seas and oceans in our lives.



With over three billion people directly depending on our oceans for their livelihoods the issue of ocean health cannot be ignored. Yet if you look around the world you cannot escape the fact that the state of our oceans has never been more precarious.



So at Malta, it was encouraging to hear from many people who wanted to take action; pledging a series of wide-ranging commitments to start reversing the damage done to our oceans.



HRH The Prince of Wales announced a bold blue economy initiative, with policies to support sustainable development. China committed to the creation of 66 'blue bays' around its coastline to protect marine life. And Carrefour announced that by 2020, half of all fish that it sells will come from sustainable sources.



The worrying truth is that the oceans face a range of issues, largely man made. One of those issues is ocean pollution and in particular the damage we are doing by the vast amounts of plastic washing up all over our shores. Our oceans are now drowning in plastic.



According to The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, without change, all the plastic in the ocean could weigh more than all the fish by 2050. The average UK household uses one rubbish truck's worth of single use plastics a year - contributing to the eight million tonnes of plastic that enters our oceans annually.



This is both dire and depressing, and the duty to act never so urgent.



At Sky we are determined to make a stand. Our Sky Ocean Rescue campaign will continue to shine a spotlight on the issues our oceans face, why they are happening and what can be done about it.



We have committed to transform our business and eradicate all single-use plastics from our operations, products and supply chains by 2020. As a start we have removed plastic bottles, cups, cutlery and straws from all our sites and replaced them with corn starch, or paper alternatives. Everyday stuff that soon adds up - we've already reduced our plastic bottle use by 300,000 in just nine months



We are also creating an Ocean Rescue Innovation Fund, anchored by our own capital to help spur innovation in this area. The fund will look for businesses and start-ups that are developing ideas and technology to eradicate single-use plastics from supply chains right across the globe and to stop plastic from ending up in the ocean.



We are inviting others to co-invest with us because we believe that by finding and funding the best ideas from around the world, we will discover new ways to help to solve this problem. By harnessing the capital, expertise and voice of the business community we can, together, accelerate innovation to reverse some of the damage already done.



The reality is not enough is being done by enough businesses. It needs us all to play our part. As an island nation, we are never more than 70 miles from the coast. This could not be more important. Three million people live on the coastline, hundreds of thousands more rely on the ocean for employment and almost every one of us for the food it provides.



This is a vast and complex issue, but what gives me hope is that there are some relatively easy, everyday things businesses can do. If you walked into a bathroom overflowing with water, what would you do? You wouldn't start mopping up the water... you would turn off the tap. So what can businesses do?

“The Wire” actor and Kate Winslet went on the “The Graham Norton Show” last week to promote their new film, “The Mountain Between Us.”

During their chat, Winslet talked about how she took the reins during a sex scene between her and Elba, since she had more experience in the area than her co-star or their director, Hany Abu-Assad.

And that’s when Winslet learned something new about Elba. While Winslet was directing, Elba had one simple request.

“‘Keep your socks on,’” the actress recalled Elba telling her. “I’m like, keep my socks on? Everything else is off. What’s with the socks?”

She then revealed a deep truth about Elba. “He was like, ‘I got a foot thing.’”

Elba immediately followed up her statement by saying to Norton, “I got a thing, you know. Just a thing.”

Winslet, however, thought she understood where Elba was coming from, admitting that she has Hobbit-like feet.

“I’ve got very, very big feet and they’re not particularly beautiful feet, either,” said the actress.

To which, Elba responded: “They’re all right, they’re all right.”

And that’s when Winslet decided to drop the real bombshell. Elba isn’t grossed out by feet at all.

Australians will be able to choose lower premiums for higher excess, and insurers are required to more clearly categorise their policies, under the Federal Government's shake up of private health insurance announced today.

The package of more than a dozen changes to the sector is designed to help reduce costs to government in the medium term and establish processes to identify further reforms in the longer term. The dominant strategy here is to draw more young people into buying health insurance.

The changes consumers will notice are choices to lower premiums, labels on policy packages, discounts for young people, mental health provisions and travel benefits for rural residents. The announcement also includes savings for funds, and potentially government.

But these changes are unlikely to lower premiums in the long run. The value proposition for the funds relies on them getting young people who don't use healthcare much, to pay for a product they are unlikely to use.

Changes for consumers.

Customers will be given the option to increase their excess limit if they want to pay a lower premium. The maximum excess for singles is currently A$500 -- that will be lifted to A$750. Families will be able to increase their limit from A$1,000 to A$1,500.

Fulfilling an election promise, the government is requiring private health insurers to label their package, so it's clear what's in and what's out. Gold products will cover everything, Silver will have a deductible (excess), Bronze will have exclusions (packages where some conditions, such as orthopaedics or obstetrics aren't covered) and Basic, well, who knows. No details about combinations and permutations have been announced.

So, unfortunately, we should expect further product differentiation, and perhaps a quick return to the same choice overload of policies we have today.

Insurers will now be able to offer discounted products to lure people aged between 19 and 29 into health insurance. Discounts of up to two percent for each year before 30 may be on offer, capped at 10 percent and phased out at 40. This is expected to attract some young, healthy people to take up insurance and so improve the insurance 'risk pool' -- by increasing the number of non-users. In theory at least, this should be a net benefit in terms of costs, despite the discount.

In a small boost for private mental health providers and consumers, people who have taken out products that exclude mental health cover will be able to upgrade to full cover, without a waiting period, if they are admitted to a private mental health facility. But this is a tokenistic change that has all the hallmarks of a back-room compromise to avoid a serious reform, such as banning mental health exclusion clauses.

Private hospital insurance will now be able to pay travel and accommodation assistance to people from rural and remote areas to travel to major centres for healthcare. Presumably each fund will choose their offerings, which will mean further complexity for people trying to work out the trade-offs between different insurance offers.

Savings for insurers and government.

Firstly, a raft of natural therapies ranging from tai chi to homeopathy will no longer be covered by funds or subsidised by government. Although popular with some consumers, the health benefits of these services is rarely proven. So they were never a good fit in an insurance scheme which has a hefty taxpayer subsidy.

Secondly, rebates for prostheses will be reduced. The payment rates claimed by private hospitals and device manufacturers -- and paid by insurers -- have been significantly higher than prices paid by public hospitals. Savings of up to A$300 million each year have been pencilled in for this initiative for insurers, with up to A$100 million of that potentially flowing to government through reduced rebates.

But whether these savings will be achieved is an open question. Private hospitals may simply look to replace lost profit on prostheses with increased bed day charges, which will make negotiations between funds and private hospitals over payments that much more interesting.

One savings opportunity for health funds that hasn't received much attention is a move to improve the evidence base for some hospital interventions insurers pay for. This initiative, addressing so called low-value care, will initially focus on the burgeoning rehabilitation and mental health services provided by private hospitals.

The evidence about the value to consumers of bed-based compared to home rehabilitation is weak, but the profits to private hospitals can be large. As Grattan Institute has previously argued, strengthening insurers' powers to question the growth of these services is long overdue.

Who will benefit?

The big winner from the changes is a 25 year old, living in a small rural town, who already has health insurance. They could get a 10 percent discount and improved benefits. But of course, few Australians fall into this category. And whether a 10 percent discount is enough to increase health insurance take up by young people, many of whom are in precarious employment arrangements or unemployed, is a question for the marketeers.

Age distribution of people paying for hospital treatment through private health insurance in June 2017.

To the extent that young people are attracted into health insurance, if private hospitals don't find some way to wrangle increased bed day charges out of the funds to replace losses in prostheses, health insurance payouts will go down. This will benefit all those with insurance by slowing the rate of growth in premiums.

Premiums have gone up at more than twice the rate of inflation over the past few years. And they will probably still increase at rates significantly more than inflation into the future, despite those announcements.

The new arrangements have been designed in close cooperation with the private health insurance industry, and so, not surprisingly, have been welcomed by them. The share prices for stock-exchange listed insurers are expected to increase. However, the hype associated with the announcement is probably not warranted.

The changes will provide some stability for the industry, and they may help consumers make better-informed choices. But the changes will probably slow growth in health insurance premiums only marginally, perhaps by one percent year. And people will still probably drop or downgrade their cover while wage growth remains anaemic and family budgets are under pressure from rising electricity prices.

The government and the insurers are obviously hoping this Friday the 13th will be their lucky day, and that Australia will at last have a healthier private health insurance industry.

We should believe it when we see it.

Basterebbe già questo per zittire quanti blaterano di 'sopruso' nei confronti degli italiani nell'approvare una legge che applichi il principio dello 'ius soli'.

Per chi non lo sapesse, e sono in tanti, questo termine latino - letteralmente diritto (ius) del suolo (soli genitivo di solum)- che sancisce il diritto all'acquisizione della cittadinanza nel Paese sul cui territorio si nasce, indipendentemente dalla nazionalità dei genitori, è applicato in varie forme nella gran parte dei paesi europei e in assoluto in quelli occidentali.

Ciò non vuol dire che se l'Italia lo adottasse così come è previsto dal disegno di legge che dovrebbe introdurlo, con un profilo 'temperato', tutti i bambini partoriti da donne incinte arrivando oggi nel nostro Paese su barconi di fortuna sarebbero considerati italiani.

Ma i professionisti della speculazione politica e in cerca di consenso elettorale vogliono far passare questa verità che, giustamente o meno, allarma l'opinione pubblica.

E allora tocca fare chiarezza. Una volta per sempre. Soprattutto oggi che il presidente del Consiglio Paolo Gentiloni dal palco dell'Eliseo, dove si festeggiavano i dieci anni del Partito democratico, ha garantito che l'approvazione di questa legge di civiltà resta una priorità del suo governo.

Lo farò come se lo stessi spiegando a un bambino di cinque anni. In modo semplice.

Intanto, traducendo direttamente dalla Universal Declaration of Human Rights approvata dall'assemblea generale delle Nazioni Unite il 10 dicembre del 1948, l'articolo 24 del Patto internazionale sui diritti civili e politici recita: ogni fanciullo, senza alcuna discriminazione sulla razza, il colore, il sesso, la lingua, la religione, l'origine nazionale o sociale, deve essere registrato immediatamente dopo la nascita e deve avere un nome. Ogni bambino ha il diritto di acquisire una cittadinanza.

E l'articolo 7 precisa che: gli Stati firmatari della presente dichiarazione devono garantire l'applicazione di questi diritti in conformità della loro legislazione nazionale e dei loro obblighi ai sensi degli strumenti internazionali pertinenti in questo settore, in particolare quando il bambino risulterebbe altrimenti apolide.

Con queste indicazioni, i sottoscrittori della dichiarazione del '48 tra cui ovviamente l'Italia, hanno assunto l'impegno a rispettare il diritto dei minori costretti a nascere al di fuori del proprio Paese di origine, ma anche dei figli di lavoratori migranti ad acquisire una nazionalità all'atto della registrazione dopo la nascita.

Tra gli Stati che finora hanno preso alla lettera le prescrizioni delle Nazioni Unite e non si limitano come in Italia al riconoscimento della cittadinanza secondo il principio dello ius sanguinis ('diritto di sangue') ovvero bambini nati da almeno un genitore italiano, i discendenti che sono in grado di dimostrare la catena parentale fino ai parenti italiani e i figli di ignoti nati in Italia, i più virtuosi in Europa sono la Francia, la Germania, l'Irlanda e la Gran Bretagna.

Il Regno Unito, anche se con la Brexit potrebbe modificare la normativa in materia di cittadinanza, pur non avendo uno ius soli alla nascita garantisce un accesso facilitato alla nazionalità britannica.

Il bambino che nasce sul territorio inglese anche da un solo genitore già in possesso della nazionalità Uk o che è legalmente residente nel Paese da tre anni è automaticamente cittadino del Regno Unito, diritto che si acquisisce anche dopo tre anni di matrimonio con un britannico.

In Irlanda, che come l'Italia riconosce il principio dello ius sanguinis, se un bambino nasce da genitori di cui almeno uno risiede nel Paese regolarmente con un permesso di soggiorno da non meno di tre anni è di diritto irlandese.

Seppur con maggiori restrizioni, anche in Germania è possibile accedere da stranieri alla cittadinanza tedesca. Dal primo gennaio del 2000 è entrato in vigore uno ius sanguinis meno rigido. Tutti i bambini nati da quella data sono riconosciuti 'cittadini' della Germania anche se entrambi i genitori non sono tedeschi. L'unica condizione è che uno dei genitori sia legalmente residente nel Paese da otto anni e abbia un diritto di soggiorno oppure viva lì da tre anni ma con un permesso di soggiorno permanente.

Il sistema più simile a quello italiano, ma che ha adeguato la legislazione in merito alla cittadinanza, è quello francese. Pur non esistendo uno ius soli puro, chi nasce nel territorio del Paese e ha vissuto stabilmente in Francia per un periodo di almeno cinque anni può ottenere la nazionalità quando compie la maggiore età. I figli nati da un genitore straniero nato in Francia viene invece considerato automaticamente francese.

Nonostante l'avvento dell'amministrazione Trump, restano in assoluto gli Stati Uniti il più grande Paese in cui per nascita si applica lo ius soli e dunque si è cittadini americani per il semplice fatto di essere nati sul territorio Usa. La cittadinanza americana dura tutta la vita, a meno che non si rinunci ad essa.

Con l'entrata in vigore del 14esimo Emendamento della Costituzione il 9 luglio 1868, la nazionalità delle persone nate in America è stata regolata da una clausola in cui si afferma: ""Tutte le persone nate o naturalizzate negli Stati Uniti, e soggette alla loro giurisdizione, sono cittadini americani e dello Stato in cui risiedono"".

In Italia non si vuole arrivare a tanto. Se il ddl in attesa di calendarizzazione in Senato, con la speranza che possa essere approvato entro la fine della legislatura - come si è impegnato a fare il premier Gentiloni - un bambino nato in Italia ottiene la cittadinanza se almeno uno dei due genitori si trova legalmente nel paese da almeno 5 anni ed è in possesso di un permesso di soggiorno, un reddito non inferiore all'importo annuo dell'assegno sociale, vive in un'abitazione con i requisiti di idoneità previsti dalla legge e ha superato un test di conoscenza della lingua italiana.

L'altra strada per ottenere la cittadinanza è quella del cosiddetto ius culturae, e passa attraverso il sistema scolastico italiano.

I minori stranieri nati in Italia o arrivati entro i 12 anni che abbiano frequentato le scuole italiane per almeno 5 anni potranno chiedere la cittadinanza italiana, come i ragazzi nati all'estero ma che arrivano in Italia fra i 12 e i 18 anni trascorrendone almeno sei anni nel nostro Paese e dopo avere frequentato a loro volta un intero ciclo scolastico.

Insomma, quanto fanno già i nostri figli che sono italiani.","Lo ius soli non spalanca le porte agli immigrati, è tempo di spiegare bene agli italiani di che si tratta",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/antonella-napoli/lo-ius-soli-non-spalanca-le-porte-agli-immigrati-e-tempo-di-spiegare-bene-agli-italiani-di-che-si-tratta_a_23243409/?utm_hp_ref=it-homepage

On a November morning, two years ago, just a few days before ""Children's Day"", I was standing outside a Barista waiting for an Uber cab I had just ordered. I called the driver for the third time in 15 minutes.

""Arrey kidhar ho?"" I asked him exasperatedly.

""U-turn le ke aa raha hoon!"" he replied equally impatiently.

I hung up, and as I did I heard a thin voice ask, ""Joota polish?""

I looked down to see a boy who could not have been more than 10-years-old squinting up into the sun at me, with his shoe-shine kit slung over his shoulder, asking to polish my shoes.

He looked up scornfully from his polishing and said, ""Do I look like I go to school?"" I instantly felt like an idiot!

I pulled out a ten rupee note out of my pocket and handed it to him. He took a step back indignantly and said, ""I'm not begging."" I suddenly felt ashamed of myself and asked a bit gruffly, ""How much will you charge?""

The boy said, ""Whatever you want to give."" Smart little chap, I thought to myself.

I sat down on the steps of the Barista and started chatting to him as he began scrubbing my shoes.

""What's your name?"" I asked

""Honey,"" he replied.

""How many people in your family?'

""Just me and my mother.""

""What does your mother do?"" I asked him

""Nothing. She's not well, and so I have to work.""

Not quite sure what to say next, I asked him, ""Do you go to school?""

He looked up scornfully from his polishing and said, ""Do I look like I go to school?"" I instantly felt like an idiot!

""Where is your father?"" I asked him.

""Gone"", he replied. I did not probe further.

I looked at his dirty white shirt, and bleached brown hair as he applied the final touches of shoe wax to my shoes and a thought suddenly struck me.

""Have you eaten?""

""Not since last night. I'm starving,"" then he quickly added so as not to have to make me think too much, ""There's a place in the back of the market where they sell rajma chawal for people like me.""

For people like me?

The words stung me like a slap! For people like me?!

Something resembling anger rose up inside me. I pointed to the Barista behind me and said, ""Want to go here for lunch?""

Honey recoiled. ""No, no, no!"" he said. ""They'll never let me in there.""

""Of course they will,"" I said. ""You're my friend, right? I'm taking you for lunch.""

Honey frowned, not exactly sure if my saying I was his friend actually made me one.

""Come on,"" I said to him. ""Let's go."" And I opened the door to the Barista. The look on Honey's face said that either I was mad or he was. We walked into the Barista, me with my laptop bag slung over my shoulder and he with his shoeshine kit slung over his.

All conversation in the Barista suddenly ceased. A complete hush descended on the coffee shop. Even the sound of cutlery died. There were maybe 30 people in the cafe. Every pair of eyes stared at us as we walked to the counter.

""What would you like?"" I said. Honey pressed his nose to the glass. ""That!"" he said, pointing to a rich chocolate truffle pastry.

""One chocolate truffle for my friend please,"" I said to the chap behind the counter who had a wide grin on his face. He was, I guessed, not from a very affluent background himself. The cafe manager, on the other hand, looked like he was frozen in time and space and had no clue how to handle this.

I was starting to enjoy myself now.

""Where do you want to sit?"" I asked Honey, rather hoping he would choose to sit inside. But Honey, the empathetic soul that he was, looked around at the very obvious discomfiture of everyone else in the cafe and said, ""Let's just sit outside.""

We went and sat on the steps of the Barista as he wolfed down his chocolate truffle. He suddenly realised he hadn't offered me any. He held up the half-eaten pastry and said, ""Want some?"" I declined, and he happily went back to finishing it.

My taxi arrived, and I got up to go.

I slipped Honey a hundred rupee note. He said, ""So will I see you again? I'm here every day."" I said, 'Of course,"" and took my leave.

As I settled into the taxi, I heard a rather heavy knock on the window. I turned to see a burly chap in a pink shirt that I remembered seeing in the Barista. I rolled down the window. The big man said in a soft voice, ""I saw what you did there. That was very nice. Thank you.""

I honestly did not know what to say and fumbled for words and a response. Nothing came to mind. I can't remember what I said if anything. All I remember is that I felt a bit awkward and embarrassed.

As the taxi drove away, I turned to see the man in the pink shirt sit down on the steps next to Honey and start chatting to him.

I went back to that market a few days later with a bag of warm clothes for him and then a few times after that, but I never met Honey again. I asked around, but no one seemed to have seen him. It's been two years now. I have no idea what happened to that little chap.

I hope I meet him again.

Earlier today, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmavati trailer was unveiled online.

With Bhansali, who is known to weave magic with his visuals, one expects nothing but a stunning canvass, and with Padmavati, it seems that he has trumped all of his past work.

Padmavati's trailer is moody and atmospheric with an appropriate background score that adds to the tension instead of overwhelming the proceedings.

His three actors: Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, and Shahid Kapoor appear in top form, with Singh's Khilji (who looks a bit like Khal Drogo), looking much more menacing and mad than one initially imagined. To nobody's surprise, Padukone looks dreamy, gorgeous, and completely in command of her titular role.

Bhansali's past work has proven that he has the unique ability to mount films on a stupendous scale without muddling the narrative. Padmavati seems like an extension of the same body of work, but with a lot more ambition.

Produced by Viacom and Bhansali, film opens in cinemas on December 1.

Un chiffre finalement assez similaire en France comme l'a montré Le Monde: environ 3 millions de vapoteurs ""occasionnels"" en 2015 selon l'Institut National de Prévention et d'Education pour la Santé (INPES).

Globalement, la cigarette électronique est l'objet de nombreuses discussions voire controverses. Certains franchissent le pas dans la perspective d'arrêter de fumer tandis que d'autres refusent de recourir à cet outil qui n'est pas sans effet sur la santé.

Paul Taylor, un comédien britannique vivant en France depuis 2009 et à l'origine de la web-série originale, ""What's Up France"", a pris un troisième chemin: celui consistant à railler la e-cigarette, et plus précisément les nouvelles lois françaises la concernant.

""Les e-cigarettes sont les Starbucks du monde des clopes""

Selon un décret entré en vigueur le 1er octobre, il est désormais interdit de ""vapoter"" dans un open space. Dans les faits, tous les lieux de travail ""fermés et couverts à usage collectif"" sont concernés par l'interdiction, comme les entrepôts, les usines, les établissements scolaires ou encore les infrastructures ""destinées à l'accueil, la formation et l'hébergement des mineurs"". Chaque personne ne respectant pas cette loi s'expose à une amende de 35 euros, si ce n'est de 150 euros avec les pénalités de retard.

Habitué à se moquer des Français et de leurs usages dans ses vidéos diffusées sur Canal+, l'humoriste a choisi cette fois-ci de tourner en dérision la nouvelle législation. Avec son rythme dynamique et décalé, ses punchlines incisives et plutôt drôles, le court spot évoque les tenants et les aboutissants de cette loi tout en égratignant le concept même de la cigarette électronique.

Finalement, l'humoriste conclut son sketch avec un message éloquent: ""Mais le vrai problème avec cette loi, c'est que maintenant le gouvernement envoie les gens qui vapotent dehors avec les gens qui fument de vraies clopes donc ils vont les regarder et se dire: 'Bah si je dois aller dehors maintenant, autant recommencer à fumer des vraies clopes!'""

Après s'être moqué de la façon dont ""les Français se font la bise"" dans une vidéo diffusée en janvier 2016, Paul Taylor s'attaque donc au vapotage sur le territoire national. Peut-être l'occasion de créer une nouvelle fois le débat autour de cet instrument.

Impossible naturellement de célébrer la psychanalyse sans évoquer Jacques Lacan, le génial continuateur de Freud.
Sa connaissance de la géographie de la psychanalyse permet à l'historienne de marier un concept à une ville: le ça pour Paris ou le désir pour Rome.
Ainsi, plusieurs parcours sont-ils envisageables dans le Dictionnaire amoureux de la psychanalyse: d'un auteur à l'autre, d'une ville à l'autre ou d'un concept à l'autre.

Il était échu en héritage à Sibylle, la fille mal aimée de Lacan, qui ne lui accordait aucune signification particulière et l'a vendu à l'hôtel Drouot le 5 octobre 1991.

Comble de l'ironie, l'acheteur n'avait rien d'un lacanien obsessionnel: il s'agissait en effet pour cet amoureux attentionné d'offrir un cadeau original à sa fiancée psychologue. Mais n'était-ce pas finalement la plus belle manière de célébrer la mémoire de Jacques Lacan que de faire de son divan un gage de passion?

Comme Élisabeth Roudinesco le remarque dans son Dictionnaire amoureux de la psychanalyse, la conception analytique de l'amour renvoie à toutes les entrées du volume, notamment au transfert. L'historienne a d'ailleurs conçu son dictionnaire comme un inventaire. Elle demeure fidèle en cela à l'enseignement de son ami l'écrivain Georges Pérec –analysé notamment par Jean-Bertrand Pontalis– qui aimait aussi bâtir ses livres à partir de citations.

Dans la liste des aphorismes de Jacques Lacan constituée par Élisabeth Roudinesco, on savourera ses paradoxes sur l'amour. On se rappelle celui-ci: ""L'amour, c'est donner ce qu'on n'a pas à quelqu'un qui n'en veut pas"", ou encore cette autre phrase, moins connue: ""Je te demande de refuser ce que je t'offre parce que ce n'est pas ça"".

Impossible naturellement de célébrer la psychanalyse sans évoquer Jacques Lacan, le génial continuateur de Freud. Mais à la lecture de l'index du volume, on s'aperçoit qu'aux yeux d'Élisabeth Roudinesco, un des contemporains de Lacan a également contribué à enrichir le corpus des textes psychanalytiques. Il s'agit de Louis Althusser.

Le philosophe, en analyse avec René Diatkine à partir de 1964, a écrit d'importants articles théoriques consacrés à la psychanalyse, notamment ""Freud et Lacan"" (janvier 1964). Mais dans sa correspondance amoureuse avec sa traductrice italienne, Franca Madonia, il a plus particulièrement inclus ses perceptions d'analysant.

Son amour pour Franca apparaît comme dépendant de sa relation parfois apaisée mais plus souvent tendue, semble-t-il, avec Diatkine. S'il lui était interdit ""d'apporter"" tous ses rêves à son analyste qui les limitait à deux ou trois par cure, il lui était tout aussi impossible de vivre le bonheur avec Franca.

La page 23 du dictionnaire d'Élisabeth Roudinesco est émouvante car elle associe les Lettres à Franca aux Lettres à Anne de François Mitterrand, récemment parues. Leurs qualités littéraires de premier plan permet d'assimiler ces deux correspondances, qui révèlent en outre deux inoubliables figures de femmes.

Si on ne relève aucune référence à Jacques Lacan dans l'index des Lettres à Anne, on y découvre deux entrées au nom de Freud, dont une relative au transfert: ""j'ai souvent pensé à te faire un enfant.

Du reste, à la liste des lieux favorables aux psychanalystes qu'on trouve dans son dictionnaire, Élisabeth Roudinesco aurait pu ajouter Gordes, ce village du Lubéron qu'Althusser et Mitterrand ont beaucoup fréquenté l'un et l'autre dès le milieu des années 1960.

Now, you will be automatically checked in, and your boarding pass sent to your phone 24 hours before you are due for take off.

So you don’t need to worry about doing anything apart from opening the app.

The change was first noted by a customer who had downloaded the iOS version of the app, but the updates seem to have taken place on the 12 October.

It is not yet clear how Delta plans to manage other administrative tasks that were sorted during the check-in process, such as seat allocation or bag check.

And of course you will still have to get to the airport well in advance for security checks (and an obligatory Duty Free supermarket sweep).

But as Delta are the first US airline to permanently make this change (Jetblue did briefly pilot something similar but scrapped it), it seems hopeful that others will follow suit.

If you've ever been in a house that was built pre-World War II, you'll likely notice the ornate ceilings, leadlight doors and an awkwardly placed television.

While TV was technically available in the 1920s, it was not until 1956 here in Australia that Bruce Gyngell uttered the immortal line, ""Good evening, and welcome to television"".

So, while a dedicated wall upon which to mount or stand a TV eventually became de rigeur in homes, most houses you enter with beautiful art deco features likely also have their TVs crammed into a corner, with the couches on diagonal angles. Because what architect or builder in the 1920s and '30s knew a single box would become the dominant mechanism around which a family would come together of an evening?

Therefore, with the seemingly inevitable rise of virtual reality and augmented reality, you have to wonder just how important a media room is going to be in the coming years.

At the moment, dedicated space for VR seems like a ridiculous extravagance for millionaires. Just like a television set was in its early days.

Ready, headset, go!

We may have been given a sneak peek at the affordable future of VR this week, with Mark Zuckerberg revealing a wireless, standalone headset -- one that requires no PC or smartphone to function -- at the company's Oculus Connect developer conference.

""Standalone is a new category designed to bring more freedom and accessibility to VR,"" Oculus wrote in a blog post.

""Without a cable or the need for a mobile phone, standalone headsets represent a totally new phase of VR hardware.""

While coy on details of battery life and visual fidelity, the Oculus Go does promise a ""high-resolution fast-switch LCD screen"" as well as lenses the company claim to be their ""best ever"".

The entry point? A measly $US199 (around $AU250).

That's less than half the cost of Oculus' top-line headset, which also requires a decked-out PC rig to be anything more than a ridiculous piece of headwear. And it's only about $100 more than the Samsung Gear VR (an Oculus product), which requires a smartphone worth at least $500 to function.

Presenting Oculus Go, Zuckerberg reinforced he and Facebook's commitment to VR, with the CEO making the bold statement, ""We want to get a billion people in virtual reality"".

You can't be content without content.

Of course, assuming the Go is the amazing piece of machinery Oculus promise, even the world's most comfortable, affordable VR headset isn't much good if there isn't a library of worthwhile content.

And that's the other aspect of this week's conference that the company have sought to highlight: the expanding universe of content possibilities.

Since Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014, Zuckerberg has been at pains to point out that he sees the platform as so much more than just an opportunity to take gaming to the next level. This week, he showed an aspect of what's possible, taking a VR tour of hurricane-struck Puerto Rico.

Now, it was an incredibly tone-deaf presentation -- 'Check out all this misery you can experience close-up with our amazing tech!' -- but if you take the sales-pitch aspect out of it, this could be the future of disaster relief.

Pictures may be worth 1000 words but even they can't do justice to the level of destruction that natural disasters inflict. Setting up a walking tour of a disaster-ravaged city or town could immediately impress upon world leaders the severity of a situation, whereas at the moment organising a tour can take days --at a time when every hour counts for desperate people.

Again, he did a poor job of communicating it, but these are the kind of possibilities Zuckerberg has envisioned for VR -- a way to change education, communication, and even humanitarian relief.

Time to start thinking about renovations.

We'll find out what's what when Go is released in early 2018, however Oculus appear to have thrown the gauntlet down to the other companies doing VR.

But if we assume these setups will become commonplace, what will be the point of setting it up in a room full of bulky furniture? You want to immerse yourself in a virtual universe in which you can walk around. And if you're going to enjoy a realistic and safe VR experience, you need to have a relatively large, open space in which to do it.

As stated on Oculus' Gear VR safety precautions, ""Serious injuries can occur from tripping, running into or striking walls, furniture or other objects, so clear an area for safe use before using the Gear VR"".

Granted, the Gear VR also recommends you stay seated throughout, but anyone who's donned a top-of-the-line piece of VR will tell you that the ability to walk around in the environment takes the whole thing to the next level.

And do you really want to pull the couches, coffee table and TV out of your media room every time you want to don the VR headset?

Look, it's not going to take effect tomorrow, so don't chuck out all your living room furniture just yet, but if VR is going to be an essential piece of homeware -- much like the TV -- then there will be broader repercussions.

Perhaps having to call in the renovators will be one of them.",Who Needs Furniture When You Have A Virtual Reality Headset?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/jason-dooris/who-needs-furniture-when-you-have-a-virtual-reality-headset_a_23240794/

As if the dismal count of women leaders wasn't bad enough, it appears that what they are valued for is also drowned in stereotypes. Let's examine both with an example, the numbers and nature of women held up as examples of leadership. Harvard Business School caters to approximately 80% of the business cases studied across the world. Across its 53 best-selling case studies over five years, only seven feature women protagonists (of which two are actually men with names changed to add to the gender mix). Sadly, even this low percentage (13%) beats the real-world figure, despite the rise in the number of women CEOs in 2017 from 21 to 32 amongst the Fortune 500 companies (i.e. 6%).

An INSEAD graduate, Lesley Symons, decided to delve deeper and founded an organisation The Case for Women, which conducts detailed research into the representation of women in business school papers and case studies. To begin with, in the women-led Harvard case studies mentioned above, Symons discovered that these seven women were limited to working in 'pink' industries: food, family, furniture and fashion, that are stereotypically associated with women leaders. She performed the 'Bechdel test' on these case studies (calling it the 'Symons test') and found that only three out of these seven women in leadership positions were actually portrayed as speaking to other women 'about' the business. She also notes that their descriptions are much less in-depth than the important men within the same case study and that they are never accorded any importance in the world portrayed in the case study.

Men take recourse to the narrative of being the breadwinner of the house, hence alleviating any guilt about their inability to help out at home

Apart from their limitation within the 'pink industries', the one glaring aspect about women leaders highlighted in business case studies is how they deal with 'work-life-balance'. Men in leadership positions do not have to be concerned about the home while women leaders must always balance their professional lives with the personal, especially if they have children. Anecdotally, too, whether it is in conferences or celebrated interviews with successful women, there is almost always airtime dedicated to how they cope with work and home, together. Many women leaders offer sage advice on the importance of marrying the right person and having supportive in-laws as critical factors for getting ahead in the workplace!

Talking about 'the right partner', what is the expectation from men? There are studies to indicate that men take recourse to the narrative of being the breadwinner of the house, hence alleviating any guilt about their inability to help out at home. According to a survey by the Working Mother Research Institute, 79% of working mothers are responsible for doing the laundry, and mothers are twice as fathers likely to handle the cooking. The results of this survey also say that working fathers tend to take over the outdoor chores, but working mothers handle most of the childcare.

It is clear that women have to simultaneously deal with the pressure at work, the unfair expectations on them to outperform their peers to prove that they are 'serious' about and committed to their work, as well as the guilt and judgment that comes with being a working mother, from family members and colleagues, if they do not spend time at home. Women who manage both home and work well are idolised as the superwomen of our generation.

But is this a fair expectation?

Is this a fair expectation only of women? While women are beginning to assume leadership positions, with growing representation in areas such as automobiles and defence, we need to create change beyond the professional universe. Conversations at home must change. Whether it is about men wanting to parent more or share domestic chores in greater measure, or women wanting to step out more, these equality-oriented steps have to become more visible and loud. And if we truly want to break stereotypes, work-life-balance must matter to both, equally.

Not only are we not providing enough women role models, but even the ones that exist bear the burden of every existing gender stereotype out there. This can never lead to a balanced 'home' or 'professional space'. If even hypothetical situations (business case studies) fail to show equality in its true sense of the word, how do we influence and change the direction of young minds who will shape the future of the professional world sustainably?

Now that bed-time stories are becoming gender-transformative, isn't it time for business schools to take a cue?

August habe ich mich mit Monika Schulz-Strelow getroffen. Es ging es um Diversity, Frauen und wie wir mehr Frauen in die Aufsichtsräte bekommen. Denn Monika Schulz-Strelow ist Gründungspräsidentin von FidAR e.V. (Frauen in die Aufsichtsräte) und gilt als die oberste Lobbyistin in Sachen Frauenquote. Die Themen Diversity und Frauenquote beschäftigen mich selbst seit vielen Jahren. Deshalb bin ich selbst vor einigen Jahren FidAR beigetreten. Was es heißt, wegen meines Geschlechts in der Unterzahl zu sein, habe ich kürzlich bei der FidAR-Bilanzkonferenz im Juni 2017 erlebt. Dort war ich einer von 34 Männern unter 300 Frauen. Frauen in Führungspositionen erleben das jeden Tag und dies seit Jahrzehnten. Das muss sich ändern! Deshalb meine Botschaft an alle Chauvinisten: Hört Euch an, was Monika Schulz-Strelow zu sagen hat.

Berliner Erklärung: 12 Millionen Frauen fordern gleiche Teilhabe

Auf der FidAR Bilanzkonferenz überreichte der Verein zusammen mit 17 Frauenverbänden die Berliner Erklärung an die Bundesregierung. 12 Millionen Frauen stehen hinter der Erklärung, in der Forderungen an Privatwirtschaft, Wissenschaft, Kultur, Medien und Politik formuliert werden. Frauen müssen in allen Bereichen gleichberechtigt teilhaben können und sie müssen gleich gut bezahlt werden wie Männer, so der Kern der Erklärung. Andernfalls müssen wirksame Sanktionen greifen. Was eigentlich eine Selbstverständlichkeit sein sollte in einer westlichen Demokratie mit einem Grundgesetz, in dem alle Menschen als „gleich"" bezeichnet werden, muss offenbar auch im Jahr 2017 noch erkämpft werden.

Ohne Sanktionen geht es offenbar nicht

Monika Schulz-Strelow ist Feministin und sie ist in der Privatwirtschaft zu Hause. Sie hat jahrelange Berufserfahrung in der internationalen Wirtschaft. Das Letzte was man ihr vorwerfen könnte ist, dass sie nicht weiß, wovon sie spricht, wenn sie von den Unternehmen mehr Geschlechtergerechtigkeit fordert und dazu aufruft, Aufsichtsräte, Vorstandsposten und Führungspositionen im oberen und mittleren Management mit mindestens 30 Prozent Frauen zu besetzen. Ihr Verein FidAR, der 2006 von acht Frauen mit ihr als Gründungspräsidentin ins Leben gerufen wurde, hat mittlerweile 700 Mitglieder und betreibt in Berlin erfolgreich Lobbyarbeit in Sachen Frauenquote. Dabei kommt es ihr vor allem auf die Privatwirtschaft an, denn dort gibt es noch immer zu wenige Frauen in den Top-Positionen. Ihre Bilanz nach zwölf Jahren Lobby-Arbeit: „Dort wo gesetzliche Regelungen erlassen wurden, sind große Erfolge erzielt worden. Überall, wo Unternehmen freiwillig entscheiden können und nicht mit Sanktionen rechnen müssen, bleiben alte Strukturen bestehen.""

Quelle: Stephan Grabmeier / YouTube



30 Prozent Frauenquote in Aufsichtsräten erreicht

Am 1. Mai 2015 trat die 30-Prozent-Quote für Aufsichtsratsposten in börsennotierten Unternehmen mit paritätischer Mitbestimmung in Kraft. 160 Unternehmen waren davon betroffen: frei werdende Aufsichtsratspositionen mussten zum großen Teil mit Frauen nach besetzt werden. Trotz großen Gejammers und Weltuntergangsstimmung ist die Folge des Gesetzes, dass heute 29 Prozent der Aufsichtsratsposten mit Frauen besetzt sind. Und, wie Monika Schulz-Strelow süffisant bemerkt: „Kein Unternehmen ist deshalb in die Insolvenz gegangen.""

Diversität bringt Unternehmen und Menschen weiter. Mit diesem Motiv wirbt FidAR um männliche Mitglieder (Bild: © FidAR)

Damit hat sie Recht. Ich möchte aber sogar noch einen Schritt weiter gehen: Die Unternehmen profitieren von Diversität, von anderen Blickwinkeln, von mehr Diskussionen und neuen Lösungsansätzen für Probleme. Machostrukturen, die ihre Macht und Pfründe sichern wollen, erhalten sich zwar vielleicht die eigenen Privilegien. Aber sie sorgen bestimmt nicht dafür, dass Unternehmen sich positiv entwickeln. Denn dafür braucht es Mut, Neues zu wagen. Dieser frische Wind kommt bestimmt nicht von den immer gleichen alten weißen Männern. Diversity ist deshalb das Gebot der Stunde und dazu gehören auch mehr Frauen in Entscheidungspositionen.

Männliche Strukturen machen es Frauen schwer

Noch immer prägen tradierte männerdominierte Muster Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft. Wenn wir diese unbewussten Denkmuster und Vorurteile nicht endlich durchbrechen, wird sich so schnell nichts ändern.

Wie stark Rollenmuster Meinungen und Einstellungen beeinflussen, habe ich bei der Deutschen Telekom erlebt. Dort war ich u.a. für die Unternehmenskultur verantwortlich und durfte in dieser Rolle die Einführung einer 30-Prozent-Frauenquote für Führungspositionen aktiv mitgestalten - und die Abwehrreaktionen einer tradierten Organisation erleben. Mit dem damaligen CEO René Obermann und dem CHRO Thomas Sattelberger hat sich die Deutsche Telekom AG als erster DAX-Konzern dazu verpflichtet, bis 2015 30 Prozent Frauen in Führungspositionen zu bringen. Ein einzigartiger Schritt mit hoher Strahlkraft. Leider bisher einzigartig.

Wie stark jahrhundertealte, diskriminierende Muster gegen Gleichstellung auch heute noch immer wirken, zeigt die Tatsache, dass sich bis heute kein männlicher Vorstand der deutschen Wirtschaft traut, sich zu einer Frauenquote zu verpflichten. Wovor haben die Chauvis in den Vorstandsetagen nur solche Angst? Davor, sich auf dem Golfplatz in ihrem Old Boys-Netzwerk rechtfertigen zu müssen? Oder davor, in der eigenen Familie das Rollenbild an die Moderne anzupassen? Oder davor sich selbst zu ändern und von Rollenbild Stereotypen Abstand zu nehmen?

Wie lange werden wir FidAR wohl noch brauchen?

Monika Schulz-Strelow bringt für ihr Ziel, mehr Frauen in Führungspositionen zu bringen, viel Energie und Begeisterung mit - „manchmal zu viel für andere"", wie sie selbst sagt. Als Kämpferin für die Frauenquote erwartet sie, dass Frauen, die nun in Top-Positionen kommen, eine Vorbildfunktion für andere ausfüllen. Die Quote sieht sie als Türöffner: Kompetente Frauen mit guter Performance stünden ohne die Quote vor der verschlossenen Tür. Die Quote stößt diese Tür auf - aber durchgehen muss jede Frau selbst. Jeder hat selbst die Verantwortung für seine Erfolge: „Erwartet nicht, dass andere alles für Euch machen. Steht auf und macht es selbst"", fordert sie. So ist die Frauenquote für sie eine Übergangslösung. Nichts wäre ihr lieber, als in einigen Jahren FidAR aufzulösen, die Lobbyarbeit an den Nagel zu hängen und das Gesetz zur Quote wieder abzuschaffen, weil alle Ziele erreicht wurden. Hoffen wir, dass Monika Schulz-Strelows Wunsch bald in Erfüllung geht. Ich setze mich, wie viele andere Frauen und moderne Männer dafür ein.

C'est ce que rapportent quatre sources proches de l'enquête de Ronan Farrow, le journaliste de NBC News qui a publié son enquête dans le ""New Yorker"" cette semaine. Un vrai tournant, après de longs mois de travail sur une histoire qui avait porté malheur à toute une génération de journalistes.

Ronan Farrow ne manquait déjà pas de matière. En mars, il s'était procuré un enregistrement aussi accablant que convoité où Harvey Weinstein avouait avoir peloté une mannequin italienne. D'anciens cadres et assistants ayant collaboré avec le producteur s'étaient fait l'écho des harcèlements et autres agressions sexuelles qu'il pratiquait au quotidien. Et maintenant, il disposait d'un témoignage vidéo qui l'accusait de viol.

Mais le journaliste s'est alors heurté à l'autorité de sa chaîne. D'après quatre sources, des cadres de NBC News lui ont déclaré que son enquête ne comprenait pas assez de matière pour être diffusée, et qu'il devait cesser d'y travailler. NBC a tenté d'empêcher l'interview de la victime présumée du viol, lui interdisant de la tourner avec l'une de leurs équipes ou de mentionner ses liens avec la chaîne. Finalement, c'est de sa poche que Ronan Farrow a dû financer l'enregistrement de ce témoignage.

Au niveau de NBC, le projet était officiellement mort. Peu de temps après, le journaliste a reçu la permission de le proposer à un autre média. Le résultat, publié mardi par le ""New Yorker"", est une véritable bombe: de multiples femmes y accusent Harvey Weinstein de viol et autres agressions sexuelles, en plus de l'enregistrement où le producteur lui-même admet des faits sérieux.

Le New Yorker a diffusé l'enregistrement d'une dispute survenue dans un hôtel entre Harvey et une jeune mannequin.

Mercredi, lors d'une assemblée publique de NBC News, son président Noah Oppenheim a déclaré: ""L'idée que nous ayons pu essayer de couvrir une personnalité puissante est profondément offensante pour nous tous. Comme de nombreux autres, nous avons essayé de couvrir cette histoire, mais au final, ce n'est pas nous qui l'avons sortie.""

D'un ton attristé, il a ensuite suggéré que c'était par simple manque de ressources que le reportage né au sein de la NBC n'avait pu voir le jour. ""Au cours de l'été, nous avons estimé ne pas avoir assez d'éléments pour publier cette histoire.""

Mais les témoignages de 12 personnes directement impliquées dans l'enquête, internes ou externes à NBC News, laissent voir un tout autre scénario. Toutes ont demandé à rester anonymes, n'ayant pas le droit de s'exprimer dans les médias sur ce reportage ou craignant des représailles des dirigeants de NBC. Toutes racontent des mois de combat au sein de la chaîne, Noah Oppenheim et d'autres responsables traînant les pieds et freinant la progression du reportage de Ronan Farrow par leurs réticences et leurs hésitations.

Au final, ces inquiétudes ont pris une tournure plus personnelle, au point de voir se brouiller les lignes entre désir de patience et de rigueur de la part de la chaîne et efforts des équipes de Harvey Weinstein pour discréditer l'enquête.

D'après de multiples sources ayant travaillé sur le reportage mort-né, Noah Oppenheim a rapporté à Ronan Farrow une plainte émise par les avocats du producteur: le journaliste était en situation de conflit d'intérêts, Harvey Weinstein ayant contribué à relancer la carrière de son père Woody Allen, avec lequel il a rompu tout contact. Cet angle d'attaque a aussi été utilisé une fois l'article soumis au ""New Yorker"". Ce dernier, pourtant connu pour la rigueur de ses contrôles, n'a pas jugé l'argument recevable.

D'après plusieurs sources proches, les déclarations de Noah Oppenheim et la ligne de défense de la chaîne sont en opposition directe avec les témoignages de personnes ayant participé à la mise au point du reportage.

Ronan Farrow, qui avait entamé son enquête en janvier et, fin juillet, avait interviewé au moins huit femmes — dont certaines avaient accepté d'être filmées — s'était vu affirmer à deux reprises que son reportage était ""publiable"", ayant passé les rigoureuses vérifications légales et factuelles imposées par la chaîne, selon quatre sources très au fait de ce processus. Selon elles, une autre journaliste d'investigation avait été sollicitée pour réexaminer l'enquête, à laquelle elle n'avait trouvé aucun problème.

Des cadres de NBC News auraient fait savoir à Ronan Farrow que son reportage sur Harvey Weinstein n'avait pas assez de matière pour être diffusé.

C'est en janvier que Ronan Farrow a réalisé son premier coup de maître: une interview filmée où Rose McGowan accusait Harvey Weinstein de l'avoir agressée sexuellement quand elle avait 23 ans. D'après le ""New York Times"", l'actrice et le producteur ont passé un accord amiable de 100.000 dollars en 1997. Menacée de poursuites, elle a finalement retiré sa permission pour l'exploitation de la vidéo.

En mars, Ronan Farrow s'est procuré un enregistrement où Harvey Weinstein admettait avoir agressé sexuellement la mannequin italienne Ambra Battilana Gutierrez. La jeune femme l'avait dénoncé à la police de New York, expliquant aux fonctionnaires qu'il lui avait peloté les seins et avait tenté de mettre sa main sous sa jupe.

La police l'a alors équipée d'un micro pour lui permettre d'enregistrer sa prochaine conversation avec le producteur, survenue au Tribeca Grand Hotel de New York.

Sur l'enregistrement, on entend Harvey Weinstein presser la mannequin de le rejoindre dans sa chambre. À la fin de cette conversation tendue, il admet l'avoir agressée sexuellement: lorsqu'elle lui demande pourquoi il lui a touché les seins la veille, il répond ""Oh, je t'en prie, je suis désolé. Allez, viens"", puis ""J'ai l'habitude de le faire. Allez, s'il te plaît.""

""Vous avez l'habitude?"" réplique la jeune femme.

""Oui"", répond-il avant d'ajouter: ""Je ne recommencerai plus.""

Depuis deux ans déjà, les journalistes de multiples médias s'efforçaient de mettre la main sur cette pièce accablante. Pour nombre de ces organismes, à elle seule, elle aurait bien mérité tout un article. Et même sans souhaiter la diffuser à la télévision, NBC News aurait très bien pu publier le reportage en ligne — ce que Ronan Farrow a aussi cherché à obtenir, avec l'aide de Rich McHugh, producteur spécialisé dans l'investigation à NBC. Le journaliste se serait même montré impatient de voir paraître une partie de son travail, espérant briser ainsi le silence et permettre à d'autres sources de se manifester.

En avril, NBC News avait deux énormes scoops à disposition: l'interview vidéo de Rose McGowan et l'enregistrement-confession de Harvey Weinstein. Et pourtant, de multiples cadres et producteurs de la chaîne ont déclaré au journaliste que son travail d'enquête et ses interviews ne suffisaient pas pour un reportage télévisé. D'après quatre sources, Ronan Farrow et Rich McHugh ont également rédigé un long article destiné au site de NBC News — qui n'a pas non plus été publié.

En juillet, le reportage était devenu une véritable bombe, comprenant notamment des interviews vidéo des victimes présumées et des entretiens avec quatre anciens cadres de Miramax et Weinstein Co., hommes et femmes.

À ce stade, Ronan Farrow et Rich McHugh se sentaient prêts à la publication. Le reportage devait cependant être approuvé par Andy Lack, président du conseil d'administration de NBC News Group, et réexaminé par Steve Burke, vice-président exécutif de Comcast et président et PDG de NBC Universal. Un niveau de contrôle plus qu'inhabituel, d'après trois employés de la chaîne: il était inédit qu'un reportage ait à passer par le bureau de Steve Burke.

En août, selon quatre sources, Ronan Farrow s'est vu répéter qu'il n'avait pas assez de matière pour publier son histoire, mais aussi qu'il devait mettre fin à son enquête — une position intenable.

Parmi les personnes qu'il avait interviewées, on compte Ken Auletta, une grande figure du journalisme. Plus tôt dans sa carrière, ce dernier avait lui-même tenté de révéler l'attitude de prédateur de Harvey Weinstein. Selon deux sources ayant eu accès à son interview et le compte rendu légèrement différent du journaliste Lloyd Grove dans The Daily Beast, après avoir examiné le travail de Ronan Farrow, Ken Auletta aurait déclaré face caméra: ""Si NBC News ne fait rien de tous les éléments récoltés par Ronan, cela créera un énorme scandale et jettera l'opprobre sur la chaîne.""

Finalement, Ronan Farrow a soumis son reportage au ""New Yorker"", qui l'a publié lundi après le contrôle scrupuleux de son armée de réviseurs et de fact-checkers.

""Ronan Farrow est venu nous voir il y a environ deux mois, en ayant déjà réalisé un très important travail d'investigation"", a déclaré son rédacteur en chef David Remnick. ""Il a travaillé d'arrache-pied, assisté par nombre de mes collègues du ""New Yorker"", pour approfondir encore son article et le rendre publiable. C'est un véritable exemple en matière de journalisme d'investigation.""

NBC s'est aussi montrée réticente à reprendre les articles d'autres médias sur Harvey Weinstein. Jeudi dernier, lorsque le ""New York Times"" a publié son exposé de sa longue carrière de harceleur sexuel présumé, les chaînes CBS et ABC ont toutes deux repris l'information dans leurs émissions du soir. Mais NBC s'est fait remarquer par son silence dans son émission ""NBC Nightly News"", bien qu'elle ait eu sept heures pour se préparer (l'article du ""New York Times"" ayant été publié à 11 h heure locale).

Des sources internes à la NBC ont déclaré que l'émission avait déjà trop de sujets à couvrir — notamment les suites de la fusillade de Las Vegas et une information selon laquelle le secrétaire d'État Rex Tillerson aurait traité Donald Trump de ""débile"". Mais l'émission a aussi trouvé le temps pour une séquence sur les réflexions sexistes adressées à une journaliste par Cam Newton, un joueur de la NFL, et une autre sur les artistes nominés pour le Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

Deux sources proches de la production ont rapporté au HuffPost que c'était Noah Oppenheim qui avait décidé de ne rien diffuser sur Harvey Weinstein, affirmant à son personnel que le producteur n'était pas une figure nationalement connue. Le week-end suivant, critiqué pour n'avoir inclus aucune vanne sur l'affaire dans le ""Saturday Night Live"", Lorne Michaels, le producteur exécutif de l'émission, a maintenu cette ligne en déclarant au Daily Mail que c'était une histoire ""bien new-yorkaise"". Selon des sources internes à la NBC, certains employés en sont venus à se demander si ce n'était pas là un élément de langage décidé en interne pour justifier cette faible couverture.

Noah Oppenheim, président de NBC News, s'exprimant lors d'une assemblée publique:

Le lendemain matin, NBC était une fois de plus dépassée par les chaînes concurrentes: dans leurs émissions ""Good Morning America"" et ""This Morning"", ABC et CBS ont diffusé des reportages de dix et cinq minutes sur Harvey Weinstein. En contraste, pendant l'émission ""Today"", le présentateur Craig Melvin s'est contenté de quelques phrases lues sur son prompteur, qui rapportaient principalement la défense du producteur face aux accusations détaillées du ""New York Times"".

Les employés auxquels nous avons parlé se sont dits très choqués et frustrés d'apprendre que leur chaîne avait eu en main l'enregistrement où le producteur avouait s'être livré à une agression sexuelle. D'après eux, ce scoop manqué a créé une ambiance délétère au sein de la rédaction.

Il a aussi rappeléune autre occasion où la NBC avait manqué sa chance de révéler une affaire de harcèlement sexuel présumé.

En octobre 2016, c'était NBC News qui disposait de l'enregistrement devenu célèbre où Donald Trump disait aimer attraper des femmes ""par la chatte"". Bien que la chaîne en ait eu la propriété, c'est le Washington Post qui l'a finalement publié.

The damage control effort will begin with a special briefing early Monday morning for Liberal backbenchers, some of whom have been among the most vocal opponents of the measures.

Sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly, say Morneau wants to demonstrate to anxious Liberal MPs that he's heard their concerns about his tax reform plan and is addressing them.

Watch Trudeau, Scheer trade shots on taxes:

The proposed reforms were intended to put an end to measures which the government contends have allowed wealthy individuals to use incorporation as small businesses to unfairly reduce their income tax burden.

They triggered an angry backlash from doctors, lawyers, accountants, shop owners, farmers, premiers and even some Liberal backbenchers, who maintained the reforms would hurt the very middle class Canadians that the Trudeau government claims to be trying to help.

The changes are expected to ensure the reforms are targeted more clearly at the wealthy.

They're also expected to address concerns that the reforms will disproportionately impact women, inhibit the ability of small business owners to save for a rainy day and make it impossible for farmers, fishers and others to pass their businesses on to their children.

Morneau has acknowledged changes are required to address some of the concerns raised and to ensure there are no unintended consequences.

One source said that Morneau intends to emphasize to Liberal backbenchers that he will continue listening to any concerns about the proposed reforms, suggesting that Monday's changes won't necessarily be the end of the story.

Not the end of the story

As originally proposed, the plan would restrict income sprinkling, in which an incorporated business owner can transfer income to a child or spouse who is taxed at a lower rate, regardless of whether they actually do any work for the company.

It would also limit the use of private corporations to make passive investments that are unrelated to the company and curb the ability of business owners to convert regular income of a corporation into capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

The proposals were unveiled in mid-July but it took about a month for the backlash to materialize. Since then, the Liberals' popularity has taken a hit in some public opinion polls and the governing party's backbenchers have become increasingly anxious.

A number of Liberal MPs, including finance committee chair Wayne Easter, have complained about the messaging surrounding the proposals, which they say portrays small business owners as tax cheats.

Tories blast villa discovery

The Conservatives have used the furor to accuse Morneau of hypocrisy, targeting small business owners while doing nothing to deal with legal tax avoidance strategies used by large corporations like Morneau Shepell, a human resources company headed by the minister until his appointment to cabinet in 2015.

That line of attack was bolstered Friday by news that for two years, Morneau failed to disclose to the federal ethics commissioner that he and his wife are partners in a private company that owns a family villa in southern France. CBC News reported that holding property through a private company is useful in avoiding inheritance taxes in France.

Morneau's ownership of the villa was disclosed but the involvement of the private company was not until last month, when CBC began to ask questions about it.

Dan Lauzon, a spokesman for Morneau, called the failure to disclose the company an ""administrative error"" and said the minister's office is working with federal ethics watchdog Mary Dawson to ensure he's ""in full compliance with the spirit and letter of the rules.""

Le PSG s'est imposé (2-1) in extremis à Dijon ce samedi 14 octobre grâce à un doublé de Thomas Meunier, lors de la 9e journée de Ligue 1. Les hommes d'Emery ont arraché la victoire dans les arrêts de jeu, non sans souffrance, après une magnifique frappe du Dijonnais Benjamin Jeannot, qui a bien failli offrir le point du nul aux Bourguignons.

Finalement, le latéral belge Thomas Meunier a à deux reprises sauvé la mise des Parisiens, d'abord en profitant d'une tentative de Neymar repoussée par le gardien à la 71e minute pour ouvrir enfin le score, puis dans les arrêts de jeu (90+2) pour donner les trois points au PSG après l'égalisation de Benjamin Jeannot.

Ce résultat permet au PSG de prendre six points d'avance en tête de la Ligue 1. Et il tombe à pic pour éloigner un peu les sujets qui fâchent, en l'occurrence les déboires du président du Paris SG. Nasser Al-Khelaïfi a en effet été mis en cause en fin de semaine par la justice suisse dans une affaire de corruption présumée qui concerne son activité de président de BeIN Medias et qui, si elle ne touche pas directement le PSG, le concerne quand même un peu, forcément.

Now that Trump occupies the White House, the union’s president, D. Taylor, says the best place to fight his presidency and his policies is still in the workplace.
“Most of these jobs are not good jobs,” Taylor said of the sort of hotel and food service jobs that Trump, as a businessman, was best known for.
“The only way those jobs change is if people have good union contracts, decent wages, good healthcare and retirement benefits.
Taylor said such contract wins are one way unions can push back on Trump’s immigration policies at the bargaining table.","The hospitality workers union Unite Here was tangling with Donald Trump long before he ever became president. While the business mogul made his run for the Republican nomination last year, the group waged ― and eventually won ― a scrappy battle to unionize the housekeepers and restaurant workers at his hotel on the Las Vegas strip.

Now that Trump occupies the White House, the union’s president, D. Taylor, says the best place to fight his presidency and his policies is still in the workplace.

“Most of these jobs are not good jobs,” Taylor said of the sort of hotel and food service jobs that Trump, as a businessman, was best known for. “The only way those jobs change is if people have good union contracts, decent wages, good healthcare and retirement benefits. As much as we’d all love for manufacturing jobs to come back, we think we need to turn these [hospitality] jobs into good jobs.”

Unite Here has added 12,000 new members this year, many of them at hotels and casinos in the South, bringing the union’s ranks close to 300,000. According to Taylor, the past year has been the union’s fastest-growing in a long time, “at a time when we’re told you can’t grow.” (Union membership in the private sector has now fallen to below seven percent in the U.S.)

As a show of force, the union plans to hold demonstrations in 40 different cities on Oct. 19, ratcheting up labor fights with companies like Disney, Marriott and Google, while protesting the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies. The point, Taylor said, is to show that “we need advancement in our working standards, and we need protections for the workers who drive this industry.”

For many members, those immigration policies are personal. As a union of service workers, Unite Here’s membership skews toward immigrants. In Florida, the union represents 500 Haitian workers at Disney World who could potentially lose their temporary protected status that shields them from deportation. Trump’s Department of Homeland Security is weighing whether or not to end the Haitian TPS program, which allows some 59,000 people to stay in the U.S. rather than return home to a country that was battered by natural disasters.

Although Unite Here and Disney don’t always get along, the two have been playing on the same team when it comes to lobbying to preserve the protected status program. Taylor said pressure from businesses could be the deciding factor for the administration.

“If the employers step up, we have a chance,” Taylor said. “If not, I don’t see why Trump wouldn’t screw not just Haitian workers but Salvadoran workers and whoever else.”

In New York, food service workers from Madison Square Garden plan on marching to Trump Tower to call on the president to preserve TPS as well as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants temporary work permits to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Trump has announced an end to DACA, which was started by former President Barack Obama, and called upon Congress to come up with a fix. He’s threatened to use DACA recipients as a bargaining chip in negotiations over border security.

“Our union has a lot of immigrants from all corners of the globe,” said Gerard Cerda, who’s been a beer vendor at Madison Square Garden for 24 years. “Many of them are lower-paid employees. We have to support their efforts to better their lives.”

Unite Here has been negotiating clauses in their collective bargaining agreements to protect immigrant workers, an effort the union says has become more urgent under Trump. The strategy includes getting employers to agree not to allow immigration officers onto a job site unless they have a warrant, and also promise not to do “self-audits” of employees’ immigration paperwork unless the government forces them to. The union also wants employers to agree to contribute money to assistance funds for undocumented workers who lose their jobs.

Kaitlyn Smith aus Baltimore ist ihre teure, neue Lederhandtasche gestohlen worden - inklusive Kreditkarten, Bargeld, iPad und Führerschein. Einige Tage später lief sie die Straße, in der sie wohnt, entlang und sah einen Mann mit einem schmutzigen weißen Shirt und zerfledderten Jeans. In der Hand: Ihre Handtasche.

Sie ging auf den Mann zu und bot ihm Geld, um ihm die Handtasche wieder abzukaufen. Doch er verneinte und sagte, er würde eine Dame namens Kaitlyn suchen. Als die junge Frau dem Mann zu verstehen gab, dass sie die Gesuchte ist, sank der Mann erschöpft vor ihr zusammen.

Der unbekannte Finder suchte nach Kaitlyn

Er erzählte Kaitlyn, dass er Aeric McCoy heiße und ihre Handtasche in einer Gasse gefunden habe. In der Handtasche war ein Zettel, auf dem ihre Adresse stand. Also beschloss er, sie ihr zurückzubringen. Ihm selbst sei vor kurzem der Schlafsack gestohlen worden - daher wisse er genau, wie frustrierend es ist, wenn man bestohlen wird.

Kaitlyn gab Aeric einen Schlafsack, eine Taschenlampe, Kleidung, einen neuen Rucksack und brachte ihn zurück nach Hause - denn Aeric war den ganzen, Kilometer weiten Weg durch die halbe Stadt zu ihr gelaufen. Auf dem Rückweg erzählte Aeric Kaitlyn, dass er heroinabhängig sei. Früher hatte er eine eigene Firma gehabt und als Landschaftsgärtner gearbeitet.

Sumra Muslim potters return every year to Sarkhej Roza, where their goods are bought by Hindu wholesale traders, evoking secular unity

By Gajanan Khergamker*, Ahmedabad, Gujarat

Every morning, Rehman Sumra of Kheralu village in Mehsana district rummages through his wares, salvaging whatever he can, packing them for his annual journey to work. Each passing day brings increased anxiety to the Muslim potter who, like his fellow craftsmen, was hit the worst by the most recent floods in Gujarat. ""The rains have stopped, and it's time to go to Ahmedabad and start work,"" he says, looking at the cloudy skies.

Each year in September, more than a hundred potters belonging to the Sumra community head for Ahmedabad's Sarkhej Roza from their villages in Mehsana. In Sarkhej Roza, they set up makaan and karkhana, (home and workshop) at spaces they take on a five-year lease.

Running out of money as their work had been delayed, Rehman incurred unexpected additional expenditures in repairing his flood-hit village home. While the government forces rescued stranded citizens from Banaskantha, Patan and Mehsana districts in north Gujarat, the badly affected potter community waited out the monsoons. ""We have gone through with our savings, there's no work in the village, and to top it, we suffered financial loss owing to the rains,"" Mariam, Rehman's wife, told VillageSquare.in. Having lived off their earnings during the heavy monsoon, the Sumras are keen to get back to work.

Strengthening secular ties

In spite of the hardships and hand-to-mouth existence, the Sumras look forward to their work. For the economic activity has carved out a beautiful socio-cultural association as the Muslim Sumra families make pots for the predominantly Hindu Kumbhar community in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, strengthening secular ties, especially in troubled times.

With the rain clouds receding and humidity decreasing, Rehman and his wife Mariam are set to return to Sarkhej Roza to start their work once again. For the next eight months, the Sarkhej Roza suburb of Ahmedabad will be home to Rehman and hundreds of other Muslim potters.

From Diwali until the next chaumasa, as they call the monsoons, they will make thousands of pots that would be bought by both wholesalers and retailers. The Sumras specialise in making pots of different shapes and sizes for storing water and keeping it cool during summers.

Each kumbharwada, as a settlement of potters is known, has approximately 20 potter families residing and working together. The potter families in a kumbharwada are mostly from the same village. The shanties are lined next to each other and covered with huge plastic sheets. Pots are placed in beautiful symmetrical patterns, in rows and stacked vertically, to be sold in the wholesale market.

The families in a kumbharwada pay a landlord who owns the entire plot and rents out each shanty for Rs 1,200 per month. With an additional expenditure on electricity, the charges add up to Rs 2,000 per month, and the potters do not pay any deposit. They make five-year agreements and work entirely on trust.

The potter families who come to Sarkhej Roza have been doing so regularly for the past 15 years. Some like Noori have been coming for 20 years. ""In fact, I live here and go to my village only when I have to attend a family function,"" said the 50-year-old from Sidhpur in Patan district For many, the temporary homes seem more permanent to them than the houses in their native villages.

Making pots, not money

The pottery process isn't exactly an easy one. According to Sumra, getting the clay or chikni mitti is tough. Clay is sourced from the beds of lakes of Sanand and a tractor load of clay for making about 500 pots costs Rs 2,000. Once the pots are made, they need to be coloured with geru (earthen ochre ), which is ordered from Thaan, a village about 120 km from Sarkhej Roza.

Rehman's brother-in-law, 20-year-old Imran Haji Sumra, lives in an adjacent shanty with his family and transports the pots to cities such as Surat and Valsad in South Gujarat. Within a few years of starting work, he has been able to buy a mini truck that can transport 700 pots. On delivering pots in Surat, 350 km from Ahmedabad, Imran earns Rs 7,000.

Making ends meet until there is enough demand for pots is tricky for the potters. Sometimes the pots don't sell as expected. Then the Sumras leave the pots in their karkhanas and return to their village; they come back next year and sell the same during Diwali.

Family effort

Contrary to the stereotyping associated with the community, men and women work shoulder-to-shoulder. While Rehman does arduous physical tasks, Mariam too handles those that are equally backbreaking. Lifting heavy pots, bags of clay and creating artistic pots are gender-neutral activities for the community.

Shahida, one of Noori's daughters, comes to Sarkhej Roza every year to help her mother in the family business and then returns to her marital family in Mandali village in Mehsana district. ""I help my mother in colouring and baking the pots,"" said Shahida even as she continued cooking the family's meal.

Noori's parents-in-law Ibrahim Sumra and Ruksana rest on the makeshift bed as Noori ducks below the low ceiling fan to sit next to them. ""It is important to keep the fan low so the pots can dry quickly,"" she explains.

This year Noori, Imran's mother, has brought three goats to ensure milk for her grandchildren. ""Lekin, inko rakhna bhi toh mehenga padta hai (But rearing goats too is a costly affair),"" she says. Every day she spends Rs 100 on fodder for the goats.

All the members of the potter family pitch in to make a collective earning. If the man of the house is busy with the pottery business, the woman sets up shop selling everyday items in her makaan. Mariam runs a makeshift store selling grocery to the other potters. The children take care of the goats.

A secular network

While the potters are all Muslims, they deal primarily with Hindu wholesale dealers who buy the pots in bulk. Ahmedabad's Vejalpur-based Girish Prajapati, a regular wholesale dealer says he feels at home when he comes to Sarkhej Roza to buy pots. ""I am a Prajapati, a Hindu potter and I always buy my wares from a Sumra, a Muslim potter. We have been doing business for many years now, without a single problem,"" he says.

Por no hablar de la precisión en los niveles en donde lo mismo nos lleva a complejos conflictos políticos y religiosos de su región natal que a sumergirnos, en el caso de Chef, en olores, sabores, colores y texturas que tocan algo más que la vena literaria: las papilas gustativas.

Ahora bien, así enunciado parece cosa nimia, pero mucho de lo expresado pasa por una grueso tamiz algo ingrato: en occidente solemos entender la mayoría de las ocasiones cosas totalmente distintas al respecto.

¡Quién mejor que su traductora al español mexicano, Edith Verónica Luna, para ayudarnos a digerir su más reciente narración!

¿De qué va la obra de Singh? ¿De Chef, específicamente?

Tanto Diecisiete tomates y otras historias de Cachemira, el primer libro de Jaspreet Singh, como Chef son libros que relatan el entorno de un país que atraviesa conflictos geopolíticos, describen a individuos que padecen una realidad poscolonial violenta y cruel, sin distinciones de edad o género, en historias y capítulos cuyas redes isotópicas son la guerra, la partición de la India y la comida.

Chef cuenta la historia de Kirpal, un militar retirado quien se acaba de enterar que tiene un tumor cerebral. La noticia de su enfermedad llega al mismo tiempo que una carta de su antiguo superior, el general Kumar, pidiéndole que le ayude a preparar el banquete de bodas de su hija, quien se casará nada menos que con el enemigo, un pakistaní. Así, Kirpal decide regresar a Cachemira, la ciudad de la que se despidió dejando todo atrás, para reconciliarse con su pasado y, quizá, para encontrar una cura... o al menos esa es su intención.

¿Qué implicó traducir Chef?

Al comenzar a traducir Chef me estremecí ante una realidad que se me presentaba demasiado lejana, una narrativa que mezclaba el hindi con el inglés, a los saris con las kurtas, y el arroz con el azafrán. La primera lectura me dejó los ojos invadidos de tonos rojizos, ocres, los resabios del penetrante aroma a té y una sensación de calidez que provenía del lenguaje sutil y respetuoso muy común de la India.

La segunda me dejó ver las dificultades al tratar de explicar el significado de las palabras en hindi manteniendo la alternancia de lenguas sin recurrir a notas al pie, aquellas de describir platillos con ingredientes que no existen en nuestro continente y, por ende, las de hacer ""comprensibles"" esas comidas en nuestra cultura. Por otro lado, también la gravedad de tomar la decisión de no llevar turbante, pues este es obligatorio una vez que un niño entra a la pubertad en aquellas lejanas tierras.

La narrativa de Singh nos lleva en espiral, por tiempos y lugares que nos dan la impresión de regresar a un punto ya conocido y, aun así, diferente. A lo largo de los 28 capítulos de Chef, nos encontramos a menudo con la sensación de vivir en un continuo déjà vu, una particularidad debida quizá a la enfermedad que aqueja al personaje y que, evidentemente, debía reflejarse en su traducción literaria.

El autor es preciso al elegir sus palabras; está de más afirmar que Singh como literato jamás abandona su faceta de hombre de ciencia y de aficionado a la música: describe recetas con todo rigor, plantea problemas matemáticos y hasta transcribe el tarareo de la novena sinfonía como si la estuviese cantando al oído del lector. Pero también es poeta, y sus poemas tienen una música que, a primera vista, parece disonante pero que en realidad termina siendo atrayente, alejada del exotismo vulgar.

¿Cómo trasladar esa compleja y culinariamente variada India a este complejo y culinariamente variado México?

Chef es un libro que huele a comida, a té, a mujeres, a hielo, a pólvora, a sangre y a fuego. Cada hebra ha sido hilvanada con sumo cuidado, de modo que nuestro tránsito por los paisajes indios, cachemires, semeja un suave paneo cinematográfico que nos muestra el entorno, mientras una voz lo va narrando todo con lujo de detalle.

¿Qué hacer? ¿Cómo mantener el tono, los giros, la fuerza de las imágenes? Es ahí donde uno tiene que leer forzosamente como un traductor literario, no para saber de qué va la historia, esa lectura ya se habrá hecho, sino para deshacer el hilado y comenzar a tejer de nuevo con la misma madeja pero realizando distinta puntada.

Leer con humildad, con duda, inquisitivamente, para saber qué decisión tomar. El traductor literario, posteriormente, se lee a sí mismo, se critica y se cuestiona, hace siempre ese ejercicio que alguna vez Miguel Sáenz llamó de ""teoría contra intuición""; traducir es leer a conciencia, es obligarse a justificar cada decisión tomada, a hacer a un lado la expresión ""porque suena bien"", para que prime el ""porque es la mejor opción"".

No obstante, ya que mencionaste la importante etapa de la lectura traductora, ¿quién califica al final el trabajo del traductor literario?

Cuando la traducción es mala, de ello se encarga el crítico literario, tenga o no las herramientas para hacerlo. Casi siempre es lo segundo. Pero cuando la traducción es buena, no hace ruido, nadie la menciona en las reseñas y, por supuesto, nadie menciona nunca tampoco al traductor literario, a quien, dadas esta y otras muchas adversidades, en el contexto mexicano, le basta con el gesto de satisfacción de un lector que ha llegado hasta el punto final de su obra traducida.

Partying should be a by-product of your travel, not the reason.","Not long ago I looked at my newsfeed and noticed it was filled with young people partying at far-flung locations around the globe. Topless blokes covered in body paint danced with girls in bikinis grasping buckets of cheap cocktails.

Looking at the pictures, as jealous as I was not to be partying on a tropical beach somewhere, it occurred to me that although there is nothing wrong with this kind of travel, it isn't the type of traveller that I am -- and I have no problem with that.

I know the exact moment I came to this conclusion. I was on a boat travelling from the island of Ko Tao to Ko Samui, Thailand. I had decided to relax there for a few days before heading over to the party island of Ko Pha Ngan for one of the famous Full Moon parties that draw thousands of young party travellers each year.

The visit to Ko Tao was only supposed to take a few days -- we stayed for a week.

It's a hard lifestyle to want to leave; beachside breakfasts, fresh seafood dinners and cocktails on the beach in a picturesque setting. So we decided to give the Full Moon Party a miss. Whether that was a decision we would live to regret is hard to say. Regardless, I do not regret my time on Ko Tao.

To miss a day sightseeing or an adventure because I was laid up in bed, hungover is an incredibly deflating feeling.

When it came time for us to leave, we had to catch a ferry back to Ko Samui. On the way we pulled into the dock at Ko Pha Ngan to pick up more passengers. It resembled something more like a scene from a disaster movie than a ferry terminal.

Bodies were strewn around like wounded soldiers, some with face paint still behind their ears from the night before. The ones still standing looked defeated. It was as though they were all caught in a fog of both regret and elation and weren't sure which emotion was more dominant. The kind of feeling you get after a night on the booze where you hope you had a good time but weren't confident that was what actually took place.

A young girl was loaded onto the ferry looking more worse for wear than the others, an impressive feat in itself considering how everyone else looked like extras from an episode of 'The Walking Dead'. A saline drip was attached to her arm as two Thai locals helped her to her seat.

This was the exact moment when I thought, how much is too much?

I can imagine the conversation she would have with friends when she got back home...

""How was the Full Moon Party?""

""Oh good. You know. Face paint, buckets of alcohol, I needed a drip the next day. I really gave it 110 percent.""

Maybe it's a badge of honour these days, but generally speaking, any kind of medical treatment to help recover from over indulgence is usually seen as something a person attempts to avoid when having a good time.

Or maybe, I'm just old.

Don't get me wrong, I love a good time. I suffer more prominently from a fear of missing out. When overseas, you have a limited amount of time to spend visiting places you might not get a chance to ever see again. That should resonate heavily with most people. That's not to say I don't enjoy these types of experiences -- I think everyone should try them -- I just don't base my travel around them.

There are roughly two types of travellers, those who like to party and those who do not. While this seems like (and is) a gross generalisation, it is not all that far from the truth.

I'm not talking about comparing young people to old people -- age is irrelevant. I've met many older individuals who enjoy a drink while on holiday and I know just as many young people who don't travel just to party.

Some people like to live it up and others like to explore. As easy as it is to say you can do both, I just prefer not to feel queasy whilst doing the latter as a result of the former. To miss a day sightseeing or an adventure because I was laid up in bed, hungover is an incredibly deflating feeling.

I'm not saying you shouldn't live it up overseas nor am I begrudging people who do so. I get it. I'm just wary that there is too much on offer around the world to place too much emphasis on how much you can drink as opposed to how much you can see.

But the Aarushi case showed what damage it can wreak as well when it operates with no scruples other than TRP.
The Aarushi case should become a textbook example of how not to report on a murder.","ADVERTISEMENT

The Aarushi verdict has been overturned. For now. Nupur and Rajesh Talwar have been freed. The court has ruled there is insufficient evidence to prove them guilty and they must get the benefit of the doubt.

All over social media the commentariat have taken sides. Some feel that the original guilty verdict on the parents was a gross miscarriage of justice in the first place. Some believe that this overturned verdict was the real miscarriage of justice, the law moved to act by the outraged of media, books and films that had taken up the case with crusading zeal.

All it means, however, is that in the eyes of the law we do not know who killed Aarushi Talwar. But one thing all of us do know. And all of us should agree upon.

It brought out the worst in us as media –- half-baked, trigger-happy and happy to sensationalise.

This is not new. As the recent book In Hot Blood by Bachi J Karkaria on the Nanavati case showed, everyone loves a juicy murder scandal, especially one with sex and adultery. In that case even as the prosecution asked why the fresh-from-his-shower Ahuja's towel did not fall off if there was indeed a scuffle and an accidental firing of the weapon, Bombay hawkers sold Ahuja towels and Nanavati toy pistols – ""Nanavati ka pistol! Bang, bang, bang! Ahuja ka towliya. Marenga toh bhi nahin girenga. (You'll die but it won't fall off).""

When police allowed media to tramp through a crime scene, up those famous 17 steps to the terrace and destroy evidence, just for two minutes of fame on the evening news, it did the cause of justice no good. The investigation was botched.

Russi Karanjia's Blitz whipped up public interest to hysteria. rode that trial and tried unapologetically to direct its outcome. Karkaria writes that Karanjia co-opted even his cinema critic, his astrologer and his Letters to the Editor to column to fit his agenda, printing letters comparing Nanavati to Lord Ramachandra who killed Ravana for abducting his wife. He was determined to win the ""battle for men's minds and women's hearts"". It was probably that media blitz that helped Nanavati be pardoned even after being convicted.

Yet Karkaria writes that while Nanavati was a big media trial, it was still not a trial by media which is a different beast altogether. That's what the Aarushi case became, fanned by competing 24x7 television channels jostling for every scurrilous detail. In Nanavati, she says ""there was no savaging of the accused which became the lot of the Noida dentist-couple parents of young Aarushi Talwar.""

That is the ugliness that was laid bare by the Aarushi case.

The Supreme Court warned us about it. In 2010, the court cautioned that irresponsible reporting was affecting the honour of the crime's victim. Advocate Surat Singh filed a PIL in 2008 seeking restraint because of wild allegations levelled by the Noida police. Telecast after telecast cast aspersions on the characters of all the principals from the Talwars to their daughter to Hemraj, the servant who was first suspected of the murder and then found dead the next day. An Inspector General on Police went on television to call father and daughter, people of loose character. With sources in the CBI leaking information constantly and media lapping it up without check or balance, senior advocate Pinaki Mishra said, ""It is virtually a trial by a voyeuristic media presenting an incident in an extremely malicious manner.""

The Hoot reports that the day Rajesh Talwar was arrested, the TRP for that coverage was higher than the IPL match.

Of course the media's job is to cover the story. But when police allowed media to tramp through a crime scene, up those famous 17 steps to the terrace and destroy evidence, just for two minutes of fame on the evening news, it did the cause of justice no good. The investigation was botched. But the media coverage was even more horrendous.

The media as an instrument of outrage can do good as proved by the Jessica Lal case. But the Aarushi case showed what damage it can wreak as well when it operates with no scruples other than TRP.

We saw the media not content with facts of the case. They dug out every semi-scurrilous detail they could find about the alleged lifestyles of the Talwar whether or not that had any bearing on the case. One channel aired an MMS clip of the murdered girl. A 17-year-old friend was named by the police and his mobile number was flashed on TV screens. An ""other woman"" was unveiled on live TV as reporters went hunting for stories of marital infidelity. Domestic staff and friends were trapped with insinuating questions. Recounting all this Vandana K Mittal writes in Merinews ""What if any of the currently accused of marital infidelity and covering up for the main accused turn out to be innocent? Who will patch up the many broken lives that this case is likely to leave in its wake?""

Now we are in fact at that moment. And of course there will be no mea culpa from the media for the devastation they left in their wake. We cannot single out the media. We get the media we deserve. We kept those TRP ratings high because we were hungry for every sordid detail.

The Aarushi case showed us the collision between, as Madhabhushi Sridhar of the NALSAR Center for Media Law & Public Policy (http://www.thehoot.org/media- watch/media-practice/maligned- by-police-and-media-4750) points out, ""the victims' family's rights, journalistic ethics, the police and the media's liability for defamation and the people's right to know.""

The media as an instrument of outrage can do good as proved by the Jessica Lal case. But the Aarushi case showed what damage it can wreak as well when it operates with no scruples other than TRP. One could hope that in retrospect it would serve as a cautionary tale for all of us. But it's a slim hope.

As the Indrani Mukherjea -Sheena Bora or the Sunanda Pushkar case showed as soon as we smell TRP gold investigation becomes all about digging up dirt, the more lurid, the more personal the better. Just as in Aarushi media was happy to be rely on anonymous sources and believe what they heard and rush to print it before someone else beat them to it. We focused not on the crime but on the sordid dark lives of the players as television channels lined up bit players who could come on TV to call Indrani Lady Macbeth or describe how Peter Mukherjea dumped his girlfriend for Indrani. Even sometime actor Rahul Roy showed up on TV as a ""celebrity of 25 years"". This was punishment often for being perceived as rich and entitled, comeuppance by media.

The Aarushi case should become a textbook example of how not to report on a murder. Instead the fear is it's become the prototype.",How Not To Report A Murder: The Aarushi Talwar Case Is A Textbook Example,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/13/how-not-to-report-a-murder-the-aarushi-talwar-case-is-a-textbook-example_a_23242412/

Zwei Männer boten einer Gruppe Jugendlicher eine angebliche Zigarette an

Nach nur einem Zug davon sollen zwei 18-Jährige zusammengebrochen sein

Jetzt ermittelt die Berliner Polizei

Die Nacht zum Freitag nahm für zwei Jugendliche in Berlin ein unschönes Ende: Nach dem Zug an einer angeblichen Zigarette sind die beiden 18-Jährigen auf offener Straße zusammengebrochen. Die Zigarette - möglicherweise ein Joint - sei ihnen am S-Bahnhof Warschauer Straße von zwei Männern angeboten worden, teilte die Polizei am Freitag mit.

Nach den bisherigen Ermittlungen und Aussagen von Zeugen boten die beiden Männer einer Gruppe von vier 18-Jährigen die verhängnisvolle Zigarette zum Mitrauchen an.

Zwei Jugendliche aus der Gruppe sollen daraufhin einen Zug genommen haben. Nur Sekunden später brachen sie dann zusammen und wurden bewusstlos.

Die Rettungskräfte mussten einen Jugendlichen beatmen

Die Begleiter alarmierten Rettungskräfte, die einen der Bewusstlosen beatmen mussten. Beide wurden zur stationären Behandlung in ein Krankenhaus gebracht.

Die beiden Männer konnten nach dem Vorfall zunächst fliehen. Ein Verdächtiger wurde festgenommen, wenig später aber wieder entlassen. Gegen den 25-Jährigen wird jetzt wegen gefährlicher Körperverletzung und Verstoßes gegen das Betäubungsmittelgesetz ermittelt. Welche Substanzen die Zigarette enthielt, konnte die Polizei zunächst nicht sagen.

Die Untersuchungen von Blut- und Urinproben der Opfer werden wahrscheinlich noch längere Zeit andauern.

영화 업계에선 하비 웨인스타인의 성추행에 대해 몰랐다는 사람들이 많다. 제인 폰다는 1년 전 그의 행동에 대한 이야기를 들었다고 인정했다고 헐리우드 리포터가 보도했다.

11월 6일의 CNN 인터뷰에서 제인 폰다는 크리스티안 아만푸르와 이야기하며 보다 일찍 그를 규탄하지 않은 것을 후회한다고 말했다.

“나는 1년 쯤 전에 하비에 대해 알게 되었다. 당시 아무 발언도 하지 않은 것이 부끄럽다.”

폰다는 로잔나 아퀘트를 통해 웨인스타인의 행동을 처음 알게 되었다고 한다. 아퀘트는 뉴욕 타임스 기자에게 웨인스타인이 가한 성폭력 사건을 자세히 말한 바 있다. 아퀘트에 따르면 웨인스타인은 1990년대에 영화 배역을 제안한다는 핑계로 아퀘트를 호텔 방에 불러 가랑이에 손을 밀어넣었다고 한다.

추가: @Janefonda 는 발언한 사람들이 ‘정말 자랑스럽다’고 한다. “이게 특이하고 끔찍한 일이라고 생각하지 말자- 이건 늘 일어나는 일이다.”

왜 침묵을 지켰는지 묻자 폰다는 “나는 그렇게 대담하지 못했다. 내게 일어난 일이 아니라서 내가 할 말이 아니라고 생각했던 것 같다.”고 답했다.

79세의 폰다는 웨인스타인을 단 한 번 만났다고 한다. 개인적으로는 그와 함께 있을 때 불편하지 않았다고 한다.

“나는 나이가 많이 들고 나서야 하비를 만났다. 하비는 더 취약한 어린 여성을 노린다.”

폰다는 과거에 침묵을 지켰으나, 성추행과 폭력 혐의가 드디어 주목 받게 된 것이 ‘기쁘다’고 한다.

“나는 발언하고 있는 동료 배우들이 정말 자랑스럽다. 오랜 시간이 걸린 일임을 알고 있다. 아주, 아주, 아주 힘든 일이다. 피해자가 된 사람으로서 얻을 수 있는 건 없지만, 이게 드러났다는 게 중요한 일이다.”

헐리우드에서는 권력 남용이 비일비재하지만, 폰다는 유명하든 아니든 온갖 업계에서 여성들에게 이런 일들이 일어남을 지적했다.

“이게 특이하고 끔찍한 일이라고 생각하지 말자.. 이런 일은 언제나 일어난다. 헐리우드를 비롯한 모든 곳에서 남성들은 이래도 된다고 생각한다. 전세계 모든 사무실과 업계에서, 바에서, 레스토랑에서, 가게에서. 여성들은 공격 받고, 학대 당하고, 희롱당한다.”

""She will be missed and will always be loved by her family.""

Results are expected today from forensic testing on ""biological matter"" found near clothing and a walking stick after Ms Cameron, a dementia sufferer, went missing from her nursing home.

She was last seen near the OzCare Aged Care facility at Craiglie, Port Douglas, on Tuesday afternoon.

Police fear Ms Cameron, who had only been at the facility for a few weeks, may have been taken by a crocodile after becoming disoriented when she wandered into a dense area of bushland.

A Department of Environment and Heritage Protection spokesman says traps will be set in an attempt to catch the crocodile as police and wildlife officers continue to look for the woman's body.

Clothes and a walking stick with Ms Cameron's name on it were discovered on Thursday at the end of Four Mile Beach.

""We have also located some biological matter which we believe to be human remains and these are being tested in Cairns,"" Acting Inspector Ed Lukin said on Thursday.

""We continue to search the area in the hope of finding her alive (but) because of the proximity of these items near the creek bank, we cannot rule out the possibility of a crocodile attack.

""Je ne crois pas à la répartition forcée et administrative"" des médecins, a-t-il insisté en appelant chacun à la responsabilité et en promettant de faire ""sauter les verrous"" qui freinent l'installation de médecins généralistes.

Edouard Philippe se dit opposé à l'obligation d'installer des médecins dans les déserts médicaux pic.twitter.com/3MI3Vb8mzQ — BFMTV (@BFMTV) 13 octobre 2017

En lieu et place de mesures contraignantes, le gouvernement propose ""un panel de solutions adaptables à chaque territoire"", des ""mesures de simplification législatives ou réglementaires"" pour ""soutenir les organisations innovantes"", qui bénéficieront d'un fonds dédié.

Comme attendu, le plan acte l'objectif de doubler le nombre de maisons de santé (910 recensées en mars 2017) sur le quinquennat en leur consacrant 400 millions d'euros. En outre, le cumul emploi-retraite des médecins libéraux sera facilité grâce à un avantage élargi en matière de cotisation dans les zones en tension. ""L'accès aux soins est au coeur du pacte social"", a déclaré le premier ministre, venu inaugurer une maison de santé dans une région confrontée comme tant d'autres au manque de médecins.

Accroître le rôle des infirmiers

Il faut reconnaître ""le rôle essentiel des infirmiers"", a par ailleurs insisté le premier ministre. Ce rôle ""croit et peut encore croître en matière de prévention"" et de prescription, a souligné dans un communiqué l'Ordre de la profession.

Le dispositif expérimental Asalee, qui permet à des infirmiers libéraux de suivre, en partenariat avec des généralistes, des malades chroniques, sera pérennisé. ""De nouvelles formations seront proposées dès la rentrée 2018"" pour permettre aux soignants d'acquérir de nouvelles compétences ""ensuite reconnues par des rémunérations spécifiques"".

Un peu plus de 8% de la population vit dans l'une des 9.000 communes sous-denses en médecins généralistes, soit environ 5,3 millions d'habitants, rappelle le gouvernement. Si rien n'est fait, cette proportion continuera à grimper sous l'effet de la baisse du nombre de généralistes, de nombreux départs à la retraite et des nouvelles aspirations des jeunes médecins, à la recherche d'une vie plus équilibrée.

Simplification administrative et télémédecine

Les médecins libéraux seront incités à exercer à temps partiel dans des zones sous-dotées grâce à une revalorisation de leurs primes, et les ""consultations avancées"" (par exemple un cardiologue hospitalier recevant des patients une fois par semaine dans une maison de santé) encouragées.

Le gouvernement mise sur la ""confiance"" aux professionnels de santé et aux initiatives locales et sur la ""simplification administrative"".

""Nouvelles façons d'exercer entre la ville et l'hôpital"", ""télémédecine"", ""pratiques avancées"" (permettant par exemple aux infirmiers de pratiquer des actes habituellement réservés aux médecins, ndlr) sont autant de pistes à suivre pour Edouard Philippe.

Il s'agit de ""garantir un égal accès aux soins"" partout en France, selon Agnès Buzyn, citée dans le dossier de presse. Mais il ""serait illusoire d'annoncer des mesures définitives, ou de concentrer nos efforts sur le seul sujet de l'installation des professionnels de santé"", dit-elle. Autrement dit: ces mesures incitatives devront à nouveau être évaluées et potentiellement réajustées.

Un peu comme de savoir s'il doit porter chance ou malheur...

Ce qui est sûr, c'est qu'il ne laisse pas indifférent. La Française des jeux l'a bien compris. Elle est devenue coutumière des loteries exceptionnelles du vendredi 13, où le porte-malheur peut sourire aux chanceux.

Vous ne savez plus quoi croire? Reprenons depuis le début. Dans la chrétienté, le 13 a mauvaise réputation depuis que Judas l'a trahi (en même temps que le Christ). En se joignant aux 11 apôtres attablés, celui qui devait dénoncer Jésus aux Romains porta un coup durable à la réputation du 13e invité. De nos jours encore, une tablée de 13 personnes n'inspire pas confiance...

Treize à table, une recette à éviter

Mais attention, la paraskevidékatriaphobie (du grec paraskeví pour vendredi et dekatreís pour 13) dépasse le cadre de la chrétienté. Dans la mythologie nordique, le dieu des guerriers Odin organise un dîner qui tourne mal lorsque Loki rejoint les douze convives. Bilan: un mort.

Plus largement, on peut aussi voir dans l'aversion au 13 un héritage de nombreuses civilisations anciennes. Au Moyen-Orient, en Egypte, ou en Roumanie, on comptait plus volontiers jusqu'à 12 sur les phalanges, que jusqu'à 10 sur ses doigts.

En effet, mesurer des quantités de douze en douze est plus simple qu'en dizaines, les divisions tombent juste plus souvent (avec les multiples de 2, 3, 4, 6). On en retrouve encore la trace: 12 pouces dans un pied en Angleterre, 12 deniers dans un sou dans la France d'antan, 12 douzaines dans une grosse d'huîtres, etc. Sans calculatrice, on comprend mieux que la préparation d'un repas pour treize puisse mettre de mauvaise humeur...

Quant au vendredi, ce serait encore un héritage chrétien. Selon la tradition catholique, Jésus aurait été mis en croix ce funeste jour.

En Angleterre, les assureurs enregistrent moins d'accidents

Au-delà de ces spéculations historiques, rien ne permet de prouver qu'un vendredi 13 soit un jour de déveine plus qu'un autre. Ils ne sont ni plus rares, ni plus fréquents, avec 688 occurrences au cours des 400 dernières années, pile dans la moyenne.

Et si les exemples de faits divers, ou de coup de malchance émaillant cette date ne manquent pas, là encore, on ne peut rien en déduire. En 2014, la défaite historique de la Roja en Coupe du monde est tombée ce jour... pour le plus grand bonheur de la sélection batave.

Malgré tout, les comportements s'en trouvent bel et bien modifiés, jusque pour les esprits les plus rationnels. D'après la University of Chicago Booth School of Business, superstition et rationalité peuvent très bien cohabiter. Dans une étude publiée récemment, elle montre que des fans de sports peuvent continuer à porter le maillot de leur équipe préférée, tout en sachant parfaitement que cela n'a aucune influence.

""Même quand les conditions sont parfaites pour détecter une erreur - quand les personnes ont la capacité et la motivation pour être rationnel et que le contexte met en relief leur erreur - l'intuition magique peut persister"", explique le professeur Jane Risen.

C'est donc une bonne nouvelle pour la Française des jeux, qui verra affluer ceux qui veulent tenter le sort. Mais aussi pour les assureurs. D'après The Telegraph, les assureurs enregistrent moins d'accidents domestiques et sur la route les vendredis 13.

The Allahabad High Court has acquitted the parents of Aarushi Talwar, who was found murdered nine years back in Noida, setting aside the CBI court's earlier order, in connection with the double murder case, which shook the nation in 2008. ""The chain of evidence is not sufficient. The golden rule and cardinal principle in justice is if there is only circumstantial evidence, benefit of doubt goes to the accused,"" a bench of Justices B K Narayana and A K Mishra said while pronouncing the 'not guilty' verdict in a packed courtroom.

India is one of the few countries worldwide where child marriage continues to be widely accepted--legally and socially. In a blog, Bhagyashri Dengle, Executive Director of Plan India says that the latest Census report on the decadal headcount in 2011 reveals that child marriage is rampant, with almost one in every three married women being below 18 years. She points out that child marriages continue in India because of 'social acceptance' and 'legal loopholes'.

Anupam Kher's newest appointment has led to an outpouring of praise from most quarters, except for the one that should matter to him the most – the students of Pune's Film and Television Institute of India. Aside from his right-leaning politics, there is a much bigger concern with Kher's appointment, which his troopers seemed to have conveniently overlooked. He is the founder of a private acting school in Mumbai, which presents a conflict of interest for his new role at FTII — as though being married to a politician, who is a member of the ruling government, and being appointed to run a government-backed institution wasn't problematic enough already.

On Thursday, the Election Commission announced the schedule for the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections. However, it didn't announce the dates for Gujarat, prompting the Congress to allege pressure by the Centre to get more time for announcing sops for the Prime Minister's home state. ""The reason is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to Gujarat on October 16 as a false Santa Claus to announce sops and jumlas that he didn't implement for the last 22 years. The onus lies on the EC to ensure a level playing field,"" Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala alleged.

Journalist Rohini Singh, who investigated into the alleged irregularities in business enterprises run by Jay Amitbhai Shah, BJP President Amit Shah's son, for The Wire, has stood up for herself after being slapped with a defamation case. In a Facebook post, she made her stance clear, explaining that her job as a journalist is to speak to truth to power and she wouldn't desist from it.

According to reports, Jay Shah has sued the independent news portal for Rs 100 crores, after the latter ran a story outlining alleged financial irregularities involved in his business transactions.

Based on filings available with the Registrar of Companies, Singh reported that Temple Enterprise Private Ltd, a company of which Jay is director, increased its turnover by a staggering 16,000 times since the BJP-led government at the Centre came to power under the prime ministership of Narendra Modi. Jay's father is a close associate of the PM and a leading light of the BJP.

From Rs 15,000 in 2014-15 to Rs 80.5 crore in 2015-16, the rise in revenue for Temple Enterprise has been wondrous, bolstered by an unsecured loan of Rs 15.78 crore from Rajesh Khandwala, a relative of Rajya Sabha member Parimal Nathwani, who is also a senior executive at Reliance Industries.

The Wire's findings have led to speculations whether such deals were struck between the various parties with the collusion of politicians, business leaders and elected lawmakers.

However, Jay said the report had made ""false, derogatory and defamatory imputation against me by creating in the mind of right-thinking people an impression that my business owes its 'success' to my father's political position.""

According to The Indian Express, he claimed his businesses are ""fully legitimate and conducted in a lawful manner on commercial lines"" reflected in his tax records and through banking transactions.

""I have repaid the loans by cheque on commercial rate of interest and within the time stipulated. I have mortgaged my family property with the cooperative bank to get the credit facilities,"" he said to quash all the allegations raised against his dealings by Singh.

Even before the publication of the article in The Wire, Jay's lawyer had already warned Singh, or any other media organisation, to not broadcast any potentially defamatory comments about his client.

""If you or anyone in the print, electronic or digital media carries and/or broadcasts any defamatory and/or false imputations including those which breach his fundamental right of privacy and/or defame him, Mr. Jay Shah reserves the right to prosecute and sue such person/entity including anyone who carries or broadcasts a repetition of such libelous/defamatory statement,"" the lawyer's response read.

Singh, who was previously employed with The Economic Times, is a well-known business journalist. Along with Sruthijith KK*, she exposed Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra's involvement with DLF's real estate business in an ET investigation in 2011.

Following the publication of her story on Jay, members of political parties from across the spectrum have reacted to it with expected pique.

""Today, we want to ask our Prime Minister, what do you have to say about crony capitalism now? Will you direct the CBI to probe? Will you direct the ED to probe? Will you ask them to arrest them? Because in the case of opposition, the ED immediately sends notice and shows speed in arresting them... But if somebody's name is Jay, Amit and Shah, who can arrest them? I can confidently tell you that the Prime Minister will remain silent,"" said Kapil Sibal of the Congress.

CPI(M)'s Sitaram Yechury and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) both added their voices to the clamour. AAP said it as a ""classic case of money laundering"", while Yechury asserted that ""very clearly, the son (of Amit Shah) has misused this government in order to accumulate riches in a very clandestine fashion...""

Railway minister Piyush Goyal and member of BJP strongly defended Jay, saying there was no irregularity in his operations and Singh's article is without completely substance. The army of supporters of the right-wing party on social media also chimed in with their support.

In the meantime, top government lawyer Tushar Mehta told NDTV that he may take up Jay's case against The Wire.

By ditching the idea that having pot loads of cash and working alone is the only route to owning a self-built property, Kevin argues that many of us could create our own sustainable and well-designed homes.

One way of doing so is through community build projects, which see families and individuals pooling their resources to construct not just houses, but shared living spaces and childcare options.

Doug Peters/EMPICS Entertainment Kevin McCloud

Addressing the first time he encountered this model, when the Hedgehog co-op group featured on ‘Grand Designs’, Kevin told HuffPost UK: “It was a really interesting exercise in social sustainability, I suppose you could call it.

“People building connections to places and finding security and being able to give back to society as a result of not being too stressed by the financial circumstances they’ve found themselves in.

“I thought, in 1999, we’re going to have loads of these, we’ll be able to do a series of community self-builds but we only found one more, and that was it.

“I’d love society to be doing more of it because it just creates a fantastic community, it’s good for sustainability, it’s good for architecture, it’s good all round, it’s how we used to build.”

Another option is custom-builds, where individuals work with developers, utilising their expert advice to design and construct their homes, with the focus often being on the community surrounding each home as well as the structure itself - something Kevin thinks is crucial.

“I’m quite interested in exploring new models and ways of owning and renting or living which allows you to be part of a community and doesn’t stigmatise you,” he explains.

“Where you can feel fully integrated and because of your connection to the place - knowing that you’re going to be there for a long while - allows you to put roots down and join the residents’ association or get an allotment, whatever it is that it takes to make a connection to the place.”

One example Kevin offers is the ongoing Graven Hill development in Bicester, where £149,000 buys you a ‘Golden Brick’ plot with enough space for a three-bedroom house, garden and two car-parking spaces, along with the foundations for it.

The property which is then constructed needs to meet with a series of not-too-extensive guidelines, covering issues such as how energy is supplied to the home and which areas of the plot can be built on.

Through collaboration with local authorities, these two methods can be combined to create social-housing.

This model that is already working in a number of European cities including Berlin, where “baugruppen” groups using the community-focussed approach are responsible for one in 10 new houses.

“It’s where people come together and sometimes it’s with a social housing provider or a group of people who have sold their houses and they have cash,” he explains. “But either way they are people coming together and they work with facilitators and people in the housing department and council to build a scheme.”

As well as significantly reducing the number of identikit properties and blocks of flats being constructed across the UK, Kevin confidently argues that through using these methods “we could be actually delivering against the government’s objective of 200,000 new homes a year minimum quite significantly”.

“We need to be building more good quality, beautifully designed social housing,” he stresses. “Whether it’s through housing associations or not, central government needs to start budgeting for high-quality social housing [and] social rental, and not doing what they’re doing and promoting the Right To Buy.

“I think every generation is judged on the quality of education, healthcare and the housing it provides for people. So we need to up our game very significantly.”",Kevin McCloud Wants Us All To Build Our Own Homes And Has Worked Out How We Can Do It,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/kevin-mccloud-houses-building-self_n_18254374.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Indeed, when the mind is at peace with itself, our entire being is at peace with our external environment.","ADVERTISEMENT

Till recently, modern science refused to acknowledge the connection between the mind and body. While physical ailments were seen as causing stress and anxiety, Western doctors considered a direct correlation between the mind and the body as being implausible for want of compelling evidence.

This has since undergone a change, thanks to the significant body of scientific research that demonstrated how emotions, or the state of one's mind, can impact physical health. It is now acknowledged that emotionally stressed persons, for instance, are more vulnerable to a major physical ailment. It is argued, in other words, that if the mind is not at ease, it could invite disease.

Traditional Eastern philosophy, on the other hand, has always seen a strong mind-body connection and stressed on the healing power of the mind. In their view, a physically healthy person need not, necessarily, be emotionally balanced, whereas, a mind at peace with itself can lead to a healthy body and a better quality of life.

The externally imposed demands of contemporary living that all of us have internalised make it truly difficult to cultivate a mind that is at peace with itself. We live in a highly competitive world and are constantly being called upon to prove ourselves, to be better than the others, to make more money, buy bigger houses and cars. This is the criteria of success.

While no one does anything in order to fail, very few actually succeed in achieving externally imposed yardsticks. Consequently, our everyday biography is filled with stress, anxiety, and urgency. We are in a constant state of either rage or frustration, envy and depression. It's almost as if this were the age of despair, despondency and dissatisfaction.

Scientific evidence has established that modern society suffers from a sharp increase in hypertension, depression, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, with an increased risk of hospitalisation, even death because we suffer from 'lifestyle diseases'. More importantly, this is not an ailment that is restricted to the developed world but has increasingly found its way across the globe, even in poor and emerging economies.

A mind is at peace only when we are able to disengage while being part of the here-and-now.

There is a qualitative difference in the approach of Western and Eastern philosophical traditions that is worth recalling. In Western thought, for instance, an individual who is disengaged from his environment is seen as suffering from alienation, thus likely to suffer from morbid thoughts, and possibly suicidal, or homicidal tendencies. The suggested remedy is to integrate the individual with the external space they inhabit.

In Eastern thought, disconnect or distancing is not perceived in a negative manner. Indeed, a mind is at peace only when we are able to disengage while being part of the here-and-now. This is dispassion or the ability to stand apart rather than be consumed by one's surroundings or one's state of being. The 'Eternal Now', as Hindu philosophy sees it, is when time loses its temporal quality and is perceived only as part of a continuum. Only then would opposites be seen in context. Such as, black and white, day and night, happiness and sorrow, life and death. You need one to understand the other. What follows is equanimity or being at peace with one's mind.

Eastern philosophy also advises us to tame the mind, as the mind is known to plays tricks. Mindfulness is thus, the ability to be conscious of Maya or illusion and not to mistake it for reality. Only then would the individual cultivate a mind that is at peace with itself.

Mental peace is critical to living a life of quality and value. At the same time, the sole objective behind mindfulness is to recognise the importance of experiencing with the whole body and mind rather than to see and to feel with either the body or the mind and never with both together. It is this 'wholeness' that we will experience when we, to borrow a quote from the Dalai Lama, 'awaken the mind'.

When the mind is awakened, it shifts how we see ourselves. It determines our behavior, attitude and response to people and situations. Stephen Covey puts it wonderfully: 'The way we see a problem 'is' often the problem.' Indeed, when the mind is at peace with itself, our entire being is at peace with our external environment. It is helpful to recognise this, especially in today's day and age.

It Could Be Longer Than You Think The FTPA (as anyone who has got this far probably knows) means Parliament will sit for a fixed 5-year term rather than the Prime Minister of the day calling a General Election when it suits them (yes, yes, I know). But it does limit the life of a Parliament to five years. Except that under the Withdrawal Bill, a minister could argue that the Brexit process is still incomplete... Officially Endorsed by the President of the United States... I wish that were a good thing

Lord Neuberger's Salutary Warning Many recent bad court decisions cry out for revocation, but I wonder whether the current British government is even aware of the existence of this nuclear option, let alone courageous enough to use it.

Scrapping Tuition Fees Is Regressive, We Need Reform And To Bring Back Grants The current system needs change: bring back grants, keep interest rates to inflation and explore more ways to reform the progressive system we have now. If income tax needs to be raised to fund the grants, go ahead, but abolishing tuition fees is taking two steps back after moving an inch forward.

Want To Help Those Struggling To Find Secure Work, Prime Minister? Back My Bill It's going to be tough work, but I'm excited and driven by the opportunity to make things a bit better for people. I hope you will get behind me and lobby your own MP to back my Bill. If you want to share your experiences of unpaid trial shifts, or just give me your views on the Bill then visit my website - www.stewartmcdonald.scot - and respond to my online consultation today.

We Must All Echo Theresa May's Sense Of Duty And Public Service To Get Brexit Right I'm glad the Prime Minister decided to tackle what's been going on behind her back. Not for her sake, but for everyone else's. It's safe to say that Theresa May will not be remembered as a brilliant politician, but what she has going for her is a great sense of duty and public service. And don't knock it as some consolation prize. Right now, it's what the country needs. Conservative peer and former Leader of the House of Lords

This Is Not The Political Silly Season So far from the Summer being the political 'silly season' it will be critical to pay attention to what happens this year.

Why Can't May Cosy Up To Trump Like Macron Did? What I find fascinating is the difference in tone many of these publications took when covering Theresa May's visit to Washington in January. Then, a leader of a large European country with a surprisingly fragile economy cosying up to Trump was seen as desperate. Now, it's being portrayed as a bromance. Why?

Politicians Can't Agree On Brexit - Give The People A Say The rallying cry of 'take back control,' which inspired so many voters, will not be realised within the constraints of our Parliamentary democracy. More ambition is required. In the 18th century, Britain's Parliament redefined modern democracy; in the 21st, it can do so again. Rob J Adam is an independent journalist and researcher.

Charities Should Seize The Opportunity Offered By The Parliamentary Arithmetic Let's hope that charities and others will act and not stand aside. I have confidence that there is an opportunity for social action at a local and national level on an unprecedented scale with the result that there will be change - and that this change will be for the better.

Government Needs To Listen To Business On Brexit As Downing Street discovered the hard way, a shielded and closed door approach will not work on an issue that affects so many in many different ways. An inclusive approach is what is needed to create a cohesive Brexit plan that gets the support of business and society alike. Now is the time for government to listen. Head, ACCA UK

Con ello evitarás adquirir deudas innecesarias y de las que podrías arrepentirte.","Hace un par de años, justamente antes del Buen Fin, mi computadora se descompuso y repararla costaba casi lo mismo que comprar una nueva, por lo que comparé ciertos modelos en diferentes tiendas para encontrar aquella donde costará menos y me dieran mejores facilidades de pago o recompensas por mi compra. Días después, durante el Buen Fin, revisé las promociones y ofertas que ofrecían en computadoras, para mi sorpresa, otorgaban mejores financiamientos, recompensas y bonificaciones a la hora de adquirir el producto.

En el 2016 durante el Buen Fin, los comercios al por menor utilizaron diversas estrategias de venta, entre las que destacan: descuentos sobre el precio de venta (83.4%), más líneas de productos con descuento (10.9%), productos de regalo en montos mínimos de compra (10.8%), otras estrategias (16.8%) y ninguna (6.1%). Mientras que las principales formas de pago que ofrecieron los comercios fueron meses sin intereses (59.3%), bonificación de puntos, kilómetros, dinero electrónico, etc. (15.9%), compre hoy y pague después (5.2%), otras formas de pago (5.9%) y ninguna promoción (26.3%). Esto de acuerdo con datos del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (Inegi).

Entre las lecciones que aprendí para hacer buenas y mejores compras en esta temporada anual de descuentos están:

1. Compara los productos que quieres con anticipación. Si quieres renovar algún electrodoméstico o aparato electrónico en tu hogar, lo ideal es que selecciones 3 modelos y los compares en diferentes tiendas al menos 3 semanas antes del Buen Fin, así podrás tener un mejor panorama de cuánto aumenta o disminuye su precio. A su vez, podrás conocer las formas de financiamiento y bonificaciones que ofrecen las tiendas. Con ello tomarás una mejor decisión y sabrás si te conviene adquirir el producto en esta fecha, o deberás esperar a comprarlo pasado el Buen Fin.

2. Liquida tu tarjeta de crédito. Al llegar el Buen Fin, muchas veces nos volvemos locos al encontrar ciertas ofertas que pensamos que jamás volverán, por lo que tendemos a comprar sin meditar si tenemos o no la capacidad, tanto de crédito como de pago, para hacer frente a este gasto; lo ideal es que a partir de ahora comiences a saldar las deudas pendientes que tienes en tu tarjeta de crédito. Así, cuando llegue el Buen Fin, no tendrás adeudos y podrás comprar los artículos que quieras sin temor a que tu tarjeta no pase o se sature.

3. Si vas a adquirir un viaje, activa alertas. Sabemos que comprar boletos de avión o paquetes vacacionales con anticipación es lo mejor que podemos hacer para obtener un mejor precio. Si tu viaje se acerca y no has comprado aún el vuelo, Kayak, Google Flights o SkyScanner son algunas páginas web que te alertan acerca de las fechas en las que es más barato adquirirlo. En esta fecha, aprovecha las promociones y descuentos que este tipo de páginas ofrecen.

4. Si piensas en comprar un carro, evalúa las ofertas. Es común que las agencias hagan descuentos en el precio de venta en ciertos modelos de autos si se pagan al contado; esta es una buena opción para adquirir el auto y venderlo en años próximos. De esa forma la diferencia entre el valor comercial del auto y el costo por haberlo adquirido será mínima, en comparación con haberlo adquirido al precio normal y venderlo al precio comercial que se establezca.

5. Saca provecho de las promociones. Es común que cuando vamos a comprar artículos en oferta, a la hora de pagar, existan diferentes promociones o descuentos dependiendo de la tienda. Elige aquella que dé una mejor bonificación por el gasto realizado, no te dejes guiar solo por los atractivos meses sin intereses, si puedes sacar provecho de ellos elige aquella que te dé recompensas.

A la hora de hacer una compra, piensa si el artículo que seleccionaste es necesario e imperdible, si solo es un gusto o capricho, o si lo compras solo por el calor del momento.

Une candidature déposée in extremis

Femme de gauche marquée par une enfance franco-marocaine où les livres abondaient, spécialiste du cinéma, Audrey Azoulay a été magistrate à la Cour des comptes après avoir occupé plusieurs fonctions à la Direction des médias du ministère de la culture. Elle est entrée au Centre national du cinéma (CNC) comme directrice financière en 2006, avant de devenir, de 2011 à 2014, la numéro deux de cet organisme en charge du système d'aide à la création cinématographique.

Passant pour avoir un tempérament énergique et enjoué, elle a été nommée en août 2014 conseillère de François Hollande chargée de la culture et de la communication. Elle a ensuite été ministre de la culture pendant un peu plus d'un an, jusqu'en mai 2017.

Elle avait déposé sa candidature à la tête de l'Organisation des Nations unies pour l'éducation, la science et la culture in extremis, en mars dernier, en faisant valoir que ""la France était très légitime sur la culture, l'éducation, les sciences"".

Les États-Unis et Israël ont porté ""un coup dur"" à l'Unesco, déjà fragilisée par ses dissensions et ses difficultés économiques, avec l'annonce jeudi de leur départ. Washington et Tel Aviv ont voulu ainsi exprimer leur exaspération face à une organisation qu'ils accusent d'être devenue anti-israélienne.

Les États-Unis avaient déjà suspendu leur contribution financière régulière il y a six ans.

영화 업계에선 하비 웨인스타인의 성추행에 대해 몰랐다는 사람들이 많다. 제인 폰다는 1년 전 그의 행동에 대한 이야기를 들었다고 인정했다고 헐리우드 리포터가 보도했다.

11월 6일의 CNN 인터뷰에서 제인 폰다는 크리스티안 아만푸르와 이야기하며 보다 일찍 그를 규탄하지 않은 것을 후회한다고 말했다.

“나는 1년 쯤 전에 하비에 대해 알게 되었다. 당시 아무 발언도 하지 않은 것이 부끄럽다.”

폰다는 로잔나 아퀘트를 통해 웨인스타인의 행동을 처음 알게 되었다고 한다. 아퀘트는 뉴욕 타임스 기자에게 웨인스타인이 가한 성폭력 사건을 자세히 말한 바 있다. 아퀘트에 따르면 웨인스타인은 1990년대에 영화 배역을 제안한다는 핑계로 아퀘트를 호텔 방에 불러 가랑이에 손을 밀어넣었다고 한다.

추가: @Janefonda 는 발언한 사람들이 ‘정말 자랑스럽다’고 한다. “이게 특이하고 끔찍한 일이라고 생각하지 말자- 이건 늘 일어나는 일이다.”

왜 침묵을 지켰는지 묻자 폰다는 “나는 그렇게 대담하지 못했다. 내게 일어난 일이 아니라서 내가 할 말이 아니라고 생각했던 것 같다.”고 답했다.

79세의 폰다는 웨인스타인을 단 한 번 만났다고 한다. 개인적으로는 그와 함께 있을 때 불편하지 않았다고 한다.

“나는 나이가 많이 들고 나서야 하비를 만났다. 하비는 더 취약한 어린 여성을 노린다.”

폰다는 과거에 침묵을 지켰으나, 성추행과 폭력 혐의가 드디어 주목 받게 된 것이 ‘기쁘다’고 한다.

“나는 발언하고 있는 동료 배우들이 정말 자랑스럽다. 오랜 시간이 걸린 일임을 알고 있다. 아주, 아주, 아주 힘든 일이다. 피해자가 된 사람으로서 얻을 수 있는 건 없지만, 이게 드러났다는 게 중요한 일이다.”

헐리우드에서는 권력 남용이 비일비재하지만, 폰다는 유명하든 아니든 온갖 업계에서 여성들에게 이런 일들이 일어남을 지적했다.

“이게 특이하고 끔찍한 일이라고 생각하지 말자.. 이런 일은 언제나 일어난다. 헐리우드를 비롯한 모든 곳에서 남성들은 이래도 된다고 생각한다. 전세계 모든 사무실과 업계에서, 바에서, 레스토랑에서, 가게에서. 여성들은 공격 받고, 학대 당하고, 희롱당한다.”

It may feel like you're the only one who has ever decided to take a break from university, but you're not.
The large majority of people I told said they had seriously considered taking a break on multiple occasions.
It may feel like you're the only one who has ever decided to take a break from university, but you're not.
Looking back, it wasn't an easy decision to make but I know it was the right one.","By Jake Bradshaw (@jakebrad1), a second-year economics major at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.

This was originally published Oct. 5 in the Queen's Journal.

""Mom, I need to come home.""

It has now been two weeks since I made the decision to come home for the semester. Although barely any time has passed, it feels like a lot has happened since I made that call to my parents.

Despite the short period of time, I learned a lot about myself, my friends and the pressure that we're all under as university students. My hope is that in explaining my experience struggling with a mental illness, it will allow other students to feel comfortable taking the appropriate steps they need to get better.

This can mean either getting the help they need at school in the form of social supports and counselling, or making the decision to take a break. The important thing is to recognize that you're struggling and to prioritize your mental health.

If I was still on campus, I would now be in my fourth week of classes as a second-year economics student. My first year was a little rocky and I struggled through lots of different challenges. There were moments where I felt alone, unsure of myself and hopeless about my future.

Looking back, what was I supposed to do? I was a first-year arts student who hated all of the courses I was in. The challenges I faced manifested themselves in different ways, but I ended up with a lack of confidence in myself as well as in my future.

I had doubts about all aspects of my life. I doubted my major and career path, my friendships, my decision to go to Queen's and ultimately how well I actually knew myself. This led me into some dark times where I felt alone, unsure and scared that I would feel this way forever.

Eventually, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, which proved to be a lot to deal with. While being away from home, I found it challenging to manage schoolwork, a new social scene, finding time for myself and trying to take care of my mental illness. Nevertheless, I got through it, ended the year feeling happy about where I was at mentally and proud of what I had accomplished.

Unfortunately, the summer came with its own set of challenges. The lack of activity and not having people around me all the time was a large adjustment. Although I was happy to be home, I fell into a slump that I was determined to get out of. With time, I did just that.

It may feel like you're the only one who has ever decided to take a break from university, but you're not.

At first, I started by running every morning. I meditated. I did cognitive behavioural therapy. I did everything I possibly could to get better, and I had the time to do it. Alongside all of this was a solid nine-to-five job which gave me something to focus on during the day.

In the end, the summer flew by. Looking back on it, I was hopeful about my future and I was excited by the numerous opportunities that laid ahead of me.

By the end of the summer, I was raring to go back to school. I couldn't wait to live in my own house with my friends, participate in extra-curricular activities and learn as much as I could from my classes.

But it didn't go as I had planned.

The first night back at Queen's, everything I had dealt with in first year came right back. I ended the night in my room anxious, unsure about my ability to get through second year. I felt like I needed to go home, I couldn't go through what I went through in first year again.

The confidence that I felt in the summer disappeared. I felt unsure about my ability to accomplish my goals.

I tried to establish a routine like I had in the summer. I started going to the gym and meditating, but it didn't seem to help.

I didn't know what to do. I felt helpless. I was in crisis and I knew that something had to change.

Looking back on those couple of weeks at Queen's, I can pinpoint that my anxiety was focused around my doubts about being able to do well in my classes, finish my degree and then eventually have a successful career.

When classes started, this anxiety would hit me out of the blue and I didn't know how to deal with it. I would be sitting in class, not understanding something, when my mind would tell me, ""you're a failure who will never amount to anything.""

These feelings would make me nauseous and my heart would start to beat rapidly. It was overwhelming. It got to the point where it would happen every morning in class, even if there wasn't a reason behind it.

In my mental state, I wasn't OK with not understanding everything perfectly on my first try. I figured out that I wasn't in the right mindset to learn.

Eventually, I realized I really wasn't in a good place to be at university.

In my mental state, I wasn't OK with not understanding everything perfectly on my first try. I figured out that I wasn't in the right mindset to learn.

Don't get me wrong, I love Queen's and the people there, so this decision was really hard for me. But I decided it would be better for me to take time off so I could go back feeling closer to 100 per cent and be able to enjoy it more. I know that at home I can prioritize my mental health just like I did in the summer and get back to my routine of running, meditating and challenging my anxious thoughts to feel like myself again.

When I told people at Queen's about my decision, I was met with a lot of different reactions, but one message seemed to repeat itself.

The large majority of people I told said they had seriously considered taking a break on multiple occasions. They said there were multiple times where they felt stressed and overwhelmed.

Everyone had their own way of dealing with stress, but for some people who were overwhelmed, taking a break didn't seem to be an option. That's because people think it isn't a ""normal"" thing to do. Well, I'm here to tell you it should be.

So please, if you're overwhelmed, struggling with a mental illness or just need a break, I would seriously suggest taking some time off. It may feel like you're the only one who has ever decided to take a break from university, but you're not. At the end of the day, your health is the most important thing and taking an extra semester isn't the end of the world.

Looking back, it wasn't an easy decision to make but I know it was the right one. Unfortunately, the right decisions tend to be the hardest to make.

So do whatever you feel you have to do, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's your life, not anyone else's.

Bei der Wahl in Österreich droht den Sozialdemokraten ein Debakel

Bei einer Kundgebung der SPÖ demonstrierte Kanzler Kern erneut, wieso seine Partei im Wahlkampf untergegangen ist

Die europäische Sozialdemokratie droht nun ein weiterer bitterer Tag

Der Tag, bevor sich Österreich für immer verändern könnte, begann sonnig und mit einer ordentlichen Portion Selbstbetrug.

Auf dem Viktor-Adler-Markt im Bezirk Favoriten hatten sich die Wiener Sozialdemokraten am Samstagvormittag zu einer letzten Kundgebung vor der Nationalratswahl am Sonntag getroffen. ""Unser Favoriten“, sagt die Moderatorin auf der Bühne, in dem Wissen, dass an diesem Ort, der nach einem der Begründer der österreichischen Arbeiterbewegung benannt ist, mittlerweile auch die rechten Populisten der FPÖ ihre Kundgebungen abhalten.

Viele Hundert Menschen stehen im Publikum: Junge wie Alte, Studenten und Arbeiter. Helfer verteilen Schilder mit der Aufschrift ""Gemeinsam kommen wir weiter"". Ein Slogan, der nach dem mit allen Mitteln der Niedertracht geführten Wahlkampf nicht ganz ironiefrei wirkt.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ein österreichischer Journalist berichtet: ""Wer hier rechte Politik kritisiert, muss dafür büßen""



Alle drei großen Parteien haben sich Mühe gegeben, den Gedanken an die durch den politischen Konsens geprägte politische Kultur der österreichischen Nachkriegsgeschichte wie einen historischen Irrtum aussehen zu lassen.

Während der deutsche Bundestagswahlkampf lange Zeit ereignislos dahin plätscherte, wirkte der politische Ideenstreit in Österreich wie eine Doppelfolge ""House of Cards"" nach dem fünften Obstler.

Nur die SPÖ geht in der Schlammschlacht unter

Ein früherer Berater von Christian Kern lancierte verleumderische Webangebote gegen Sebastian Kurz, dem Spitzenkandidaten der ÖVP.

Unter dem Titel ""Die Wahrheit über Sebastian Kurz"" wurden auf Facebook zum Teil ausländerfeindliche und antisemitische Inhalte verbreitet. Auch die ÖVP hatte zuletzt mit einem Skandal um die Verächtlichmachung der politischen Konkurrenz zu kämpfen.

Die FPÖ ihrerseits machte nie einen Hehl daraus, dass ihr Wahlkampf darauf basiert, die politische Konkurrenz madig zu machen. Überall in Österreich stehen Plakate, auf denen die angebliche Verlogenheit der ""Roten"" und der ""Schwarzen"" angeprangert wird.

Es ist jedoch allein die SPÖ, die in dieser wochenlangen Schlammschlacht nicht nur an Zustimmung, sondern auch ganz grundsätzlich an Glaubwürdigkeit verlor.

Was doppelt tragisch ist: Denn im Herbst 2017 deutet sich nicht nur das Ende der österreichischen Sozialdemokratie als staatstragende Kraft an. Eigentlich bräuchte Österreich gerade jetzt ein starkes Gegengewicht zu den Populisten und der nach rechts gerückten Kurz-ÖVP. Die beiden letztgenannten Parteien kommen in den Umfragen auf etwa 60 Prozent der Stimmen.

Kerns 18-Minuten-Rede war voll von Widersprüchen

Als Bundeskanzler Christian Kern die Bühne am Viktor-Adler-Markt betritt, wird deutlich, wo die systemischen Fehler liegen, die der SPÖ derzeit Zustimmungswerte auf der Flughöhe ihrer deutschen Schwesterpartei bescheren.

Kerns 18-minütige Rede war voll von offensichtlichen Widersprüchen, die man nur dann übersehen kann, wenn man seiner politischen Gesinnung anhängt wie ein Fußballfan seinem Lieblingsverein.

Einerseits beklagte Kern den schmutzigen Wahlkampf. Andererseits ließ er gut 20 Stunden vor Öffnung der Wahllokale keine Gelegenheit aus, um noch einmal ein paar rhetorische Tiefschläge zu verteilen.

Der SPÖ-Kanzler stellte sich – trotz aller bekannten Vorwürfe gegen die SPÖ-Kampagne – als Opfer der Medien dar.

""Es hat teilweise richtige Hetzkampagnen in einzelnen Medien gegeben"", klagte Kern. ""Dahinter steht die Idee, dass die glauben, dass sie sich gemeinsam mit der ÖVP aussuchen können, wer der nächste Bundeskanzler ist. Und zwar bevor die Menschen zu den Wahlurnen geschritten sind.""

Es gehe um die Interessen der ""95 Prozent"", und nicht um die die von ein ""paar Superreichen und Herausgebern"".

Es sind Worte, die man anderswo in Europa eher von jenen erwartet, die sich verschwörerisch zuraunen, dass ""die Eliten"" mit Hilfe eines ""Masterplans"" das ""Volk"" um ihr Recht betrügen wollten. Nur dass so etwas in Österreich aus dem Munde des amtierenden Bundeskanzlers kommt.

Der Kanzler wittert eine Verschwörung

Kern unterstellt seinen politisches Kontrahenten außerdem – ohne das so zu nennen – ein oligarchisches Geschäftsmodell. Reiche Geschäftsleute hätten sich mit ihren Spenden politische Positionen bei der ÖVP erkauft, und die FPÖ diene sich als Vollstreckerin dieser Absprachen an.

""Es ist bemerkenswert, wie sich die Freiheitlichen hier den Steigbügelhalter für die Interesse der Großspender von Sebastian Kurz machen"", so Kern. ""Da machen ein paar Leute den Deal ihres Lebens: Du spendest ein paar Millionen, und kriegst Milliarden zurück.""

Auch einen sexistischen Seitenhieb auf die ÖVP konnte sich Kern nicht verkneifen: Die ehemalige Chefberaterin von Ex-Bundeskanzler Wolfgang Schüssel sitze nun ""auf dem Schoß"" von Sebastian Kurz.

Doch es sind nicht nur diese heftigen, bisweilen diffamierenden und unbelegten Vorwürfe, die ein schlechtes Licht auf den Wahlkampf der SPÖ werfen. Bisweilen wirkte Kern so, als sei er dazu verdammt, alle inhaltlichen Fehler zu wiederholen, die bereits dem SPD-Kanzlerkandidaten Martin Schulz zum Verhängnis geworden waren.

Die Sozialdemokraten scheitern nach altem Muster

Kern sagte, dass die SPÖ für Steuergerechtigkeit und kostenlose Hochschulbildung kämpfen wolle. Die Reichen müssten ihren gerechten Anteil bezahlen, um das Gemeinwesen zu finanzieren.

Auch die deutsche SPD setzte auf einen Wahlkampf, der sich auf ""soziale Gerechtigkeit"" fokussierte. Ein wichtiges Thema. Doch ohne den Bezug auf ein funktionierendes Zukunftsbild – das ist die Lehre aus dem deutschen Wahlkampf – verfangen solche Forderungen nicht.

Es zeigte sich zum Beispiel: Wenn Menschen nicht mehr daran glauben, dass Bildung ihnen eine bessere Zukunft sichern kann, dann berührt es sie auch nicht, ob das Studium nun kostet oder nicht.

In einer Zeit, die immer stärker von einer Schutzhaltung vor dem Kommenden geprägt ist, schaffen es Sozialdemokraten in ganz Europa nicht mehr, die Menschen davon zu überzeugen, dass sie sich glaubwürdig für die Emanzipation des Individuums einsetzen.

Und Kern? Der lobte sich in seiner Rede auf dem Viktor-Adler-Markt auch noch dafür, dass es seiner Regierung gelungen sei ""von Monat zu Monat weniger Migration in Österreich“ zuzulassen.

Ein Slogan der Kern-Anhänger zeigt, dass seine Zeit vorbei ist

Es steht zu erwarten, dass die SPÖ am Sonntag am eigenen Leib spüren wird, wie betagt sozialdemokratische Politik im Jahr 2017 bisweilen wirkt.

Die Umfragen deuten darauf hin, dass die österreichischen Sozialdemokraten nicht nur ihr historisch schlechtestes Wahlergebnis einfahren werden. Nach dem derzeitigen Stand der Dinge ist es auch sehr unwahrscheinlich, dass sie an einer neuen Regierung beteiligt sein werden.

Auf dem Viktor-Adler-Markt skandieren die Anhänger von Kern nach dessen Rede ""Yes we can!"".

Ein zehn Jahre alter Slogan. Erfunden von einem Politiker namens Barack Obama, der heute hilflos zuschauen muss, wie sein rechtsradikaler Nachfolger Donald Trump das Land verändert. Eigentlich wäre damit schon alles gesagt. Wenn es nicht so tragisch wäre.

Donald Trump hat einen Strategiewechsel zum Iran-Deal angekündigt

Der US-Präsident droht mit Sanktionen und will das Atomabkommen mit der Islamischen Republik nicht mehr zertifizieren

Die US-Medien üben wegen seiner brachialen Vorgehensweise nun heftige Kritik an Trump

""Die Geschichte hat gezeigt: Je länger wir eine Bedrohung ignorieren, umso größer wird diese Bedrohung.""

Dieses ominöse Zitat wurde nicht über, sondern von Donald Trump gesagt. Es war die Begründung des US-Präsidenten dafür, dem Iran mit neuen Sanktionen zu drohen und das Atomabkommen mit dem Land nicht mehr zertifizieren zu wollen.

Trump trat nicht aus dem Iran-Deal aus, wie es lange befürchtet worden war - aber er machte ihn aus US-Sicht wirkungslos. Und erntete dafür prompt Kritik.

Von verbündeten Nationen wie Deutschland, Frankreich und Großbritannien, aber auch von dem Großteil der US-Medien.

""Trump händigt dem Iran einen Sieg aus""



Gleich zwei Journalisten kommentierten so etwa in der ""New York Times"" Trumps Entscheidung, den Iran-Deal herabzustufen. Der Redakteur Antony J. Blinken glaubt, Trump ""vergrault die Verbündeten der USA und händigt dem Iran einen Sieg aus.""

Schon Trumps Analyse der Lage im Iran sei vollkommen falsch gewesen, schreibt Blinken. Wie viele Republikaner behauptet Trump, dass das Regime in Teheran längst kollabiert wäre, hätte sein Vorgänger Barack Obama den Iran-Deal nicht abgeschlossen - und so die Sanktionen gegen das Land aufgehoben.

Blinken meint: ""Eine Behauptung, die Tagträumer in Washington seit vier Jahrzehnten jedes Jahr machen."" Trumps harte Linie gegen die Islamische Republik helfe nur den Hardlinern in der iranischen Regierung. Tatsächlich gefährde sie außerdem sowohl die Glaubwürdigkeit als auch die Sicherheit der USA, schlussfolgert Blinken.

Sein Kollege Bret Stephens formuliert es drastischer: ""Donald Trump hat eine Geisel genommen."" Gemeint ist der Iran-Deal, dessen Scheitern der Präsident durch seine rabiate Vorgehensweise in Kauf nehme.

Stephens räumt ein, dass die US-Politik gegenüber dem Iran zu festgefahren sei und Trump durch seine Entscheidung Bewegung in die Beziehungen der beiden Länder gebracht habe. Gleichzeitig fürchtet er aber das Risiko eines ausbrechenden Krieges - und die Tatsache, dass es an einer instabilen Person wie Donald Trump ist, einen solchen zu verhindern.

""Trumps 'neue Strategie' zum Iran ist weder neu noch eine Strategie""

Das Nachrichtenportal ""Vox"" beurteilt Trumps Attacke auf den Iran-Deal noch kritischer als die ""New York Times"". Es bezeichnet die Vorstöße des US-Präsidenten gegen den Iran als ""Abrechnung des Grolls"". ""Trumps 'neue Strategie' zum Iran ist weder neu noch eine Strategie"", schreibt ""Vox"".

Weder die Sanktionen gegen die Nationalgarde des Irans, die Trump angekündigt hatte, noch die Blockade des Iran-Deals seien Schritte, die ein klares Ziel im Umgang mit der Islamischen Republik definieren würden. ""Vox"" zitiert hierzu den Iran-Experten Hussein Banai, einen Politikwissenschaftler von der University of Indiana: ""Das ist ein ausgestreckter Mittelfinger an den Anspruch der USA auf eine Führungsrolle in der Welt.""

Die ""Washington Post"" schreibt in dieser Hinsicht von einer ""Dummheit"" Trumps. Der US-Präsident habe sich mit Teheran auf ein gefährliches und sinnloses Spiel mit dem Feuer eingelassen. Jetzt sei es am US-Kongress, nicht die gleiche Dummheit wie Trump zu begehen, indem er dessen Politik mitträgt: ""Der Kongress sollte den Status Quo, so viele Fehler dieser auch hat, nicht verletzen - denn er verhindert eine weitere nukleare Krise.""

Trump bleibt sorglos

Vor dieser fürchtet sich auch die Londoner Zeitung ""The Guardian"". ""Die nun entstehende diplomatische Lage ist beispiellos"", schreibt die US-Redaktion des Blattes. ""Ein US-Präsident streitet sich nicht nur mit seinen eigenen engsten Beratern, sondern zugleich mit allen entscheidenden Akteuren einer ernsten Krise der internationalen Sicherheit - einschließlich sämtlicher europäischer Verbündeter.""

Aus ""Amerika zuerst"" würde derzeit ""Amerika allein"" - ""und das in einem Moment, in dem klar wird, dass die USA allein weit weniger Macht hat, als sie denkt.""

Donald Trump scheint dies noch nicht klar geworden zu sein. Er feiert seine harte Linie gegen den Iran als Erfolg und Korrektur der aus seiner Sicht laschen Politik seines Vorgängers Barack Obama. Bei einer Rede am Freitagabend ging Trump so weit, zu behaupten: ""Meine Präsidentschaft ist dem Zeitplan weit voraus.""

Angesichts der bisherigen katastrophalen Fehler Trumps in der Außenpolitik lässt sich sagen: Das hat etwas von Ignoranz.

Es por ello que la organización civil busca generar votos hasta el 16 de octubre para ganar el concurso y poder desarrollar #NormaTuAbogada, una alternativa para que la gente cuente con mayor información sobre qué hacer en caso de sufrir un delito. De este modo, Norma permitirá generar datos para hacer recomendaciones de política pública en materia de procuración de justicia, con base en evidencia de lo que vive el ciudadano.

La plataforma sistematiza el camino a la denuncia a través de mensajes SMS, por lo que podría ayudar a 60.6 millones de mexicanos con acceso a celular (INEGI). El sistema también ofrece respuesta de manera inmediata, es independiente de la autoridad y busca tanto identificar como eliminar las barreras que obstaculizan la denuncia. También pretende ser una fuente de datos para mejorar las políticas públicas en materia de procuración de justicia y automatizar la asistencia, pues no requiere de capital humano para atender el mensaje.

Es por ello que el HuffPost platicó con Ricardo Corona, director jurídico del IMCO, para platicar los pormenores de la plataforma a unos días de que cierre la votación para el concurso convocado por Google.

¿Cómo surgió y cómo es que funciona esta plataforma?

Como sabes, el IMCO ha realizado diversos ejercicios para tratar de explicar y entender, a partir de evidencia empírica, cómo funciona la justicia penal mexicana, saber qué pasa, dónde están los cochupos, por qué no funciona más allá de la reforma del sistema penal. En el último ejercicio que hicimos en Morelos donde nos metimos a revisar expedientes penales y sacar evidencia, uno de los eslabones más débiles que vimos ahí fue que la ciudadanía no tiene confianza en la autoridad. Lo que nosotros hicimos fue tratar de entender qué estaba pasando, por qué la gente no confía en la autoridad para presentar una denuncia. En función de eso, el siguiente paso es explorar recomendaciones de política pública para atender ese reto. Y ahí surge Norma, como una herramienta ciudadana, un robot automatizado que por medio de un proceso de pregunta respuesta, te permita llevar paso a paso la presentación de una denuncia. El piloto que estamos trabajando es exclusivo para el delito de robo.

¿Qué alcances tiene esta plataforma y cómo la están diseñando?

Con base en todo lo que te dice la ley, armas un sistema de conocimiento, un árbol de preguntas y respuestas que incluya este robo en específico para la Ciudad de México solamente, este primer piloto. Ya que se tiene un mapeo de la ley con todas las aristas, se traduce en lenguaje ciudadano para que el ciudadano que no es experto en derecho penal (y no tiene por qué serlo), haga preguntas vía teléfono para seguir la ruta de su denuncia. La plataforma que se va a usar son mensajes SMS. La razón es muy sencilla: no todo el mundo tiene un sistema android para descargar aplicaciones y ya hay precedentes de este tipo de tecnología en que se da seguimiento personalizado a la gente en la atención de algún tema público, como las mujeres embarazadas en zonas marginadas, donde tienen acceso vía SMS a atención personalizada.

¿Cómo se atendería a toda la gente que use esta plataforma para hacer su denuncia? ¿Quién las atendería?

Haz de cuenta. Te asaltan y te roban tu cartera, los espejos de tu coche, o se meten a tu casa. Tu reportas el robo en un mensaje SMS: me robaron. En ese momento comienza la ruta: ¿qué tipo de robo? ¿dónde? Comienzan a darte la ruta para que presentes una denuncia. Cuando hablamos del número de denuncias que se presentan en México, solamente el 3.7% de los delitos que se cometen, es el que se denuncia. ¿Por qué? Porque la gente está desconectada, no ve resultados, es caro o no sabe cómo. La herramienta lo que hace es conectar a la ciudadanía para que sepa el ABC mínimo para presentar su denuncia. Ya que se completa este proceso, el ciudadano está listo para presentarse al Ministerio Público. En ese momento que los asuntos evolucionen, y necesites una interacción personalizada y no la quieres precisamente con la autoridad, tenemos convenios firmados con organizaciones que sí brindan la asistencia personalizada. En este caso, se canaliza puntualmente con una organización de las aliadas para atender cada caso. Con esta herramienta el IMCO no hace el trabajo de esas organizaciones, sino dando un paso antes para conectar a la ciudadanía y tratando de revertir la famosa cifra negra. Buscamos generar un flujo de gente que vaya a denunciar.

¿Hasta qué punto se puede revertir esta cifra negra tomando en cuenta que a final de cuentas la gente no denuncia por la desconfianza en que su denuncia será resulta de alguna manera? Y más cuando ya hay herramientas para denunciar en línea ante el Ministerio Público.

Hoy por hoy las políticas públicas vinculadas a la disminución de delitos, están dirigidas de manera vertical hacia la ciudadanía. No tienen un enfoque de empoderamiento, de conocimiento al ciudadano, de que sepa con quién, cómo y para qué, se exige el cumplimiento de sus derechos. Esto implica un proceso de sensibilización y uno de los objetivos de esta herramienta es que la gente entiende cómo funcionan las instituciones. Además de eso, con base en el agoritmo, se va a generar estadística en la Ciudad de México sobre concentración, tipos de delito y datos que hoy por hoy no tiene INEGI, que no existe, porque me refiero a generar estadística de esa cifra negra porque no se confía en las instituciones.

¿Y en qué etapa van con la fase piloto de la plataforma?

Estamos trabajando. Está la candidatura para el premio a nivel Latinoamérica. Ya lo ganamos a nivel nacional. Lo que estamos haciendo es armar el mapeo normativo, toda una radiografía para luego traducirlo a un mapa de preguntas y respuestas. La siguiente etapa del proyecto, los desarrolladores se van a encargar de traducir eso al algoritmo necesario para implementarlo en SMS.

Dlamini-Zuma continued her dialogue on the importance of radical economic transformation (RET) -- a matter which she has built her campaign around -- saying that although some people do not like the concept, the reality is that the current status quo is ""unacceptable and unsustainable"".

""RET is not a slogan that is used by a particular individual, it is a decision of the ANC. It is our responsibility to implement it. We must also look at how this RET can unfold. For RET we need to look at what do we have as South Africa (SA) and how can we use what we have,"" she said.

She spoke about the importance of investing in citizens, sports and recreation, industrialisation, free education, land redistribution and the economy.

""Nobody can stand up here and say it is good to have the majority of the people marginalised. When we talk RET, we are not frightening anyone, we are saying it is good for SA,"" she said.

""We mustn't think that it will be easy. If we are united, we are strong, we can move this country to prosperity.""

Intitulé ""Movieland"" (""le pays des films""), ce plan représente aussi les plus de 300 heures de travail, étalées sur neuf mois, qui ont été nécessaires pour concevoir cette carte sur laquelle les films ont été placés un par un. En fond, un fond imaginaire, avec des rivières, des forêts, des collines et des lacs.

Interrogé par Le HuffPost, David Honnorat raconte que cette idée est née de la frustration d'un ancien projet similaire. ""En 2009, j'avais déjà fait une compilation des ""250 meilleurs films"" sous forme de plan de métro. Mais avec du recul, j'ai regretté certains choix de film et le fait qu'ils soient si peu nombreux.""

Le Français s'est donc lancé dans cette grande cartographie. ""Je suis parti de manière très intuitive, sans vraiment de préparation, en me basant d'abord sur des films cultes."" Il explique que dans la construction, tout était surtout question de cohérence. ""Au fur et à mesure, j'avais des lacs, des routes, des forêts ou des voies de chemin de fer. Ça m'a permis de faire des liens et de placer de nouveaux films à chaque fois.""

David Honnorat explique aussi qu'il ne pouvait pas passer plus de ""deux à trois heures par jour"" sur ce travail. ""C'était assez prise de tête finalement"", raconte-t-il. ""Au bout d'un moment, j'ai créé un grand document sous forme de tableur dans lequel j'ai entré et répertorié les films que je comptais ajouter, avec, à chaque fois, les informations de base comme l'année de sortie ou le réalisateur. Grâce à ça, j'ai pu définir des régions par thématiques et structurer la carte.""

On y trouve donc de nombreuses références de tous les genres, de la ""Mer des Larmes"", aux lacs d'horreur en passant par la ""Vallée de l'Amour"".

Le plus difficile dans ce projet, c'est qu'il y avait beaucoup de cas insolubles et j'ai dû faire des choix"", explique David Honnorat. ""Par exemple, j'ai une voie de chemin de fer pour les zombies qui traverse plusieurs régions et plusieurs thématiques. Il a fallu jouer avec tous les films et se décider.

La carte a également été conçue en anglais, ""de manière à ce qu'elle puisse circuler dans le monde entier."" Le Français s'est d'ailleurs donné l'objectif de la partager le plus possible dans le maximum de pays. ""Movieland"" a déjà été reprise par Reddit et le site américain ""Fast Compagny

Le producteur d'Hollywod est désormais visé par deux enquêtes, l'une ouverte par la police de New York le 12 octobre, l'autre dans la foulée au Royaume-Uni. En France, la justice n'a, au moment où cet article est publié, pas été saisie.

Quatre actrices françaises ont témoigné: Emma de Caunes, Judith Godrèche, Léa Seydoux et Florence Darel. Les faits rapportés ont tous eu lieu sur le sol français mais ils sont pour au moins trois d'entre eux, prescrits. Une différence de taille par rapport aux législations de certains états américains et à celle du Royaume-Uni, en France, le viol et l'agression sexuelle ont un délai de prescription.

L'enquête américaine se concentrerait pour l'instant sur une agression sexuelle présumée remontant à 2004. Selon Daily News, la justice chercherait à recueillir des éléments concernant des accusations de l'actrice Lucia Evans, qui assure que Harvey Weinstein l'aurait forcée à lui faire une fellation en 2004, à New York.

L'enquête britannique, quant à elle, concernerait une agression sexuelle commise dans les années 80 dans la région londonienne.

New York, Californie, Royaume-Uni : pas de délai de prescription pour les viols

Pour le producteur, tout dépend de l'État dans lequel il serait poursuivi, car les délais de prescription ne sont pas les mêmes partout, et des faits qui lui sont reprochés.

Dans l'État de New York, Weinstein ne pourrait pas compter sur la prescription pour s'en sortir car pour les viols, celle-ci n'existe plus. ""Depuis l'affaire Cosby, pour les infractions à caractère sexuel, les viols, plusieurs Etats ont rallongé ou même supprimé le délai de prescription"", souligne Me Arthur Dethomas, avocat aux barreaux de Paris et de New York, auprès de BFMTV. ""Aujourd'hui à New York, il n'y a plus de prescription pour les viols.""

Si une enquête devait être ouverte en Californie, les victimes pourraient aussi porter plainte. Depuis la fin de l'année 2016, suite à l'affaire Bill Cosby, la prescription pour les crimes sexuels, qui était de dix ans, a été supprimée.

Ainsi, que l'agression ait eu lieu en 2004 ou dans les années 90, cela ne change rien. Lucia Evans pourrait donc en théorie porter plainte et demander à ce que le producteur soit poursuivi en justice, rappelle le Telegraph.

Toutefois, pour l'instant, aucune victime n'a porté plainte. C'est pourquoi J. Peter Donald, porte-parole du New York Police Department, a indiqué que ""la police de New York encourage toute personne détentrice d'éventuelles informations à le faire savoir"".

Quoi qu'il en soit, rappelle l'AFP, de nombreux faits reprochés à Weinstein seront prescrits car considérés par le code pénal comme des délits mineurs. C'est par exemple le cas des accusations de harcèlement sexuel pour lequel ""le délai varie entre six mois et un an"", précise à BFMTV Me Christopher Mesnooh, avocat pénaliste au barreau de Paris, New York et Washington.

Au Royaume-Uni, il n'existe pas de délai de prescription pour les crimes, le viol étant considéré comme tel.

En France, un délai de dix ans pour les personnes majeures

En France néanmoins, pour les faits étudiés par les enquêtes de New York et du Royaume-Uni, la justice ne pourrait pas être saisie. Ici, la victime, si elle est majeure, doit déposer sa plainte dans un délai de dix ans après le viol. Si le crime a été commis sur une personne mineure, celle-ci dispose de dix ans de plus pour porter plainte, donc vingt ans.

L'actrice italienne Asia Argento, qui assure au magazine The New Yorker avoir été victime d'un viol en 1997 dans une chambre d'un hôtel de la Côte d'Azur, ne pourrait donc pas porter plainte en raison du délai de prescription.

En ce qui concerne les agressions sexuelles qui ne sont pas des viols, c'est-à-dire des ""actes à caractère sexuel sans pénétration commis sur la personne d'autrui, par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise"", le délai de prescription est de trois ans pour une victime majeure et ""20 ans après la majorité de la victime si l'agression sexuelle a été commise sur une personne mineure de moins de 15 ans ou sur un mineur par un ascendant, une personne ayant autorité, ou par plusieurs personnes"", peut-on lire sur le site du gouvernement.

Des délais allongés en février 2017

Les quatre actrices françaises qui ont témoigné contre Weinstein ne pourraient donc pas non plus demander justice.

Les faits relayés par Emma de Caunes -elle a raconté qu'à l'hôtel du Ritz, à Paris, le producteur est sorti de la douche nu, le sexe en érection, et lui a demandé de s'allonger sur le lit- remontent à 2010, on est donc au-delà des trois ans de délais pour une agression sexuelle qui n'est pas un viol.

Judith Godrèche a raconté avoir refusé un massage proposé par Weinstein, qui s'est alors pressé contre elle et lui a enlevé son pull. Des faits qui datent de 1996, à Cannes.

""Nous parlions sur le canapé quand il a sauté sur moi et a essayé de m'embrasser. J'ai dû me défendre"", confie Léa Seydoux. La date de cette agression qui s'est produite dans une chambre d'hôtel parisienne n'est pas précisée.

Quant à Florence Darel, le récit qu'elle fait de Weinstein lui ayant proposé de devenir sa maîtresse remonte à 1995 à Paris. Le harcèlement sexuel est également un délit dont le délai de prescription est de trois ans.

La plupart de ces délais a été allongée en février 2017, lorsque l'Assemblée nationale a adopté une réforme. Ces délais restent bien trop courts pour certains qui souhaiteraient les allonger. En avril dernier, Flavie Flament, qui venait tout juste de révéler avoir été violée à l'adolescence, demandait à ce que ce délai soit prolongé de dix ans pour les crimes sexuels commis sur les mineurs, ce qui le porterait à 30 ans à compter de leur majorité, donc jusqu'à l'âge de 48 ans.

If you’re a superstitious sort, you might regard this as the unluckiest day of the year – so keep away from ladders, don’t break any mirrors and don’t let any black cats cross your path.

Fear of this date is known as friggatriskaidekaphobia (named after “Frigg”, the Norse goddess whom Friday is named after and “triskaidekaphobia” meaning the fear of “13”.)

Among the genuine tragedies to befall this day were the bombing of Buckingham Palace on September 13, 1940, as part of Hitler’s strategic “Blitz” bombing campaign.

November 13 1970 (also a Friday) saw a massive storm kill around 300,000 people in Bangladesh, with subsequent floods killing as many as a million in the Ganges Delta.

Thomas Fernsler, a professor at the University of Delaware, has studied Friday the 13th extensively and even goes by the moniker ‘Professor 13’.

He says one of the most common explanations for the origin of the date being associated with bad luck stems from the Bible.

There were 13 people at the Last Supper — Jesus and his 12 apostles. The Crucifixion took place on a Friday, and the two have been linked ever since. But Fernsler also says Norse mythology asserts that the god Loki went uninvited to a party of 12 other gods and caused the death of the most beloved one, Balder, causing the world to plunge into darkness.

To this day, parties are wary of having 13 members, he says. In Paris, there are businesses that will rent you a professional 14th dinner guest, called a quatorzieme.

Some people however put absolutely no stock in superstitions about this date.

Wake Forest University professor Eric Carlson once led a group called the Carolina Skeptics, who would gather every Friday the 13th and encourage people to do “unlucky” things, just to prove that the world wouldn’t end as a result.

“We would deliberately challenge superstitions,” he said. “At 13:13, I would stand under a ladder. We’d have a fake black cat (I’m allergic to real ones), and break a mirror and spill salt while standing on a crack. We like to have control in our lives, and it’s very discomforting that bad things happen that we can’t control, so we try to find ways to control these bad things.

Justice Bell sums up the mood as regards to Malcolm Roberts' legal argument: ""What are we getting out of this?"" #Citizenship7 — Adam Gartrell (@adamgartrell) October 12, 2017

Now remember, the High Court has previously found, under cross examination, Roberts -- who was born in India in 1955 to a Welsh father and an Australian mother -- was a dual-British citizen when he nominated and was elected in 2016.

This is already a technical breach of Section 44 of the Constitution, but the full bench of the High Court is still to rule on the case of Roberts as well as the six other federal politicians; Barnaby Joyce, Matt Canavan, Fiona Nash, Nick Xenophon, Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam.

Roberts is attending the High Court on Thursday and his legal representative, Robert Newlinds QC, quickly argued that the previous cross-examination of the senator had ""misfired"" and there has been ""nonsense arguments"" and then, essentially described the potential for kicking him out of parliament for being an Australian immigrant as ""un-Australian"".

The QC for the anti-immigration party argued to the High Court's full bench, there should not be a distinction between Australian born citizens and Australian immigrants or foreign born Australians, that being born overseas was almost irrelevant.

Anything else for Newlinds was ""a fundamentally un-Australian notion"".

What was he? Well it was put that it does not matter that he was born in India, in fact, it was a ""dangerous distraction"".

""We are here because he father is welsh, No one is suggesting he was an India"".

Justice Virginia Bell asked, ""is it your submission that Senator Roberts is a natural born Australian? Newlinds flung his hands in the air and responded, ""he is a natural born Indian, whatever that means"".

The Commonwealth argues politicians born overseas should have been aware there was a risk they were dual citizens.

But Roberts lawyer then claimed that the UK was not a foreign power, or at least has only been one since 1986, but this change in view had happened without ""flag-waving and clarion calls."" His assertion was that Roberts was a British subject, but also Australian.

Newlinds says the UK didn't become a foreign power until 1986, suggested in previous High Court cases #Citizenship7 — Matthew Doran (@MattDoran91) October 12, 2017

The key here, for Roberts and his team, was that Roberts father came to Australia in 1962 as a British citizen and became an Australian solely by ""setting up a domicile"".

That, it is argued how things were done back in the day for British subjects.

The other back in the day argument was that body politic - or general Australian population - in the 1970s did not view Britain a ""foreign power"", so Roberts was ""entitled to put of his mind that he was a British citizen.""

The senator, Newlinds said, always thought he was an Australian and in 1994 his dad came home with a citizenship certificate and he ""did not think it was a big deal"" and he did not get any extra rights or duties.

Newlinds saying the moment Roberts got a citizenship certificate, he didn't gain any extra rights or duties #Citizenship7 — Matthew Doran (@MattDoran91) October 12, 2017

The argument exasperated the justices who urged a hurry on during the third and final day of hearings into the dual citizenship statuses.

How does this take us to 2016, when Roberts nominated for parliament while knowing he was a dual citizen?

Justice Bell wanted to know.

""Putting to inside what people may or may not have thought, we are to determine this on the facts that have been found. It is just unclear to me where this argument is taking us?"" she asked.

Roberts put that It would be different Roberts had stood for nomination in 1987, but, Justice Bell, said in exasperation, ""we are dealing with a nomination in 2016?""

It was tendered he knew prior to 1974 that he was a British citizen, but Newlinds said Roberts did not know in 2016 he was British citizen, but he had the ""wit to think he might be"".

""His state of mind was embedded and set in 1974 and it doesn't change,"" nNewlinds told the court.

It is then, he argued, that Roberts took ""reasonable steps"" to renounce citizenship. It just happened to be after he nominated and had tried email accounts that were non-existent.

The Justices want to get to 2016. At one point, it was put ""we are in 1898, we have a long way to (get to 2016).""

The Chief Justice Susan Kiefel stated in frustration, ""I don't understand the relevance to the case,"" ""what are we getting out of this?"" and ""can you bring us up to date?""

Newlinds is trying to mix Roberts's ""state of mind"" or the view he is ""entitled to"" with a recounting of history, we will find out if he has managed to take the Justices there.",It Is 'Un-Australian'!

La recette du lundi

Et c'est parti pour la première recette pour relever le défi ""Je cuisine et j'apporte mon déj au travail pendant une semaine"". Au menu lundi midi: quiche poireau et poulet rôti et salade de carotte râpée Retrouvez toutes les infos sur notre défi sur la page Facebook du HuffPost C'est la vie! #mondéj #défihuffpost Une publication partagée par Le HuffPost (@lehuffpost) le 8 Oct. 2017 à 10h13 PDT

Pour cuisiner les restes de poulet rôti du dimanche midi, j'ai préparé une quiche poireau et poulet. Elle se congèle très bien. Elle était accompagnée d'une salade de carottes râpées. En dessert, c'était du fromage blanc et une pomme.

Pour la réaliser, c'est très simple. Faites préchauffer votre four à 180°C. Effilochez l'équivalent d'un blanc de poulet. Coupez le poireau en fines rondelles, faites revenir à la poêle pendant cinq minutes dans un peu d'huile d'olive, salez, poivrez. Dans un saladier, battez trois œufs, mélangez l'équivalent de deux petits verres de lait, ajoutez de la noix de la muscade si vous en avez, salez, poivrez. Étalez la pâte feuilletée, piquez-la, versez les rondelles de poireau, ajoutez le poulet et versez par-dessus le mélange lait - œuf.

Parsemez de gruyère et enfournez pendant 25 minutes.

Pendant ce temps-là, j'ai râpé une carotte. Pour l'assaisonnement, j'ai fait une vinaigrette classique: moutarde, vinaigre, huile d'olive. J'ai ajouté un peu de citron et des olives vertes.

Et voilà le resultat! #mondéj #défihuffpost Une publication partagée par Le HuffPost (@lehuffpost) le 8 Oct. 2017 à 11h00 PDT

Voici le résultat:

C'était très bon mais pour la quiche, le fait de réchauffer au micro-ondes pose problème. Le feuilleté de la pâte n'a pas résisté... Pour la prochaine fois, je miserai plutôt sur de la pâte brisée.

Au niveau des quantités, c'était presque un peu trop. Le combo fromage blanc et quiche est un peu lourd. J'ai laissé la pomme pour cet après-midi.

La recette du mardi

Lundi soir, c'est un bon plat de pâtes qui m'attend. J'en fais un peu plus pour pouvoir les transformer pour le repas de mardi en gratin en m'inspirant d'une recette du livre ""Pasta cake"" de Christelle Huet-Gomez aux éditions Marabout. Pour le dessert, ce sera une poire.

Faites préchauffer votre four à 180°C. Coupez la feta en dés et les cœurs d'artichaut en quatre. Mélangez le tout avec les pâtes cuites et le reste (encore!) du poulet rôti de dimanche midi, à la sauce tomate. Salez, poivrez. Versez dans un moule, parsemez de gruyère et enfournez pendant 15 minutes.

Lavez de la roquette, finissez la vinaigrette de la veille à base de moutarde, vinaigre balsamique et huile d'olive.

C'était très bon! Étonnamment, le rendu du gratin n'était pas sec et les pâtes pas trop molles non plus entre la première cuisson, le four puis le micro-ondes.

Pour ce qui est des quantités, c'est mieux que la veille. Les pâtes étaient riches en fromage, inutile de compléter avec un produit laitier supplémentaire.

Ce mercredi, j'étais sûre que j'allais commencer à fléchir et à rêver d'un bon traiteur libanais pour ma pause déjeuner. J'ai donc préparé un repas froid, simple, inspiré d'une recette du livre ""Simplissime Salades Complètes"" de Jean-François Mallet chez Hachette Cuisine.

Mélangez un avocat coupé en morceaux, le concombre en bâtonnets, des miettes de thon (optionnel), le jus d'un demi-citron, les pois chiches rincés et égouttés. Épluchez et coupez en fines rondelles l'oignon rouge, faites-les attendrir dans un peu de vinaigre. Ciselez du persil, de la coriandre, de la menthe selon votre goût (ajoutez-les au dernier moment). A côté, un peu de houmous et du pain pita.

En dessert, du raisin.

La recette du jeudi

Pour ce jeudi midi et avant-dernier jour de notre #défihuffpost j'avais préparé des wraps. L'objectif, c'était qu'ils soient aussi bons que beaux... Résultat : impossible à manger! #mondéj Une publication partagée par Le HuffPost (@lehuffpost) le 12 Oct. 2017 à 7h47 PDT

J'avais imaginé cette recette pour finir pas mal de choses utilisées plus tôt dans la semaine: les artichauts, les herbes aromatiques, l'oignon rouge, de l'avocat, la feta, le chou rouge, de la roquette.

J'ai réalisé un guacamole en écrasant un avocat. J'y ai pressé un demi citron, ajouté de l'oignon haché, de la coriandre et du piment.

Dans une tortilla, j'ai étalé une bonne quantité de guacamole, j'ai égoutté les artichauts et les ai coupés en deux. J'ai ajouté de la salade et du chou rouge. J'ai roulé l'ensemble et je l'ai découpé en tronçons. J'aurais dû piquer l'ensemble d'un cure-dent, mais je n'en avais pas. Faites attention à découper des tronçons très larges, ce sera d'autant plus facile à manger.

Si vous craignez d'avoir faim, ajoutez des blancs de poulet. Mais franchement, après mes deux wraps, je n'ai pas du tout eu faim!

En dessert, j'ai réalisé une compote de poire et pomme au micro-ondes du bureau. La marche à suivre est très simple: coupez les deux fruits en petits morceaux, placez un plat adapté au micro-ondes et faites chauffer pendant au moins douze minutes.

Et on termine en beauté avec un dahl express de lentilles corail, avec une bonne salade et du pain pita. Pour la recette, je me suis inspirée de celle-ci sur le blog Papilles et pupilles.

Épluchez et pressez (ou coupez le plus petit possible) une gousse d'ail, coupez l'oignon très finement. Dans une grande poêle, versez un peu d'huile d'olive, mettez l'ail, l'oignon, une cuillère à café de gingembre (frais ou en poudre), deux brins de thym. Après 5 minutes ajoutez le concentré de tomate, du piment (si vous aimez ça!) et une cuillère à café de garam massala, ce mélange d'épices indiennes que vous trouverez à côtés des currys.

Versez 140g de lentilles crues, ajoutez 450ml d'eau. Laissez mijoter une douzaine de minutes. Prévoyez un peu de coriandre fraîche à ciseler au-dessus.

En dessert, du fromage blanc et ce qu'il reste de fruit.

Right now there are more than a million Australians overseas. Their votes could be the crucial ones that decide the outcome of the postal survey.

This week we are reaching out across the world to all those Australians who are living, working and travelling in other countries. We are urging them to participate in the postal survey to help shape a fairer and more equal Australia.

When Ireland held its referendum back in 2015, we saw heart-warming scenes of people doing all that they could to make sure they made it home to vote and show their support for marriage equality. Trains were packed, ferries were full and airports were overflowing with people keen to cast their vote.

Australians who are living overseas do not have to go to the lengths Irish people living abroad did. It is easy to vote in the postal survey from wherever in the world you might be. Whether it's voting over the phone, online, or getting a friend or loved one to fill in the survey on your behalf, Aussies overseas can still have their say in ensuring the 'yes' vote gets over the line.

We are seeing many Australians who are living overseas sharing selfies as they post their 'yes' votes. From London to Los Angeles, Helsinki to Tokyo and beyond, it is apparent that being away from home is not going to stop people from stepping up and helping out when its needed most.

Do I want marriage equality in Australia? It's a YES from me! Posted my vote from Helsinki, Finland! @AMEqualitypic.twitter.com/2xngKP1U4E — Colin Allen (@WFDPresident) October 9, 2017

High-profile Australian celebrities have made it clear that they want to seize this opportunity to say 'yes' to love. Stars such as Hugh Sheridan, Daniel MacPherson and Luke Hemsworth have all said they're not letting distance stop them from voting and are urging others overseas to do the same while there is still time.

Stand up Australia. Time to lead and not follow. Progress not procrastination. Vote yes on marriage equality https://t.co/KXz1AtkBCu — Luke hemsworth (@Hemsdog) August 23, 2017

For some Australian expats, voting is a deeply personal matter. Joe Murphy, who married his husband Nick Smith in New York last year said:

""This survey allows us to vote YES to making the country we love a fairer and more equal place. We're going to make sure we vote and tell all our fellow expats to do the same.""

New York, 2016: Joe Murphy and Nick Smith on their wedding day.

Others are thinking of their friends or family back home when they cast their vote. Simon, who is currently living in Brighton in the UK, told us that he would love to see his gay friends have their relationships recognised as equal under Australian law.

""It was really important to me that I made sure that I supported my friends. I want to come home to an Australia that recognises their relationships. I did my vote online and it was really easy.""

The Australian Government has made provisions for Australians living, working, and travelling overseas to have multiple ways to participate. People who have an overseas postal address on the Electoral Roll should have been posted a letter containing their Secure Access Code. Australians overseas who haven't received their code can get one by calling +61 2 6252 5262 or on the ABS website.

Alternatively, Australians living or working overseas can ask a trusted person back in Australia to complete the survey on their behalf.

Spending time overseas is a rite of passage for many who call Australia home in their hearts. The good news is, there's no reason why being overseas will stop anyone from making Australia a fairer and more equal place. Just make sure to send through your 'yes' and to remind friends and family members who are abroad to return theirs as well.

This is history in the making, so don't let distance stop you from playing your part!","No Matter How Far Or How Wide You've Roamed, You Can Still Call For Equality At Home",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/alex-greenwich/no-matter-how-far-or-how-wide-youve-roamed-you-can-still-call-it-for-marriage-equality-back-home_a_23240719/

She added: “Right now, the residency rights of half a million children, including many who were born in the UK, are hanging in the balance.

“So there are reports of children being worried, feeling uncertain, even unsafe. Trying to make sense of their places in the world.

“The children’s commissioners for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already raised concerns that children’s interests are getting short shrift in the Brexit process.”

Clinton was recognised for her commitment to promoting the rights of families and children around the world, a cause shared by the university’s Observatory on the Human Rights of Children and Young People.

Some protesters gathered outside the campus ahead of her visit, the Press Association reported.

The university’s college of law was renamed The Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law and she was presented with a book about her Welsh roots.

The former first lady appeared to take a swipe at the Trump administration, accusing political leaders of “stoking divisions” and saying that “anger and resentment” were underpinning the national conversation.

“The bonds of community that once united us are fraying. Too much of the current discourse on both sides of the Atlantic is dominated by a zero-sum view of life, which argues that if someone else is gaining, I must be losing,” she said.

“The measure of any society is how we treat the most vulnerable among us, especially our children. And when we lose empathy, when it does become everyone for themselves, children are the first to suffer.

“Just look at my own country where currents of anger and resentment are underpinning our national conversation.

“Americans are divided and less trusting of democratic institutions. But instead of bringing people together we have leaders who stoke our divisions, try to distract us with controversy, after controversy, and undermine free speech and the press.

“It is nearly impossible for children’s voices to rise above the cacophony. And it is not coincidence that when politicians in Washington were arguing over protests at sporting events and cavalierly alluding to nuclear war, one of the first things to fall through the cracks was children’s healthcare.”

Clinton’s great-grandparents were from south Wales and emigrated to the US in search of a better life. Her ethnic breakdown has been calculated by genealogists as 31.2% Welsh in origin.

In her lecture, Clinton said: “As a child growing up Wales was a part of my wider understanding because it had special place in my heart due to my family’s connections to it.”",Hillary Clinton Makes Brexit Intervention Urging Clarity For Children Of EU Citizens In Britain,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/14/hillary-clinton-brexit-children-eu-citizens_n_18268710.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

It is often linked to superstition, denial or a combination of all three. Just the thought of death or dying can make someone feel awkward, uncomfortable and avoid a conversation altogether. It truly is something that most don't want to think about, let alone discuss openly. As a result, we often neglect to have important discussions with our loved ones that are necessary.

I recently participated in a roundtable discussion about death, dying and funerals (you can view the video here) and I was surprised at how reluctant we are to discuss this very important — and natural — topic with the ones we love. The women who participated are very open-minded and, as someone who is entrenched in end-of-life decisions every day, I was genuinely shocked that many hadn't yet considered what they would like for their own end-of-life celebration. None at the table had broached the topic with their spouses or parents.

When we're young, our parents have to have a lot of awkward and uncomfortable conversations with us – but they do it because they know it's important. We owe it to the ones we love to have an open and honest dialogue to get on the same page when it comes to death and dying. Having that conversation with your aging parents about their final wishes will be instrumental in easing the stress when they do eventually pass.

A survey found fewer than four in 10 (38 per cent) Canadians say they know every detail of their parents' funeral preferences. That leaves more than two-thirds in the dark about what their loved ones would like for their funeral.

Sometimes it's easier to talk about what you want to get others to open up about what they would like.

Here are some tips on how to start this — often daunting — conversation.

Start small

Maybe something happened recently — you went to a family member's funeral, someone recently fell ill or you were watching a movie that has a funeral scene. These moments could be great way to break through the stigma and begin a dialogue with your loved ones about death and your own wishes.

Sometimes it's easier to talk about what you want to get others to open up about what they would like. Starting small — talking about what to do in case of an emergency, such as sharing personal information like passwords and banking details — can be a great way start the discussion. Depending on your loved ones' openness to the topics, these are all good catalysts for starting the conversation.

It's important to keep in mind that many may not be as open to discussing these topics. Starting from a level that everyone is comfortable with will help keep the conversation going as you work on tackling larger conversations.

These small conversations will act as a blueprint for the larger topic of funeral planning and may spark your loved ones to begin thinking more deeply about their final wishes.

Don't rush it — but don't wait until it's too late, either

Finding the right time to discuss funeral planning with your loved ones is key. It should never be something you rush through and can be one of the most meaningful conversations you will have in your life.

For me, death is a natural part of life and the memory of our loved ones should be preserved and cherished. When I approached this subject with my parents I was surprised at how their wishes had evolved from a traditional service with burial to a memorial service with cremation. I was pleased they found value in ceremony and were willing to take my thoughts and my brother's into consideration.

Be purposeful in your commitment to get the conversation started. Preparing for the unexpected will leave you feeling comforted that everything will be taken care of.

We can all be more prepared if we are willing to take the first step.

Document the conversation

Keeping detailed notes on what your loved ones would like for their end of life is an important step. When these discussions take place, not everyone may be there. Keeping an account of their wishes ensures that everyone is in agreement when the time comes.

You should consider having these discussions with a funeral director to ensure there is a formal account of everyone's wishes. If the document isn't stored in a permanent place, having it in a dresser drawer when it's needed isn't helpful for anyone.

I have been in the death-care industry for 25 years and I feel blessed to have this knowledge. It's not that I am able to cope better with personal loss, but I am more prepared for what will transpire when it happens. We can all be more prepared if we are willing to take the first step and have that conversation.

Speaking a day after the Brexit talks were described as “deadlocked” by the EU’s chief negotiator, Jean-Claude Juncker accused the UK of being unwilling to compromise over the divorce bill.

Juncker insisted the British “have to pay” if they want talks to begin on a future trade deal between the UK and the EU.

In a debate at a university in his native Luxembourg, Juncker was brutally honest in his assessment of the Brexit talks.

He said: “The British are discovering, as we are, day after day new problems. That’s the reason why this process will take longer than initially thought.

“We cannot find for the time being a real compromise as far as the remaining financial commitments of the UK are concerned.

“As we are not able to do this we will not be able to say in the European Council in October that now we can move to the second phase of negotiations.

“They have to pay, they have to pay, not in an impossible way. I’m not in a revenge mood. I’m not hating the British. The Europeans have to be grateful for so many things Britain has brought to Europe before war, during war, after war. But now they have to pay.”

Juncker, who is well-known in Brussels circles for adopting a Nigel Farage-style approach to alcohol, used a metaphor about buying a round of drinks in a bar to explain the stalemate.

He said: “If you are sitting at a bar and ordering 28 beers and then suddenly some of your colleagues are leaving, it’s ok but they have to pay, they have to pay.”

The deadlock in the talks comes despite Theresa May promising to “honour commitments” to the EU budget made while the UK was a full member of the bloc.

In a speech in Florence last month, May said: “ I do not want our partners to fear that they will need to pay more or receive less over the remainder of the current budget plan as a result of our decision to leave.”

The Prime Minister also said the UK would “want to make an ongoing contribution” to any EU agencies and organisations the UK remained part of after Brexit – such as Europol.

Yet these promises were not enough to convince EU chief negotiation Michel Barnier to recommended “sufficient progress” has been made on phase one of the talks.

Speaking about the financial settlement at a press conference in Brussels alongside UK Brexit Secertary David Davis on Thursday, Barnier said: “On this question we have reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing for thousands of project promoters in Europe and it’s disturbing also for taxpayers.”

The negotiator said he expected the phase one talks – which also include discussions on citizens’ rights and Northern Ireland – to be concluded by December.",'Thanks For The War...Now Pay Up' Jean-Claude Juncker Tells The UK,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/13/jean-claude-juncker-brexit-war_n_18256046.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Deaths By Suicide May Be Falling, But We Must Realise That Every Single One Can Be Prevented It's wonderful news that suicide rates among adults have fallen in the UK and are at a six-year low.

Causes inconnues

Dans le cadre de Barkhane, une centaine de rotations d'avions ont lieu chaque année sur l'aéroport d'Abidjan. Il est fréquent que ces avions, souvent des Antonov, soient pilotés par des équipages de l'ancienne Union soviétique.

Il est aussi fréquent que des militaires français et des employés français d'entreprises sous-traitantes s'occupant de la cargaison soient à bord, a expliqué une source militaire française.

Un fort orage s'était abattu sur Abidjan samedi matin, mais pour le moment les causes de l'accident, qui s'est produit dans la phase d'atterrissage, sont inconnues.

En 2000, un Airbus A310 des Kenya Airways qui assurait la liaison Abidjan-Lagos-Nairobi, s'était écrasé en mer au décollage, à environ 1.500 mètres du rivage, faisant 169 morts et dix blessés.

Der Grund: Ein Blowjob-Hochzeitsfoto eines britischen Paares vor der Kirche

Hunderte Heiratswillige sind von dem Verbot betroffen

Hunderte Heiratswillige aus aller Welt lassen sich jedes Jahr in der St. Paul Kirche auf der griechischen Insel Rhodos trauen. Doch damit soll es nun vorbei sein.

Denn der Bischof von Rhodos hat nun nach Berichten von britischen Medien ausländischen Paaren verboten, an dem idyllischen Ort zu heiraten.

Schuld daran ist wohl ein Hochzeitsfoto, das ein Hochzeitspaar bei einem simulierten Blowjob zeigt - mit der berühmten Kirche im Hintergrund.

""Wir dürfen dieses widerliche Verhalten nicht dulden“

Ein Affront für die griechischen Kirchenoberen und die Gläubigen. Das Foto hatte das britische Paar nach der Hochzeit bei Facebook hochgeladen. Es zeigt den Bräutigam mit heruntergelassenen Hosen und hochgereckter Faust, während die Braut vor ihm kniet und einen Blowjob simuliert.

Auf Facebook zog das Foto die Aufmerksamkeit tausender Internet-Nutzer auf sich und gelangte auch in die griechischen Medien. Giorgos Eleftheriou, Präsident der Lindos Gemeinschaft auf Rhodos, sagte der britischen ""Times"": ""Wir sind Griechen und wir schätzen unsere Traditionen und die Heiligkeit unserer religiöser Stätten. Wir dürfen dieses widerliche Verhalten nicht dulden.“

Und er fügte hinzu: ""Schande über die Beiden, die diesen Schaden angerichtet haben.""

Böse Folgen für Heiratswillige und die Einwohner von Rhodos

Nun stehen hunderte Paare, die in den nächsten Jahren in der besagten Kirche heiraten wollen, vor einem großen Problem. Laut einem Bericht des ""Independent"" haben schon einige Betroffene die Hochzeit abgesagt und suchen nach Alternativen. Andere warten voller Angst auf die endgültige Entscheidung des Bürgermeisters von Rhodos, die in etwa einer Woche getroffen werden soll.

Das Verbot hat nicht nur Folgen für die Heiratswilligen, sondern auch für die Bewohner der griechischen Insel, deren Einkommen stark vom Tourismus abhängt.

Die Braut auf dem verhängnisvollen Foto sagte der ""DailyMail"" zu der von ihr und ihrem Mann ausgelösten Misere: ""Wir haben es doch nur als Witz gemeint.""

Sullo ius soli, il segretario accenna per un attimo ad un applauso, ma poi si mette subito a smanettare sullo smart phone.
I suoi spiegano che il segretario di ius soli parla nel suo libro.
E allora, se lo ius soli è il grande assente del discorso di Renzi, il solito tema della scissione colma i vuoti.
Il segretario Renzi recita una parte non sua: non è carico come alle sue Leopolde.","Nemmeno Walter Veltroni riesce a fargli cambiare idea. Lo ius soli è una battaglia sulla quale Matteo Renzi non mette la faccia. Piuttosto lascia la 'patata bollente' al premier Paolo Gentiloni, l'unico oggi all'Eliseo a rispondere all'appello diretto del fondatore del Pd: ""Vorrei che la legislatura si concludesse con l'approvazione dello ius soli. Paolo e Matteo fate ciò che è necessario"". Così lo ius soli diventa , per certi versi, l'ospite scomodo del decennale Pd all'Eliseo, festa già appannata dalle assenze: non c'è Romano Prodi, come si sapeva, ma manca all'appello anche Andrea Orlando e tutta la minoranza del Pd, non c'è Enrico Letta, non c'è Giorgio Napolitano, manca Rosi Bindi e i grandi sponsor Dem anche solo sul livello romano.

Gentiloni tira dritto: ""Speriamo di poter essere orgogliosi, è questo l'impegno del governo e mio personale, di poter dire che un altro diritto, il diritto dei bambini che frequentano la nostra scuola e che sono nei nostri quartieri e che giocano nelle squadre di calcio ma sono nati da genitori stranieri, possano avere diritto alla cittadinanza. Stiamo lavorando per approvare questa legge entro questa legislatura"". Applausi fragorosi, applaude anche Eugenio Scalfari, seduto in quarta fila con Luigi Zanda.

Qualora non si fosse capito prima, da oggi è chiaro: la battaglia per la nuova legge sulla cittadinanza è anche la battaglia di Gentiloni, premier fedele alla tradizione cattolica da cui proviene per cornice politica e familiare, discendente di Vincenzo Ottorino Gentiloni, padre di quel 'patto' che nel 1913 segnò l'ingresso ufficiale dei cattolici nell'attività politica del Regno d'Italia. Ecco: se in vista delle politiche 2018, lo ius soli scatena una guerra di posizionamenti nel Pd, il premier pure si schiera, sostenuto com'è da una parte del partito e da ministri come Graziano Delrio e Marco Minniti. Ha ceduto sulla fiducia al Rosatellum, in rispetto di Mattarella e Renzi . La cittadinanza e' invece parte delle sue convinzioni, della sua piattaforma - vuole riprendersi l'orgoglio, potremmo dire.

Quando Gentiloni parla, Renzi è seduto in prima fila accanto ai fedelissimi che non lo mollano un attimo: il tesoriere Dem Francesco Bonifazi e il sottosegretario alla Presidenza del Consiglio Maria Elena Boschi vestita in camicetta verde, pantaloni bianchi e scarpe rosse, stile patriottico bandiera Pd. Sullo ius soli, il segretario accenna per un attimo ad un applauso, ma poi si mette subito a smanettare sullo smart phone. Interviene quando finisce Gentiloni. E non coglie. Parla poco rispetto al suo solito, solo mezz'ora e in tono minore. Alcuni dei suoi fanno capire che non ci tenesse particolarmente a questo decennale: è stato più un regalo per Veltroni, per riconosce questa storia, per celebrarla.

Sia quel che sia, Renzi glissa sulla legge sulla cittadinanza, come del resto sta facendo in ogni occasione: dalla festa nazionale del Pd a Imola a fine settembre, fino a pochi giorni fa alla presentazione del libro di Piero Fassino 'Pd davvero' a Roma.

I suoi spiegano che il segretario di ius soli parla nel suo libro. E dunque considera l'argomento così esaurito. Ora lascia la materia al premier. Una formula che certo è più vicina alla posizione del sottosegretario Boschi - ""I numeri in aula non ci sono"" - piuttosto che al ministro Graziano Delrio, il quale invece per lo ius soli è in sciopero della fame a staffetta con altri parlamentari ed esponenti della società civile.

Ora: Gentiloni e Delrio, nonché una parte del Pd, lavorano per approvare lo ius soli modificato in Senato, con la fiducia, dopo la legge di stabilità, a fine novembre. Per poi fare l'ultimo passaggio alla Camera prima del voto e uscire da questa legislatura con una nuova legge sulla cittadinanza.

Renzi si ritrova a dover mediare tra Boschi e Delrio. E in più teme di pagar caro lo ius soli alle urne, un po' come successe a Ds e Margherita 10 anni fa con l'indulto approvato dal governo Prodi nel 2006. Non a caso proprio qui all'Eliseo il segretario esprime un nemmeno tanto velato timore che nemmeno l'amato Rosatellum possa bastare per vincere: ""Il nostro avversario è il centro-destra, che si chiami cinquestelle o Berlusconi-Salvini. Se passa come spero il Rosatellum, abbiamo di fronte a noi un corpo a corpo in tutti i collegi con un centrodestra populista..."". Insomma, sullo ius soli dal Nazareno non arriverà quella spinta che poi alla fine serve per mettere le leggi in pista in Parlamento e portarle all'approvazione.

E allora, se lo ius soli è il grande assente del discorso di Renzi, il solito tema della scissione colma i vuoti. ""C'è un lavoro per tenere insieme i pezzi, altrove c'è chi ha lavorato per distruggere anteponendo il proprio destino personale, questo partito appartiene al popolo, chi se ne va, tradisce se stesso. Senza il Pd la sinistra italiana sarebbe stata irrilevante come in Spagna, in Germania, Francia, Olanda e Gran Bretagna"". Applausi.

La mattinata Dem all'Eliseo dura poco più di due ore. Come succede nelle feste poco convinte, non ci si dilunga. Si sbriga giusto il dovuto sul palco. Il fondatore Veltroni srotola un denso e acclamato storytelling Pd. Il premier in carica Gentiloni svolge la parte pragmatica fino a osare sullo ius soli. Il segretario Renzi recita una parte non sua: non è carico come alle sue Leopolde. Un urlo iniziale , e applaudito, dalla platea, ""Aridatece Walter"", era un saluto a Veltroni, ma dava anche il forte sensos di una nostalgia.

Finisce tutto poco dopo mezzogiorno. Il teatro dentro è pieno, ma l'Eliseo ha spesso provato l'overbooking in altre iniziative di centrosinistra in passato. Altri tempi. Fuori, c'è chi come Cesare Damiano arriva solo alla fine: ""Non mi sono sforzato per esserci, non so cosa ci sia da celebrare..."". Franco Marini invece c'era e cerca di buttare acqua sul fuoco mettendosi a parlare di legge elettorale: ""Si doveva fare, è un meno peggio, andava fatta"". Damiano: ""Il problema non è la legge elettorale, Franco. Ma il partito..."".

Facce preoccupate alla ricerca di un affaccio sul futuro. ""Finale di partita"", recita il cartellone dell'Eliseo in questi giorni. È solo Beckett, ma sembra un commento. La festa è cascata in pieno finale di legislatura con tutto il clima di sospensione che ne consegue: tra ministri scaduti e posizionamenti politici in vista del voto.","Lo ius soli si imbuca alla festa del Pd: Veltroni lancia l'appello, Gentiloni ne fa un impegno di governo, Renzi non coglie",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/10/14/lo-ius-soli-si-imbuca-alla-festa-del-pd-veltroni-lancia-lappello-gentiloni-ne-fa-un-impegno-di-governo-renzi-non-coglie_a_23243285/?utm_hp_ref=it-homepage

The revelations are distressing enough for most readers, but particularly survivors of rape, sexual assault and abuse for whom the reports may be triggering.

Meena Kumari, National Lead for Domestic Violence and Abuse at independent charity Victim Support said the trauma may be “exacerbated when the event or a similar incident are elaborately reported in the media, forcing survivors to relive that experience and past trauma”.

“Sexual violence is a traumatic experience and those who are subjected to it can experience post-traumatic stress symptoms in the same way that those who’ve survived other kinds of trauma might,” a spokesperson for Rape Crisis told HuffPost UK.

Approximately 85,000 women and 12,000 men are raped in England and Wales alone every year, and nearly half a million adults are sexually assaulted.

Not only could certain details cause flashbacks for these individuals, but he manner of reporting can have a lasting impact.

The Rape Crisis spokesperson said: “The way stories like this are reported can sometimes implicitly or less so imply that the victim or survivor was someone partly responsible for the violence perpetrated against them.

“This victim-blaming can add to their own sense of self-blame, shame or guilt, for not being able to prevent or fend off the attack or abuse, for example.”

Caitlin Roper, founder of Collective Shout, a grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification and sexualisation of women, said that revelations such as this can be “devastating” for onlookers with histories of rape and sexual assault.

“It is a painful reminder of how our society regards women who come forward and speak honestly about what has been done to them, and a preview of the treatment they can expect should they speak out themselves.”

However, she believes that the impact of seeing so many women having the bravery to come forward and tell their stories can have a positive impact.

“It can be very validating for survivors to know that other women, perhaps even women they respect, have been through similar experiences and found the strength to overcome them,” she said. “It can be healing to see this abusive treatment of women being widely condemned as wrong and unacceptable.”

It’s important for survivors to safeguard themselves by regularly checking in with how they’re feeling.

Kumari said: “Our advice to anyone who has experienced a sexual assault or for anyone supporting someone through this would be to seek help early on. Early intervention to treat initial signs of stress and trauma can prevent the onset of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).”

Victim Support provided a list of the many potential symptoms associated with trauma:

· Emotional experiences such as shock and numbness, fear and anxiety, helplessness, irritability, lack of confidence, low self-esteem, fear of a similar incident occurring again and also guilt

· Some symptoms may affect people socially such as becoming withdrawn, conflict within relationships and avoidance

· Psychological experiences such as distressing thoughts and images, impaired memory and concentration, disorientation and hypervigilance are common

· There are also physical effects which can range from poor sleep, headaches, insomnia, a lack of appetite and low energy levels

It isn’t just survivors who might be able to spot they aren’t coping with the news cycle, friends and family can also play a crucial role.

Rape Crisis spokesperson advised: “The most important thing is to listen and be patient, allowing them to talk in their own time and not pressuring them into one course of action or another, even if you think something, like therapy or reporting to the police for example, is for their own good or is what you would do in their situation.”

According to Damian McClelland, Bupa UK’s musculoskeletal services clinical director, if you want to ease back pain, you should stop slumping over your phone or tablet in bed.

”When we lie or sit in bed to watch TV, or check emails on our phones or tablets, we tend to slouch and look downwards which isn’t good for our posture,” he exclusively told HuffPost UK.

“This usually means we’re not supporting our spine or head (generally the heaviest part of our body) properly. This puts a lot of strain on the muscles and joints in the neck.”

McClelland said the risk to back damage increases further if you’re watching content on a phone or tablet when it’s plugged in, because “you’re at the whim of a tiny wire”.

“If you find you often have to change position because you get pins and needles or a dead leg, or you’re just plain uncomfortable, that’s your body reminding you that you’re not in a good position,” he added.

“Not only is this painful at the time, but poor posture can have long term implications on your health, potentially leading to long term lower back, shoulder and neck pain affecting your work and social life.”

He stressed that if you do not change your habits, the effects of poor posture can lead to serious chronic pain. But the good news is McClelland doesn’t believe you need to ban Netflix from your bedroom completely.

He gave the following tips for using your phone, tablet or TV in bed:

1. Support your head. Sit upright with pillows behind you, or if you’re lying down ensure you have enough pillows to take your weight.

2. Avoid twisting your body. Keep your back straight with pillow support behind you if you’re on your side. Engage your core to keep your posture straight.

3. Keep your shoulders back and down if you’re sitting upright, not rounded or hunched. Don’t slouch to look at the screen, it should be at eye level like it should be when you’re at a desk.

4. Add some stretches to your Netflix routine. Put your hands above your head, reach up and at the same time stretch your feet down for a nice full body stretch. Also put your hands in the small of your back and push your chest out for a good lower back stretch.

5. Try to charge up your tablet or phone before using it, so you don’t end up spooning the plug socket.

6. Limit your phone or laptop use in bed. Definitely don’t do it just before bed, as it could interfere with your sleep cycle.

Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, a cabinet minister in Uttar Pradesh, has said that the Taj Mahal was ""rightly kept out"" of the tourism booklet recently released the Yogi Adityanath government, and the 17th century monument ""should instead be replaced with the Guru Gorakhnath peeth.""

Speaking on the controversial omission, Chaudhary said that the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Uttar Pradesh was ""rashtravadi (nationalist)"" and runs on ""dharm niti (religious policy).""

The Times of India reported today that Chaudhary, who is in charge of culture, religious affairs and minority welfare, shared his views on the Taj Mahal at an event organized by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in Hathras.

""Taj Mahal is not the symbol of any religion and (it is) nobody's. It does not represent any religion,"" he said. ""On the other hand, Gorakhnath peeth represents people's faith.""

TOI further reported that when it was pointed out that the Taj Mahal was a UNESCO heritage site, Chaudhary said, ""Those who included the monument in that list must have been of a similar taste (mizaz) as those who built it.""

In September, the UP government released a booklet entitled ""Uttar Pradesh Tourism: Its High Potential,"" which did not mention the world famous monument.

In the face of intense criticism, the UP government said that the booklet was not brochure of all the tourist attractions in UP, but a compilation of the UP government's ongoing and future projects in the tourism sector.

""The government, with the help of the World Bank has proposed projects worth Rs 370 crore, of which projects worth Rs 156 crore are meant for development of the Taj Mahal and Taj Mahal region,"" the UP Information Department said in a press release.

Tourism Minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former Congress Party leader who joined the BJP ahead of the Assembly election, said, ""How can anyone in the tourism sector ignore the Taj Mahal, one of the big tourist attractions in the country?""

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, however, is not a fan of the 17th century marble mausoleum made by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, known the world over as the ""monument of love.""

In June, Adityanath said that the Taj Mahal did not reflect Indian culture. ""Foreign dignitaries visiting the country used to be gifted replicas of the Taj Mahal and other minarets which did not reflect Indian culture,"" he said.

In August, the Modi government at the Centre approved the Adityanath government's proposal to rename the Mughalsarai railway station in Uttar Pradesh after the Bharatiya Jana Sangh leader Pandit Deendayal Upadhayay, who also served the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the BJP.

She said she was motivated to go public with her story following the New York Times' investigation that outed Harvey Weinstein's decades of sexual harassment and assault.

Schuhmacher's story caught the attention of interim Saskatchewan NDP leader Nicole Sarauer, who spoke with reporters Thursday about the allegations.

""I think it's fair to say that mistakes were made in terms of our screening of candidates last election,"" Sarauer said. An internal review is ongoing into who knew what and when, she said, noting that she was made aware of the alleged incident ""weeks"" ago.

Interim Saskatchewan NDP leader Nicole Sarauer speaks in the province's legislative assembly in the screengrab uploaded on June 30, 2016.

The interim leader also confirmed that an independent probe, spearheaded by the party's anti-harassment committee, is underway. It's unclear when its report will be ready.

""We believe survivors. I believe survivors,"" she said, adding, ""This is a systemic issue. As a province, we have the second highest rates of sexual assault amongst provinces in Canada. This is a big issue.""

An official sexual assault complaint was filed last month; both the Crown and Saskatoon police's sex crime unit are now investigating the case.

The spectrum starting with the objectification of women, to sexual harassment, to sexual assault have to be taken seriously and cannot be tolerated in our movement. Niki Ashton

NDP MP Niki Ashton shared Schuhmacher's story to her Facebook page, saying, ""I stand with Rylee.""

Ashton wrote that the article had shaken her up.

""The spectrum starting with the objectification of women, to sexual harassment, to sexual assault have to be taken seriously and cannot be tolerated in our movement,"" Ashton said in her post.

Though their words were of some comfort, Schuhmacher said that it's easy for politicians to say they believe survivors of sexual harassment and assault.

""I have no doubt in my mind that Nicole Sarauer does believe survivors or that Niki Ashton stands with me or that the other people who have talked to me do support me, but I guess that really needs to be backed up by action,"" she said.

The accused in Schuhmacher's claims made headlines last year for a series of old Facebook posts, including one where he described a school campus as ""rape-friendly."" He was an NDP candidate vying for a provincial seat at the time.

His apology to then-Saskatchewan NDP leader Cam Broten was accepted by the party. The party dropped four other candidates over three days for inappropriate social media posts, including one for commenting that ""Brad Wall's mother should have taken the abortion pill."" But the accused was permitted to continue his campaign for public office.

""He made rape jokes on the internet. And that, like, should have been enough to turf him as a candidate in 2016,"" Schuhmacher said. ""The party just turned a blind eye to it ... I want to be able to feel safe and supported within my own party.""

The accused did not respond to HuffPost Canada's interview request.

Schuhmacher said she lost hope in the justice system after giving a video statement to the sex crimes unit of the Saskatoon police.

She wrote about the experience in a Facebook post on Sept. 21:

She asked me every victim blaming question in the book. ""Well, why did you have him in your house?"", ""it seems like the making out was consensual, wasn't it?"" ""Why didn't you say no earlier?"" and finally told me ""it'd be impossible to prove,"" and apparently my rape kit ""meant nothing"" because I also made the comment, off hand, that my rapist had a big dick.

Then the Weinsten story broke. In the shadow of how a man abused his power to freely harass women, there again grew a safe space to talk about their experiences, similar to what followed in the wake of damning revelations made about Bill Cosby, Jian Ghomeshi, and former senator Don Meredith. That's when the university student decided to go public with her own story.

""People knew that Harvey was harassing women. That he was doing all sorts of just awful uncomfortable things and wielding his power over women. And people were silent. There are so many men out there who harass women, who get away with it because people stay silent,"" she said.

""I just was tired with that.""

Some protesters gathered outside the campus ahead of her visit, the Press Association reported.

The university’s college of law was renamed The Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law and she was presented with a book about her Welsh roots.

The former first lady appeared to take a swipe at the Trump administration, accusing political leaders of “stoking divisions” and saying that “anger and resentment” were underpinning the national conversation.

“The bonds of community that once united us are fraying. Too much of the current discourse on both sides of the Atlantic is dominated by a zero-sum view of life, which argues that if someone else is gaining, I must be losing,” she said.

“The measure of any society is how we treat the most vulnerable among us, especially our children. And when we lose empathy, when it does become everyone for themselves, children are the first to suffer.

“Just look at my own country where currents of anger and resentment are underpinning our national conversation.

“Americans are divided and less trusting of democratic institutions. But instead of bringing people together we have leaders who stoke our divisions, try to distract us with controversy, after controversy, and undermine free speech and the press.

“It is nearly impossible for children’s voices to rise above the cacophony. And it is not coincidence that when politicians in Washington were arguing over protests at sporting events and cavalierly alluding to nuclear war, one of the first things to fall through the cracks was children’s healthcare.”

Clinton’s great-grandparents were from south Wales and emigrated to the US in search of a better life. Her ethnic breakdown has been calculated by genealogists as 31.2% Welsh in origin.

In her lecture, Clinton said: “As a child growing up Wales was a part of my wider understanding because it had special place in my heart due to my family’s connections to it.”",Hillary Clinton Makes Brexit Intervention Urging Clarity For Children Of EU Citizens In Britain,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/14/hillary-clinton-brexit-children-eu-citizens_n_18268710.html

She admits she was wrong: “It turns out nobody is ready to hear an apology when a shocking story comes out.”

Bloom believes that Weinstein was “genuinely contrite and wanted to change,” but accepts that others didn’t think he was sincere.

“People were so shocked by the allegations that the felt the apology was hollow, that he had to say that,” she said. “He didn’t have to.

Making paid parental leave available when stillbirth occurs during the pregnancy is essential, regardless of whether the employee has already started their parental leave.
Such a change would also bring employer funded paid parental leave schemes in line with the Federal Government's Paid Parental Leave Act of 2010.","Stillbirth is one of the most traumatic events that a parent can face. Unfortunately, it is an event that is far too common, with six babies a day being stillborn in Australia. Yet despite its relatively common occurrence, too many employer parental leave policies are not clear about what support is offered to the parents of a stillborn child.

Today is International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day and we are calling on all business leaders to join us in committing to ensuring parents are covered by paid parental leave in the event that they lose a child.

Corporate parental policies need to be reviewed to ensure that a company extends paid parental leave in the case of stillbirth for the following reasons:

It removes additional financial pressure from the family during an already traumatic period as they would have anticipated having paid leave had it been a live birth.

Accessing paid parental leave recognises the birth of a child and the role of the parents.

It allows time for the female employee to physically and emotionally recover from the experience of birth.

A company would (or at least should) have already factored in the cost of parental leave for a live birth, so it does not effectively add to the company's costs.

The employee would not be fully effective if she had to return to work for financial reasons (a Stillbirth Foundation/PwC study into the economic cost of stillbirth indicates that productivity after a stillbirth is only at 26 percent after 30 days).

It is simply the right thing to do.

Today, we are asking business leaders to make the following commitment: To review company parental leave policy to ensure that employer funded paid parental leave is available in the circumstance of stillbirth.

Company policies should adopt the Australian definition of stillbirth, which is defined as the death of a baby before or during birth, from the 20th week of pregnancy onwards -- or 400 grams or more birth weight.

Making paid parental leave available when stillbirth occurs during the pregnancy is essential, regardless of whether the employee has already started their parental leave. After all, a parent is legally required to register the birth of a stillborn baby and yet also has to contend with organising a funeral for their own child, a burden that no parent should face. Access to paid parental leave is a way for a company to acknowledge their employee's loss, be it at 20-weeks gestation, full term of pregnancy or after birth.

Enshrining access to paid parental leave in the case of stillbirth into an employer's policy is key rather than relying on the discretion of managerial staff dealing with such a complex emotional issue. Given that paid parental leave is often cast as solely about caring for a baby, some managers might interpret paid leave not applying in the case of stillbirth, despite the best intentions of the employer. Having it clear in policy removes any doubt and sends a message that an employer recognises stillbirth as a social issue.

Such a change would also bring employer funded paid parental leave schemes in line with the Federal Government's Paid Parental Leave Act of 2010. Section 31(3) of this Act makes explicit that a person is eligible for the government funded paid parental leave scheme if they were to be the primary carer of the stillborn child.

Each of us in different ways has been touched by stillbirth. We are proud to support organisations like the Stillbirth Foundation, which invests in invaluable research into the causes of stillbirth and supports initiatives that will hopefully reduce the incidence of stillbirth. We are united in our view that it is critical to have policy initiatives such as this one to support parents facing one of life's most traumatic events.

The allegations came to light on Friday in a report for Science magazine.

According to Science, Jane Willenbring and Deborah Doe are speaking out because they no longer fear retribution.

Willenbring, who is now 40 years old and a tenured associate professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, part of the University of California, San Diego, alleges in the complaint to the university that during a 1999 field visit to Beacon Valley, Marchant repeatedly harassed her. He reportedly encouraged her to sleep with his brother, who was also on the expedition; called her a “slut” and a “liar”; and greeted her every morning by saying, “Today I’m going to make you cry.”

“Most days, I would listen to long discussions about how I was a ‘slut’ or a ‘whore,’” Willenbring wrote in the report.

Marchant also allegedly threw rocks at her whenever she urinated, so she would go days without drinking water, later developing a urinary tract infection. Toward the end of the trip he also is alleged to have repeatedly pushed her down an icy slope because she hadn’t cried that day.

Most days, I would listen to long discussions about how I was a 'slut' or a 'whore.' Jane Willenbring

Doe, who opted to remain anonymous, reports that she too was victim to Marchant’s harassment in the late 1990s, also on a trek to Antarctica.

She’d initially written a letter of support for Willenbring, but turned that letter into her own formal complaint. “He repeatedly called me a ‘c**t,’ among many other insults ... (bitch being the most common) that were invoked on a daily basis or more ... He would crow that he could say absolutely anything he wanted to because we were ‘in his domain,’” she said, according to Science. Doe also alleges that he threatened to ensure she never got funding if she were to finish her doctorate.

“I distinctly remember standing there, aghast, in my red down jacket and black wind pants, watching my career and life plans dissolve as Dr. Marchant smiled triumphantly at me,” she said.

Hillary Tulley, a high school teacher from Illinois who witnessed Marchant’s behavior during a National Science Foundation-funded program called Teachers Experiencing Antarctica, wrote a letter supporting Willenbring and Doe in which she detailed her own experiences with Marchant.

Marchant apparently refused to take Tulley, who was the only woman on that particular expedition, seriously.

“Talk during [group] meals ... always included relentless, snickering mentions of my advanced age (I was 43), my small breasts, and other failings, always initiated by Marchant,” she wrote. “All my attempts to steer the conversation to science were shut down.”

Letters of support for both Marchant and his accusers have poured in. One of Marchant’s former graduate students who had also traveled with him to Antarctica denies that the allegations align with his character.

“I ... sincere[ly] support ... him as an upstanding and professional individual,” the student wrote in an official letter of support.

But another former graduate student, Adam Lewis, wrote that not standing up for both Willenbring and Tulley is “one of the only real regrets I have in my whole life.” He had witnessed both of them being harassed on their separate expeditions.

“I had the chance to stand up for people,” he wrote. “And I didn’t.”

Sexual harassment is a pervasive issue in academia, with multiple universities like USC and UC Berkeley having settled complaints this year. A 2014 report also showed that scientific research field studies are particularly ripe for harassment ― PLOS ONE, a scientific research journal, conducted a survey that showed 64 percent of respondents had personally experienced sexual harassment while doing field work, and the majority of those people were trainees at the time.

A Letter To Anyone Who's Ever Felt Bad About How They Look Is it any wonder that the result, the final cut that we see shows an image of someone who looks as good as perfect? Why then should we allow this to undermine our confidence? Imagine how you would look after such a regimen - and I hope you remember that next time you see a picture of a model in a magazine.

How To Apply False Eyelashes Without Destroying Your Real Ones Let's start with strip lashes. When you're just learning to apply them, look for a lash that has a very flexible band. Because of the way each lash is attached to the band, lashes that are more dense generally have a less flexible band than more natural density (less full) lashes.

CINÉMA - Si vous êtes actuellement au Japon, vous avez de fortes chances de trouver des petits bâtonnets au fromage à l'emballage unique en son genre. Un emballage avec Nicolas Cage en égérie.

À l'origine de cette alliance totalement insolite, la promotion du film ""Army of One"" réalisé par Larry Charles. Mais il y a un hic. Selon The Wrap, le principal intéressé n'était pas au courant.

Japan has a Nicolas Cage snack food called 'Nicolastick' https://t.co/opcercum4O — Boing Boing (@BoingBoing) 8 octobre 2017

Un gros malentendu

En 2016, Nicolas Cage incarnait au cinéma Gary Faulkner -qui a réellement existé-, un quinquagénaire américain parti seul à la recherche d'Oussama Ben Laden. Sorti il y a maintenant plus d'un an outre-Atlantique, le film ne fait son arrivée dans les salles japonaises que ce vendredi 13 octobre.

Soucieux de trouver un moyen original de promouvoir ""Army of One"" au Japon, FilmNation International pensait avoir trouvé une bonne idée: afficher le visage de Nicolas Cage sur l'emballage de ces snacks dont tout le monde raffole au Japon.

Mais FilmNation International a oublié de prévenir l'acteur. Nicolas Cage n'a jamais autorisé à ce que son visage soit utilisé dans de telles circonstances.

Dans un communiqué de presse, FilmNation International a annoncé ce vendredi 13 octobre que:

""Monsieur Cage n'avait aucune connaissance préalable du fait que le produit était en train d'être créé. Par ailleurs, il n'a jamais accordé la permission d'utiliser sa ressemblance de cette façon. Les bâtonnets ont été créés pour la sortie japonaise de ""My Target, Ben Laden"" -sorti sous le nom d'Army of One aux États-Unis-. Ils étaient limités en nombre et purement destinés à être des articles promotionnels qui seraient fournis à ceux qui avaient acheté leur ticket pour voir le film.

Nicolas Cage n'a pas réagi publiquement à cette erreur. FilmNation International conclut son communiqué par des excuses adressées à l'acteur hollywoodien:

""Toutes les personnes responsables de la création et de l'annonce de ce produit promotionnel présentent leurs excuses sincères. Nous nous excusons d'avoir représenté Monsieur Cage de cette manière ainsi que pour tout préjudice qui aurait été causé, à lui, ainsi qu'à son image.""

Natasha Wallace, who attends Santa Rosa Junior College, told news station KTXL that she was on her way home from studying across town at around 2 a.m. when she saw the flames in the distance and realized she and her pit bull, Bentley, needed to get out.

The pair quickly got stuck in traffic in Wallace’s car. Fearing they’d be trapped in harm’s way, she ran home and retrieved her bike — a mode of transportation that makes bringing along a 70-pound dog a lot more difficult.

Quick-thinking Wallace also got a duffel bag and, fortunately for both her and the dog, Bentley was compliant with her request that he get in.

“I grabbed my dog and I told him, ‘Hey man, this is serious, you need to just sit in the bag.’ ... And he, he hopped right in,” she told KTXL in the video above.

Wallace biked a few miles away from the traffic jam with the large canine slung across her back, when a man named Paul Johnson pulled his truck over and gave both of them a ride to safety.

Wallace’s story is the second dramatic bike escape widely reported in the wake of the fires. Multiple media outlets wrote earlier this week about Charity Ruiz, a pregnant woman fleeing Santa Rosa on Monday who also wound up stuck in traffic and fled on a bike, KPIX 5 reported.

Ruiz, who was scheduled to deliver her baby next week, biked away towing her two daughters in a small, attachable bicycle trailer. They also were ultimately picked up by a kind stranger who drove them to a friend’s home.

Both Wallace and Ruiz have set up GoFundMe accounts to help them recover from losing their homes. You can read more about how to help other victims of the fires here.

The multiple wildfires that raged across Northern California this week are the deadliest in the state’s recorded history, with at least 32 people confirmed dead as of Friday. Hundreds of people remain missing, and rescue workers continue to search the charred rubble for bodies.

Officials assessing damage estimated on Friday that 5,700 structures had been destroyed across the state. In Santa Rosa alone, where Wallace and Ruiz lived, nearly 3,000 homes were lost.

POLITIQUE - ""Je n'accepte pas que des gens salissent mon honneur comme ils l'ont fait"". Invité de l'émission ""24h Pujadas"" sur LCI jeudi 12 octobre, Alexis Corbière n'a pas caché son énervement concernant la polémique sur le logement social qu'il occupe depuis plusieurs années à Paris.

Depuis plusieurs semaines, Alexis Corbière et Raquel Garrido sont la cible des critiques à cause du HLM qu'ils occupent depuis maintenant 6 ans, dans le 12e arrondissement de Paris. Alors sur LCI, Alexis Corbière a tenu à mettre les choses au point, réfutant les accusations selon lesquelles le couple ""refusait"" de quitter le logement.

""Je ne refuse rien, je suis en train de partir, je l'ai expliqué. En l'espace de trois-quatre mois, partir avec une famille de 5 enfants, c'est quand même un délai tout à fait raisonnable. Je suis entrain de me porter acquéreur"", a-t-il affirmé, précisant qu'il avait trouvé un bien dans sa circonscription de Seine-Saint-Denis.

Le député a rappelé qu'il occupait légalement l'appartement, et dénoncé ""une provocation indécente organisée contre la France Insoumise"". ""C'est une chasse qui est menée. Ce n'est pas moi qui suis visé, c'est La France insoumise, pour nous salir et j'en assez. Je le dis parce que je suis un homme d'honneur"", a fustigé le député.

""Depuis le mois de juin, j'ai dit que je partais, je me suis mis en situation pour partir"", a-t-il affirmé, précisant qu'il avait déjà fait de part de ses intentions au journaliste qui l'avait interrogé sur son logement, et accusant ce dernier d'avoir volontairement mis l'accent sur l'aspect polémique: ""Je l'ai dit au journaliste qui a lancé cette polémique mais ça ne l'intéressait pas et ce qui l'intéressait, c'était de lancer une attaque assez blessante contre moi.""

Une information qu'a démentie Buzzfeed, à l'origine de l'article en question: ""Au cours de la vingtaine de minutes que nous avons passé au téléphone avec lui, le député ne nous a pas dit qu'il était en train d'acquérir un appartement. Il a préféré s'énerver, nous attaquer, nous accuser d'écrire un «article commandé» et deviser sur les 'dirigeants de grands médias' qui vivent dans des HLM. Et c'est à la fin seulement qu'il a fini par préciser «qu'il était en train de chercher un logement», ce que nous avons écrit au début de notre article"", affirme Buzzfeed, qui a publié l'intégralité de l'interview d'Alexis Corbière, après son passage sur LCI.

Alors que de nombreuses voix s'élèvent dans l'opposition pour critiquer la position du député FI, accusé de prôner ""l'exemplarité politique"" dans son parti, sans s""y conformer lui-même, Alexis Corbière s'est défendu: ""Je suis exemplaire, David Pujadas"", a-t-il tonné.

In fact, the study found that straight men find relationships with their male friends more emotionally satisfying than the bonds they have with their girlfriends.

In light of the research, articles have appeared online stating that the modern day ‘bromance’ is threatening heterosexual partnerships, but this just isn’t the case.

Mental health campaigners have called the reports “misleading”, telling HuffPost UK encouraging male friendship is key to improving the population’s mental health and reducing suicide rates.

What’s more, relationship experts believe women should be encouraging their partners to develop close friendships, on the grounds that this could improve their own romantic relationship.

The study, published in the journal Men and Masculinities, found that “the increasingly intimate, emotive, and trusting nature of bromances offers young men a new social space for emotional disclosure, outside of traditional heterosexual relationships”.

“Our participants mostly determined that a bromance offered them elevated emotional stability, enhanced emotional disclosure, social fulfilment, and better conflict resolution, compared to the emotional lives they shared with girlfriends,” the researchers said.

In light of the study, some news outlets claimed bromances are “threatening” heterosexual relationships, but James Scroggs, chair of male suicide prevention charity CALM said “it can be misleading to start pitting bromance against romance”.

Suicide remains the largest killer of men under the age of 45 in the UK and men are three times more likely to die from suicide than women. However, the latest statistics suggest suicide rates are falling and this is likely linked to the fact that we’re becoming more open with one another about mental health and suicide.

“At CALM, we work to prevent male suicide by challenging a damaging and outdated culture that prevents men from opening up and seeking help when they need it,” Scroggs told HuffPost UK.

“Whilst we note that the bromance research was conducted with a small number of participants and focused on men at university only, it does speak to the growing number of men who feel comfortable opening up to their friends.”

He also pointed out that CALM’s previous research, published with HuffPost UK in 2016, also showed that men are starting to talk to their partner or family about their feelings.

“It is clear there is a steady and positive shift in people’s attitudes and behaviours which enable men to open up, not bottle up their emotion, and therefore avoid reaching crisis point,” he said.

Cal Strode, a spokesperson for the Mental Health Foundation, agreed that strong male friendships should be portrayed as a positive thing.

“From our research we know that 28% of men living with a mental health problem had never sought medical help, compared to 19% of women. Men are also much less likely to talk openly with their friends about mental health problems,” he told HuffPost UK.

“Men often feel isolated and unable to tell people how they are feeling – a culture of men shouldering pain alone has developed...we have a duty to question our culture and push for change.”

He added that there’s a danger we can confuse being surrounded by a big group of people with friends “that we can count on when we’re really not doing okay”.

“Men having more friendships where they feel able to speak openly about their emotions and mental health can only be a good thing,” he said.

Instead of pitting friendships against romantic relationships, Relate counsellor, Gurpreet Singh said we should invest in both in order to improve our wellbeing.

“Friendships will often bring out a different side to us than a romantic relationship. Sometimes for example, there’s an element of camaraderie that’s more common in friendships,” he told HuffPost UK.

“We’ll also be friends with different people for different reasons, because they represent different parts of us. You can be friends with your partner but a ‘couple relationship’ is also about meeting one another’s romantic and sexual needs, sharing your life together and perhaps starting a family together.

“Spending time with friends, doing things that our partners may not necessarily enjoy, gives us an opportunity to pursue our separate interests and also creates a healthy breathing space in the relationship.”

He pointed out that previous research by Relate found one in eight people in the UK say they have no close friends, so “it’s good that more men now feel able to confide in one another”.

“However, if you’re also in a couple relationship, it’s important to maintain a balance and not neglect your partner in favour of your friendships and vice versa,” he said.

Also commenting on the study, Kate Leaver, author of The Friendship Cure (out March 2018 in the UK), told HuffPost UK bromances can not only improve mental health, but release some of the strain on romantic relationships.

“In modern times, we place a dangerous level of expectation on our romantic partners and have a concerning fixation on romantic love as the most important form of love,” she said.

“The more we can move away from that and distribute our emotional needs and resources across multiple relationships - bromances, female friendships - the better. For the sustainability and stability of our romantic relationships, for our mental health, for our constant development as people.”

She added that she strongly believes people should retain their own independent friendships when they get into a relationship.

“Research shows that on average we lose three friendships when we enter a serious monogamous relationship and I’d like to see us deliberately change that stat,” she said.

“We should really be diversifying our emotional investment as much as possible, including our chosen love person and the friends who lift us up and make life better.”","'Bromances' Aren't Ruining Romantic Relationships, They're Saving Men's Lives",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/13/bromances-arent-ruining-romantic-relationships-theyre-saving-mens-lives_n_18257432.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Das sogenannte Fuel Dumping ist in Notfällen erlaubt

Die Folgen des Fuel Dumpings sind umstritten

Ein Flugzeug hat vergangene Woche etwa 40 Tonnen Kerosin über Rheinland-Pfalz abgelassen. Das bestätigte die Deutsche Flugsicherung am Freitag, wie ""Focus Online"" berichtet.

Der Airbus von Lufthansa sollte vergangenen Dienstag von Frankfurt nach Houston im US-Bundesstaat Texas fliegen. Doch der Airbus A380 musste nach dem Start wieder zum Flughafen zurückkehren, weil es offenbar Probleme am Fahrwerk gab.

Das Flugpersonal ließ daraufhin das Kerosin ab, um sicher landen zu können.

Fuel Dumping ist in Notfällen erlaubt

Durch diese Maßnahme verliert das Flugzeug an Gewicht - denn wenn es zu schwer für die Landung ist, könnte das Fahrwerk zu stark belastet werden und die Passagiere in Gefahr bringen. Aus diesem Grund ist das sogenannten Fuel Dumping in solchen Notfällen erlaubt.

Schon im Mai hat ein Passagierflugzeug 54 Tonnen Kerosin über der Westpfalz abgelassen, weil es wegen technischer Probleme wieder zum Startflughafen zurückkehren und für die Landung Gewicht verlieren musste.

Das Sprit abgelassen werde, komme in Deutschland pro Jahr nur 20 bis 30 Mal vor - bei insgesamt drei Millionen Flugbewegungen, sagte eine Sprecherin der Deutschen Flugsicherung ""Focus Online"". Das geschehe nur in Fällen, in denen ansonsten eine große Gefahr für das Leben der Reisenden bestünde.

""Es geht hier um Menschenleben. Deshalb müssen wir den Piloten die Möglichkeit geben, über möglichst unbesiedelten Gebieten ihre Runden zu drehen, um entsprechend Treibstoff abzulassen"", sagte die Sprecherin.

Der Pilot darf nicht selbst entscheiden

Der Pilot könne dies auch nicht selbst entscheiden, sondern müsse auf Geheiß der Lotsen über möglichst unbewohnte Gebiete fliegen und dort den Sprit ablassen. Ob der Treibstoff überhaupt am Boden ankomme, sei unter Experten umstritten.

Mit den Risiken von abgelassenem Kerosin für Gesundheit und Umwelt wird sich nach Landtagsangaben der Ausschuss für Wirtschaft und Verkehr am 18. Oktober befassen.

Plus de 4000 femmes briguent un poste de préfet, de maire, ou de conseiller au niveau municipal pour les élections du 5 novembre, selon les chiffres préliminaires dévoilés récemment par le ministère des Affaires municipales et de l'Occupation du territoire (MAMOT).

En 2013, les femmes candidates étaient plus de 3800.

C'est en regardant les élections précédant 2013 que l'on remarque une plus grande progression des candidatures féminines. En 2005, elles formaient à peine 25 pour cent des candidatures, et leur nombre a augmenté à un peu plus de 26 pour cent quatre ans plus tard.

D'ailleurs, les politiciennes représentent une proportion importante des élus les plus jeunes. Dans la catégorie des 18 à 34 ans, 39,7 pour cent des candidats sont des femmes. Chez les 34 à 44 ans, ce chiffre grimpe à 40,9 pour cent.

Leur pourcentage décline ensuite graduellement à partir de 45 ans. Dans les candidats âgés de 65 ans et plus, elles représentent moins de 20 pour cent des candidatures.

Une tendance similaire avait été observée en 2013.

Les jeunes moins nombreux

S'il y a une augmentation constante des femmes à travers le temps, les candidatures jeunes, elles, sont en légère baisse.

Le pourcentage de candidatures des 18 à 34 ans est passé de 9 pour cent en 2013 à 8,7 pour cent cette année. On ne dénombre que 1125 jeunes de 18 à 34 ans sur le total de 12 965 candidats.

Ce sont les 55 à 64 ans qui représentent la plus grande proportion des candidats, avec un pourcentage de 31,2 pour cent. Les groupes de 45 à 54 ans et de 65 ans et plus représentent chacun un peu plus de 21 pour cent des candidatures.

L'âge moyen, qui était de 53 ans en 2013, a augmenté à 54 ans cette année.","Élections municipales: les femmes plus nombreuses, lentement mais sûrement",http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/10/14/elections-municipales-les-femmes-plus-nombreuses-lentement-mais-surement_a_23243506/

Der Bischof von Rhodos hat ausländischen Paaren verboten, in einer berühmten Kirche zu heiraten

Der Grund: Ein Blowjob-Hochzeitsfoto eines britischen Paares vor der Kirche

Hunderte Heiratswillige sind von dem Verbot betroffen

Hunderte Heiratswillige aus aller Welt lassen sich jedes Jahr in der St. Paul Kirche auf der griechischen Insel Rhodos trauen. Doch damit soll es nun vorbei sein.

Denn der Bischof von Rhodos hat nun nach Berichten von britischen Medien ausländischen Paaren verboten, an dem idyllischen Ort zu heiraten.

Schuld daran ist wohl ein Hochzeitsfoto, das ein Hochzeitspaar bei einem simulierten Blowjob zeigt - mit der berühmten Kirche im Hintergrund.

""Wir dürfen dieses widerliche Verhalten nicht dulden“

Ein Affront für die griechischen Kirchenoberen und die Gläubigen. Das Foto hatte das britische Paar nach der Hochzeit bei Facebook hochgeladen. Es zeigt den Bräutigam mit heruntergelassenen Hosen und hochgereckter Faust, während die Braut vor ihm kniet und einen Blowjob simuliert.

Auf Facebook zog das Foto die Aufmerksamkeit tausender Internet-Nutzer auf sich und gelangte auch in die griechischen Medien. Giorgos Eleftheriou, Präsident der Lindos Gemeinschaft auf Rhodos, sagte der britischen ""Times"": ""Wir sind Griechen und wir schätzen unsere Traditionen und die Heiligkeit unserer religiöser Stätten. Wir dürfen dieses widerliche Verhalten nicht dulden.“

Und er fügte hinzu: ""Schande über die Beiden, die diesen Schaden angerichtet haben.""

Böse Folgen für Heiratswillige und die Einwohner von Rhodos

Nun stehen hunderte Paare, die in den nächsten Jahren in der besagten Kirche heiraten wollen, vor einem großen Problem. Laut einem Bericht des ""Independent"" haben schon einige Betroffene die Hochzeit abgesagt und suchen nach Alternativen. Andere warten voller Angst auf die endgültige Entscheidung des Bürgermeisters von Rhodos, die in etwa einer Woche getroffen werden soll.

Das Verbot hat nicht nur Folgen für die Heiratswilligen, sondern auch für die Bewohner der griechischen Insel, deren Einkommen stark vom Tourismus abhängt.

Die Braut auf dem verhängnisvollen Foto sagte der ""DailyMail"" zu der von ihr und ihrem Mann ausgelösten Misere: ""Wir haben es doch nur als Witz gemeint.""

Ce n'est pas la première fois que la Chine est accusée de racisme.","POLEMIQUE - L'exposition, accusée de racisme, a provoqué une vive polémique. Un musée chinois, situé dans la province de Hubei, dans la ville de Wuhan, a été contraint de retirer des photographies associant Africains et animaux sauvages, relate le New York Times. L'exposition, intitulée ""This is Africa"" (""Voici l'Afrique"", ndlr), présentait une série de 150 clichés, pris par l'artiste chinois Yu Huiping.

Dans le détail, les photographies comparaient les expressions faciales d'Africains à autres chimpanzés, babouins, lions ou encore girafes. Parmi elles, un petit garçon Noir pose en ouvrant la bouche. A ses côtés, un singe ouvrant lui aussi sa gueule.

Les photos ont d'abord été dénoncées sur Instagram par un visiteur de l'exposition, Edward E. Duke, qui a la nationalité nigériane. ""Dans un musée à Wuhan, la Chine juxtapose des photographies d'une ethnie particulière à côté d'animaux sauvages, pourquoi?"". La publication a depuis été supprimée.

Mais cette exposition a continué d'indigner les Africains, y compris ceux qui vivent en Chine, a indiqué le conservateur de l'exposition. ""Pour montrer notre bonne volonté et notre sincérité, nous avons remplacé les photos que les amis africains jugent choquantes"", a-t-il expliqué, après avoir affirmé que ""dans les proverbes chinois, les animaux sont utilisés pour faire des compliments et suscitent l'admiration"".

Zhao Yingxin, président des Editions nationales chinoises de la photographie, approuvait l'exposition, louant le travail de l'artiste: ""La photographie de Yu Huiping est perceptive, intelligente, et visuellement percutante. Elle capture l'énergie de la vie primitive"", déclare-t-il au site d'informations chinois Shangaiist, tandis que ce dernier la trouvait ""étonnamment offensive"".

Ce n'est pas la première fois que la Chine est accusée de racisme. Comme le rapporte 20 Minutes, une compagnie de lessive avait été contrainte de s'excuser en 2016, après avoir diffusé une publicité dans laquelle un Africain ressortait d'une machine à laver sous les traits d'un Asiatique.

Ce mois-ci, on change radicalement d'univers pour se plonger dans une dystopie souvent comparée à ""1984"" de George Orwell. Plus d'amour fou, de mensonges à l'endroit, à l'envers, fini l'humour pétillant d'Olivier Bourdeaut. Direction maintenant la sombre République de Gilead où règnent en maîtres des fanatiques religieux. Vous l'avez peut-être deviné tant il a fait l'actualité cette année, nous allons lire ""La servante écarlate"", le roman de science-fiction écrit par la Canadienne Margaret Atwood, publié en 1985 et traduit en Français en 1987.

Le thème: ""Le corps des femmes""

Le livre: ""La servante écarlate"" de Margaret Atwood (1985)

Le résumé: ""Defred est une Servante écarlate, vêtue de rouge, au service de la République de Gilead fondée par des fanatiques religieux, et a pour obligation de procréer. La nuit venue, dans sa cellule, elle songe au temps où les femmes avaient le droit de porter un nom, de lire, de travailler. En rejoignant un réseau secret, elle va tout tenter pour recouvrer sa liberté.""

Pourquoi ce livre? En plein dans l'actualité de ces derniers mois, il nous permet d'aborder l'important thème du corps des femmes, de leur droit à disposer d'elles-mêmes et plus généralement de problématiques féministes qui, dans notre rubrique ""C'est la vie"", nous sont chères.

Vous le savez peut-être, ce livre qui dépeint une dictature du futur pas si loin de notre époque, a été adaptée en série télé et a raflé cinq prix lors des derniers Emmy Awards.

Ce livre est aussi devenu un symbole de résistance dans l'Amérique de Donald Trump. De nombreuses femmes tout droit sorties du roman, vêtues de rouge et de blanc, ont notamment protesté devant le Capitole contre la réforme de l'Obama Care. En ligne de mire: les initiatives anti-avortement du président des États-Unis. Preuve que la contre-utopie d'Atwood nous concerne d'un peu plus près que ce que l'on peut croire, certaines femmes ont même protesté à la Woman's March avec ce panneau:

""Faites que l'œuvre de Margaret Atwood redevienne de la fiction""

Nous reparlerons de tout cela pendant un mois, à travers l'histoire de Defred, interprétée dans la série par la talentueuse Elisabeth Moss. Nous pourrons échanger sur les peurs que cette contre-utopie fait naître en nous mais aussi sur les souvenirs d'un temps meilleur qui permettent à notre héroïne de ne pas totalement sombrer dans ce monde où les femmes ne sont plus que des réceptacles.

En attendant de commencer nos discussions sur la page Facebook du club de lecture, je vous laisse le temps de vous procurer ce petit bijou chez votre libraire préféré, à la bibliothèque ou sur l'étagère de l'un de vos proches.

N'hésitez pas à nous dire dans les commentaires et sur notre page si le thème et le livre du mois vous plaisent. À très vite.

""Si nous n'arrivons pas à trouver un solution (...) il sera mis fin à l'accord"", a-t-il martelé lors de son allocution à la tonalité très virulente.
Le programme nucléaire iranien empoisonnait les relations internationales depuis 2003, et les discussions, débutées entre Européens et Iraniens, patinaient.
Les deux présidents se sont entretenus vendredi après-midi par téléphone, Macron rappelant ""l'attachement de la France"" à l'accord sur le nucléaire iranien.","INTERNATIONAL - C'est une attaque en règle contre le pouvoir iranien et son activité nucléaire. Donald Trump a appelé vendredi 13 octobre le Congrès à durcir l'accord international qui vise à empêcher l'Iran de se doter de la bombe atomique, sans pour autant aller jusqu'à le ""déchirer"" comme il l'avait promis en campagne.

Le président américain a fait cette annonce à l'issue d'un long réquisitoire contre cet accord emblématique conclu en juillet 2015, ""le pire"" jamais négocié par les États-Unis selon lui. Comme vous pouvez le voir dans la vidéo ci-dessous, il a utilisé des mots très durs à l'égard de la ""dictature iranienne"", l'un des principaux ""soutiens au terrorisme"" dans le monde selon lui.

Son discours a provoqué une virulente réaction de Téhéran. Les États-Unis sont ""plus seuls que jamais contre le peuple iranien"", a lancé le président iranien Hassan Rohani.

Avant son discours, le secrétaire d'État américain Rex Tillerson avait annoncé la couleur en expliquant que le président allait annoncer la ""non-certification"" des engagements de l'Iran dans le cadre de l'accord sur son programme nucléaire, sans pour autant quitter cet accord.

""Notre intention est de rester dans la JCPOA (acronyme de ce texte) mais le président va décertifier"", a indiqué Rex Tillerson. Concrètement, cela signifie que Donald Trump refuse de ""certifier"" le fait que Téhéran respecte ses engagements, en dépit des assurances en ce sens de l'Agence internationale de l'énergie atomique.

Cette ""non-certification"" place de facto le Congrès américain en première ligne: les parlementaires auront en effet 60 jours pour décider de ré-imposer, ou non, les sanctions levées depuis 2015. ""Nous ne demandons pas au Congrès de réimposer des sanctions car cela reviendrait de facto à quitter l'accord"", a souligné Rex Tillerson.

Trump menace de quitter l'accord ""à tout moment""

D'après le secrétaire d'État, l'équipe gouvernementale américaine souhaite plutôt l'émergence d'un nouveau texte sur le nucléaire iranien. ""Nous pensons que l'accord est faible et ne répond pas à plusieurs questions importantes"", a dit le chef de la diplomatie américaine, évoquant la possibilité d'un nouvel accord dans le futur qui ne remplacerait pas l'existant mais viendrait le compléter.

L'administration souhaite supprimer de facto les échéances de cet accord en vertu duquel les restrictions sur le programme nucléaire sont censées être levées progressivement à partir de 2025.

Menaçant d'annuler la participation des États-Unis ""à tout moment"", Donald Trump a appelé dans son discours les parlementaires américains mais aussi les autres pays signataires -Russie, Chine, France, Allemagne, Royaume-Uni- à faire preuve de plus de fermeté vis-à-vis de Téhéran. ""Si nous n'arrivons pas à trouver un solution (...) il sera mis fin à l'accord"", a-t-il martelé lors de son allocution à la tonalité très virulente.

France, Allemagne et Royaume-Uni ""préoccupés"" par la décision de Trump

En ""décertifiant"" l'accord de Vienne, le président américain porte un coup majeur à une négociation diplomatique sans précédent, qui, de Genève à Lausanne en passant par New York et Vienne, a réuni sur près de deux ans les représentants de sept pays: États-Unis, France, Grande-Bretagne, Chine, Russie, Allemagne, et Iran. Le programme nucléaire iranien empoisonnait les relations internationales depuis 2003, et les discussions, débutées entre Européens et Iraniens, patinaient.

Si le Premier ministre israélien, Benjamin Netanyahu, a immédiatement félicité le président américain pour sa ""décision courageuse"", Donald Trump reste très isolé sur ce dossier: Téhéran bien sûr, mais aussi tous les autres signataires de ce texte historique avaient par avance mis en garde contre un retour en arrière aux conséquences imprévisibles.

La chef de la diplomatie européenne Federica Mogherini a mis en garde contre la tentation de ""démanteler un accord qui fonctionne et tient ses promesses"".

Dans un communiqué commun, la France, l'Allemagne et le Royaume-Uni se sont ainsi dits vendredi soir ""préoccupés par les implications"" de la décision de Donald Trump et ""fermement attachés"" à cet accord. ""Nous encourageons l'Administration et le Congrès américains à prendre en compte les implications que leur décision aurait pour la sécurité des États-Unis et de leurs alliés, avant de prendre toute mesure susceptible de porter atteinte"" à l'accord, par exemple d'imposer de nouveau à l'Iran des sanctions déjà levées, poursuivent les trois pays européens.

Macron ""envisage"" de se rendre en Iran

Ils ajoutent en revanche partager ""des préoccupations américaines sur ""le programme de missiles balistiques de l'Iran et ses activités dans la région"" et se disent prêts à prendre ""de nouvelles mesures adéquates pour traiter ces questions, en étroite coopération avec les États-Unis et tous les partenaires concernés.

L'Élysée a par ailleurs indiqué que le président français Emmanuel Macron ""envisageait"" de se rendre en Iran, à l'invitation du président Rohani, ce qui serait la première visite d'un chef d'État ou de gouvernement français dans ce pays depuis 1971. La présidence iranienne a elle évoqué sur son site une visite ""l'année prochaine"". Les deux présidents se sont entretenus vendredi après-midi par téléphone, Macron rappelant ""l'attachement de la France"" à l'accord sur le nucléaire iranien.

Donald Trump a également annoncé des sanctions contre certains membres des Gardiens de la révolution, l'armée d'élite iranienne. Les Gardiens de la révolution ""ont détourné de vastes parts de l'économie iranienne et saisi les dotations religieuses pour financer la guerre et le terrorisme à l'étranger"", a-t-il accusé, sans toutefois allé jusqu'à les désigner comme un ""groupe terroriste"".

Chapter 2: Fear And Judgement What I have to regularly remind myself is that people will judge you whether you worry about their opinions or not, so you may as well do what you want to do.

Love Is All Around Us (Even In My Chemo Unit) Richard Curtis once wrote that, 'love is everywhere', and none more so than at the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. I disagree.

Why Is Gaslighting So Disturbing? Being gaslighted over time effectively disconnects you from yourself, your feelings, your ability to know what you want and don't want, what you know to be true about yourself, others, and the world.

695,"['angry', 'best', 'despite', 'need', 'partners', 'youre', 'heard', 'things', 'couples', 'resolve', 'totally', 'ok', 'youve', 'sleep', 'bed', 'reasons', 'conflict']","Conventional relationship wisdom says couples should settle their disagreements before bed and never go to sleep still mad at each other.
“We are not in a good place to hash things out when we are angry and triggered and need time to process what’s happening.
It is up to you to determine what you need, and not your partner’s job to predict this after simply telling them you’re upset.
But once their event is over, do talk about it, because buried resentments wreak havoc over time.” ― Ryan Howes7.
When you’ve lost sight of what you were even arguing about in the first place.","Conventional relationship wisdom says couples should settle their disagreements before bed and never go to sleep still mad at each other. And while this advice is well-intentioned, in some cases, it can actually worsen the problem at hand.

We asked relationship experts to tell us the types of arguments that call for hitting the hay and revisiting the discussion at a later time. Below, seven times to sleep on it, according to therapists and psychologists:

1. When you’re really tired.

“Lack of sleep can greatly exacerbate conflict. When couples are exhausted, they are more irritable and snippy. Going to bed mad can often mean that you wake up feeling okay, especially if the conflict was exacerbated or even entirely caused by two irritable, fatigued people sniping at one another.

Also, the idea that going to bed angry is ‘bad’ leads to many couples staying up later than they should, trying to resolve fights and often failing, as they get more and more entrenched in their positions. When you have a good night’s sleep, you can much more easily see your partner’s position and empathize, which means that making up is finally possible.” ― Samantha Rodman, psychologist and dating coach

2. When you’ve been drinking.

“The heated conversations of the overserved can travel to strange places, and the more drunk, the less constructive they tend to be. It might be best to call a time out, have a glass of water, and revisit the squabble in the morning, if you still remember it.” ― Ryan Howes, psychologist

3. When you’re really worked up.

“When in conflict, the body often goes into fight-or-flight mode. ‘Fight’ usually results in an elevated heart rate, an increase in stress hormones and an inability to think rationally. You cannot have a meaningful conversation, much less attempt problem solving, when your body is in this state. If you recognize it, you need to find a way to self-soothe. Some people go for a walk, some take a shower, some meditate and some sleep. If your anger has gotten the best of you, sleep may in fact be your best strategy for repair, especially if it’s late.” ― Zach Brittle, therapist and founder of the online couples therapy series forBetter

4. When you need more time to process your feelings.

“We are not in a good place to hash things out when we are angry and triggered and need time to process what’s happening. Anger provides useful information to us and is a signal that something needs to change. Specifically, you want to do this in a constructive way (journaling, reflecting, physical activity, sleep) and not destructively (lengthy discussions, yelling, violence). It is up to you to determine what you need, and not your partner’s job to predict this after simply telling them you’re upset. Sleep also provides a mental filing of things experienced or learned throughout the day, so it’s an even better time to allow for processing of these strong emotions.” ― Kari Carroll, couples therapist

5. When the conflict requires a mediator.

“Some conflicts are ongoing and require intervention, like therapy. Trying to resolve these in one evening just so you don’t go to sleep angry would be impossible, and would leave both partners feeling hopeless and like they must be doing something wrong if they can’t resolve things.” ― Samantha Rodman

6. When you have a big day the next day.

“You may have a bone to pick, but it’s 11 p.m. and your partner has a job interview first thing in the morning. Or a final exam. Or major surgery. If it’s possible to hold onto your moderate grudge until their major event has passed, that may be the most loving, considerate thing to do. But once their event is over, do talk about it, because buried resentments wreak havoc over time.” ― Ryan Howes

Επιθυμία της ήταν η κηδεία της να γίνει στον Καθεδρικό της Ουψάλα, της πόλης που μεγάλωσε και αγάπησε.
Η οικογένεια μου έχασε και την τιμή της και την κόρη της.","Είχε αρχίσει να βραδιάζει όταν περάσαμε τον ποταμό Φύρι και σταθήκαμε για λίγο σε μία πολύ μικρή πλατεία έτσι ώστε να ακούσουμε δύο λόγια από τον καθηγητή μας . Αμέσως μετά θα πηγαίναμε για φαγητό και ανυπομονούσαμε να τελειώσει η ημέρα μας εκεί αλλά δεν ξέραμε ότι η ιστορία και το όνομα της πλατείας θα μας συντρόφευε για αρκετές ώρες μετά. Το όνομα της πλατείας ήταν Fadimes plats, δηλαδή η πλατεία της Fadime. Η σύντομη ιστορία της Φαντιμέ άνοιξε μία μακρυά και έντονη συζήτηση εκείνο το βράδυ στο τραπέζι μας όπως ακριβώς εκείνη που άνοιξε πριν 15 χρόνια στη Σουηδία και εξακολουθεί να τη στοιχειώνει ως μία ιστορία ντροπής και φόβου.

H Φαντιμέ έφτασε στη Σουηδία όταν ήταν εφτά ετών. Καταγόταν από το Ελμπιστάν, ένα κουρδικό χωριό στη Νοτιοανατολική Τουρκία. Ο πατέρας της Ραχμί είχε μεταναστεύσει στην Ουψάλα λίγα χρόνια νωρίτερα και η οικογένεια τον ακολούθησε στα μέσα της δεκαετίας του '80.

«Το σχολείο και η εκπαίδευση ήταν καλή για την οικογένεια μου μόνο εφόσον μάθαινα να γράφω και να διαβάζω. Θεωρούσαν ότι η ανώτερη εκπαίδευση δεν προοριζόταν για εμένα. Σκοπός ήταν να ολοκληρώσω το σχολείο και να γυρίσω στο χωριό για να παντρευτώ κάποιον Κούρδο. Τον Κούρδο που θα έχουν επιλέξει αυτοί για εμένα. Όταν έφτασα στη Σουηδία και ξεκίνησα το σχολείο, οι γονείς μου μού έλεγαν να μην παίζω με τους συμμαθητές μου που ήταν από τη Σουηδία και να γυρίζω αμέσως μετά το σχολείο στο σπίτι».

Η Φαντιμέ στα 18 της γνώρισε και ερωτεύτηκε τον Σουηδό -Ιρανό Πάτρικ Λιντεσος. Κρύβονταν για έναν ολόκληρο χρόνο από την οικογένεια της ώσπου ξαφνικά τους είδε ο πατέρας της στο κέντρο της Ουψάλα. Χτύπησε και τους δύο ενώ τόσο ο πατέρας της όσο και ο δεκαεξάχρονος αδερφός της απείλησαν το ζευγάρι ότι θα το σκοτώσουν. Η Φαντιμέ και ο Πάτρικ έκαναν μήνυση στην οικογένεια και αποφάσισαν να μετακομίσουν στην περιοχή του Sundsvall.



«Η πρώτη αντίδραση του πατέρα μου ήταν να μας χτυπήσει. Πίστευε ότι ο ρόλος του σωστού πατέρα ήταν να υπερασπίζεται και να προστατεύει την τιμή της κόρης του. Υπέθεσε ότι ο Πάτρικ κι εγώ είχαμε σεξουαλικές σχέσεις. Για τη κουλτούρα του, ήταν σημαντικό να είμαι παρθένα. Υπάρχει ακόμα η παράδοση με το σημάδι από το αίμα στο σεντόνι. Για την οικογένεια μου, ο σκοπός της ζωής μου ήταν να παντρευτώ κάποιον Κούρδο. Από ένα καλό κορίτσι κούρδικης οικογένειας είχα μεταμορφωθεί σε μία ξετσίπωτη που είχε παρασυρθεί από τη ζωή των Σουηδών και τους είχα προδώσει. Αποφάσισα να κόψω τις επαφές με την οικογένεια μου και να μετακομίσω στο Sundsvall. Ο αδερφός μου με βρήκε και με απείλησε. Η κατάσταση πήγαινε από το κακό στο χειρότερο. Ο λόγος για τον οποίο στέλνανε τον ανήλικο αδερφό μου ήταν γιατί ο νόμος δεν θα τιμωρούσε λόγω της ηλικίας του»

Λίγες ημέρες πριν φύγουν με τον Πάτρικ, ο σύντροφος της σκοτώθηκε σε αυτοκινητιστικό δυστύχημα. Η ίδια αποφάσισε να μην φύγει σαν κυνηγημένη αλλά να μείνει στον τόπο όπου μεγάλωσε και γνώρισε τον έρωτα της ζωής της. Παρόλα αυτά, οι απειλές για τη ζωή της από την οικογένεια της δεν σταμάτησαν ακόμα και μετά τον θάνατο του Πάτρικ. Απευθύνθηκε επανειλημμένως στη σουηδική αστυνομία για να λάβει αδιάφορες απαντήσεις.

«Κατήγγειλα τα περιστατικά στην αστυνομία αλλά κανένας δεν με πήρε στα σοβαρά. Αντίθετα, δεν κατάλαβαν καθόλου την επικινδυνότητα της κατάστασης και την απειλή της ζωής μου και με συμβούλεψαν να προσπαθήσω να τα βρω μαζί τους ή να τους μιλήσω και να τους ζητήσω να μην με ενοχλήσουν ξανά».

Η Φαντιμέ βρήκε ως τελευταία λύση τα Μέσα Μαζικής Ενημέρωσης. Στράφηκε στη δημοσιότητα για να προστατέψει τον εαυτό της, να ενημερώσει για την κατάσταση της και την περίπτωση η οποία όπως φάνηκε δεν ήταν η μοναδική στην «παραδεισένια» σουηδική κοινωνία.

«Η περίπτωση μου συγκέντρωσε τεράστιο ενδιαφέρον. Ένας αριθμός παρόμοιων περιπτώσεων αποκαλύφθηκε την ίδια περίοδο σε όλη τη Σουηδία. Έδωσα φωνή και πρόσωπο στην καταπίεση»

Η Φαντιμέ δολοφονήθηκε στις 21 Νοεμβρίου 2002 από τον πατέρα της λίγες ημέρες πριν φύγει για σπουδές στην Κένυα. Είχε βρεθεί με τη μητέρα της και τις δύο αδερφές της στο διαμέρισμα της αδερφής στην Ουψάλα ώσπου χτύπησε η πόρτα. Πηγαίνοντας να ανοίξει, ο πατέρας της την πυροβόλησε δύο φορές στο κεφάλι. Η Φαντιμέ πέθανε στην αγκαλιά της μητέρας η οποία δεν ήταν ικανή να τη σώσει.

Η Σουηδία ταρακουνήθηκε από την μαρτυρία και τον θάνατο της Φαντιμέ. Η κοινωνία διχάστηκε για την αποτελεσματική ενσωμάτωση των μεταναστών και πολλά μέσα μαζικής ενημέρωσης προσπάθησαν να ταυτίσουν τα εγκλήματα τιμής με το Ισλάμ.

Η Anne Patterson και η Unni Wikan στο βιβλίο της : In Honor of Fadime, Murder and Shame προσπάθησαν να αποσυνδέσουν τα εγκλήματα τιμής από τη θρησκεία και από συγκεκριμένες θρησκευτικές κοινότητες.

«Τα εγκλήματα τιμής και η έννοια της τιμής και της ντροπής δεν συνδέονται με τη θρησκεία. Οι έννοιες και οι ιδέες αυτές βρίσκονται σε συγκεκριμένες εθνοτικές ομάδες. Μπορούν να βρεθούν σε διάφορα πολιτιστικά σκηνικά τόσο μέσα στον Δυτικό κόσμο όσο και έξω από αυτόν. Το έγκλημα τιμής δεν αφορά τη θρησκεία αλλά τον κοινωνικό περίγυρο. Τιμή και ντροπή υπάρχουν μόνο εφόσον ο κόσμος γνωρίζει. Το έγκλημα γίνεται για να επικροτηθεί ο θύτης από το κοινωνικό περιβάλλον που θεωρεί την πράξη σωστή. Ακούστηκαν πολλά για τη θρησκεία της Φαντιμέ και το Ισλάμ. Ναι, η οικογένεια της Φαντιμέ ήταν μουσουλμάνοι όχι όμως πιστοί. Δεν ακολουθούσαν βασικούς κανόνες της θρησκείας άρα η πράξη αυτή δεν ήταν απόρροια μίας θρησκευτικής υποχρέωσης. Δεν είχε να κάνει με τον Θεό αλλά με τους ανθρώπους. Αντίθετα, στο Ισλάμ επικρατεί η ιδέα ότι κάθε ανθρώπινο ον είναι υπεύθυνο απέναντι στον Θεό κατά τη διάρκεια της Τελικής Κρίσης. Κανένας άνθρωπος δεν είναι σε θέση να κρίνει έναν άλλον άνθρωπο. 'Ένα χαρακτηριστικό παράδειγμα αποσύνδεσης των εγκλημάτων τιμής από τη θρησκεία είναι η δολοφονία ενός κοριτσιού το οποίο προερχόταν από οικογένεια Παλαιστίνιων χριστιανών και το οποίο αρνήθηκε έναν κανονισμένο γάμο, πριν λίγα χρόνια στη Σουηδία».

Μετά τον θάνατο της Φαντιμέ, οι πολιτικοί είδαν υπό νέο φως τις πολιτικές ενσωμάτωσης των μεταναστών στη σουηδική κοινωνία. Η αντίθεση ανάμεσα στη σουηδική μοντέρνα κοινωνία και σε παραδόσεις όπως εγκλήματα τιμής και κανονισμένοι γάμοι έφερνε σε απόγνωση τους νέους που δεν μπορούσαν να βρουν που πραγματικά ανήκουν. Είναι παιδιά μιας οικογένειας με απαρχαιωμένες αξίες ή μέλη μίας ισότιμης κοινωνίας όπου επιλέγουν ελεύθερα και συνειδητά για τον εαυτό τους;

Το Σοσιαλιστικό - Δημοκρατικό Κόμμα το οποίο βρισκόταν στην κυβέρνηση έδωσε μεγαλύτερες επιχορηγήσεις σε ειδικά κέντρα στήριξης έτσι ώστε να βοηθήσουν νεαρά κορίτσια να αποφύγουν γάμους ή να ξεφύγουν από τη βία της οικογένειας τους. Νομοθετικά, ρύθμισαν το όριο ηλικίας γάμου για τους μετανάστες στα 18 ενώ πριν ήταν στα 15. Η Mona Sahlin, τότε υπουργός Μετανάστευσης είχε δηλώσει για την Φαντιμέ: «Η Φαντιμέ και η λαχτάρα της να ζήσει τη δική της ζωή αποτελούν το ιδανικό πρότυπο για όλες τις νέες γυναίκες. Τα μίντια την αποκαλούν μία μάρτυρα η οποία θυσίασε τη ζωή της για την ισότητα αντρών -γυναικών και για το δικαίωμα να αποφασίσει για τη ζωή της».

Επιθυμία της ήταν η κηδεία της να γίνει στον Καθεδρικό της Ουψάλα, της πόλης που μεγάλωσε και αγάπησε. Θέλησε να ταφεί δίπλα στον αγαπημένο της Πάτρικ στο προτεσταντικό νεκροταφείο της Ουψάλα. 4.000 άνθρωποι συγκεντρώθηκαν στον Καθεδρικό για να αποχαιρετήσουν την Φαντιμέ. Να την αποχαιρετήσουν όχι ένα κορίτσι μίας πατριαρχικής οικογένειας Κούρδων αλλά μία πολίτη της Σουηδίας που είχε το θάρρος να βγει μπροστά και να μιλήσει ανοιχτά για όσα η σουηδική κοινωνία έβαζε κάτω από το χαλί.

Το φέρετρο της κουβάλησαν γυναίκες συγγενείς της ενώ κατά τη διάρκεια της κηδείας της έπαιξαν τα αγαπημένα της κομμάτια: το Tears in Heaven του Eric Clapton, το One των U2 και ένα παραδοσιακό κουρδικό κομμάτι θλίψης από κλαρίνο.

We want to know: What does it mean to be American today? To find out, we’re hitting the road this fall to interview people about their hopes, dreams, fears and definition of ""being American."" By converting a tour bus into a mobile video studio, we’ll capture conversations with people of all ages and backgrounds. Our goal: moving, multimedia storytelling that showcases what we share as Americans, rather than what divides us.

Why we are doing this

Trust in media has bottomed out. We hope to rebuild some of that — and learn from it — by listening to the public and elevating their stories through our massive distribution network.

How we are making it happen

We will travel the old-fashioned way — via bus — to 20-plus states to hear from some of the under-heard, diverse Americans who make up the communities that form much of our nation. And by working on the ground with community leaders, nonprofits, educational institutions, local businesses and others, we’ll make sure people know we’re there to listen.

Not on the bus tour? Don’t worry. You can follow us via our daily newsletter or Facebook page.

Il s'appelle Éric. Il est proche de la cinquantaine. En septembre dernier, il a fait un méchant burnout dans l'entreprise où il pensait légitimement finir sa carrière. Il sera remplacé par un millennial, un jeune cadre formaté pour conduire la transformation digitale réclamée par sa direction. Éric accuse le coup et pourtant, son licenciement lui apporte un certain soulagement. Car il a d'autres idées en tête. Il entend réaliser ses rêves d'étudiant, lui, le digne représentant de la génération X. Éric n'est pas un cas isolé. Ils sont des centaines, chaque mois, à tout remettre en question.

C'est l'écrivain Douglas Coupland qui, le premier, a décrit la désormais célèbre génération X. Elle a rejeté le modèle de ses parents (la génération W, issue du baby-boom) leur fidélité à l'entreprise, leurs plans d'épargne, leurs raisonnements figés dans la guerre froide et leurs grandes certitudes forgées dans les trente glorieuses. De toute façon, avec des calamités comme la fin du plein emploi et l'apparition du sida, l'humeur n'était pas à l'optimisme.

Éric accuse le coup et pourtant, son licenciement lui apporte un certain soulagement.

Les enfants de la génération X appartiennent à la génération Y ou Z, ces fameux millennials qui aiguisent l'appétit des spécialistes du marketing et déboussolent les DRH. Leurs enfants? La génération X les regarde avec envie. Ils approuvent leurs révoltes. Ils se disent qu'ils ont raison, que le travail, ce n'est pas tout, qu'il faut vivre, coûte que coûte, avant qu'il ne soit trop tard.

Car il est peut-être déjà trop tard. La génération X est entrée dans la deuxième moitié de son existence et elle panique. La crise des quarante ans est remplacée par la crise des cinquante. La crise du milieu de vie a pris dix ans parce que l'espérance de vie a augmenté. Comme l'a souligné le psychologue Elliott Jacques, ""la crise du milieu de vie, c'est quand on prend conscience de sa mortalité"". Alors la génération X se rebiffe, elle refuse tout fatalisme. Oui, il y a une vie après la cinquantaine. Le récent film ""Aurore"" avec Agnès Jaoui est l'un des nombreux exemples illustrant ce phénomène de société, le grand questionnement de la génération X et déclarons-le: l'avènement de la génération X-Tension.

Les X-Tension n'ont plus peur de bouleverser leur vie. Ils ne supportent plus d'appartenir à des modèles, de suivre des conventions. Ils ont soufflé, comme leurs enfants, le vent de changement incarné par des Macron ou des Mélenchon au moment des élections. Sans doute parce qu'ils incarnaient –à tort ou à raison- un renouveau.

Les indices de leur révolte sont partout. J'en veux pour preuve le succès du roman de Luke Rhinehart, L'homme-dé. De quoi s'agit-il? D'un psychologue de New York qui, un jour d'ennui, décide de programmer le reste de son après-midi sur un coup de dé. Ça donne plus ou moins ça: 1. je retourne au travail. 2. Je vais à la séance de cinéma de 15h. 3. Je range le grenier. 4. Je vais chercher ma fille à l'école pour lui faire une surprise. 5. Je vais me saouler dans un bar voisin. 6. Je vais retrouver mon amour de jeunesse à 400 km de là. Le héros du livre roule le dé. Ça tombe sur 6 et sa vie s'en trouve chamboulée. À la fin du livre, le psychologue doit se justifier devant ses collègues praticiens, furieux -car il joue aux dés la thérapie de ses patients.

Voici ce qu'il leur explique: ""Dans les sociétés stables, cohérentes, l'étroitesse de la personnalité avait une valeur. On pouvait se réaliser avec un seul moi. Ce n'est plus vrai aujourd'hui. Dans une société multivalente, seule une personnalité multiple peut faire l'affaire. Nous avons chacun une centaine de moi réprimés; nous avons beau fouler à toute force le sentier étroit de notre personnalité, nous ne parvenons jamais à oublier que notre plus profond désir est d'être multiple, de jouer plusieurs rôles différents"".

""Dans les sociétés stables, cohérentes, l'étroitesse de la personnalité avait une valeur. On pouvait se réaliser avec un seul moi. Ce n'est plus vrai aujourd'hui.""

Nous sommes conditionnés dès notre plus jeune âge (école-collège-lycée-université-carrière-mariage-enfants-retraite-cimetière). C'est insensé, dit le psychologue dépeint par Luke Rhinehart. Nous sommes faits pour être multiples, pour vivre plusieurs vies. Ce livre, écrit dans les années 70, est prémonitoire. Il n'y a jamais eu autant de familles recomposées, de sites de libertinage, d'invitation à l'épanouissement personnel, d'encouragement à l'entreprise individuelle (partage salarial, auto-entrepreneuriat, freelance), de promotion du fameux slashing (le cumul de plusieurs activité), de désir d'expatriation. Partout, on fustige le bullshit job (""le métier à la con"") et quand les psys demandent aux adultérins pourquoi ils ont trompé leurs conjoints, ils répondent unanimement: ""je voulais me sentir vivant, à nouveau"". C'est un fait, 79% des Français veulent changer de vie, et la génération X-Tension mène la danse.

Les X-Tension représentent-ils une menace? Plutôt une force. Ils vont porter les mouvements demandés par leurs enfants. Pourquoi? Parce que la marche actuelle du monde les consterne. Ils ont célébré la chute du mur de Berlin: ils ne s'attendaient pas à ce qu'on s'entoure de barricades. Ils ont porté l'adoption de la monnaie unique: ils ne s'attendaient pas à ce qu'on questionne l'Europe. Ils ont vu tomber les dictateurs: ils ne s'attendaient pas à ce que le populisme prolifère. Ils ont rêvé d'un monde où les cultures se rencontreraient plus facilement: malgré les nouvelles technologies, la haine de l'autre grandit. Bref, ils rejettent le monde qui se dessine, avec moins de fougue que dans leur jeunesse, mais avec la détermination de ceux qui ont suffisamment vécu pour savoir que leur cause est juste.

Pourtant, ce sont d'autres générations qui concentrent toutes les attentions: les millennials et le troisième âge. Les premiers parce qu'ils incarnent l'avenir. Les seconds parce qu'ils représentent un pourcentage non négligeable de la population (les plus de 65 ans représentent 19% de la population française selon l'INSEE).

Les X-Tension n'ont plus peur de bouleverser leur vie. Ils ne supportent plus d'appartenir à des modèles, de suivre des conventions.

La génération X-Tension est coincée entre les deux, tiraillée, frustrée, bouillonnante. Il n'est pas rare, d'ailleurs, qu'elle ait la charge des générations qui les encadrent. Ce quinquagénaire témoigne: ""mon fils n'a pas de travail. Il reste à la maison. Mon père est malade, je passe tous mes week-ends à l'hôpital. Résultat? Je n'ai plus de temps pour moi. Je n'en peux plus"".

L'implosion a déjà commencé. La génération X-Tension a les moyens de ses envies, et elle est de plus en plus rétive aux compromis. Rappelons que la génération X-Tension représente un quart de la population et un tiers des ressources. Marques et médias commencent seulement à le réaliser. La génération X-Tension finance les choix des Y et des Z, elle accompagne les W. Mais surtout, elle veut réaliser ses rêves, jusqu'aux plus fous.

Une inquiétante révolution pour certains, une aubaine pour d'autres. L'émancipation de la génération X-Tension va confirmer des tendances de fond, avec une accélération de la diversification professionnelle, une explosion des loisirs associés à l'expression individuelle et un accroissement des foyers monoparentaux. Tous les secteurs d'activité associés à ces tendances seront les grands gagnants des deux prochaines décennies.

LUCKNOW -- The Allahabad High Court has acquitted the parents of Aarushi Talwar, who was found murdered nine years back in Noida, setting aside the CBI court's earlier order, in connection with the double murder case, which shook the nation in 2008.

A special CBI Judge, S. Lal, had earlier held Aarushi's parents, Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, guilty of conspiracy and murder of 14-year-old Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj.

The order, however, failed to bring a closure to the case and the public opinion remained divided, even after years of the conviction.

A high court bench, comprising Justice B.K. Narayana and Justice A.K. Mishra, had reserved its verdict, in September, in the appeal filed by Aarushi's parents, who were sentenced to life in jail.

On May 16, 2008, Aarushi was found murdered inside her bedroom in the flat in Jal Vayu Vihar - her throat slit with surgical precision.

It was initially suspected that house help Hemraj had killed Aarushi. However, the case took a shocking turn when Hemraj's body was recovered two days later from the terrace of the same flat.

The police then began to suspect the Talwars and said Rajesh had murdered the two after finding them in an ""objectionable"" position.

The accusations enraged the Talwars and friends, who accused the police of framing the dentist couple in order to cover up a botched investigation.

After widespread outrage, the case was transferred from the Uttar Pradesh Police to the CBI that exonerated the parents and suspected the Talwars' assistant Krishna along with two domestic servants, Rajkumar Sharma and Vijay Mandal.

In 2009, the CBI handed over the investigation to a new team, which recommended closing the case due to critical gaps in investigation.

Based on circumstantial evidence, it named Rajesh as the sole suspect, but refused to charge him due to lack of evidence.

Rajesh was first arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Police on May 23, 2008 after which he was lodged at Dasna Jail and let off on July 11, 2008.

Later in 2012, his wife Nupur surrendered before a Ghaziabad court before trial and was also sent to Dasna Jail.",Allahabad High Court Acquits Nupur and Rajesh Talwar In Aarushi Murder Case,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/12/aarushis-parents-nupur-and-rajesh-talwar-acquitted-by-allahabad-high-court_a_23240939/

Επιθυμία της ήταν η κηδεία της να γίνει στον Καθεδρικό της Ουψάλα, της πόλης που μεγάλωσε και αγάπησε.
Η οικογένεια μου έχασε και την τιμή της και την κόρη της.","Είχε αρχίσει να βραδιάζει όταν περάσαμε τον ποταμό Φύρι και σταθήκαμε για λίγο σε μία πολύ μικρή πλατεία έτσι ώστε να ακούσουμε δύο λόγια από τον καθηγητή μας . Αμέσως μετά θα πηγαίναμε για φαγητό και ανυπομονούσαμε να τελειώσει η ημέρα μας εκεί αλλά δεν ξέραμε ότι η ιστορία και το όνομα της πλατείας θα μας συντρόφευε για αρκετές ώρες μετά. Το όνομα της πλατείας ήταν Fadimes plats, δηλαδή η πλατεία της Fadime. Η σύντομη ιστορία της Φαντιμέ άνοιξε μία μακρυά και έντονη συζήτηση εκείνο το βράδυ στο τραπέζι μας όπως ακριβώς εκείνη που άνοιξε πριν 15 χρόνια στη Σουηδία και εξακολουθεί να τη στοιχειώνει ως μία ιστορία ντροπής και φόβου.

H Φαντιμέ έφτασε στη Σουηδία όταν ήταν εφτά ετών. Καταγόταν από το Ελμπιστάν, ένα κουρδικό χωριό στη Νοτιοανατολική Τουρκία. Ο πατέρας της Ραχμί είχε μεταναστεύσει στην Ουψάλα λίγα χρόνια νωρίτερα και η οικογένεια τον ακολούθησε στα μέσα της δεκαετίας του '80.

«Το σχολείο και η εκπαίδευση ήταν καλή για την οικογένεια μου μόνο εφόσον μάθαινα να γράφω και να διαβάζω. Θεωρούσαν ότι η ανώτερη εκπαίδευση δεν προοριζόταν για εμένα. Σκοπός ήταν να ολοκληρώσω το σχολείο και να γυρίσω στο χωριό για να παντρευτώ κάποιον Κούρδο. Τον Κούρδο που θα έχουν επιλέξει αυτοί για εμένα. Όταν έφτασα στη Σουηδία και ξεκίνησα το σχολείο, οι γονείς μου μού έλεγαν να μην παίζω με τους συμμαθητές μου που ήταν από τη Σουηδία και να γυρίζω αμέσως μετά το σχολείο στο σπίτι».

Η Φαντιμέ στα 18 της γνώρισε και ερωτεύτηκε τον Σουηδό -Ιρανό Πάτρικ Λιντεσος. Κρύβονταν για έναν ολόκληρο χρόνο από την οικογένεια της ώσπου ξαφνικά τους είδε ο πατέρας της στο κέντρο της Ουψάλα. Χτύπησε και τους δύο ενώ τόσο ο πατέρας της όσο και ο δεκαεξάχρονος αδερφός της απείλησαν το ζευγάρι ότι θα το σκοτώσουν. Η Φαντιμέ και ο Πάτρικ έκαναν μήνυση στην οικογένεια και αποφάσισαν να μετακομίσουν στην περιοχή του Sundsvall.



«Η πρώτη αντίδραση του πατέρα μου ήταν να μας χτυπήσει. Πίστευε ότι ο ρόλος του σωστού πατέρα ήταν να υπερασπίζεται και να προστατεύει την τιμή της κόρης του. Υπέθεσε ότι ο Πάτρικ κι εγώ είχαμε σεξουαλικές σχέσεις. Για τη κουλτούρα του, ήταν σημαντικό να είμαι παρθένα. Υπάρχει ακόμα η παράδοση με το σημάδι από το αίμα στο σεντόνι. Για την οικογένεια μου, ο σκοπός της ζωής μου ήταν να παντρευτώ κάποιον Κούρδο. Από ένα καλό κορίτσι κούρδικης οικογένειας είχα μεταμορφωθεί σε μία ξετσίπωτη που είχε παρασυρθεί από τη ζωή των Σουηδών και τους είχα προδώσει. Αποφάσισα να κόψω τις επαφές με την οικογένεια μου και να μετακομίσω στο Sundsvall. Ο αδερφός μου με βρήκε και με απείλησε. Η κατάσταση πήγαινε από το κακό στο χειρότερο. Ο λόγος για τον οποίο στέλνανε τον ανήλικο αδερφό μου ήταν γιατί ο νόμος δεν θα τιμωρούσε λόγω της ηλικίας του»

Λίγες ημέρες πριν φύγουν με τον Πάτρικ, ο σύντροφος της σκοτώθηκε σε αυτοκινητιστικό δυστύχημα. Η ίδια αποφάσισε να μην φύγει σαν κυνηγημένη αλλά να μείνει στον τόπο όπου μεγάλωσε και γνώρισε τον έρωτα της ζωής της. Παρόλα αυτά, οι απειλές για τη ζωή της από την οικογένεια της δεν σταμάτησαν ακόμα και μετά τον θάνατο του Πάτρικ. Απευθύνθηκε επανειλημμένως στη σουηδική αστυνομία για να λάβει αδιάφορες απαντήσεις.

«Κατήγγειλα τα περιστατικά στην αστυνομία αλλά κανένας δεν με πήρε στα σοβαρά. Αντίθετα, δεν κατάλαβαν καθόλου την επικινδυνότητα της κατάστασης και την απειλή της ζωής μου και με συμβούλεψαν να προσπαθήσω να τα βρω μαζί τους ή να τους μιλήσω και να τους ζητήσω να μην με ενοχλήσουν ξανά».

Η Φαντιμέ βρήκε ως τελευταία λύση τα Μέσα Μαζικής Ενημέρωσης. Στράφηκε στη δημοσιότητα για να προστατέψει τον εαυτό της, να ενημερώσει για την κατάσταση της και την περίπτωση η οποία όπως φάνηκε δεν ήταν η μοναδική στην «παραδεισένια» σουηδική κοινωνία.

«Η περίπτωση μου συγκέντρωσε τεράστιο ενδιαφέρον. Ένας αριθμός παρόμοιων περιπτώσεων αποκαλύφθηκε την ίδια περίοδο σε όλη τη Σουηδία. Έδωσα φωνή και πρόσωπο στην καταπίεση»

Η Φαντιμέ δολοφονήθηκε στις 21 Νοεμβρίου 2002 από τον πατέρα της λίγες ημέρες πριν φύγει για σπουδές στην Κένυα. Είχε βρεθεί με τη μητέρα της και τις δύο αδερφές της στο διαμέρισμα της αδερφής στην Ουψάλα ώσπου χτύπησε η πόρτα. Πηγαίνοντας να ανοίξει, ο πατέρας της την πυροβόλησε δύο φορές στο κεφάλι. Η Φαντιμέ πέθανε στην αγκαλιά της μητέρας η οποία δεν ήταν ικανή να τη σώσει.

Η Σουηδία ταρακουνήθηκε από την μαρτυρία και τον θάνατο της Φαντιμέ. Η κοινωνία διχάστηκε για την αποτελεσματική ενσωμάτωση των μεταναστών και πολλά μέσα μαζικής ενημέρωσης προσπάθησαν να ταυτίσουν τα εγκλήματα τιμής με το Ισλάμ.

Η Anne Patterson και η Unni Wikan στο βιβλίο της : In Honor of Fadime, Murder and Shame προσπάθησαν να αποσυνδέσουν τα εγκλήματα τιμής από τη θρησκεία και από συγκεκριμένες θρησκευτικές κοινότητες.

«Τα εγκλήματα τιμής και η έννοια της τιμής και της ντροπής δεν συνδέονται με τη θρησκεία. Οι έννοιες και οι ιδέες αυτές βρίσκονται σε συγκεκριμένες εθνοτικές ομάδες. Μπορούν να βρεθούν σε διάφορα πολιτιστικά σκηνικά τόσο μέσα στον Δυτικό κόσμο όσο και έξω από αυτόν. Το έγκλημα τιμής δεν αφορά τη θρησκεία αλλά τον κοινωνικό περίγυρο. Τιμή και ντροπή υπάρχουν μόνο εφόσον ο κόσμος γνωρίζει. Το έγκλημα γίνεται για να επικροτηθεί ο θύτης από το κοινωνικό περιβάλλον που θεωρεί την πράξη σωστή. Ακούστηκαν πολλά για τη θρησκεία της Φαντιμέ και το Ισλάμ. Ναι, η οικογένεια της Φαντιμέ ήταν μουσουλμάνοι όχι όμως πιστοί. Δεν ακολουθούσαν βασικούς κανόνες της θρησκείας άρα η πράξη αυτή δεν ήταν απόρροια μίας θρησκευτικής υποχρέωσης. Δεν είχε να κάνει με τον Θεό αλλά με τους ανθρώπους. Αντίθετα, στο Ισλάμ επικρατεί η ιδέα ότι κάθε ανθρώπινο ον είναι υπεύθυνο απέναντι στον Θεό κατά τη διάρκεια της Τελικής Κρίσης. Κανένας άνθρωπος δεν είναι σε θέση να κρίνει έναν άλλον άνθρωπο. 'Ένα χαρακτηριστικό παράδειγμα αποσύνδεσης των εγκλημάτων τιμής από τη θρησκεία είναι η δολοφονία ενός κοριτσιού το οποίο προερχόταν από οικογένεια Παλαιστίνιων χριστιανών και το οποίο αρνήθηκε έναν κανονισμένο γάμο, πριν λίγα χρόνια στη Σουηδία».

Μετά τον θάνατο της Φαντιμέ, οι πολιτικοί είδαν υπό νέο φως τις πολιτικές ενσωμάτωσης των μεταναστών στη σουηδική κοινωνία. Η αντίθεση ανάμεσα στη σουηδική μοντέρνα κοινωνία και σε παραδόσεις όπως εγκλήματα τιμής και κανονισμένοι γάμοι έφερνε σε απόγνωση τους νέους που δεν μπορούσαν να βρουν που πραγματικά ανήκουν. Είναι παιδιά μιας οικογένειας με απαρχαιωμένες αξίες ή μέλη μίας ισότιμης κοινωνίας όπου επιλέγουν ελεύθερα και συνειδητά για τον εαυτό τους;

Το Σοσιαλιστικό - Δημοκρατικό Κόμμα το οποίο βρισκόταν στην κυβέρνηση έδωσε μεγαλύτερες επιχορηγήσεις σε ειδικά κέντρα στήριξης έτσι ώστε να βοηθήσουν νεαρά κορίτσια να αποφύγουν γάμους ή να ξεφύγουν από τη βία της οικογένειας τους. Νομοθετικά, ρύθμισαν το όριο ηλικίας γάμου για τους μετανάστες στα 18 ενώ πριν ήταν στα 15. Η Mona Sahlin, τότε υπουργός Μετανάστευσης είχε δηλώσει για την Φαντιμέ: «Η Φαντιμέ και η λαχτάρα της να ζήσει τη δική της ζωή αποτελούν το ιδανικό πρότυπο για όλες τις νέες γυναίκες. Τα μίντια την αποκαλούν μία μάρτυρα η οποία θυσίασε τη ζωή της για την ισότητα αντρών -γυναικών και για το δικαίωμα να αποφασίσει για τη ζωή της».

Επιθυμία της ήταν η κηδεία της να γίνει στον Καθεδρικό της Ουψάλα, της πόλης που μεγάλωσε και αγάπησε. Θέλησε να ταφεί δίπλα στον αγαπημένο της Πάτρικ στο προτεσταντικό νεκροταφείο της Ουψάλα. 4.000 άνθρωποι συγκεντρώθηκαν στον Καθεδρικό για να αποχαιρετήσουν την Φαντιμέ. Να την αποχαιρετήσουν όχι ένα κορίτσι μίας πατριαρχικής οικογένειας Κούρδων αλλά μία πολίτη της Σουηδίας που είχε το θάρρος να βγει μπροστά και να μιλήσει ανοιχτά για όσα η σουηδική κοινωνία έβαζε κάτω από το χαλί.

Το φέρετρο της κουβάλησαν γυναίκες συγγενείς της ενώ κατά τη διάρκεια της κηδείας της έπαιξαν τα αγαπημένα της κομμάτια: το Tears in Heaven του Eric Clapton, το One των U2 και ένα παραδοσιακό κουρδικό κομμάτι θλίψης από κλαρίνο.

«Έπρεπε να αφήσω όλο μου το παρελθόν και να δημιουργήσω μία νέα ταυτότητα. Έπρεπε να αφήσω την οικογένεια μου. Πλήρωσα πολύ ακριβό τίμημα για αυτό. Δεν μετανιώνω που άφησα την οικογένεια μου αλλά λυπάμαι που ήμουν αναγκασμένη να το κάνω. Η οικογένεια μου έχασε και την τιμή της και την κόρη της. Θα μπορούσε να είχε αποφευχθεί. Εάν η κοινωνία είχε θεωρήσει ότι είναι υποχρέωση της να ενσωματώσει την οικογένεια μου, θα μπορούσαμε να αποφύγουμε όλα αυτά. Εάν η Ένωση Κούρδων είχε βοηθήσει την οικογένεια μου, θα μπορούσε να είχε αποφευχθεί. Δεν νιώθω καμία πικρία αλλά νομίζω ότι είναι σημαντικό να μάθουμε όλοι από αυτό και να μην συμβεί ποτέ ξανά. Νομίζω ότι είναι σημαντικό να μην κλείνουμε τα μάτια μας στην κατάσταση των κοριτσιών από οικογένειες μεταναστών».

Τα αποσπάσματα ήταν από τον λόγο της Φαντιμέ δύο μήνες πριν τον θανατό της.

Την είχε καλέσει η σουηδική Βουλή για να μιλήσει σε συζήτηση για τη βία κατά των γυναικών και για την αποτελεσματική ενσωμάτωση των μεταναστευτικών κοινοτήτων. Στη μνήμη της Φαντιμέ ιδρύθηκε ο οργανισμός GAPF -- Glöm aldrig Pela och Fadime, δηλαδή «Μην ξεχνάς ποτέ την Πέλα και την Φαντιμέ». Σκοπός του οργανισμού είναι να ενημερώνει για τα εγκλήματα τιμής και να προστατεύει όσους απευθυνθούν σε αυτόν ζητώντας μας να θυμόμαστε ότι κάθε χρόνο δολοφονούνται 5.000 γυναίκες για λόγους τιμής. Γυναίκες από όλες τις θρησκείες, τις εθνικότητες, τις κοινωνικές τάξεις και τις πολιτικές πεποιθήσεις.",Η τιμή της Φαντιμέ Σαχιντάλ,http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/georgia-gleoudi/blog-i-timi-tis-fadime-santixal-_b_18198696.html

TELEVISION - Un saut dans le grand bain. Camille Lacourt passe des bassins de natation à la scène de ""Danse avec les stars"" ce samedi 14 octobre sur TF1. Tout juste retraité, le quintuple champion du monde lâche le slip pour les paillettes de la huitième saison de l'émission phare de danse du PAF.

Après avoir tout gagné en individuel et en équipe, Camille Lacourt s'engage dans une nouvelle aventure, dont il pense qu'elle n'ira pas loin. ""J'ai longtemps hésité... parce que je ne sais pas danser!, avoue le champion à Télé Loisirs. Je suis arrivé à un moment de ma vie où j'ai réussi ce que j'avais à faire dans une piscine donc je me suis dit que j'avais le droit d'être ridicule dans un autre domaine de compétence! Je vais essayer de m'amuser"".

J-2 avant le 1er prime!!! Stressé mais heureux 😊😊 Une publication partagée par Camille Lacourt Officiel (@cam_lacourt_off) le 12 Oct. 2017 à 9h06 PDT

C'est donc en équipe, ou plutôt en binôme, que Camille Lacourt va défendre ses chances devant le jury composé de Fauve Hautot, Jean-Marc Généreux, Nicolas Archambault et Chris Marques. Quatre professionnels de la danse qui jugeront des progrès effectués par l'ancien nageur lors de ces dernières semaines de préparation lors desquelles Camille Lacourt a dû apprendre à synchroniser ses mouvements ailleurs que dans l'eau.

Ses bras, ses jambes, et son torse

""C'est un avantage d'avoir été sportif de haut niveau"", concède-t-il à L'Équipe. ""Ce qui me sert, c'est la façon dont j'apprenais les choses dans la piscine. Je ne sais pas comment les autres apprennent, mais j'ai l'impression d'apprendre pas trop doucement. Chez moi, quand j'ai un moment de libre, je visualise les pas. J'ai une bonne conscience de mon corps après le reste, je découvre"".

Le nageur tentera de faire mieux que les sportifs qui l'ont précédé sur la piste de danse de TF1. Si David Ginola, Thaïg Kris, Brian Joubert ou Philippe Candeloro avaient assuré de belles places, Christophe Dominici et Djibril Cissé sont repartis bredouilles. Aucun d'entre-eux n'a jamais remporté le concours.

Accompagné de sa partenaire Hajiba Fahmy qui a dansé pour Beyoncé, Camille Lacourt a dû apprendre à régler son ""problème de bras et de jambes"" qui lui faisait défaut pendant les répétitions, selon elle. Invité sur le plateau de ""C à Vous"" cette semaine, c'est sur un autre atout majeur qu'ont ironisé Arielle Dombasle et Anne-Elisabeth Lemoine.

""Qu'est-ce qui reste?"", a demandé l'animatrice au sujet de ses défauts de danseur. ""Il reste son torse"", s'est esclaffé la comédienne qui participe à l'émission de danse pour la première fois. C'est exactement où voulait en venir la journaliste pour enchaîner sur un diaporama de sa célèbre carrure d'athlète.

En eaux calmes

Vierge de tout scandale, Camille Lacourt devrait échapper au sort qu'avait connu le nageur américain Ryan Lochte pour sa première dans la version américaine. En septembre 2016, le champion olympique de natation avait subi les conséquences de son comportement extra-sportif pendant les Jeux de Rio. En direct sur ABC, des activistes avaient déboulé sur le plateau vêtus d'un T-shirt avec son nom barré.

Quoi qu'il en soit, ce happening n'avait pas entaché le reste de sa participation à la 23e saison de ""Dancing with the Stars"". En duo avec la danseuse Cheryl Burke, Ryan Lochte avait été éliminé après la huitième émission. Il n'avait pas été le plus ridicule, cumulant deux meilleurs scores sur les dix danses proposées, mais aussi la pire note à trois reprises.

Le 22 octobre lors d'une salsa épicée, le juré Bruno Toniolli avait loué la prestation du nageur qui s'était ""déshabillé pour impressionner"", laissant son physique faire le reste devant le public et les caméras.

Diversity Progress In Fashion Is A Step Forward But There's No Time To Be Complacent While there's nothing wrong with being naturally slim and tall, it's not representative of what our society looks like, leading to greater anxiety and fear among people of not being able to live up to what's considered beautiful.

Self-sabotage flavour No. 1: Rationalizing with the snowball effect

Missing one workout is not the same as missing five. One cookie is not the same as seven. One glass of wine is not the same as drinking the bottle. Portions count, and all movement adds up.

Too many of us snowball; we rationalize missing workouts or eating multiple treats by telling ourselves that the damage has already been done, so why not indulge further?

You can compensate for small indulgences. If you let that one choice snowball into multiple indulgences it will take days (even weeks) to get back on track.

I live by the motto, ""It is always easier to keep up than to catch up."" When I want to snowball I use this ""mustard"" image: I imagine what I would do if I spilled a small amount of mustard on my shirt. I would spot treat it immediately. I wouldn't say, ""I spilled this much, so I might as well spill the entire bottle on myself."" Spilling the bottle is the same as eating 10 cookies ""just because you already had one."" Neither makes sense. ""Snowballing"" does not make sense.

""Had to"" statements should be the exception, NOT the norm.

Self-sabotage flavour No. 2: Crying wolf

""I had to skip a workout because of X.""

""I had to eat the fast food because it was all that was available.""

""I had to have frozen pizza because I had no other food in the house.""

If ""had to"" is your go-to, then ""crying wolf"" is your method of self-sabotage.

""Had to"" assumes an external locus of control. To achieve goals you have to hold yourself accountable. Plus, you can't learn from an externalized ""had to"" stance — your future self will continue to make the same mistake. Replace ""had to"" with something like, ""I did not plan in advance, and thus this less-than-ideal choice has become what is available.""

Sure, once in a small while unhealthy choices are unavoidable — life is unpredictable. But most of the time, if we set ourselves up for success, we can plan so that healthy habits are possible.

""Had to"" statements should be the exception, NOT the norm.

Instead of saying you ""had to,"" make your healthy habits convenient (so you don't ""have to"" reach for the chocolate bar) and your unhealthy habits utterly inconvenient. Create ""if ... then"" statements — when you are level-headed — about how to act when your future self is in tricky situations. For example, if I want to overeat while watching TV, then I will knit instead.

Self-sabotage flavour No. 3: The ""I deserve"" mentality

You are not five years old, negotiating with your mom. You are an adult. Don't fall into the ""I went for a 30-minute run today so I deserve all the beer, cake, fried food or [fill in the blank] that I want"" or ""I exercised today so I don't have to feel guilty for watching 10 hours of TV in a row."" What you ""deserve"" is to love yourself enough to make healthy choices.

Self-sabotage flavour No. 4: The ""I am too busy"" excuse

""I don't have time"" is the grown-up equivalent of ""the dog ate my homework.""

Think preparation, preparation, preparation. You will always be too busy if you don't carve out time. Schedule your workouts. Analyze your upcoming week. Troubleshoot possible problems. Come up with solutions. Make a date with a friend or sign up for adult dance classes so the time is reserved.

When you are legitimately too busy to complete a full workout, weave motion into your day. Everyone has time to take the stairs instead of the escalator.

Benefits are moot if you can't stick with a program.

Self-sabotage flavour No. 5: Trying to adopt a method of change counter to your personality

Adopt a method of change that is realistic for you. I am sure that sounds obvious — and it is — but to many of us ignore the obvious and instead adopt every new ""best"" program. Benefits are moot if you can't stick with a program. If you are most successful when you implement changes gradually, be gradual. Try weekly ""add-ons."" If you like radical change, try something akin to the ""180 daily pyramid"" method.

Weekly add-ons. List habits you would like to adopt — eg, eat five or more servings of vegetables daily, drink water or eat fewer fried foods. Commit to one or two changes for a week. Once you successfully complete them for a week, continue on, but add another change the following week. Continue to add on positive changes until you have implemented all of your new healthy habits.

180 daily pyramid. Again, start by making a list of possible changes. Next, ask yourself how long you could realistically maintain all of the changes — maybe two days? Be honest. Commit to being 100 per cent disciplined for those two days, knowing that once you finish your two days you can have a ""normal"" day. After your ""normal"" day, stick to your goals for three days. Once you can do three days, aim for four, then five, and so on. Eventually, your ""normal"" will evolve; your new healthier habits will become the norm. Trust me — taste buds and exercise preferences change.

Main takeaway

Sure, miss the occasional workouts and eat some cake — life is worth living. But own the choice. An unhealthy choice is an unhealthy choice, and every choice has a consequence. Decide if the consequence is ""worth it."" Are you OK not reaching your weekly weight loss goal or having a sugar ""crash"" at work? Act accordingly.

He grew up in a working class household just a cricket ball's throw from the SCG. He played cricket in the park with his brothers every day. And his chief interests in life were -- no prizes for guessing -- cricket, cricket and cricket.

But in other ways, the country which his Pakistani parents Traiq and Fozia Khawaja adopted had a nasty way of telling the youngest Khawaja that he was never one of us.

Khawaja, who is now 30 and has played 24 Tests so far for Australia with a very healthy batting average of 45.47, was five-years-old and spoke no English (but fluent Urdu) when his family of five moved to Australia and rented a tiny two bedroom apartment in inner Sydney.

As he told the website Playersvoice.com.au this week, one day he saw the Australian cricketer Michael Slater drive past in his red Ferrari. ""How good was Australia!"" the impressionable youngster thought to himself. How good indeed.

We hang on his every word these days.

Khawaja did not always have things easy as a kid. When his family shifted to western Sydney, he was often called a ""f---ken curry muncher"", even though -- as he rather amusingly points out -- ""I still don't know how to actually munch curry"".

YOU CAN READ THE WHOLE USMAN KHAWAJA PIECE ON PLAYERSVOICE HERE. IT'S RIPPER STUFF.

Other times kids picked fights with him for no reason. Then came the rise of Pauline Hanson, who again set back his ability to feel part of the Australian community.

While that played out on the wider national stage, Khawaja experienced racial slurs from both players and parents as he rose through the junior cricket ranks, especially when he made runs. And while his natural instinct was to support the Australian cricket team, the young Khawaja found it increasingly difficult to do so. As he wrote on PlayersVoice:

""Everything that was going on in our childhood and around us built up this resentment of the Australian cricket team. I mean, none of them looked like us. I was brought up to believe if I didn't drink alcohol growing up I was un-Australian. So then why should I support a country that doesn't believe in me? I was brought up to be respectful, humble and polite. But when I watched the Aussie team, I saw men who were hard-nosed, confident, almost brutish. The same type of men who would sledge me about my heritage growing up.

Thing changed. Khawaja began to realise that only a minority of Australians held racist views. By high school he cheered wholeheartedly for the Aussie team. But was there a pathway for a boy like him to be part of it?

""So many times I was told by other sub continental parents, 'You will never make it, you're not the right skin colour',"" he recalls. But that just drove him to prove them wrong. And fortunately both for him and for Australian cricket, that's how things turned out.

Australia's first Muslim Test cricketer now says he sees more and more talented Asian Australian players coming through the domestic cricket ranks here. And he believes the door is open for Australian selection, even though, as he wrote in his PlayersVoice piece:

""There is no doubt racism and politics played a large roll [sic] in selections in the past.""

""What I do know is Australian cricket is slowly changing and will finally have a chance to reflect what Australia really is. An international team truly representative of its richly diverse population,"" Khawaja wrote.

Weinstein was fired Sunday as co-chairman of the company he founded with his brother Bob amid a wildfire of sexual harassment claims that has worsened every day since and now includes several allegations of rape and investigations by both US and UK police. A spokesperson for the 65-year-old has said the “allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied.”

The avalanche of claims was set-loose by a New York Times scoop that disentombed the industry’s rotten underbelly, that was, until this week - often whispered about, but seldom spoken of aloud.

Jumaan Short/Facebook Jumaan Short has urged the film industry not to forget that sexual harassment is also prevalent at ""the bottom"" of the business

Tinseltown’s shine was smeared further still by denouncements from its A-list, including Meryl Streep, who exclusively told HuffPost Weinstein’s behaviour was “disgraceful” and “inexcusable”.

In an interview on Thursday night actor Emma Thompson widened the scope of the Weinstein scandal saying the “predator” was just the top of an “iceberg” and his behaviour was “endemic” of the Hollywood system, and mirrored in society.

The Oscar-winner lamented that women had been subjected to “belittling, bullying and interference” since “time immemorial”.

BBC Oscar-winner Emma Thompson said the Weinstein scandal is just the top of the 'iceberg'

“So what we need to start talking about is the crisis in masculinity, the crisis of extreme masculinity, which is this sort of behaviour, and the fact that it is not only ok but that it is also represented by the most powerful man in the world at the moment,” she said, in a much lauded interview.

Lesser-known actress, Jumaan Short, furthered Thompson’s narrative in a blog for HuffPost UK on Friday where she urged the acting community - and society as a whole - not to be blinkered by the made-in-Hollywood scandal, saying the ‘casting couch’ mentality was in-action to the very outskirts of the industry.

“The ‘casting couch’, as many articles are now stating is the norm, is accepted, is nothing new and has been going on for years. Yet while people are complaining about what is happening at the top of the ladder in the industry, not enough are talking about what happens at the bottom.” Actress Jumaan Short

Short continued: “Myself and fellow actors - not just women but men too - have countless stories of abuse and harassment when trying to get work.”

The Londoner, working as a stand-in for Penelope Cruz on movie Nine, detailed how even in such a lowly position, she hadn’t failed to register on Weinstein’s sexual radar - while waiting to use a portaloo:

The first thing that struck me about him was that he’s a big man. Tall, broad, so he stands out. Coupled with his powerful position I can see how he could be intimidating. One day, when I wasn’t needed on set I went to use one of the mobile toilets. On my way out there was Harvey. Don’t get me wrong, he wasn’t following me, he must have been on his way somewhere, maybe to the toilets too, but I was surprised to see him in front of me, and then he spoke! Now it was unusual to be spoken to by anybody ‘of any position’ on set (stand-ins were barely noticed), so I was taken aback by this large famous figure talking to me outside the Portaloo. He asked who I was, which was even weirder and so I mumbled nervously and with embarrassment, ‘I’m just Penelope’s stand in’. He then asked me if I wanted to go out with him, but I felt so awkward and couldn’t believe my ears, that I rushed off pretending I didn’t even hear and, after a couple of days, if I remember correctly he was gone. Perhaps you’re feeling disappointed that this isn’t one of the more shocking stories that have appeared in recent days like Ambra Battaliana’s or Ashley Judd’s and that the headline has misled you, but perhaps if I hadn’t been so frightened, or the circumstances had been different, I might have found myself in one such awkward position. I don’t know whether anyone else on the set of Nine had similar encounters with Weinstein but there were lots of beautiful, young, Italian female dancers there - it being a musical - who may have had their own experiences. Since that time, out in the acting world I’ve consistently heard rumours and stories about him all tallying with the exposes that are now appearing. That’s why no one I know was surprised when the story broke.

Short goes on to state that, along with her fellow actors - not just women but men too - “have countless stories of abuse and harassment when trying to get work” and how advice on how to advance in the industry included how to deal with uncomfortable sexual advances.

In part of the advice, she was told: “You’ll meet horrible people, because you know that’s how the industry is, it’s really competitive, there are thousands of actors just like you and you’re not an English rose so you have to work harder and people will treat you like shit and if someone wants to go out with you, make out like you’ll sleep with them, but then don’t, cos you have to be polite and lovely to everyone or you’ll get sacked or you won’t work at all, in fact you’ll never work again, it’ll be over, so make sure this is really what you want to do.”

Short said she was never “put in a position” or had slept with anyone for a role, “or even, God forbid” been raped, but said she had been “promised fame and fortune by numerous film folk with the gift of the gab”.

“In the end, I could always smell the rat and left as fast as I could,” she said.

Bloomberg via Getty Images More than a dozen women have made claims against Weinstein who is now being investigated by police in both the US and UK

Short recalled how an American director had “insisted I go and stay where he was because he said ‘we’d need a couple of days to discuss things’ and that all the locations were there”, only for him to drive her to “the most remote house in the middle of nowhere where he said I could stay with him alone”.

“The two of us were alone in this empty house, I was frightened, all kinds of thoughts came into my head, we were in the countryside. No one would hear me scream. No one would rescue me,” she wrote in her blog.

Later, as part of an audition, Short said, the “much older, unattractive” director urged her to “kiss his neck” while she was being filmed, something she felt “completely uncomfortable” with and resisted.

“But he kept telling me to kiss him, and I didn’t. I just held back tears as the camera rolled. It’s hard for me to admit this, but I even remember thinking, ‘I must be a bad actress if I can’t do this’.”

Short never got the part and never spoke of the incident, as she felt “so stupid and humiliated for getting myself in that situation”.

“It’s understandable, then, why when it comes to Weinstein these famous actresses wouldn’t want to say they went to Harvey’s hotel room, because apart from the fear their careers would be ruined by speaking out, in general people assume the worst - that you did sleep with him. They judge, you feel ashamed, they think how could you be so stupid, when you were completely innocent.”

On another occasion, Short recalled how a director wanted her to stay at his house, which she did because she had got the job on his show through her then agent. Arriving on set Short did not reveal she had stayed over to the cast, but did when she “discovered he’d hired 10 female actors in the hope that he’d get to sleep with one!”

Javier Barbancho / Reuters Short had a run-in with Weinstein while being a stand-in for Penelope Cruz

Short: “When I refused him, he actually uttered the clichéd words, ‘I’ll make sure you never work again’, and never gave me the final payment.”

In Bollywood, director’s motives were even more transparent: Short said a director asked her to meet to discuss a project, but then admitted “he fancies me”, there was no job, and that “in Bollywood you have to sleep your way to the top”.

Short said now that she is “older and wider” she has learned to avoid “these situations” and said she looks forward to getting “even older and less attractive because then auditioning could actually be about the work”.

“Some men in the business, and even male actors, if they don’t fancy you won’t want to work with you, won’t hire you, don’t even want to talk to you. It’s like you’re not worthy,” Short said.

“My stories are just the tip of the iceberg. There are many that are worse, and naturally not all the men I meet in the business are like Weinstein. I’m not even remotely famous, but even now as I write this, I feel some fear about speaking out. You don’t want to be seen as a ‘troublemaker’ or ‘difficult to work with’. Even now the brainwashing is affecting me.

Elizabeth Dale said: “I’m completely disgusted with the new Dove advert.","A model who starred in the controversial Dove advert that was branded “racist” by many, has spoken out to say she is “not a victim”.

Lola Ogunyemi said as a Nigerian woman, born in London and raised in Atlanta, she has grown up aware that models with darker skin are rarely seen in the media, so she “jumped” at the chance to be the face of a global campaign.

“Having the opportunity to represent my dark-skinned sisters in a global beauty brand felt like the perfect way for me to remind the world that we are here, we are beautiful, and more importantly, we are valued,” she wrote in a piece for the Guardian.

She added that some of the clips circulating on social media do not show the full advert and as such, the ad’s message has been “misinterpreted”.

The Dove campaign, which appeared on Facebook in GIF form, showed a black woman, Ogunyemi, removing her t-shirt to reveal a white woman underneath.

The images went viral after American makeup artist Naomi Blake shared the photos on social media.

In the Guardian article, Ogunyemi said the full Dove TV advert intended to “highlight the fact that all skin deserves gentleness”. However, this message was lost in the 13-second clip that appeared on Facebook.

The model went on to suggest she did not know the images would be edited in this way.

“If I had even the slightest inclination that I would be portrayed as inferior, or as the ‘before’ in a before and after shot, I would have been the first to say an emphatic ‘no’,” she said.

In response to the backlash the advert received, Dove said in a statement: “This did not represent the diversity of real beauty which is something Dove is passionate about and is core to our beliefs, and it should not have happened.

“We have removed the post and have not published any other related content. We apologise deeply and sincerely for the offence that it has caused.”

The brand may have apologised, but for many this is not enough. In a HuffPost UK video, five black women spoke out about the advert, with many saying the apology fell short.

Elizabeth Dale said: “I’m completely disgusted with the new Dove advert. With their apology, they didn’t acknowledge anything or any wrong doing.”

Amel Mukhtar added: “It was incredibly racially insensitive and showed a vast ignorance of a history in which blackness has been linked to dirtiness, to uncleanliness.”

Ogunyemi said that while she agrees that Dove should have apologised for any offence caused, she believes the company could have “defended their creative vision” and the initial decision to use a dark-skinned model",Model At Centre Of 'Racist' Dove Ad Speaks Out: 'I Am Beautiful And I Will Not Be Erased',http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lola-ogunyemi-model-controversial-dove-ad_uk_59dc94b9e4b0208970cf6791

NSW Greens state MP David Shoebridge and federal Greens senator Lee Rhiannon have come out against the Pardus LAX 12 MF shotgun, which is now available in Australia. MF stands for magazine fed, referring to the detachable ammunition magazine which can be quickly detached from the firearm and a new one inserted. The shotgun is advertised on the company's website as having ""the feeling of a more tactical usage as well fast loading with detachable magazines with different capacities"".

The Pardus is similar to the Adler shotgun -- which sparked intense and protracted debate in Federal Parliament before being moved into the most restricted firearm category last year -- in that it is a lever-action weapon. The Greens and Gun Control Australia say the 12-gauge Pardus is of more concern than the Adler due to its magazine feature, which means the gun can be reloaded faster than a conventional shotgun.

The Pardus LAX 12 MF

""The magazine is the concern for this one. It's quick release, you push the button on the side and the magazine drops out then you feed in another one. It's the same magazine as an AR assault rifle,"" Samantha Lee, chair of Gun Control Australia, told HuffPost Australia.

""The Adler had a tube magazine, the magazine is a tube inside the firearm. But with this one, you drop out the magazine and replace it. It can be a five or ten-shot magazine. There are very little restrictions on the purchasing of magazines.""

Videos posted online claim the Adler shotgun and the Pardus LAX -- the predecessor to the LAX MF, which does not have the same assault rifle-like magazine of the MF but instead a tube magazine like the Adler -- were very similar in terms of speed and ease of reloading.

A video posted by a Hunter Valley gun shop marvels at ""how fluent (sic) this action and mag system work"", showing how the weapon's magazine can be detached and a new one inserted within just three seconds.

Lee said most states had categorised the Pardus MF as a category A weapon, the least restricted category, while NSW, Queensland and the ACT had classed it in category B as a general hunting rifle. She said she would like to see it moved to the higher and more restricted categories of C or D, which would vastly limit the shotgun's availability.

The most recent data available from the Australian Institute of Criminology suggested there were 2.5 million registered firearms in Australia, belonging to 731,567 individual licence holders.

Senator Rhiannon said the Greens wanted far tighter limits placed on the Pardus MF, while Shoebridge claimed it was ""more dangerous"" than the Adler.

""Its a threat to public safety. It's effectively a semi-automatic weapon because it's such a rapid fire weapon that loads so quickly,"" Rhiannon told HuffPost Australia.

""It's at least as dangerous as the Adler. It certainly looks like an automatic weapon and for some people buying these guns, the look is very attractive. The fact it's designed to look like an assault rifle, and how quickly it fires, shows how the gun lobby is running rings around the Federal Government.

""This is a very dangerous weapon.""

Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon

David Auger is the manager of Queensland Gun Exchange, one Australian retailer which stocks the Pardus. He denied the weapon was as fast to reload as was claimed, saying it was ""a bit awkward"" to reload, and that it had legitimate uses for game hunting.

""I wouldn't say you can quickly replace [the magazine], I'd say it's quicker than the tube magazine but it's not that quick...we're talking not much quicker,"" he told HuffPost Australia.

""Lever action shotguns have been around for over 100 years. It's nothing new. This is emotional rubbish,""

When asked why someone would need to reload five or ten rounds into a shotgun as fast as the Pardus design allows, Auger said:

""Think about it. If you're pig shooting, and you've shot five pigs and there's five more pigs, you want to keep shooting.""

""People like different things, some people like a [Ford] Falcon and some like a 4WD. Why do you need it? Because individuals like the look of different things.""

Rhiannon said she would be pushing for the Federal Government to take action on the Pardus at a national level, and criticised both the Coalition and Labor for presiding over what she saw as a weakening of Australia's gun laws.

""Between the Adler coming into Australia, now this Pardus, the gun lobby has had a very successful year in 2017. You hear the Prime Minister go out there after the recent massacre in Las Vegas saying we're proud of our strong gun laws, but they're now riddled with holes due to the weak position his govt has taken,"" she said.

Rhiannon last year told HuffPost Australia that she was concerned about the rising power of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party in NSW, who held influence in that state parliament. She said the party, as well as what she sees as a growing power in the gun lobby, were eroding Australia's gun laws.

Despite Australia's pride in its strict gun laws and landmark National Firearms Agreement after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, not one state or territory has ever fully complied with the weapons control instrument, a new report revealed last week.

The influence of the Shooters party has grown to the extent that former Prime Minister John Howard wrote an open letter to country NSW voters ahead of planned state by-elections in Murray and Cootamundra this weekend, urging them not to vote for that party.

""The Shooters first priority is to fundamentally weaken our existing firearms laws, introduced by the Howard-Fischer government after the Port Arthur tragedy. We can't take a risk on a party with such dangerous policies,"" Howard and his former deputy PM Tim Fischer wrote.

""All the parties have been responsible for cosying up to the shooters and not confronting these issues,"" Rhiannon said.

""The next stop will be in Senate estimates, to dig into how this decision was made and really looking at the inconsistencies around the National Firearms Agreement, to explore the loopholes allowing this to occur.

We have a long way to go before the stigma of talking about mental health is completely gone, especially for men.

But for the three hosts of ""The Sex And Suicide Podcast,"" nothing is off limits. This includes talking about their depression, anxiety and even being sexually abused.

The men, based in London, Ont., have created a raw and profanity-laced podcast to encourage others to be just as brutally blunt and honest about their own mental health struggles.

Their flagship series, Soulfire Sundays, features hosts Shawn Evans, Scott Milne, and Paulie O'Byrne sitting on a couch cracking jokes while opening up about their personal experiences. One episode centred on Evans' anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications, while another was about O'Byrne's cognitive behavioural therapy treatment.

Evans, who created the podcast, said their unorthodox style resonates with their growing base of 20,000 fans on Facebook and YouTube.

""I think people typically only get this type of information thrown at them in a lecture setting or by someone with clinical training,"" Evans told HuffPost Canada in an interview. ""But we're just three guys that have been through it.""

It used to only be that if you're a man you need to 'tough it out' or 'we don't talk about our feelings or our emotions.' Shawn Evans, ""The Sex And Suicide Podcast"" creator​​​

""It's so needed. So many guys have that stigma that they shouldn't be emotional,"" Milne said. ""But society has built us up to have these egos where we don't ask for help or know how to.""

Milne, who is a professional bodybuilder, pointed out that mental illness doesn't care about how much someone can bench press. The hosts' mantra is: if it's OK for them to talk about it, anyone can.

""I don't have a problem talking about it. Half the time I don't even realize the camera (and mic are) on,"" Milne laughs.

Evans adds, ""It makes people feel like they're not alone. It used to only be that if you're a man you needed to 'tough it out' or 'we don't talk about our feelings or our emotions.'

""Everybody needs to live more open, honest and transparent lives and share their stories.""

Earlier on HuffPost: Only one in five Canadian youth who need mental health services get them

O'Byrne is extremely candid about being sexually abused by his hockey coach over 11 years ago. His abuser was convicted of sexual assault and served three months house arrest and 18 months probation.

""It was the hardest blow to me emotionally and mentally,"" O'Byrne said. The day of the sentencing was the first time he ever attempted to take his own life.

So when the group talks about sex on the podcast, he said it can be hard to dredge it all up. But O'Byrne refuses to ignore his past.

""I've been to too many funerals because of stigma,"" he said. ""It breaks my heart when I have to go to a funeral because someone ended their life to suicide.""

In addition to speaking about mental illness on college campuses, O'Byrne is the founder of the not-for-profit group, I'm One-In-Five. It's named after the statistic that one in five Canadians is affected by addiction, mental illness, trauma, and victimization.

Paulie O'Bryne is a public speaker and co-host of ""The Sex And Suicide Podcast.""

Evans asked O'Byrne to join the podcast this May after seeing him speak. O'Byrne was drawn to the podcast's simplicity and rawness.

""It's just three guys on a couch. We could be your three brothers or three uncles having a candid conversation,"" O'Byrne said. ""If we're talking about solutions, we're not talking about problems anymore.""

Mental illnesses like his social anxiety and depression are lifelong challenges and O'Byrne says that's OK.

""I'm in a safe, comfortable place to talk about where these people are not going to judge me about what I've been through — that's what gives me peace of mind,"" he noted.

""We get through it (struggles) together.""

A big factor in starting the podcast came when Evans was forced to confront society's perception of him — on reality TV.

Haha you break it you buy it! Great night 😊 @kaitlynbristowe @brittkarolina #TheBachelorette #BachelorFamily A post shared by Shawn Matthew Evans (@realshawnevans) on Jun 2, 2015 at 5:39am PDT

Evans was a contestant on the 11th season of ABC's ""The Bachelorette."" On the show, he was a partier, who indulged in drinking.

Off-camera he said he was prone to self-medicating and drinking even more when he felt tense.

Now approaching two years sobriety, Evans says the experience altered his life because ""it made me look at how people saw me and change my ways, and for that I'm appreciative.""

Lost roommate to suicide

But his mission to normalize talking about mental health really developed after his roommate, who struggled with addiction, took his own life on Christmas Eve. He died only a month after he had made a pact with Evans to stay sober.

""I have maintained that promise to my best friend to stay sober, because it somehow makes me feel closer to him and keeps him alive in my heart,"" Evans says.

""Had I been more comfortable talking openly about mental health, suicide in particular, with my best friend, maybe I could have better helped him and potentially saved him.""

Evans began devoting himself to sexology education, facing his anxiety and volunteering at mental health facilities in his hometown of London, Ont. to better understand mental illness firsthand.

Had I been more comfortable talking openly about mental health .. maybe I could have better helped him and potentially saved him. Shawn Evans, ""The Sex And Suicide Podcast"" creator

He also toured college campuses talking about mental health and sexual consent with Spencer Rice from the TV show, ""Spenny Vs. Kenny.""

""It was at a time when Donald Trump [didn't seem] to know what consent was,"" Evans said, referring to the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape, where the now-president of the United States bragged about sexual assault.

Previously On HuffPost:

""At the end of the college tour, there were so many questions from the students coming up and asking me,"" said Evans, now a certified sex coach. ""I thought, 'I have to develop something where they can reach out or we could post information on a regular basis.'""

The podcast has expanded to other series like Mental Health And Motivational Mondays, where it invites people to share their success stories to help inspire the audience.

Listeners have heard the story of Lee Thibeault, who adapted to living in a wheelchair after a motorcycle accident. They've also met social media personalities like Dan Shaba who created ""The Pun Guys,"" who simply post funny videos involving puns.

Their other series, Woman Crush Wednesday, focuses on female empowerment and dispelling notions of toxic masculinity. They've featured a woman talking about cutting herself and another's struggle with cancer and a miscarriage.

The more we share this stuff.. it makes people feel like they're not alone. Shawn Evans, ""The Sex And Suicide Podcast"" creator

O'Bryne says there are too few public resources devoted to talking about mental health. Having a handful of days like Bell's Let's Talk Day or Mental Health Day on Oct. 10 are good but not enough.

""Why don't we talk about it every day? It's one of the biggest epidemics on the planet right now — suicide, addiction and mental health.""

Evans says he wants to meet more of the people who are reaching out to them on their videos.

""Or maybe have people share their own stories and talking it out with them.""

""Everyone has a story to be heard. No one's is more important than the next person's,"" he states. ""The more we share this stuff and talk about it and show that it's OK to be spoken about — it makes people feel like they're not alone.""

Eine Kirche der Zukunft ist „Salz der Welt"" (Mt 5,13)

Die Gesellschaft und Welt von heute sehnt sich massiv nach gelebten, guten Werten sowie nach Menschen, die diese Werte aus ganzem Herzen leben und verkörpern.

Christsein ist in der Tat eine solche Bewegung, die sich auf den Weg gemacht, dem Auferstandenen nachzufolgen. „Die des Weges sind"" war denn auch der erste Nickname der Jesus-Nachfolger.

Statt irgendwelchen Moden und Hypes nachzueifern, ist für Christen zunächst klar: das Feuer des Geistes ist der Auslöser für alles, was die Dynamik des Lebens und christlicher Be-Geist-erung ausmacht und angeht.

„Die Gesellschaft hat uns eingeredet, wir sollten unser Leben lang wie ein 18-jähriges Modelaussehen. Aber ich denke, ich kann genauso gut auch das sein, was ich bin.""

Clint Eastwood

Vor Jahren erlebte ich Clint Eastwood bei der Eröffnung eines Celebrity Golf-Turniers in Pebble Beach (Kalifornien). Ich war angetan von seiner lässigen, individualistisch-fokussierten Art, die einfach nur „da war"", ohne Habitus und großes Gehabe. Ich empfand ihn als jemanden, der keinen Modetrends nachstrebt, sondern einfach „sein Ding"" macht, ohne Etikette-Floskeln. Einer, der sich nicht irritieren lässt von Fremderwartungen und falschen Vorgaben.

Christsein, das Salz der Erde, wie es Jesus in Matthäus 5 in der Bergpredigt formulierte, ist ein Leben, das sich aus der Gotteswahrheit, aus dem Willen Gottes speist und nicht nach den Modevorgaben aktueller It-Geister fragt.

Eine von Christus begeisterte Christenheit

Die leidenschaftliche, aber reflektiert-beherzte Gläubigkeit wäre ein Gegengift gegen eine schematisch- regelhaft und leblos-leer daherkommende Form von Christentum, das die Welt und die Menschen nicht mehr erreichen kann.

Hier kann man bei der Volksmusik eine Menge lernen: da flammt immer wieder echte Herzensbegeisterung auf; egal, und ob man nun auf einem Konzert von Helene Fischer, von Die Schäfer oder bei Hansi Hinterseer ist. Hier spürt man eine Vibration, die selten in christlichen Kontexten anzutreffen ist. Wobei etwa Gemeinden, die in der Hillsong-Tradition arbeiten - oder auch bei einem Blick über den Teich zu Joel Osteen und seiner Lakewood Church - sieht man, dass die Landeskirche deutscher Couleur nicht der Gral der Wahrheit (Weisheit) ist.

Das Christsein hat grundsätzlich mit Begeisterung für den Auferstandenen zu tun: sein Tod am Kreuz, seine Auferstehung bereiteten den Boden für eine von Schuld und Sünde befreite Existenz.

Den Ruf des Auferstandenen hören und ihm nachfolgen. Damit beginnt alles""

„Denn also hat Gott die Welt geliebt, dass er seinen eingeborenen Sohn gab, auf dass alle, die an ihn glauben, nicht verloren werden, sondern das ewige Leben haben.""

Den Blick auf Christus zu richten: darauf käme es in der Tat entscheidend an.

„Seid ihr nun mit Christus auferweckt, so sucht, was droben ist, wo Christus ist, sitzend zur Rechten Gottes."" (Kolosserbrief, Kap. 3, Vers 1)

Doch in Sachen Begeisterung ist basal zu bedenken, dass diese sehr langsam reifen kann und von einer schnell verpuffenden Erregung zu unterscheiden ist:

„Begeisterung ist immer ruhig, immer langsam und bleibt innig. Der plötzliche Ausbruch ist nicht Begeisterung und auch nicht aus ihr hervorgegangen, er kommt aus einem heftigen Zustand. Man soll auch die Begeisterung nicht mit dem Schwung verwechseln, der aufregt, während jene bewegt.""

Joseph Joubert

Wichtig ist, dass die Kirche, dass die aktiven Gemeinden auf die Welt, auf die Menschen zugehen. Dass sie sich nicht hinter herrlichen eigenen Gemäuern in ihrem eigenen Sumpf „verschanzen"" und einigeln. Das geht nur allzu schnell.

Dabei wären in Zeiten der multimedialen Einflussnahme, der Chat-„Boutiquen"", der Twitter-Präsidenten, der Instagram-Influencer und eines generell äußerst durchmediatisierten kontemporären Lifestyles die Formen, in denen wir das Evangelium verkörpern/präsentieren, alles andere als zu vernachlässigen.

Die „Denke"" der Menschen zu begreifen und ihnen auf ihrer Ebene begegnen: den Reichen in ihrer Sprache, den Armen, den Kranken, den Frustrierten, den Gelangweilten so begegnen, dass sie eine offene Tür zum Ergriffensein sehen können und Gottes Geist eine Brücke durch die Art unserer Vermittlung hat.

„Die Kirche, die zu den Menschen geht, kommt mit ihnen ins Gespräch. Jugendliche lassen sich begeistern. Gut inszenierte Projekte ziehen die Menschen an und bewegen sie zum Mitmachen. Glaubensinhalte lassen sich vermitteln, wenn die Darstellung stimmt."" (I. Schwaetzer)

Theologie kann Herz und Denken vereinen und Impulse setzen

Meine einjährige Studienzeit am London Bible College (heute: London School of Theology) hat mir zu Beginn meiner akademischen Vita beigebracht, dass lebendiger Gottesglaube und Begeisterung für Jesus bestens mit hoher Wissenschaftlichkeit einhergehen bzw. damit verbunden werden können.

„Das Herz macht den Theologen."" (August Tholuck)

Eine Theologie, die sich der Wahrheit und der Dynamik des Glaubens verschreibt, wäre heute mehr denn je dran. Eine Theologie, die sich einem geistfreien Denkkonzept und rationalistischen Deutekurven verschreibt und diesen frönt, sollte nicht mehr als eine zeitgemäße Form der Gotteskunst erachtet werden. Eine Hermeneutik, die von tiefem Glauben und großer Leidenschaft für Gott und sein Wort geprägt ist, könnte für Kirche und Gesellschaft Fulminantes leisten und neue Horizonte erschließen helfen.

Ich sehne mich nach Formen von Christsein, die einfach das „Dasein"" der bekehrten und zu Christus gewandten Menschen zur Geltung bringt.

Nach Lebens- und Denk-Foren, in denen sich das Evangelium natürlich erzeigt, ohne in subkulturell-seltsamen Gemeindekulturen geradezu zu verkommen, wo eine oft mobbinghafte Form interaktionaler Fehlhaltung die Szene und das Miteinander dominiert, ohne dass diese frommen Sub-Welten noch in irgendeiner Form als gesund oder gar „göttlich"" bezeichnet werden könnten.

Wir bräuchten ein exodushaftes Christsein, das wieder markante und ungespielte Impulse setzt. Das auf natürlich-herzliches Echtsein, auf klare Verkündigung und vorbehaltlosen Glauben sowie auf die Kraft der göttlichen Liebe (Agape) und der Auferstehungshoffnung setzt.

Martin Luther hat den Exodus-Modus echten Christseins einfach auf den Punkt gebracht:

„Wir sind immer auf dem Wege und müssen verlassen, was wir kennen und haben, und suchen, was wir noch nicht kennen und haben.""

Wobei wir dabei immer auf eine klare Form der Einkehr achten sollten, die uns guttut und unsere geistliche Gestaltungskraft aufrecht erhält:

„Merke auf den Sabbat deines Herzens, daß du ihn feierst, und wenn sie dich halten wollen, mache dich frei, oder gehe zugrunde.""

Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (1768 - 1834)

Und Nahles, das hat ""Maybritt Illner"" gezeigt, ist schon ganz in der Rolle der Oppositionsführerin.","Bei ""Maybrit Illner"" zeigt sich SPD-Fraktionschefin Nahles in Angriffslaune

Beim Thema soziale Gerechtigkeit lachte sie FDP-Vize Kubicki aus

Doch die möglichen Jamaika-Partner FDP und Grüne entdeckten viele – teils überraschende – Gemeinsamkeiten

""Jamaika in, Gerechtigkeit out?“, fragte Maybrit Illner. Nachdem zuletzt die Debatte über die Aufnahme und Integration von Flüchtlingen die Phase der Annäherung zwischen Union, FDP und Grünen bestimmt hatte, sollte es in der ZDF-Talkshow um die Sozialpolitik der so ungleichen möglichen Partner gehen.

Dass Gerechtigkeit zumindest nicht ""in“ ist, musste die neue SPD-Fraktionsvorsitzende Andrea Nahles am Wahltag feststellen. Die SPD fiel auf ihr schwächstes Wahlergebnis der Nachkriegsgeschichte – nachdem man sich so dick wie lange nicht das Wort ""Gerechtigkeit"" auf die rot-weiße Fahne gepinselt hatte.

Bei Illner gab Nahles jetzt zu: ""Wir Sozialdemokraten haben nicht die richtigen Themen getroffen."" Dann wandte sie den Blick nach vorne und griff das mögliche Jamaika-Bündnis an: ""Es wundert mich, dass die Jamaika-Koalition in Schleswig-Holstein einen Antrag eingereicht hat, der den Mindestlohn aushöhlt.""

Kontra bekam die bisherige Arbeitsministerin dann gleich von FDP-Vize und Schleswig-Holstein-Chef Wolfgang Kubicki. Es gehe bei der angestrebten Abschaffung der Dokumentationspflicht nicht – wie von Nahles behauptet – um den Abbau von Arbeitnehmerrechten. ""Das ist Quatsch. Das ist doch völliger Unsinn"", warf Kubicki ein.

► Zum Hintergrund: Als ""Dokumentationspflicht"" versteht man die Pflicht, dass geringfügig Beschäftigte ihre genaue Stundenanzahl notieren müssen, um für diese den Lohn ausgezahlt zu bekommen. Der FDP-Vize sieht darin eine ""komplett irre Bürokratie"".

Kubicki betonte, der Mindestlohn an sich solle überhaupt nicht angetastet werden. Nahles fing an spöttisch, fast selbstzufrieden, zu lachen: ""Aber er wird hinten rum aufgemacht, ja?""

Die SPD-Politikerin, die sich von Kubicki mehrfach vorwerfen lassen musste, in der Regierung selbst nicht für eine sozialere Politik gesorgt zu haben, setzte hier bereits den Ton für die zukünftig angestrebte Oppositionsarbeit.

""Deshalb freue ich mich auch über die Opposition, die dann ja vehement dafür Sorge tragen wird, dass Jamaika sozialere Politik macht, als es die Sozialdemokraten bisher getan haben"" spottete Kubicki.

Da wurde Nahles angriffslustig: ""Das ist nicht die neue FDP, das ist wieder ganz die alte. Aber Sie haben ja gesagt, Sie wollen die sozialste Politik ever machen.“

Kubicki und Trittin sind sich einig wie selten

Während sich FDP und SPD so erwartungsgemäß fleißig beharkten und einen Vorgeschmack dafür lieferten, wie sich die Debatten nach dem Ende der Großen Koalition wieder verschärfen könnten, kam es auf der Seite der möglichen Jamaika-Partner zu erstaunlichen Annäherungen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Der Pflegenotstand in Deutschland ist gravierend - schon die Änderung eines Satzes im Pflegegesetz könnte helfen

Als Nahles wieder einmal über den ""digitalen Kapitalismus"" meckerte, meldete sich Grünen-Urgestein Jürgen Trittin zu Wort. Seine Idee: ""Der Bund verkauft endlich seine letzten Telekom-Anteile, und nutzt sie endlich, um Glasfaser zum letzten Haushalt zu verlegen.""



Kubicki schaute den Parteilinken fast ungläubig an. Dann: ""Ich habe ja heute gelernt, dass entgegen meinen Vorurteilen manche Vorstellungen von Jürgen Trittin ganz vernünftig sind.""



Ein erster Flirt der oft so unversöhnlichen Parteien. ""Das ist FDP-Programm"", erklärte Kubicki. ""Nein, das ist grünes Programm"", entgegnete Trittin. Am Ende ist es vielleicht Jamaika-Programm?

Auch Trittin und Nahles harmonieren

Doch auf ganz neue Wege begab sich Trittin nicht – er machte auch der SPD ein Versprechen. Eine Flexibilisierung der Arbeit, wie sie auch DIW-Präsident Marcel Fratscher bei Illner forderte, sei nur unter bestimmten Bedingungen denkbar.

Es brauche 11-Stunden-Ruhephasen und den Achtstundentag, war Trittin überzeugt. Auch Nahles sprach sich dafür aus. Fast entgeistert fragte sie Kubicki, als der davon schwärmte, die besten Ideen oft am späten Abend zu haben: ""Wollen sie jetzt die Arbeitszeiten deregulieren – oder wie, verstehe ich das...?""

Kubicki entgegnete, das genau das bereits passiere. Und auch CSU-Frau Ilse Aigner setzte unter das Projekt ""Flexible Arbeitszeit"" ihren Stempel: ""Wir wollen keine Mehrarbeit, sondern mehr Flexibilität in der Arbeit.""

Eine Koalition hat diese TV-Runde zumindest nicht unwahrscheinlicher gemacht. Und Nahles, das hat ""Maybritt Illner"" gezeigt, ist schon ganz in der Rolle der Oppositionsführerin.

Une mise en examen aurait pu être fatale à ce macroniste de la première heure, lui qui avait déjà dû renoncer à son portefeuille de ministre de la Cohésion des territoires après l'ouverture d'une enquête préliminaire sur ses anciennes activités à la tête des Mutuelles de Bretagne.

""Lavé de tout soupçon"" et ""plus libre de parler à nouveau de l'avenir de notre pays"", ce proche du président de la République peut donc désormais espérer un retour en grâce gouvernemental. Un scénario que personne n'exclut tout à fait dans la majorité LREM à l'heure où des rumeurs insistantes annoncent une refonte de l'exécutif. ""Il va vouloir jouer à fond la carte 'je suis blanchi par la justice' et revenir vite au gouvernement. Peut-être même plus vite qu'on ne l'imagine"", prend les paris un député LREM.

Interrogé à ce sujet par Le Figaro, Richard Ferrand se montre prudent sans insulter l'avenir. ""Je me considère comme étant au service du pays et du président de la République et je veux être utile là où on pense que je peux l'être le plus"", esquive le député du Finistère tout en rappelant que ""la composition du gouvernement ne [lui] appartient pas"". Une chose est sûre: Richard Ferrand n'est pas candidat à la présidence de La République En Marche, un autre poste qui aiguise les ambitions au sein de la majorité.

""Comme une odeur de remaniement""

Depuis plusieurs jours, une agitation certaine a saisi les troupes d'En Marche!, certains ministres étant annoncés sur le départ ce qui pourrait entraîner un jeu de chaises musicales entre l'exécutif, le groupe et le parti. Jacques Mézard, le successeur de Richard Ferrand au ministère de la Cohésion des territoires, ""veut repartir au Sénat pour finir sa carrière tranquillement, il n'a pas trouvé le bon rythme et le bon ton au gouvernement, il s'emmerde"", confie un député. Qui mieux que son prédécesseur pour reprendre la place qu'il a dû céder?

Alors que certains phosphorent sur un hypothétique aller-retour de Richard Ferrand, le nom de Hugues Renson, actuellement vice-président de l'Assemblée, circule pour lui succéder à la présidence du groupe. Un possible lot de consolation pour le député de Paris alors que La République En Marche va bientôt devoir rétrocéder deux vice-présidences aux Républicains.

Le macroniste du premier cercle Benjamin Griveaux, aujourd'hui secrétaire d'Etat à Bercy, est lui tantôt annoncé promu, tantôt exfiltré pour prendre la présidence de La République En Marche. Pour la présidence justement, une élue LREM ne voit que ""Benjamin Griveaux et Christophe Castaner (le porte-parole du gouvernement, NDLR). Ils sont là depuis le début, ils ont tout les deux le même niveau de légitimité, que ce soit aux yeux du PR, des parlementaires ou des militants"".

A moins qu'une femme finisse par s'imposer. Ce vendredi, la députée de Paris Olivia Grégoire n'a pas exclu de candidater mais ferait aussi une excellente secrétaire d'Etat en remplacement de... Benjamin Grivaux. ""Il y a comme une odeur de remaniement, particulièrement ces dernières heures avec certains qui font acte de candidature à des postes comme s'ils espéraient des choses"", ironise un élu LREM.

En attendant Pénicaud

Reste que le remaniement tant attendu n'a rien d'une évidence, tout comme le retour au sommet de Richard Ferrand. Blessé par la campagne qu'il a subie ces quatre derniers mois, le député du Finistère a adressé une lettre aux élus de son groupe qu'il a assurés de sa ""volonté de poursuivre"" à leurs côtés ""la mise en œuvre du projet de transformation"" du président. Dans un communiqué, l'ancien ministre estime que des ""échéances importantes nous attendent, avec l'examen des budgets de la Nation et de la Sécurité sociale"". Manière de se projeter à l'Assemblée au moins jusqu'à la fin de l'année.

Il est par ailleurs probable qu'Emmanuel Macron préfère attendre que l'enquête judiciaire sur la ministre du Travail Muriel Pénicaud soit scellée avant de procéder à un réajustement de son exécutif.

Un député met en garde tout le monde: ""les gens ont beau s'activer dans tous les sens, il n'y en a qu'un qui décide. C'est Macron"".

Pretoria – Police have arrested several suspects in a significant breakthrough in what has been dubbed the ""airport-following"" robberies, committed in and around the Johannesburg area, News24 reported.

Police spokesperson, Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, said the breakthrough came on Friday evening, following arrests made by police members based at the OR Tambo International Airport (ORTIA) and the Johannesburg East Cluster.

""The team, acting on information, monitored a security vehicle and discovered that this vehicle, which is contracted to work at OR Tambo International Airport, was following a sedan from ORTIA travelling towards Sandton,"" he said.

Naidoo said the security vehicle was stopped with two occupants inside. He said police discovered that one of the occupants, a security company manager, was wanted for a case of possession of an unlicensed firearm and an armed robbery in the Limpopo province.

""The security company manager, as well as a second occupant in the security vehicle, were immediately arrested,"" he said.

Naidoo said the team had worked throughout the night and during the early hours of Saturday morning, and arrested a further four suspects in the Hillbrow area.

""All six suspects are between 23 and 38 years of age. A seventh suspect managed to escape and he is still at large but being sought by the police,"" he said.

""Several incriminating items, including the security vehicle, a sedan, passports, at least 15 cellular phones and several luggage bags have been recovered in Hillbrow.""

Naidoo said the team also recovered two pistols which will be sent for ballistic testing to establish which crimes, if any, they may have been used in.

""The team is also investigating the possibility that these may have been the same suspects that are responsible for the robbery of seven foreign visitors at Colette Drive this past Thursday night,"" he said

Deputy national commissioner responsible for policing, Lieutenant General Fanie Masemola, complimented both the teams of OR Tambo International Airport and the Johannesburg East Cluster for a job well done.

""The sterling work by these teams has brought us a step closer to cracking these incidents of 'airport-following' robberies and they must be commended,"" said Masemola.

""However, our job does not end here, we will still have a lot to do to solve the many robberies that were committed and to prevent new ones from taking place and we won't rest until we reach a positive outcome,"" he said.

DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS via Getty Images Jeremy Corbyn told the Co-Operative Party Conference the Tories were 'transparently failing' on Brexit

As Brexit negotiations continue, the prime minister has said that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.

But Corbyn warned in his speech that a no-deal Brexit could mean “economic disaster” in “sector after sector”.

“The risk would be that key manufacturers leave for the European mainland, taking skilled jobs with them,” he warned.

“Theresa May’s Cabinet of chaos is risking a jobs meltdown across Britain.

“A powerful faction of the Tories want a no-deal outcome because they think they can use it to turn our economy into a deregulated tax haven. We must not let them.”

Corbyn also mocked Chancellor Philip Hammond’s claim at Conservative Party Conference earlier this month that Labour represents “an existential challenge to our economic model”.

“Well Philip, yes we do,” Corbyn said, adding the party would not “sit back” while homelessness spiralled.

“Their economic model is broken,” he added of the Tories.

Empics Entertainment Chancellor Philip Hammond told Conservative Conference that Corbyn's Labour represented 'an existential challenge to our economic model'

The Co-Operative Party does not field its own political candidates but 38 Labour MPs were elected on a joint ticket with the party.

Corbyn also hit out at Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, accusing both of them of “macho posturing” in the war of words between the two countries over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.

He said: “We live in a world riven by conflict, spurred on by ego and neo-imperial ambition.

Ihre Haut ist dünn und verletzlich. So wie die Flügel eines Schmetterlings. Es gibt nur wenige Momente im Leben der Zwölfjährigen, in denen sie ihre Krankheit vergessen kann. Die meisten davon erlebt sie an einem Ort, der im ersten Moment nicht danach klingt, als könnte es für ein an Epidermolysis bullosa leidendes Mädchen ein Happy Place sein: auf dem Rücken eines Pferdes.

Knöpfe oder Nähte, kleine Stöße. Dinge, die uns im Alltag begleiten und passieren können, stellen für Alinas Haut eine enorme Gefahr da. Eine unbedachte Bewegung, ein Moment der Unachtsamkeit – und schon reißt ihre Haut auf. „Unser Leben ist ein einziges Aufpassen“, sagt Alinas Mutter, Michaela Schierholz. Kleinigkeiten, die gesunde Menschen kaum kümmern, können für ihre Tochter gravierende Folgen haben. Selbst in der Schule. Wenn sie zu lange am Stück schreibt, fängt ihre gesamte Hand an zu bluten.

Und dann äußert Alina den Wunsch, reiten zu wollen. Reiten. Einer viel größeren Gefahr könnte sich Alina kaum aussetzen. Wo doch selbst der Gartenschlauch im heimischen Garten, über den sie im vergangenen Sommer gestolpert war, für Wochen voller Kummer und Sorgen gesorgt hatte. Doch auf dem Rücken von Therapiepferd Maggy ist die Zwölfjährige ein ganz normales Mädchen. Nur ein kleines Fell, das auf dem Sattel liegt, und zu harte Stöße dämpfen soll, unterscheidet sie von anderen pferdeverrückten Fast-Teenagern.

„Wenn ich auf Maggy reite, merkt sie sofort, wenn ich unsicher bin. Dann hält sie sofort an.“ Alina findet ihr Glück auf Maggys Rücken. Und allmählich ist auch Mama Michaela deutlich entspannter, wenn sie zum Reitunterricht fahren. „Anfangs bin ich tausend Tode gestorben“, erzählt sie. Immer hatte sie bange Fragen im Hinterkopf: Was passiert, wenn Alina vom Pferd fällt? Was, wenn im Stall etwas passiert? Passiert ist in den anderthalb Jahren, in denen Alina nun schon Reitunterricht nimmt, aber noch nichts.

Michaela Schierholz vertraut nicht nur Maggy, sie sieht auch, wie das Reiten ihre Tochter verändert hat. Alinas Gleichgewichtssinn hat sich deutlich verbessert. Die Folge: Sie fällt seltener hin als noch vor der Verwandlung zum „Pferdemädchen“. Und selbstbewusster ist die Zwölfjährige geworden. Nicht nur in der Arbeit mit dem Pferd. Sondern generell. „Maggy ist einfach toll“, sagt Alina. Das zarte Mädchen und das massige Kaltblut. Ein Bild voller Gegensätze – und voller Liebe.

Porträt: Reit-Therapiezentrum der Stiftung Synanon Berlin

Einmal in der Woche, immer freitags, fahren Alina und Mama Michaela auf den Hof der Stiftung Synanon in Berlin-Frohnau. In dieser Einrichtung werden unter anderem Suchtkranke betreut. Und seit drei Jahren wird dort auch heilpädagogisches Reiten angeboten. 13 Kinder und 3 Erwachsene mit unterschiedlichsten Krankheiten nehmen hier regelmäßig Reitunterricht. Autisten, Querschnittsgelähmte, Gehörlose, eine Frau mit multipler Sklerose und Alina.

Sie alle vereint, dass sie ein Leben leben, das sich zu einem großen Teil in Arztpraxen, Krankenhäusern und bei Physiotherapeuten abspielt. Doch der beste Therapeut, darin sind sich alle einig, heißt Maggy. Die 18-jährige Tinker-Stute ist eins von drei Therapiepferden auf dem Hof. Fernab vom Großstadt-Lärm schafft dieses sanfte Wesen etwas, das ihren Reitern weder Ärzte noch Medikamente geben können. Einen Moment der Freiheit, in dem sie den Augenblick genießen – und ihre Krankheiten keine Rolle spielen.

Auch Reitlehrerin Petra Mächold sieht, dass sich Alina in den vergangenen anderthalb Jahren verändert hat. „Ihre ganze Körperhaltung war zusammengekauert. Sie hatte permanent Angst, sich zu stoßen.“ Wer heute sehe, wie selbstbewusst und gerade Alina auf dem Pferd sitzt, könne sich kaum vorstellen, dass sie einmal anders gewesen ist. Was Alina beim Reiten am meisten Spaß macht? „Galoppieren natürlich! Da fühl ich mich so herrlich frei.“

Das einzige Manko: Hippotherapien werden nicht von Krankenkassen übernommen. Weil laut Bundesministerium für Gesundheit „ein therapeutischer Nutzen der Hippotherapie nicht nachgewiesen ist und die Therapie daher als nicht verordnungsfähiges Heilmittel zu führen ist“. Das heißt: Betroffene, die diesen Weg der Therapie gehen wollen, müssen ihn aus eigener Tasche bezahlen oder versuchen, ihn über Spenden zu finanzieren.

It took one hour and 29 minutes to reach a peak altitude of 37,007 metres.

The teacake, which landed in a tree in Galloway Forest Park, was said to be “pretty intact” after the adventure.

The experiment was streamed on Facebook, with 33,000 people watching.

GSC chief executive Dr Stephen Breslin said: “We engage people with space science every day, and we thought what better way to spark people’s imaginations and interest in STEM than for us to launch something into space ourselves.

“We are delighted by how many people joined us at GSC, and online, to watch Terry’s space adventures.”

Writing on the Brighton Sunday Roast Club page, Pat Obyrne told other local residents: “I am disabled, love roast dinners but live on my own, no car, very lonely, but have not got a big appetite.”

It wasn’t long before she began to receive kind messages from strangers, with many offering to take Pat out to dinner or inviting her to their family homes.

In response to Pat’s message, one woman said: “Hi Pat, you’d be welcome round ours for a roast, as long as you don’t mind sharing the table with a cheeky toddler! We could pick you up.”

Another couple added: “We would love to accompany you for a roast, and would be very happy to pick you up and take you home, we can go anywhere you like! Lots of places do half-size portions for smaller appetites, so no worries there.”

Local restaurants have also commented on the post, offering to host Pat and her guests for free.

The Brighton Sunday Roast Club page was originally set up so locals could share details of places to find good food, but Kefi Chadwick, one of the four admins who manage the page, said she’s happy its purpose has evolved.

“I was delighted by the response to Pat’s piece, but not that surprised,” she told HuffPost UK.

“By and large we have very nice members who are engaged in their community - hence their interest in where’s good locally to go. I love that a page about roasts can also make someone feel connected to others.”

Pat’s post follows research released by disability charity Sense earlier this year, which showed one in four people avoid conversations with disabled people, resulting in “epidemic” levels of loneliness.

Commenting at the time, Rachel Reeves MP, co-chair of the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness, said: “Many of the barriers to building social connections for disabled people are practical ones, such as the need for accessible transport and buildings, financial support and appropriate social care; but public attitudes also play a part in the risk of loneliness for people with disability.","'Lonely' Disabled Woman Asks Facebook For Roast Dinner Companion, The Reaction She Gets Is Beautiful",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lonely-disabled-woman-asks-facebook-for-roast-dinner-companion-and-the-reaction-she-gets-is-beautiful_uk_59e084ece4b03a7be57fadd6

Republican Bob Corker, who previously called Trump’s volatile White House an “adult day care centre” and warned the president could start World War Three, said Trump’s tweets dismissing Tillerson’s negotiation efforts were narrowing America’s options on dealing with countries like Iran and North Korea.

Trump, who was condemned worldwide for refusing to certify the nuclear deal with the “fanatical regime” in Iran on Friday, tweeted two weeks ago to say Tillerson was “wasting his time” by trying to negotiate with North Korea and told him to “save your energy”.

...Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2017

The tweet came the day after Tillerson had told a news conference in Beijing that America was directly communicating with North Korea on its nuclear and missile programme but it had shown no interest in dialogue.

“You cannot publicly castrate your own secretary of state,” Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told The Washington Post.

He added that Trump’s undermining Tillerson and diplomatic channels pushed America towards a “binary” choice of either going to war with countries like North Korea or leaving them to develop nuclear weapons.

Corker said: “When you jack the legs out from under your chief diplomat, you cause all that to fall apart... Us working with [Beijing] effectively is the key to not getting to a binary choice.

“When you publicly castrate your secretary of state, you take that off the table.”

Corker has already been a target of Trump’s Twitter tirades. Trump has claimed Corker wanted to be his Secretary of State and said he was responsible for the “horrendous” Iran deal.

Tillerson is among the most senior officials in Trump’s Cabinet and White House who remains in his job, after a series of high profile resignations and firings.

According to Buzzfeed, he agreed to a three-way “suicide pact” with Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnunchin to all resign together if Trump tries to remove any of them.",Donald Trump Accused Of 'Castrating' Rex Tillerson With Tweets,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/14/donald-trump-rex-tillerson_n_18266098.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&amp;ir=UK

Es müsse in Deutschland möglich sein, Vorschläge seriös zu diskutieren

Der Vorschlag von CDU-Innenminister Thomas de Maizière, in Gegenden mit vielen Muslimen auch muslimische Feiertage einzuführen, stößt bei den Sozialdemokraten auf offene Ohren. ""Man muss über den Vorschlag nachdenken"", sagte SPD-Chef Martin Schulz am Samstag der Deutschen Presse-Agentur.

Schulz geht es dabei offenbar weniger um den konkreten Vorschlag, als um eine faire Debatte um die Idee.

""Ich hab vor allen Dingen zur Kenntnis genommen, in welcher Art und Weise sofort gegen den Herrn de Maizière aus seinen eigenen Reihen losgekoffert wird"", sagte der SPD-Chef.

Der Vorschlag des Innenministers habe ihn überrascht, sagte Schulz am Rande einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung in Hildesheim. ""Herr de Maizière ist ja sonst in dieser Hinsicht nicht der Fantasievollste.""

""Wo es Moslems gibt, kann man darüber nachdenken""

De Maizière hatte sich bei einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung in Wolfenbüttel offen gezeigt, in bestimmten Regionen Deutschlands muslimische Feiertage einzuführen.

Allerheiligen sei auch nur dort Feiertag, wo viele Katholiken lebten, erklärte er. ""Wo es viele Moslems gibt, warum kann man nicht auch mal über einen muslimischen Feiertag nachdenken.""

Er war dafür aus den Reihen der Union heftig kritisiert worden.

CDU-Innenexperte Wolfgang Bosbach etwa sagte der ""Passauer Neuen Presse"": ""Wir haben eine christlich-jüdische religiöse Prägung, keine islamische. Daher verstehe ich auch nicht, warum wir jetzt diese Debatte führen.""

Weiter sagte der ehemalige Bundestagsabgeordnete: ""Ich würde etwas anderes thematisieren: Wann haben endlich Christen in allen islamischen Ländern die gleiche Religionsfreiheit wie die Muslime bei uns?""

CSU-Mann Stephan Mayer betonte in der Diskussion ebenfalls die ""christliche Tradition"" Deutschlands.

Der Vorwurf: Einkommensschwache Deutsche werden im Stich gelassen

Jetzt meldet sich der Mieterbund zu Wort - mit einer klaren Ansage

Es ist nur ein Ausschnitt einer Zeitungsseite, aber er wird gerade tausendfach von Rechten im Netz geteilt.

Darauf zu sehen sind vier Wohnungsgesuche von Flüchtlingshelfern für syrische Familien, außerdem eine Anzeige einer alleinerziehenden Mutter.

Die Anzeige wurde schon im Frühjahr in der ""Südwestpresse"" geschaltet, sorgt allerdings jetzt erst für Aufregung.

Flüchtlinge erschwerten ""Normalbürgern"" die Wohnungssuche, weil deren Miete ""nicht vom Amt"" komme, schreibt etwa die neurechte Bloggerin Anabel Schunke auf Facebook. Der hier lebende Bürger sei der Dumme.

""Ich kann den Ärger verstehen""

Solche Kommentare landeten auch bei den Flüchtlingshelfern, die in der Anzeige aufgeführt sind. Im Umlauf ist der Ausschnitt nämlich ohne geschwärzte Namen, Telefonnummern und Mailadressen.

Einer* sagte im Gespräch mit der HuffPost: ""In einem Fall wurde mir von einem Anrufer gesagt, dass er es ekelhaft fände, was ich mache. Meine Antwort war: Ich finde es ekelhaft, was Sie machen. Und dann habe ich aufgelegt.""

Eine* andere sagte: ""Ich kann den Ärger verstehen. Nicht nur Flüchtlinge, sondern viele andere in Deutschland haben Hilfebedarf bei der Wohnungssuche. Es gibt viel Not, und je mehr Leute sich in irgendeiner Weise für andere stark machen und das in vielen Bereichen, nur dann wird die Not geringer.""

Falscher Eindruck

In den Kommentaren auf Facebook jedoch soll der Eindruck erweckt werden, dass Deutsche, die es ohnehin schwer auf dem hartumkämpften Wohnungsmarkt haben, bei ihrer Suche alleine gelassen werden.

Die rechten Nutzer glauben, dass deutsche Staatsbürger chancenlos um Wohnungen konkurrieren würden und am Ende gar auf der Straße landen könnten, während der Flüchtling mit seiner Familie im Warmen sitze.

Was ist dran an diesen Vorwürfen?

Der Mieterbund jedenfalls sieht das Problem der Wohnungsnot nicht bei den Flüchtlingen - sondern darin, dass n den vergangenen Jahren in Deutschland viel zu wenige Wohnungen gebaut wurden.

In Deutschland fehlen rund eine Million Wohnungen

""In den letzten Jahren ist viel zu wenig neu gebaut worden, insbesondere in Städten ist die Nachfrage nach Wohnungen deutlich höher als das Angebot"", sagt Ulrich Ropertz, Geschäftsführer des Deutschen Mieterbundes, der HuffPost.

400.000 neue Wohnungen müssten pro Jahr gebaut werden, rechnet Ropertz vor. Davon mindestens 80.000 Sozialwohnungen. Nach Wohnungen würden unter den Asylbewerbern eigentlich nur die anerkannten Flüchtlinge suchen. ""2017 dürften es 140.000 sein"", sagt Ropertz.

Zum Vergleich: Studienanfänger, die ebenfalls in vielen Fällen nach einer Wohnung suchen, gab es in diesem Studienjahr 507.779. Flüchtlinge leisten so nur ein kleinen Beitrag zu einem großen strukturellen Problem.

In Deutschland fehlten zurzeit rund eine Million Wohnungen – ein Fehlbestand, der sich über Jahre aufgebaut habe und jetzt Schritt für Schritt abgebaut werden müsse.

Aber haben Flüchtlinge tatsächlich einen Vorteil, weil ihre Mietzahlung vom Amt gesichert ist?

Ropertz findet das ""zweifelhaft"". Zumindest habe noch nie jemand behauptet, dass es ein Vorteil auf dem Wohnungsmarkt sei, ALG-II-Bezieher zu sein. ""Auch hier übernimmt die Stadt die Wohnkosten zu 100 Prozent"", sagt Ropertz.

""Flüchtlinge dürften es ausgesprochen schwer haben""

Mehr noch: ""Tatsächlich dürften es Flüchtlinge auf dem Wohnungsmarkt ausgesprochen schwer haben"", sagt Ropertz.

Wie alle einkommensschwächeren Personen hätten sie Probleme, eine Wohnung zu finden. ""Hinzu kommen auch Vorurteile potenzieller Vermieter und Sprachschwierigkeiten.""

You've probably heard of mindfulness. These days, it's everywhere, like many ideas and practices drawn from Buddhist texts that have become part of mainstream Western culture.

But a review published recently in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science shows the hype is ahead of the evidence. Some reviews of studies on mindfulness suggest it may help with psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and stress. But it's not clear what type of mindfulness or meditation we need and for what specific problem.

The study, involving a large group of researchers, clinicians and meditators, found a clear-cut definition of mindfulness doesn't exist. This has potentially serious implications. If vastly different treatments and practices are considered the same, then research evidence for one may be wrongly taken as support for another.

At the same time, if we move the goalposts too far or in the wrong direction, we might lose the potential benefits of mindfulness altogether.

So, what is mindfulness?

Mindfulness receives a bewildering assortment of definitions. Psychologists measure the concept in differing combinations of acceptance, attentiveness, awareness, body focus, curiosity, nonjudgmental attitude, focus on the present, and others.

It's equally ill-defined as a set of practices. A brief exercise in self-reflection prompted by a smart-phone app on your daily commute may be considered the same as a months-long meditation retreat. Mindfulness can both refer to what Buddhist monks do and what your yoga instructor does for five minutes at the start and end of a class.

To be clear, mindfulness and meditation are not the same thing. There are types of meditation that are mindful, but not all mindfulness involves meditation and not all meditation is mindfulness-based.

Mindfulness mainly refers to the idea of focusing on the present moment, but it's not quite that simple. It also refers to several forms of meditation practices that aim to develop skills of awareness of the world around you and of your behavioral patterns and habits. In truth, many disagree about its actual purpose and what is and isn't mindfulness.

Researchers studying the efficacy of mindfulness treatments should compare them to credible alternative treatments, whenever possible.

What's it for?

Mindfulness has been applied to just about any problem you can think up -- from relationship issues, problems with alcohol or drugs, to enhancing leadership skills. It's being used by sportsmen to find 'clarity' on and off the field and mindfulness programs are being offered at school. You can find it in workplaces, medical clinics, and old age homes.

More than a few popular books have been written touting the benefits of mindfulness and meditation. For example, in a supposedly critical review Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes your Mind, Brain and Body, Daniel Goleman argues one of the four benefits of mindfulness is improved working memory. Yet, a recent review of about 18 studies exploring the effect of mindfulness-based therapies on attention and memory calls into question these ideas.

Another common claim is that mindfulness reduces stress, for which there is limited evidence. Other promises, such as improved mood and attention, better eating habits, improved sleep, and better weight control are not fully supported by the science either.

And while benefits have limited evidence, mindfulness and meditation can sometimes be harmful and can lead to psychosis, mania, loss of personal identity, anxiety, panic, and re-experiencing traumatic memories. Experts have suggested mindfulness is not for everyone, especially those suffering from several serious mental health problems such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Research on mindfulness:

Another problem with mindfulness literature is that it often suffers from poor research methodology. Ways of measuring mindfulness are highly variable, assessing quite different phenomena while using the same label. This lack of equivalence among measures and individuals makes it challenging to generalise from one study to another.

Mindfulness researchers rely too much on questionnaires, which require people to introspect and report on mental states that may be slippery and fleeting. These reports are notoriously vulnerable to biases. For example, people who aspire to mindfulness may report being mindful because they see it as desirable, not because they have actually achieved it.

Only a tiny minority of attempts to examine whether these treatments work compare them against another treatment that is known to work -- which is the primary means by which clinical science can show added value of new treatments. And a minority of these studies are conducted in regular clinical practices rather than in specialist research contexts.

A recent review of studies, commissioned by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, found many studies were too poorly conducted to include in the review and that mindfulness treatments were moderately effective, at best, for anxiety, depression, and pain. There was no evidence of efficacy for attention problems, positive mood, substance abuse, eating habits, sleep or weight control.

What should be done?

Mindfulness is definitely a useful concept and a promising set of practices. It may help prevent psychological problems and could be useful as an addition to existing treatments. It may also be helpful for general mental functioning and well-being. But the promise will not be realised if problems are not addressed.

The mindfulness community must agree to key features that are essential to mindfulness and researchers should be clear how their measures and practices include these. Media reports should be equally specific about what states of mind and practices mindfulness includes, rather than using it as a broad term.

Mindfulness might be assessed, not through self-reporting, but in part using more objective neurobiological and behavioural measures, such as breath counting. This is where random tones could be used to 'ask' participants if they are focused on the breath (press left button) or if their mind had wandered (press right button).

Researchers studying the efficacy of mindfulness treatments should compare them to credible alternative treatments, whenever possible. Development of new mindfulness approaches should be avoided until we know more about the ones we already have. Scientists and clinicians should use rigorous randomised control trials and work with researchers from outside the mindfulness tradition.

And lastly, mindfulness researchers and practitioners should acknowledge the reality of occasional negative effects. Just as medications must declare potential side effects, so should mindfulness treatments. Researchers should systematically assess potential side effects when studying mindfulness treatments. Practitioners should be alert to them and not recommend mindfulness treatments as a first approach if safer ones with stronger evidence of efficacy are available.

A continuación, algunas de las mejores películas poco vistas de los últimos años que vale la pena que veas:

Winter's Bone/Invierno Profundo (2010):

La película que dio a conocer a Jennifer Lawrence, antes de X Men: First Class y The Hunger Games. Un thriller realista y bastante brutal sobre una adolescente Ree Dolly (Lawrence) en búsqueda de su padre desaparecido, que traficaba con drogas en la comunidad redneck de las montañas Ozark. ¿Está vivo o muerto? La protagonista emprende una peligrosa odisea para averiguarlo, mientras tiene que actuar como madre sustituta para sus hermanos pequeños. La directora debutante Debra Granik logra una de las mejores películas americanas del siglo y que le mereció a Jennifer Lawrence su primera nominación al Oscar como Mejor Actriz, a los 20 años. Winter's Bone muestra el Estados Unidos blanco, olvidado y pobre, relegado del boom económico y dominado por la violencia. Te guste o no Jennifer Lawrence, vale la pena ver esta película dura y feroz, y premonitoria en el retrato impactante de la clase blanca marginada que llevó a Trump a la presidencia.

Whiplash/Música y obsesión (2014): ​​​​

#Whiplash‬ is the story of dreams and drums. Drummers, unite! Let's get loud. #EvansDrumHeads ‪#drumfam‬ http://sonypictur.es/NWP1mz Una publicación compartida de Whiplash (@whiplash.movie) el 27 de Feb de 2015 a la(s) 10:56 PST

¿No entendiste por qué tanto escándalo por La La Land? Ve la primera película de su director, Damien Chazelle, que es muchísimo mejor y que deslumbró por su brillantez. Si alguna vez has tenido un maestro o mentor brillante, pero destructivo, esta es la película que tienes que ver para hacer catársis. Una especie de Black Swan masculino, Whiplash sigue a un joven baterista que cae bajo la influencia de un maestro excepcional pero sádico. Genio contra disciplina, juventud contra madurez, no son temas nuevos. Pero Chazelle dirige su película como una pieza musical, llena de energía y estilo, alcanzando una intensidad absolutamente hipnótica. Por este filme Chazelle sí merecía el Oscar que se llevó el año siguiente por La La Land. Grandes actuaciones de Miles Teller y JK Simmons, este último se llevó el Oscar a Mejor Actor de Reparto por este papel.

Tangerine (2014):

Una excelente comedia urbana, grabada en un celular y estelarizada por unas prostitutas transgénero. Suena extravagante y aunque no te guste lo extravagante, dale una oportunidad, te vas a reír. Filmada por el director Sean Baker en su teléfono, la película recuerda las primeras películas de Almodóvar y de Spike Lee: libre, desparpajada, irreverente y muy chistosa. Es la saga de Alexandra, una prostituta negra, que junto con su amiga, Sin Dee (también negra y transgénero) emprende una búsqueda por Los Ángeles para encontrar a su novio padrote, que aparentemente le fue infiel. Una serie de aventuras delirantes ocurren a continuación involucrando a todo tipo de personajes de Los Ángeles: taxistas, policías, amas de casa, dealers, prostitutas, todo en tono de comedia. Si quieres ver algo diferente, Tangerine es la onda.

Kill the Messenger/ Maten al mensajero (2014):

Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye de Los Avengers) estelarizó y produjo esta excelente película basada en un hecho real y relevante para la historia de la guerra contra las drogas. Renner encarna al periodista Gary Webb, que reveló en una exclusiva en los 90 los nexos entre la CIA y el narcotráfico en el periódico regional San Jose Mercury News. La película sigue a Webb desde la investigación que lo lleva descubrir esta oscura alianza hasta la posterior campaña de desprestigio que el gobierno y los medios establecidos (incluyendo el New York Times y el Washington Post) le hacen para destruir su reputación, alegando que la historia es falsa. Notable por ser el tipo de cine de suspenso y de denuncia política que ya casi no se hace, una película al estilo de Todos los hombres del presidente. Dirigida por Michael Cuesta.

A Dangerous Method/Un método peligroso (2011):

Una película fascinante sobre Freud y su discípulo y posterior rival Carl Jung, y sobre la mujer que fascinó a ambos, primero como paciente y después como colaboradora, Sabina Spielrein. Cualquiera interesado en el psicoanálisis y la historia de las ideas debería ver esta película que rescata la vida de una mujer brillante y trágica —que debería ser más conocida— y que fue crucial en el desarrollo de las ideas de Jung. Es también la historia del romance sin final feliz de Jung y Spielrein, y un estudio fascinante sobre cómo la psicología conquistó al mundo. Gran actuación de Keira Knightley apoyada por Michael Fassbender como Jung y Viggo Mortensen como Freud. Aunque atípica en la obra del respetado director de culto David Cronenberg (La mosca, Cosmopolis), aquí logra no sólo una de sus mejores películas, sino también atípico para él, una de sus más emotivas.

Cette phrase, prononcée par Jane Fonda dans une interview accordée à la BBC ce jeudi 12 octobre, témoigne du tabou qui existe dans les affaires de harcèlement sexuel. Car l'actrice était au courant des accusations d'agression sexuelle et de viol portées contre Harvey Weinstein depuis un an. Mais cette omerta ne s'applique pas seulement au cas du producteur américain ni à Hollywood.

Ce silence existe aussi dans n'importe quel milieu professionnel. Pour Marie Pezé, docteur en psychologie, psychanalyste et expert auprès de la Cour d'appel de Versailles, celui-ci s'explique par le fait que ""trop souvent, le harcèlement sexuel au travail est vécu comme une affaire privée ou personnelle. C'est aux femmes de se débrouiller seules pour se sortir de ces situations, alors qu'il existe un cadre légal très solide"", explique-t-elle au HuffPost.

L'employeur et les salariés responsables de la santé physique et mentale des collaborateurs

En France, les articles L4121 et L4122 du code du travail fixent un cadre juridique: le chef de l'entreprise doit protéger la santé physique et mentale de ses salariés en terme de résultat. Il est légalement obligé de mettre en place une organisation du travail saine.

Il en est de même pour le salarié d'une entreprise, qui doit prendre soin de ""sa santé et de sa sécurité"", mais également de celle de ses collègues, sinon, il s'agit d'une ""omission"".

- Article L4121: ""L'employeur prend les mesures nécessaires pour assurer la sécurité et protéger la santé physique et mentale des travailleurs. Ces mesures comprennent: des actions de prévention des risques professionnels, des actions d'information et de formation, la mise en place d'une organisation et de moyens adaptés. L'employeur veille à l'adaptation de ces mesures pour tenir compte du changement des circonstances et tendre à l'amélioration des situations existantes"".

- Article L4122: ""Conformément aux instructions qui lui sont données par l'employeur, dans les conditions prévues au règlement intérieur pour les entreprises tenues d'en élaborer un, il incombe à chaque travailleur de prendre soin, en fonction de sa formation et selon ses possibilités, de sa santé et de sa sécurité ainsi que de celles des autres personnes concernées par ses actes ou ses omissions au travail"".

Marie Pezé, qui a créé la première consultation ""Souffrance & Travail"" en 1997, détaille: ""Cela signifie que les salariés sont responsables de la santé de leurs collègues. S'ils constatent qu'une femme ne s'habille plus comme avant, qu'elle commence à perdre du poids ou à en prendre, qu'elle a des crises de larmes, qu'elle va mal, il relève de la posture citoyenne d'aller la voir et de lui dire 'que puis-je faire pour t'aider?' afin qu'elle puisse se confier"".

Contactée par Le HuffPost, Marilyn Baldeck, déléguée générale de l'Association européenne contre les violences faites aux femmes au travail (AVFT), ajoute: ""Si ces informations remontent jusqu'à l'employeur, il est supposé réagir et doit s'en saisir. Quand un salarié est par exemple qualifié de 'dragueur' ou de 'cavaleur', cela cache bien souvent un discours qui relève d'une infraction pénale ou d'un comportement incompatible avec la démarche de l'entreprise ou le contrat de travail"".

""Le médecin du travail peut agir""

Mais quand on est témoin de harcèlement sur son lieu de travail, comment agir concrètement? Marilyn Baldeck explique: ""Ce sont des salariées qui se confient à d'autres sur le harcèlement sexuel dont elles sont victimes. La rumeur a donc le statut d'information. La question est de savoir ce que les personnes qui ont reçu cette information sont supposées en faire. Si on parle de 'rumeur', personne ne va jamais rien faire, car ce ne sera pas pris au sérieux"".

Marie Pezé conseille tout d'abord d'aller parler aux acteurs de l'entreprise, à savoir, dans un premier temps, le médecin du travail, même si ces rumeurs paraissent infondées. ""Le médecin du travail a le droit d'aller faire des visites de service et des visites de postes. Comme il a vu des salariés en consultation, il sait des choses. De plus, il est inscrit au Conseil de l'ordre et donc soumis au secret médical. Le médecin du travail peut vraiment agir et mener une enquête"".

Mais il est aussi possible d'aller se confier à un délégué syndical ou un délégué du personnel, et même à l'inspecteur du travail, soumis au secret professionnel. ""Comme il est membre de droit du Comité d'Hygiène, de sécurité et des conditions de travail (CHSCT), il peut mettre le sujet sur la table sans citer personne. (...) Si le collègue ne parle pas, il devient un témoin passif et collabore à ce que la situation perdure. C'est une forme de complicité passive, voire même active"", poursuit la spécialiste de la souffrance au travail.

Cependant, Marilyn Baldeck précise que ""la victime doit avoir l'assurance que la personne qui est au courant ne fera rien sans son accord. C'est aussi l'une des raisons pour lesquelles les victimes ne veulent pas saisir les organisations syndicales: elles redoutent qu'il y ait tout de suite une démarche vis à vis de l'employeur. Elles sont dans des temporalités qui sont différentes des professionnels qui interviennent à leurs côtés. Agir tout de suite sans leur consentement est une erreur fatale, parce qu'on les perd. Si on va plus vite que leur propre rythme, on risque de les décourager à jamais d'entreprendre quoique ce soit"".

La jurisprudence progresse

En outre, la jurisprudence avance également en ce sens. La Cour d'appel d'Orléans a ainsi condamné un journal à 78.500 euros de dommages et intérêts le 7 février 2017 et a recouru, pour la première fois, à la notion de ""harcèlement sexuel d'ambiance"" ou ""environnemental"".

Le site juridique Le Village de la Justice explique que le harcèlement sexuel d'ambiance est ""caractérisé par une situation où 'sans être directement visée, la victime subit des provocations et blagues obscènes ou vulgaires qui lui deviennent insupportables'"". En d'autres termes, le harcèlement sexuel devient général et non plus individuel. Grâce à cet arrêt de la Cour d'appel d'Orléans, un collègue peut donc dénoncer ces comportements sexistes même s'il n'en est pas directement la cible.

Mais Marie Pezé est formelle, ""s'il n'y avait pas cette ambiance complice et générale, cela ne se produirait pas"". Dans le cas du producteur Harvey Weinstein, elle tente d'expliquer toute la complexité de l'affaire: ""Tout le monde savait probablement depuis toujours que c'était un prédateur. Mais tout le monde s'est tu parce qu'il est un bon producteur, qui a produit des films remarquables. Ce sont souvent des personnes qui exercent leur pouvoir pas seulement pour harceler sexuellement, mais aussi pour faire de bonnes choses dans le monde professionnel"".

Chandrababu Naidu won't admit it, but he knows that his Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Telangana is in the ICU. In the past three years, twelve of his 15 legislators have dumped the TDP bicycle to hitch a ride on the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti's (TRS) car, cocking a snook at the toothless anti-defection law. Realising the David TDP cannot fight the TRS Goliath in Telangana, the other non-MLAs of the TDP who have not migrated so far are now pitching for an alliance with the TRS.

If there was a prescription for political suicide, this would qualify eminently.

But then put yourself in Naidu's shoes and you would realise the options available on the table do not give him much elbow room. Going alone in 2019 is not an option as he is more than likely to come a cropper. This means Naidu will have to swallow his pride and explore options to ally with either of the three parties in Telangana - the TRS, Congress or the BJP.

The tie-up that leaders like M Narasimhulu, a prominent Dalit leader of the party, are rooting for is with the TRS. Given that a considerable part of the TRS consists of TDP defectors, the argument is Naidu would feel at home dealing with the 'pink party'. Some of the turncoats too are pitching for a Telangana-Andhra gatbandhan. But playing second fiddle to the TRS would also mean TDP's own independent identity in India's youngest state would be severely compromised.

Would KCR like to shake hands with Naidu, a leader he has accused every election of being pro-Andhra?

Much was made of K Chandrasekhar Rao's visit to Anantapur earlier this month to attend the wedding of the son of Andhra minister Paritala Sunitha. During the visit, TDP banners welcoming KCR were put up, signalling that the Telangana chief minister was no longer a hate figure that he was during the Telangana agitation. District TDP leaders vied to take selfies with KCR. The Telangana CM's one-on-one discussion with P Keshav, a senior TDP leader from Rayalaseema, considered close to Naidu, also set tongues wagging. Knowing KCR's political sharpness, it is quite likely that he went the extra mile to ensure the optics of the confabulations at the helipad created confusion in the TDP ranks in Telangana.

The posturing for a TRS-TDP alliance is partly to do with the fact that the TDP in the last one year has fought three polls, including a trade union election, jointly with the Congress, an combination unthinkable till a couple of years ago, given that the TDP was formed by N T Rama Rao in 1982 on an anti-Congress plank. The opposition unity has not tasted success so far but the parties also realise that ekla chalo re would be a far worse option.

But would KCR like to shake hands with Naidu, a leader he has accused every election of being pro-Andhra? It would help KCR ensure the opposition vote is deprived of the TDP voteshare and will bring to the TRS kitty, the vote of people from Andhra who are settled in Telangana. But it would also show up KCR as a hypocrite given all the vitriol he poured on Naidu for being anti-Telangana and working against its interests.

Having lost most of its leaders to the TRS, the only vote catcher left in the TDP is Revanth Reddy.

For KCR therefore, it would work much better if he were to drive TDP into the Congress fold and then target the duo as working against Telangana's interests, his pet theme.

That is precisely what the Congress would worry about. TDP, because it is in power in Andhra and because Naidu was not seen to be in favour of bifurcation of united Andhra Pradesh, is seen as a electoral liability in Telangana. The party with its pro-Andhra tag could lose the alliance precious votes in hardcore Telangana patches.

Having lost most of its leaders to the TRS, the only vote catcher left in the TDP is Revanth Reddy. Whispers within the Congress suggest that should Naidu force an alliance with the TRS, Revanth is more than likely to shift sides to the Congress that in any case, is seen as a Reddy community party. That is because Reddy is accused in the cash for votes scam, in which he was caught on camera allegedly trying to bribe an independent MLA to vote for the TDP candidate in the MLC elections in 2015. There is no love lost between KCR and Revanth, though the latter is known to be close to some other leaders in the TRS.

Netting a Revanth would then be the best case scenario for the Congress. Except that many well-entrenched leaders in the Congress would not take kindly to his entry. How the high command handles this HR matter would be a factor in 2019.

The third party in the political matrix, the BJP state unit in Telangana, is simply not interested in forging an alliance with the TDP. The saffron party snapped its ties with TDP after the 2014 disaster and wants to test its individual strength. Though the final decision will be taken by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, it is certain that even if an alliance is forced upon the state unit, it won't be a comfortable marriage.

Cape Town – Low-lying clouds and shifting winds are hampering fire-fighting activities against a blaze that continues to rage through the Table Mountain National Park, News24 reported.

""The fire is not yet contained,"" said Table Mountain National Park (TMNP) fire manager Philip Prins.

Prins said the fire has spread overnight, coming over the mountain and going down Myburgh ravine to Orange Kloof. It started on Wednesday.

""It is burning above Orange Kloof as well as on Judas Peak and Grootkop,"" he said.

""Unfortunately strong north-westerly winds and low-lying clouds that have left most of the mountain covered are hampering fire-fighting efforts,"" he said.

Prins said due to the low cloud cover, the three helicopters which had flown in from George to assist with the operation, were unable to conduct any aerial assaults on the fires.

Hikers have also been cautioned to stay off the mountains.

Prins advised motorists to exercise caution and listen to traffic updates for the latest information, as well as to follow instructions of personnel at the scene of the fire.

He said people should avoid areas where the fire was burning if at all possible.

Prins said while Victoria Drive had been reopened to traffic late last night, the fire was proving unpredictable due to erratic winds and conditions could change.

He added that while the 12 Apostles Hotel remained closed, conditions there were looking good.

The Department of Environmental Affairs and Working on Fire will be providing 80 firefighters, three Huey helicopters and a spotter plane, which has been placed on standby.

At 90, Nayantara Sahgal stands tall among writers in India for her courage of conviction and belief in the secular spirit of the nation enshrined by the leaders who brought it into being. Both of these qualities are abundantly evident in her new novella, When the Moon Shines By Day, published recently by Speaking Tiger (Hardcover, ₹399), which reads like a chilling commentary on our time.

Although only 167 pages long, the story is packed with ideas, most of which Sahgal highlighted two years ago when she returned the Sahitya Akademi award in the wake of the murder of rationalist MM Kalburgi. Setting an example with her symbolic gesture, she opened the floodgates of dissent among intellectuals across the country, writing in a range of languages, who joined her in returning their awards to protest against vicious attacks on India's age-old tradition of debate, discussion and dissent.

The silencing of anti-establishment voices, brutally brought home by the recent murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh for instance, is captured with a lacerating irony by the title itself. Deceptively poetic, the phrase is evoked by the protagonist, Rehana, to explain to her friends her reason to continue working with Asians Against Torture, a human-rights organisation: ""Because people are tortured for refusing to agree the moon shines by day and the sun by night..."" The barbaric premonitions this admission opens up are borne out by the plot, which, in spite of its episodic fragments, conjures up a vision of pure hell.

The India that Sahgal sets her story in reminds us, with alarming familiarity, of the one we live in the here and now — except it's descended into a worse dystopia. The trappings of anarchy are cemented ever more firmly: books are banned, paintings destroyed and people get killed on the suspicion of carrying a suitcase made of cowhide, presided over by the all-pervasive eye of the Director of Cultural Transformation.

The latter's views on the vandalism of history are unambiguous. ""We cannot forget the pain of invasions,"" he informs a gallery owner on hearing a complaint of rampant hooliganism at a show, ""the Turks, Mongols, Mughals, foreigners who interrupted our Hindu history."" Wiping out ""that painful memory and returning our nation by all possible means to its racial and religious purity"" is, in his book, a matter of ""plain justice"".

If such passages strike as too unadorned, they also ring uncomfortably true, hitting home the heady reality of conflicts and confusions contemporary India is immersed in. Much like Sahgal, earlier this year, Prayaag Akbar brought alive the crises of being alive in this moment with a terrifying clarity in his novel, Leila. In a keenly-imagined dystopia, towards which present-day India seems to be inexorably hurtling, Akbar framed a story of an outcaste searching for her daughter and husband for nearly two decades, who were wrenched from her by the might of a police state, bent on preserving religious purity by condemning intermarriage.

In Sahgal's story, terror percolates into the genteel drawing-room conversations of Rehana and her friends, who gather for a book club, holding on to the vestiges of art and literature at a time neither can provide much consolation. Characters like Kamlesh, a bureaucrat with an interest in Mughal history, especially in the alleged depravities of Shah Jahan, including his incestuous relationship with his daughter, or Franz Rohner, a German historian of the Third Reich, act as foils to their title-tattle. The aroma of pekoe orange blossom tea at the ladies' book club gets fouled by the stink of violence, repeated sagas of bloodlust and massacre.

Exposed to the horrors of a dictatorial regime through her work with victims of torture, Rehana is the fiery conscience that shines through the darkness in which the novel is plunged. Even as she witnesses her lover Zamir's turbulent predicament for his religion and 'subversive' writing, the disappearance of her father's books on medieval history from public holdings, and the bottomless cruelty of everyday life, she manages to retain a humane curiosity about the world around her.

Rehana's friendship with Rohner is Sahgal's point of entry into larger historical questions about the fate of totalitarian regimes, comparing these with the ones in Europe of the 1930s and 40s. Such parallels may appear a bit stretched and Sahgal's detour into the past somewhat didactic, but the timing of the novel ameliorates such aesthetic grudges. In spite of the rough edges and choppy jump-cuts, Sahgal's wit and humanity glitters occasionally, especially in Rohner's bawdy wisecracks.

""Are they not the man who mounts his woman with no please-may-I, gallops to glory, rolls of his mount and snores himself to sleep?"" he says, memorably, on being asked his opinion about revolutions, saving a punch for the end. ""And the woman? Ah, the woman! She lies awake plotting how to kill him.""

En effet, le Gouvernement ne souhaite plus financer que 200.000 contrats pour l'année 2018 (pour mémoire: 450.000 contrats aidés avaient été signés en 2016). Selon Le Monde, le gouvernement miserait d'ailleurs sur un nouveau coup de rabot sur les contrats aidés en 2019. Imaginez donc que vous vous appelez Edouard Philippe et que vous voulez en finir avec les contrats aidés. Comment pourriez-vous vous y prendre?

Première étape: il vous faudra affirmer que les contrats aidés sont coûteux et inefficaces. Vous pouvez ainsi tweeter que ""75% des contrats aidés n'aboutissent pas"" comme le fit le Premier ministre le 24 août dernier. Si ce chiffre a été abondamment repris par les médias, il n'en est pas moins faux. Vous vous êtes pourtant basé sur les chiffres d'une étude de la Direction de l'animation, de la recherche, des études et des statistiques du Ministère du Travail (la DARES) publiée en mars 2017 qui montrent que 26% des personnes sorties d'un contrat aidé dans le secteur non-marchand se trouvent en emploi durable six mois après. Sauf que la notion d'emploi durable exclut les CDD de moins de six mois: en les comptant, 41% des bénéficiaires se trouvent en emploi six mois après leur contrat. Ces résultats sont loin d'être aussi désastreux et encore plus lorsque l'on s'intéresse au profil des bénéficiaires: 73% des bénéficiaires de contrats aidés dans le secteur non-marchand sont des chômeurs de plus de 12 mois!

De plus, lorsque l'on étudie le taux d'emploi six mois après des bénéficiaires de contrats aidés, dans le secteur marchand cette fois, on parvient à un taux d'insertion professionnelle de 67% (dont 72% en CDI!). Si le taux d'emploi est moins important dans le secteur non-marchand, c'est parce que ""les bénéficiaires de contrats aidés [y] sont davantage éloignés de l'emploi"" et ""souvent allocataires de minima sociaux ou sans diplôme"". Cependant, pour établir l'efficacité de ce dispositif, il faut se demander si l'embauche aurait pu avoir lieu en l'absence d'aide. La DARES montre très clairement que, dans le secteur non-marchand, 67% des recrutements n'auraient pas eu lieu. Enfin, les deux auteurs de l'étude notent que ""six mois après leur sortie de contrat unique d'insertion, 74% des anciens bénéficiaires trouvaient que le contrat aidé leur avait permis de se sentir utile et de reprendre confiance, et cela particulièrement pour les bénéficiaires d'un contrat non-marchand"". Ce fait n'est quasiment pas évoqué alors qu'il est capital: toute personne ayant un jour connu le chômage sait à quel point l'estime de soi peut être atteinte par ces mois à chercher un emploi sans succès. Le contrat aidé permet une réinsertion professionnelle mais également sociale: qu'à cela ne tienne, vous voulez le faire disparaître donc vous passez sous silence ces points positifs!

Face à une fronde inédite allant des communes de La Réunion jusqu'aux Restos du Cœur de Grenoble, vous décidez de procéder à une nouvelle rallonge budgétaire, le 24 juillet. Ne pouvant satisfaire tout le monde, vous décidez de recentrer les contrats aidés sur le secteur non-marchand et sur quatre priorités: l'accompagnement des élèves en situation de handicap, l'urgence sociale et sanitaire (elle-même décomposée en plusieurs priorités: aide alimentaire, accompagnement social ou hébergement des jeunes enfants, personnes dépendantes, sans abri ou atteintes d'un handicap), les Outre-mer et les communes rurales. Vous commettez alors trois erreurs.

Premièrement, avec autant de priorités pour une si petite enveloppe, vous pouvez être assuré que tout le monde se sentira lésé! Deuxièmement, si vous établissez désormais une priorité territoriale pour le déploiement des contrats aidés en 2018 en privilégiant les Outre-mer et les communes rurales, il est surprenant que les quartiers prioritaires de la ville (QPV) soient oubliés. Troisièmement, si vous jugez le dispositif inefficace et, comme l'affirme la ministre du Travail, Muriel Pénicaud, que les contrats aidés sont des ""emplois court terme et précaires"", pourquoi les contrats aidés sont-ils maintenus dans les territoires ruraux et ultramarins? Nos concitoyens des Outre-mer et des communes rurales n'ont-ils pas, eux aussi, le droit à un emploi durable?

Enfin -et là vous reprenez l'avantage!- vous décidez une mesure technique et guère suivie par le grand public: les contrats aidés ne seront désormais pris en charge par l'Etat qu'à hauteur de 50% du smic horaire brut (contre des taux pouvant aller jusqu'à 70% auparavant). Voici votre plan: pour des associations comme pour des communes déjà soumises à d'importantes contraintes financières, il sera extrêmement difficile –pour ne pas dire impossible!- de maintenir le même niveau de contrats aidés ou des contrats aidés d'une même durée qu'auparavant. Or, la longueur du contrat aidé est capitale pour sa réussite: dans un rapport extrêmement intéressant de la Cour des comptes de 2013 intitulé ""Le Marché du travail"". Face à un chômage élevé, la Cour constate que les contrats aidés d'une durée trop courte ne permettent pas une insertion durable dans l'emploi et recommande que celle-ci soit au minimum supérieure à un an. On s'oriente pourtant vers tout le contraire: avec la baisse du taux de prise en charge, les mairies seront tentées de faire du quantitatif (nombre important de contrats aidés) plutôt que du qualitatif (des contrats aidés d'une durée d'un an minimum). Vous pouvez alors vous raser le matin en pensant à la fable de la grenouille qui veut que, pour faire cuire une grenouille dans une casserole, il ne faut pas la plonger dans une casserole d'eau bouillante mais plutôt augmenter très légèrement le feu petit à petit.

Cependant, puisque vous êtes Premier ministre, vous pouvez aussi décider une politique de l'emploi juste et ambitieuse. Elle supposerait dès lors de maintenir des contrats aidés d'une durée suffisante pour un réel apprentissage et une insertion durable. Contre les effets d'aubaine constatés dans le secteur marchand, la DARES recommande ainsi ""un ciblage étroit des bénéficiaires"" pour lutter contre le phénomène tout en permettant ""d'agir sur la file d'attente face au chômage"". De plus, puisque le gouvernement affirme que l'attribution d'emplois aidés est réalisée par les municipalités de manière clientéliste, vous pourriez confier la gestion de ces contrats à Pôle emploi. Tout lien électoral ou politique, si tant est qu'il existe, serait alors empêché!

Enfin, pour favoriser les taux d'insertion durable à l'issue des contrats aidés, vous pourriez agir sur la qualité de ces derniers. Tout contrat aidé serait alors associé à une formation de qualité et individualisée, ce qui n'est –il faut bien le reconnaître– pas toujours le cas. L'accompagnement externe des bénéficiaires d'emplois aidés pourrait également être renforcé tout comme le suivi à l'issue de ces contrats pour permettre une insertion professionnelle et sociale durable. Oui, ces dispositifs sont coûteux à court terme mais les résultats sont là et, pour des publics éloignés de l'emploi comme des chômeurs de 24 mois (41% des bénéficiaires de contrats aidés non marchands), ils ne peuvent être tenus pour négligeables.

Notre pays a mieux à offrir que le chômage à des milliers de personnes: soyons à la hauteur de nos responsabilités et agissons avec dignité à leur égard.

Junge Aktivisten bereiten sich auf einen längeren politischen Kampf vor

Die HuffPost berichtet aus Barcelona: Wie geht es dort nun weiter?

Barcelona im Oktober 2017. Ganz Europa blickt auf die Metropole im Nordosten Spaniens, als am Mittwoch den 5. Oktober Präsident Puidgemont eine Art ""Unabhängigkeit Light"" ausruft. Er erklärt die Abspaltung von Spanien – und setzt den Prozess dann gleich wieder aus.



Der spanische Staat hatte über Monate hinweg versucht, ein Referendum zu verhindern. Deshalb wurden im Verborgenen Urnen gefertigt, nach Katalonien geschmuggelt und in Wahllokale gebracht. Am Tag des Referendums kam es zur Konfrontation.



Aktivisten besetzten Schulen, um dort die Abstimmung zu ermöglichen, Foto: Michael Trammer



Ungeheuerliche Bilder von Polizeigewalt gingen um die Welt. Nun scheint sich die Lage zu beruhigen. Die aufrührerischen Katalanen, die nach Sezession rufen, wollen an den Verhandlungstisch. Die Zentralregierung bleibt hart und will klare Kante zeigen: Kein Dialog mit denen, die sie als Verfassungsfeinde brandmarken.



Doch was sind die Motive junger Leute sich trotz aller Hindernisse, trotz der drohenden Gewaltspirale der Unabhängigkeitsbewegung anzuschließen? Was sind die Hoffnungen in einen neu-gegründeten Staat? Wie bereiten sich die Menschen auf die drohende Konfrontation vor?



""Kein Blut-und-Boden-Nationalismus""



Lluc ist Kunststudent an der Universität in Barcelona. Er hat geholfen, das Referendum durchzuführen, auch durch die Besetzung von Schulen, die dann als Wahllokale dienten. Für ihn bedeutet eine Sezession von Spanien, deutlich mehr als nur die Gründung eines neuen Staates.



Lluc kämpft für die die katalanische Unabhängigkeit, Foto: Michael Trammer



Er sieht die Unabhängigkeit als einzige Chance, um einen Schlussstrich zu ziehen. Auch mit dem in seinen Augen ungenügend aufgearbeiteten Erbe des Francoregimes. Seine Hoffnung und Anspruch an einen katalanischen Staat ist vor allem: Mehr direkte Demokratie – ein basisdemokratischer Staat.

Doch was ist dran an den kritischen Stimmen, die die Separatisten für gefährliche Nationalisten halten?

Lluc zumindest streitet das vorsichtig ab. Laut seiner Einschätzung handelt es sich bei der katalanischen Ideologie nicht um einen Blut-und-Boden Nationalismus. Für ihn ist Katalane wer sich zum multikulturellen Leben in der spanischen Region zugehörig fühlt. Lluc gibt aber auch zu, dass sicher nicht alle Leute in der Unabhängigkeitsbewegung so denken wie er.

""Ich rede über eine soziale Revolution!""



Die wirtschaftlichen Konsequenzen, die Katalonien bereits jetzt zu spüren bekommt, kümmern ihn nicht. Mehrere Banken haben ihre Sitze aus der Region verlagert. Jobs werden gekündigt.



Eine Frau beim Public Viewing – kurz bevor das Ergebnis des Referendums verkündet wurde

Lluc ist das egal. Er träumt ohnehin davon, dass sich alles ändert: ""Ich rede hier über eine soziale Revolution! Die allererste Grundbedingung für genau so eine ist, dass Banken aus Katalonien verschwinden müssen und wir die Steuerung der Wirtschaft selbst in die Hand nehmen!“

Es ist eine radikale Position, die viele Katalanen teilen. Denn sie haben das Gefühl, dass von der wirtschaftlichen Stärke der Region wenig bei ihnen ankommt. Tatsächlich ist die Arbeitslosenquote in Katalonien, nach der Eurokrise kaum niedriger als im Rest von Spanien.

Auf die eine oder andere Art und Weise wird es in Llucs Augen eine Konfrontation zwischen der spanischen und der katalanischen Regierung geben. Er geht auch davon aus, dass die katalanische Regierung in naher Zukunft ihre realpolitische Macht verlieren wird. Dann wäre auch ein Militäreinsatz in Katalonien denkbar.

""Es wird große Generalstreiks geben!""

Wie genau es weitergeht, kann auch der Aktivist nicht absehen. Was seine Freunde und er planen, wenn die Unabhängigkeit final erklärt wird, weiß er aber genau: ‘Wir haben unsere Kräfte bereits vorbereitet und es wird Streiks geben – Generalstreiks! Ein Datum kann ich euch nicht nennen – aber es wird bald Generalstreiks geben! Große Generalstreiks!“



Tausende junge Katalanen träumen von der Unabhängigkeit.

Diese sollen wohl auch einen verfassungsbildenden Prozess befürworten und beschleunigen. In seinen Augen, kann die Zentralregierung in Madrid zwar das Militär nach Katalonien schicken. Doch wie sollen sie gegen die Massen auf den Straßen vorgehen?

Gewaltsame Ausschreitungen in den Straßen von Barcelona wären auch für die spanische Regierung ein Fiasko.



Auszuschließen sind sie nicht: Denn die Lage in Katalonien scheint ganz und gar nicht beruhigt. Zwar sind die Protestwellen abgeebbt und momentan findet ein Konflikt auf parteipolitischer Ebene statt, doch erst am Donnerstagabend riefen nun auch bürgerliche Gruppen zu einer finalen Lossagung von Madrid auf.

“I’ve got to thank my team for helping me build it so quickly. I won’t wear it every week, but will probably use it for more up-tempo dances, where I need to bounce on my toes.

“Thank you for your support and I hope you keep watching and voting.”

Speaking ahead of the first live show last month, Jonnie explained that his prosthetic leg isn’t something he was worrying about.

“It’s not the bottom half I have to worry about, it’s more the top half and how that looks,” he said (via Irish News). “I’m just going to go out there and have as much fun as possible and try to change some of those stigmas that I guess are surrounding it.”

On Saturday (14 October) night, viewers will see Jonnie and Oti take on the American Smooth, dancing to the Michael Buble version of ‘Cry Me A River’.

Fears of mass protests have led diplomats to discuss downgrading the US President’s plans from a full-blown State Visit, according to the London Evening Standard.

Instead of receiving a Royal banquet at Buckingham Palace, the revised programme would see Trump embark on a “working” trip as part of a tour of other European states.

Jeremy Corbyn’s office have welcomed the downgrade, and renewed the Labour leader’s offer to take Trump to a local mosque to help him understand Muslim culture.

Theresa May tried to underline her close relations with the US President at the White House in January, when she invited him to the UK on a State Visit as guest of the Queen.

The intention was to repeat the success of Barack Obama’s own State Visit in 2011, but critics pointed out the convention was to wait for a President’s second term in office before being granted the honour.

The Trump trip had been expected this summer, but the UK snap general election as well as growing controversy over Trump’s foreign policy led to a rethink.

Some protestors had even planned to ‘moon’ the president en masse, as part of a campaign called ‘Show your rump to Trump’.

The newly stripped-down visit is expected to focus on global security issues.

Trump may be allowed cut the ribbon on the brand new US embassy which is close to completion at Nine Elms, near Battersea Power Station.

But he will not sleep at Buckingham Palace as the guest of the Queen, probably staying at the residence of the new US ambassador Woody Johnson instead.

Asked if the downgrade to a ‘working visit’ was a welcome move, a senior Labour source said: “We don’t think it’s appropriate or right for there to be a State Visit by the US President.

“If Donald Trump comes to the UK, Jeremy has said he’s prepared to meet him and would like to introduce him to different communities in Britain and make the case against many of the things Trump is doing domestically and internationally. He would take him to Finsbury Park Mosque and have a meeting there.”

A source close to Sadiq Khan confirmed to HuffPost UK that the Mayor of London, who led criticism of the State Visit invitation, “would not object” to a working visit.

Diplomatic sources suggested to The Times on Thursday that the trip could involve a short audience with the Queen to ‘mollify’ the President, but without the full trappings of a ceremonial visit.

Her Majesty usually lists all formal visits for the coming year, but pointedly did not include the US President’s trip.

The absence of Trump’s tour from her speech was a clear signal that no date had been agreed on his controversial visit. It followed claims that he was worried about mass street protests causing embarrassment to himself and the Royal Family. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said that the Government’s State Visit invitation remained unchanged.

The Foreign Office said a State Visit, which is seen by MPs as being on indefinite hold, would go ahead at some stage.

""Ich war immer so gereizt, wenn das Meth alle war"", sagt mein Freund Jeremy.

""Wenn du es hast, musst du es weiter nehmen. Wenn du keins mehr hast, ist das wie ‚Okay, ich kann jetzt in mein Leben zurück'. Ich hab das ganze Wochenende nicht geschlafen und bin zu diesen Sexpartys und habe mich anschließend bis Mittwoch beschissen gefühlt. Vor ungefähr zwei Jahren bin ich auf Kokain umgestiegen, weil ich dann am nächsten Tag arbeiten konnte.""

Jeremy liegt im Krankenhaus, als er mir das erzählt. Er sagt nicht, wie es genau zu der Überdosis gekommen ist, nur dass ein Unbekannter den Krankenwagen gerufen hat und er hier aufgewacht ist.

""Die Drogen waren eine Kombination aus Langeweile und Einsamkeit""

Ich hätte nicht gedacht, dass ich mit meinem Freund Jeremy mal ein solches Gespräch führen würde. Bis vor ein paar Wochen hatte ich keine Ahnung, dass er härtere Drogen konsumiert als Martinis.

Er ist sportlich, intelligent, glutenfrei und trägt an jedem x-beliebigen Wochentag ein sauberes Hemd. Als ich ihn vor drei Jahren kennenlernte, wollte er wissen, wo man gut Crossfit machen kann.

""Die Drogen waren eine Kombination aus Langeweile und Einsamkeit"", sagt er. ""Freitagabend kam ich nach Hause, völlig k.o. von der Arbeit, und fragte mich: ‚Was jetzt?' Also hab ich rumtelefoniert, um mir Meth liefern zu lassen und im Internet Partys zu checken. Entweder das oder allein einen Film angucken.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir sind das erste schwule Ehepaar, das in Deutschland ein Kind adoptiert hat: Hier ist unsere Botschaft an alle, die es uns nicht gönnen

Schon seit Jahren sehe ich, wie das Leben meiner heterosexuellen und meiner schwulen Freunde auseinanderdriftet. Die eine Hälfte meines sozialen Netzwerks hat sich in Familien und Vororte verabschiedet, die andere kämpft sich durch Isolation und Angstzustände, harte Drogen und riskanten Sex.

Depression, Einsamkeit und Drogen in der schwulen Gemeinde noch genauso verbreitet wie vor Jahrzehnten

Nichts davon passt zu dem, was ich mir vorgestellt hatte unter dem Leben eines schwulen Mannes. Genauso wenig wie ich wurde Jeremy von Gleichaltrigen gemobbt oder von seiner Familie abgelehnt. Er kann sich nicht mal daran erinnern, dass er je Schwuchtel genannt wurde.

Seine lesbische Mutter erzog ihn in einem Vorort an der Westküste. ""Sie outete sich mir gegenüber, als ich zwölf war"", sagt er. ""Und im nächsten Satz sagte sie, dass ich schwul bin. Mir war das damals selbst noch kaum klar.""

Jeremy und ich sind 34. In unserem Leben haben die Schwulen größere gesellschaftliche und rechtliche Akzeptanz erreicht als je zuvor. In meiner eigenen Teenagerzeit war die Homo-Ehe ein ferner Traum, von den Zeitungen in Gänsefüßchen gesetzt. Heute ist sie höchstrichterlich abgesegnet.

Die gesellschaftliche Zustimmung zur Homo-Ehe ist von 27 Prozent im Jahr 1996 auf 61 Prozent im Jahr 2016 gestiegen. In der Popkultur sind schwule Figuren so alltäglich, dass sie sogar Fehler haben dürfen.

Trotzdem - während wir Ausmaß und Tempo dieses Wandels feiern, sind Depression, Einsamkeit und Drogen in der schwulen Gemeinde noch genauso verbreitet wie vor Jahrzehnten. Je nach Studie ist die Suizidrate bei Schwulen zwei- bis zehnmal so hoch wie bei Heteros. Depressive Phasen gibt es bei uns doppelt so häufig.

Laut einer Untersuchung unter schwulen Männern, die erst seit kurzem in New York wohnen, litten drei Viertel von ihnen unter Angstattacken oder Depressionen, nahmen Drogen oder Alkohol oder praktizierten ungeschützten Sex. Auch wenn wir dauernd von ""Wahlfamilien"" sprechen, haben schwule Männer nicht so viele enge Freunde wie Heteros oder lesbische Frauen.

In den Niederlanden leiden Homosexuelle dreimal so oft an affektiven Störungen wie Heterosexuelle

Ich will nicht so tun, als sei ich objektiv. Ich bin ein zeitweise allein lebender Schwuler, in einer normalen Kleinstadt von Eltern erzogen, die in einem Verein von Angehörigen Homosexueller organisiert waren.

Niemand in meiner Bekanntschaft starb an Aids. Ich bin nie direkt diskriminiert worden und habe mich in einer Welt geoutet, in der Heirat, Jägerzaun und ein Golden Retriever für einen homosexuellen Mann nicht nur erreichbare Ziele waren, sondern geradezu von ihm erwartet wurden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir haben überprüft, was das AfD-Wahlprogramm Homosexuellen zu bieten hat - das Ergebnis war sogar schlimmer als erwartet

""Für manche Schwule waren die Homo-Ehe und die Gesetzesänderungen eine Verbesserung"", befindet Christopher Stults. Er untersucht an der New York University die Unterschiede in der seelischen Gesundheit von Schwulen und Heterosexuellen. ""Viele andere aber waren enttäuscht. Jetzt haben wir diesen rechtlichen Status erreicht, und doch haben sich nicht alle Erwartungen erfüllt.""

Nicht nur Amerikaner kennen dieses Gefühl der Leere. In den Niederlanden existiert die Homo-Ehe seit 2001, und trotzdem leiden Homosexuelle dreimal so oft an affektiven Störungen wie Heterosexuelle, und ""Selbstverletzungen in suizidaler Absicht"" treten bei ihnen zehnmal so häufig auf.

In Schweden gibt es eingetragene Partnerschaften seit 1995 und die gleichberechtigte Ehe seit 2009, aber bei Männern, die mit Männern verheiratet sind, ist die Suizidrate dreimal so hoch wie bei Männern, die mit Frauen verheiratet sind.

All diese schwer erträglichen Statistiken führen zur selben Schlussfolgerung: Wenn man sich als Mann zu anderen Männern hingezogen fühlt, riskiert man auch heute noch eine gefährliche Entfremdung. Die gute Nachricht: Epidemiologen und Sozialwissenschaftler verstehen die Gründe mittlerweile besser denn je.

Travis Salway, Forscher am Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, befasst sich seit fünf Jahren mit der Frage, warum schwule Männer sich immer noch umbringen.

""Früher waren schwule Männer einsam, weil sie sich nicht outen konnten"", sagt er. ""Aber heute haben sich Millionen Schwule geoutet, und sie fühlen sich noch genauso isoliert.""

Schwule Männer wurden aus ihren Familien verstoßen, ihr Liebesleben war verboten

Wir treffen uns zum Mittagessen in einer winzigen Nudelbar. Es ist November, und er trägt Jeans, Überschuhe und einen Ehering. ""Schwule Ehe?"", frage ich.

""Sogar monogam"", sagt er.

Salway wuchs in Celina, Ohio, auf, einer abgetakelten Industriestadt mit etwa 10.000 Einwohnern, in der bei den 21-Jährigen die Ehe mit dem College konkurrierte. Er wurde schon als schwul beschimpft, bevor es ihm selbst klar war.

""Ich war feminin und sang im Chor"", sagt er. ""Das genügte."" Die meiste Zeit in der Highschool hatte er eine Freundin und vermied Beziehungen mit Jungen, bis er weggehen konnte.

Gegen Ende der Nullerjahre war er Sozialarbeiter und Epidemiologe, und der zunehmende Abstand zwischen heterosexuellen und schwulen Freunden irritierte ihn ebenso wie mich. Gab es vielleicht noch mehr als das, was man über schwule Männer und seelische Gesundheit bis dahin angenommen hatte?

In den 50er- und 60er-Jahren trat die Disparität erstmals zutage, und die Ärzte hielten sie für ein Symptom der Homosexualität an sich, für eine von vielen Erscheinungsformen des damals als ""sexuelle Inversion"" bekannten Phänomens. Als die Schwulenbewegung Fahrt aufnahm, wurde die Homosexualität aus der Liste der psychischen Defekte gestrichen und das Problem mit einem Trauma erklärt. Schwule Männer wurden aus ihren Familien verstoßen, ihr Liebesleben war verboten. Selbstverständlich erreichten ihre Depressionen und Suizidraten beunruhigende Level.

""So schätzte ich das auch ein"", sagt Salway, ""dass der schwule Suizid Produkt einer früheren Zeit war oder vor allem bei Jugendlichen auftrat, die keinen anderen Ausweg sahen.""

Dann nahm er sich die Daten vor. Das Problem war nicht nur die Selbsttötung, und sie trat nicht nur bei Teenagern auf, nicht nur in Gegenden mit grassierender Homophobie.

Er stellte fest, dass Schwule überall und in jedem Alter häufiger an Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen, Krebs, Sexsucht, Erektionsstörungen, Allergien, Asthma und vielen anderen Erkrankungen leiden. In Kanada sterben seit Jahren mehr Schwule an Suizid als an Aids.

Vom Stress, ständig darauf gefasst zu sein, diskriminiert zu werden

""Es gibt schwule Männer, die nie sexuell oder physisch angegriffen worden sind und an ähnlichen posttraumatischen Belastungsstörungen leiden wie Menschen, die Kampfsituationen oder Vergewaltigungen erlebt haben"", sagt Alex Keuroghlian, Psychiater am Fenway Institute's Center for Population Research in LGBT Health.

Schwule Männer sind darauf ""geeicht, Diskriminierung zu erwarten"", glaubt Keuroghlian. Ununterbrochen scannen wir unser Umfeld, ob wir vielleicht herausfallen. Wir kämpfen um Selbstbehauptung. Wir spielen uns unsere sozialen Fehlschläge in einer Endlosschleife vor.

Am meisten aber erstaunt bei diesen Symptomen die Tatsache, dass wir sie im Allgemeinen nicht einmal als Symptome wahrnehmen. Seit er sich mit diesen Daten befasst, interviewt Salway schwule Männer, die einen Suizidversuch überlebt haben.

""Wenn man sie fragt, warum sie sich das Leben nehmen wollten, erwähnen die meisten ihre Homosexualität gar nicht."" Stattdessen erzählen sie ihm von Beziehungsproblemen, beruflichen Problemen, finanziellen Problemen. ""Sie nehmen ihre Sexualität nicht als entscheidenden Faktor in ihrem Leben wahr. Und doch ist ihre Suizidrate zehnmal so hoch.""

Dieses Phänomen wird in der Wissenschaft mit dem ""Minderheitenstressmodell"" beschrieben. In seiner direktesten Form ist es ziemlich einfach: Die Zugehörigkeit zu einer Randgruppe bringt zusätzliche Anstrengungen mit sich.

Als einzige Frau in einem geschäftlichen Meeting oder als einziger Schwarzer im Studentenwohnheim muss man sich viel mehr Gedanken machen als die Angehörigen der Mehrheit. Wenn man sich gegen den Chef wehrt oder aber es nicht tut, entspricht man dann den Klischees über Frauen am Arbeitsplatz?

Wenn man einen Test verhaut, denken die Leute dann, dass es an der Rasse liegt? Selbst wenn man nicht offen stigmatisiert wird, hinterlassen diese fortwährenden Grübeleien auf die Dauer ihre Spuren.

Die ganze Ablehnung spielte sich nur in meinem Kopf ab

John Pachankis forscht in Yale über Stress. Seiner Ansicht nach entsteht die Störung in den etwa fünf Jahren zwischen der Entdeckung der eigenen Sexualität und dem Zeitpunkt, wenn wir mit anderen darüber sprechen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Der Schein trügt: Hasskriminalität gegen Lesben und Schwule nimmt stetig zu

In dieser Zeit wirken sich sogar relativ unbedeutende Stresssituationen unverhältnismäßig stark aus - nicht weil sie traumatisch wären, sondern weil wir uns darauf einstellen, dass sie passieren. ""Du musst nicht mal schwul genannt werden, damit du dein Verhalten so anpasst, dass dir das nicht passiert"", sagt Salway.

So war es auch in meiner Teenie-Zeit: immer auf der Hut, bloß nichts Falsches sagen, immer im Stress, immer überkompensieren. Als ich in einem Erlebnisbad mit einem Schulfreund an der Wasserrutsche wartete, erwischte er mich, wie ich ihn anstarrte.

""Alter, was glotzt du mich an?"" Ich konnte gerade noch ablenken, so was wie ""Sorry, du bist nicht mein Typ"", aber in den Wochen danach quälte mich der Gedanke, was er wohl über mich dachte. Dabei kam er nie darauf zurück. Die ganze Ablehnung spielte sich nur in meinem Kopf ab.

Das Heranwachsen als Schwuler ist ähnlich belastend wie das Heranwachsen in extremer Armut

""Das eigentliche Trauma für Schwule ist die lange Zeitdauer"", sagt William Elder, Traumaforscher und Psychologe. ""Bei einem einzelnen Trauma erleidet man eine posttraumatische Belastungsstörung, die in einem halben Jahr Therapie geheilt werden kann.

Aber wenn man jahrelang immer wieder kleine stressige Situationen erlebt und sich dann jedes Mal fragt: War das jetzt wegen meiner Sexualität?, kann das den Effekt sogar noch intensivieren."" Wer seine Homosexualität versteckt, ist laut Elder in der Lage eines Menschen, dem immer wieder leicht auf den Arm geschlagen wird.

Am Anfang ist er genervt. Nach einiger Zeit ist er wütend. Schließlich kann er an nichts anderes mehr denken.

Und dann baut sich der Stress im Körper auf, weil man sich Tag für Tag damit beschäftigt.

Anscheinend ist das Heranwachsen als Schwuler ähnlich belastend wie das Heranwachsen in extremer Armut.

Nach einer Untersuchung von 2015 produzieren Schwule weniger von dem stressregulierenden Hormon Cortisol. Ihr Organismus war in ihrer Adoleszenz ständig so aktiv, dass sie als Erwachsene träge werden, sagt Katie McLaughlin, eine der Autorinnen der Studie.

Unter Männern herrscht ein rauer Ton, das ist bei Schwulen nicht anders

2014 wurden die kardiovaskulären Risikofaktoren von hetero- und homosexuellen Jugendlichen verglichen. Dabei stellte sich heraus, dass die schwulen Kids nicht mehr Stresssituationen ausgesetzt waren - dass also auch heterosexuelle Jugendliche Probleme haben -, dass diese ihr Nervensystem aber stärker schädigten.

Sogar Salway, der sich gründlich mit dem Minderheitenstress befasst, fühlt sich manchmal unwohl, wenn er mit seinem Partner durch Vancouver schlendert.

Noch nie ist er angegriffen worden, aber irgendwelche Idioten haben ihn in der Öffentlichkeit mal beschimpft. So etwas muss nur ein paar Mal passieren, und schon wartet man darauf und schlägt das Herz etwas schneller, sobald sich ein Auto nähert.

Unter Männern herrscht ein rauer Ton, das ist bei Schwulen nicht anders. Im Gegenteil.

Mit Minderheitenstress allein lassen die vielfältigen Gesundheitsprobleme schwuler Männer sich jedoch nicht erklären. Tatsächlich kommt es zur ersten Schädigung, während sie sich verstecken, die zweite und vielleicht gravierendere kommt aber erst danach.

Auch in der schwulen Community lauern Diskriminierungen

Jahrzehnte hindurch nahmen Psychologen an, dass die entscheidenden Phasen in der Bildung der schwulen Identität zum Coming-out führen und dass wir, wenn wir uns in unserer Haut endlich wohlfühlen, unser Leben aufbauen können, gemeinsam mit Menschen, die die gleichen Erfahrungen gemacht haben.

Die Forschung der letzten zehn Jahre zeigt jedoch, dass der Kampf um Anpassung sogar noch heftiger wird. Nach einer Untersuchung von 2015 leiden Männer, die sich kurz vorher geoutet hatten, stärker an Ängsten und Depressionen als solche, die ihre Homosexualität noch verstecken. Denn auch in der schwulen Community lauern Diskriminierungen.

Jeder Schwule, den ich kenne, trägt ein Päckchen mit all den Fiesheiten, die andere Schwule ihm gesagt oder angetan haben. Als ich mal zu einem Date kam, stand der Typ sofort auf, als er mich sah, warf mir vor, dass ich kleiner sei als auf meinen Fotos, und ging. Alex, Fitnesstrainer in Seattle, bekam von einem Mitglied seines Schwimmteams zu hören:

""Ich bin bereit, über dein Gesicht hinwegzusehen, wenn du mich ohne Kondom fickst."" Martin, ein Brite in Portland, hat etwa fünf Kilo zugenommen, seit er da wohnt, und - an Weihnachten - bekam er über Grindr diese Nachricht: ""Du warst immer so sexy. Schade, dass du das versaut hast.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Du bist eine Schande und deine Freundin ein Dämon"" - was ich erlebte, als ich auf Instagram zeigte, dass ich eine Frau liebe

In anderen Minderheiten werden Ängste und Depressionen durch die Unterstützung der Community weniger. Die Nähe zu Menschen, von denen man sich instinktiv verstanden weiß, ist hilfreich. Bei uns dagegen ist das Gegenteil der Fall.

Mehrere Studien haben gezeigt, dass die Tendenz zu ungeschütztem Sex und Meth steigt, das Engagement für Ehrenämter oder Sport dagegen sinkt, wenn man in einem schwulen Viertel wohnt. Aus einer Untersuchung von 2009 geht hervor, dass Schwule, die eng mit ihrer schwulen Community verbunden sind, mit ihren eigenen Liebesbeziehungen weniger zufrieden sind.

Schwule Männer behandeln sich gegenseitig mies, weil wir Männer sind

""Schwule und bisexuelle Männer bezeichnen die schwule Community als großen Stressfaktor"", sagt John Pachankis, der in Yale zu genderbezogenen Krankheiten forscht. Der Hauptgrund sei, dass die Diskriminierung innerhalb der Gruppe die Psyche stärker schädige als die Zurückweisung durch Angehörige der Mehrheit.

Wenn man von Heterosexuellen zurückgewiesen wird, kann man leicht darüber hinwegsehen, man kann mit den Augen rollen oder ihnen den Mittelfinger zeigen - man braucht ihre Anerkennung ja nicht. Die Ablehnung durch andere Schwule tut mehr weh, weil man diese Leute stärker braucht.

Die Forscher, mit denen ich gesprochen habe, gehen davon aus, dass Schwule sich aus zwei Gründen häufig verletzen. Der Hauptgrund, der auch am häufigsten genannt wird, ist, dass schwule Männer sich gegenseitig mies behandeln, weil wir Männer sind.

""In einer Gemeinschaft von Männern wird Männlichkeit besonders herausgefordert"", sagt Pachankis. ""Männlichkeit ist ein flüchtiges Gut. Sie muss ständig inszeniert oder verteidigt oder eingefordert werden. Wenn die Männlichkeit infrage gestellt wird, kann man sehen, wie dumm Männer darauf reagieren. Sie nehmen aggressive Posen ein, stürzen sich in finanzielle Risiken, wollen Sachen zerschlagen.""

Bei femininen Schwulen sind Suizid, Einsamkeit und psychische Krankheiten noch weiter verbreitet

So lässt sich auch die allgegenwärtige Stigmatisierung femininer Männer in der schwulen Community besser verstehen. Dane Whicker, klinischer Psychologe und Forscher an der Duke University, hat herausgefunden, dass sich die meisten schwulen Männer für maskuline Männer interessieren und selbst möglichst maskulin auftreten möchten.

Das könnte daran liegen, dass maskuline Männer historisch in der heterosexuellen Gesellschaft geringere Probleme hatten. Vielleicht haben wir es aber auch mit verinnerlichter Homophobie zu tun: Feminine Schwule werden stereotyp immer noch als Bottom, als rezeptiver Partner beim Analverkehr, gesehen.

Bei femininen Schwulen sind Suizid, Einsamkeit und psychische Krankheiten denn auch weiter verbreitet. Maskuline Schwule wiederum leiden mehr unter Ängsten, neigen zu ungeschütztem Sex und greifen öfter zu Drogen und Tabak.

Während die Schwulenbars verschwinden, treffen sich auf Grindr immer mehr

Der zweite Grund, warum die schwule Gemeinde ihre Mitglieder so sehr stresst, hat nicht mit dem Warum unserer wechselseitigen Ablehnung zu tun, sondern mit dem Wie. In den letzten zehn Jahren sind die traditionellen schwulen Treffpunkte - Bars, Nachtclubs, Saunen - nach und nach verschwunden, an ihre Stelle sind die sozialen Medien getreten.

Mindestens 70 Prozent der homosexuellen Männer nutzen heute Dating-Apps wie Grindr oder Scruff. Im Jahr 2000 lernten sich etwa 20 Prozent der schwulen Paare online kennen. 2010 waren es bis zu 70 Prozent. Die Zahl der schwulen Paare, die sich durch Freunde gefunden haben, ist von 30 auf 12 Prozent gesunken.

Öfter liest man über die App Grindr, deren Nutzer sie durchschnittlich 90 Minuten am Tag verwenden, irgendwelche Horrorstorys in den Medien: über Mörder oder Homophobe, die hier ihre Opfer abschleppen.

Oder es geht um die beunruhigenden ""Chemsex-Partys"", die sich in Berlin, London und New York ausbreiten. Und ja, das sind Probleme. Die eigentliche Wirkung der Apps aber ist stiller, unauffälliger, und sie geht in mancher Hinsicht auch tiefer: Viele von uns kommunizieren hauptsächlich auf diesem Weg mit anderen Schwulen.

Diese Apps vermitteln uns nachdrücklich das Gefühl, hässlich zu sein

Das Schlimmste an den Apps jedoch und der Grund, warum sie sich so unterschiedlich auf die Gesundheit von schwulen bzw. heterosexuellen Männern auswirken, ist nicht nur, dass wir sie so intensiv nutzen. Vielmehr eignen sie sich fast perfekt dazu, unsere negative Selbstwahrnehmung noch zu verschärfen.

Der Traumaforscher Elder führte im Jahr 2015 Interviews mit Schwulen und fand heraus, dass 90 Prozent seiner Probanden einen Partner wollten, der groß, jung, weiß, muskulös und maskulin sein sollte. Die meisten von uns entsprechen kaum einem dieser Kriterien, geschweige denn allen fünf, und so vermitteln diese Apps uns nachdrücklich das Gefühl, hässlich zu sein.

Das alles ist natürlich nicht neu. Der seit den Achtzigern mit gesellschaftlicher Isolation befasste Psychologe Walt Odets erklärt, schwule Männer hätten an den Saunen genauso gelitten wie heute an Grindr. Doch bei seinen jüngeren Patienten sieht er diesen Unterschied:

""Wenn man in der Sauna von jemandem abgelehnt wurde, konnte man anschließend immer noch mit ihm darüber reden. Vielleicht konnte daraus eine Freundschaft werden oder wenigstens eine positive soziale Erfahrung. Bei den Apps wird man einfach weggedrückt, wenn man nicht als sexuell oder romantisch interessant wahrgenommen wird.""

Die Apps verstärken oder beschleunigen vielleicht auch nur die erwachsene Version der Hypothese, die Pachankis als ""Der beste kleine Junge auf der Welt"" bezeichnet. Wenn wir als Jugendliche unsere Sexualität verstecken, konzentrieren wir unser Selbstwertgefühl auf das, was die Außenwelt von uns will: gut sein im Sport, in der Schule etc.

Als Erwachsene drängen die sozialen Normen unserer eigenen Community uns, unser Selbstwertgefühl noch weiter zu konzentrieren: auf unser Aussehen, unsere Männlichkeit, unsere sexuellen Leistungen.

Aber selbst wenn wir hier wettbewerbsfähig sind, selbst wenn wir unser Ideal vom maskulinen dominanten Top erreichen - selbst dann haben wir uns in Wirklichkeit darauf konditioniert, dass wir am Boden zerstört sind, wenn wir ihm nicht mehr entsprechen, was unvermeidlich der Fall sein wird.

HARCÈLEMENT - ""Ma fille a été victime d'Harvey Weinstein"". Les langues se délient chaque jour un peu plus dans l'affaire Weinstein, notamment celles d'actrices françaises. Après les témoignages de Léa Seydoux, Emma De Caunes et Florence Darel, le nom d'Eva Green vient s'ajouter à la longue liste des victimes du producteur d'Hollywood.

Ce vendredi 13 octobre, l'actrice Marlène Jobert a confié que sa fille a été harcelée par le producteur américain de cinéma. ""Ma fille Eva en a été victime... Il est tenace, il insiste pendant plusieurs mois, dès qu'il passait à Paris, il l'appelait"", raconte-t-elle au micro d'Europe 1.

Connue pour son rôle de James Bond Girl dans ""Casino Royale"" en 2006 et ""Miss Peregrine"" de Tim Burton en 2016, Eva Green a été harcelée par Harvey Weinstein au cours de l'année 2010-2011. Sa mère raconte ce que lui a fait subir le producteur.

""Elle ne répondait pas (...) Elle était un peu intimidée, ce type avait tellement de pouvoir! De pouvoir sur tout le cinéma! Il a dû lui mettre tellement de bâtons dans les roues, car il était vexé, explique-t-elle. C'était difficile, elle a mis du temps a s'en remettre, elle préfère oublier et ne pas en parler aujourd'hui"".

Marlène Jobert détaille également la technique d'approche du producteur pour attirer sa fille. ""Il était avec Eva comme avec toutes les autres, avec le même mode opératoire: sous le prétexte d'un rendez-vous professionnel, d'un scénario à lui remettre, avec un beau rôle à la clé, explique l'actrice. Et comme son bureau était aussi dans sa suite d'hôtel, il les faisait monter et puis bon... Il leur promettait comme à toutes de favoriser leur carrière en échange de faveurs sexuelles. Elle a réussi à s'échapper"", affirme-t-elle.

Deux enquêtes ouvertes

En témoignant à la place de sa fille, Marlène Jobert veut ajouter un témoignage de plus à ceux qui accablent déjà Harvey Weinstein. ""Ça me révolte, lâche-t-elle. J'ai tellement été choquée, ça m'a fait du mal quand c'est arrivé. Ce n'est pas possible que ce type soit impuni"".

A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court has ruled that sex between a man and his minor wife would constitute rape under the Indian Penal Code.

Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said today that the exception in Section 375, the law against rape in the IPC, is discriminatory, capricious and arbitrary. The exception states: ""Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.""

The court ruled that lowering the legal age for sex to 15 only because the minor was married violated the Constitution of India. ""If a man has sexual intercourse with a wife who is below 18 years, it is an offence. The minor wife can complain against the husband within one year,"" the judges said.

""The exception in rape law under the IPC is contrary to other statutes, violates bodily integrity of girl child,"" they said.

Under Indian law, sex with a minor (below 18) is a crime. Until today, the only exception to the law was if the minor was a wife. The exception also ran contrary to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) which criminalizes sex with minors as rape.

The judgment outlawing sex with a minor wife could have a significant impact on curtailing child marriages. The apex court also urged the Indian government to take more initiative in preventing child marriages in the country. The judges observed that social justice laws are not being implemented with the spirit in which they were enacted.

The Supreme Court clarified that it had not ruled on marital rape.

The ruling today was the result of a petition filed by Independent Thought, a Noida based NGO, which challenged the exception under Section 375 as being violative of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.

Nachhaltiges Wirtschaften braucht Kurskorrekturen

Das Leitbild des Ehrbaren Kaufmanns gibt es in Deutschland bereits seit dem Mittelalter. Neu ist allerdings, dass eine Vielzahl von Finanzinvestoren diese zeitlosen Gedanken aufnehmen und ihre Investitionen zuweilen sogar als Druckmittel verwenden, um einen nachhaltigen Richtungswechsel in Unternehmen zu bewirken. Dabei handeln sie nicht losgelöst von gesellschaftlichen Entwicklungen, denn die Nachfrage nach ethisch sauberen Investitionen und Anlagemöglichkeiten ist seit der Finanzkrise erheblich angestiegen.

Ökonomische, ökologische und soziale Aspekte werden zunehmend auch in Hauptversammlungen thematisiert. Hintergrund ist eine Veränderung der Regulierung in Europa. Eine Überarbeitung der Aktionärsrechte-Richtlinie hat beispielsweise zum Ziel, die Anteilseigner aus der Anonymität des Aktienbesitzes herauszuführen und von ihnen aktive Mitsprache einzufordern. Anonyme Inhaberaktien sollen durch Namensaktien ersetzt werden, um eine höhere Beteiligung bei den Hauptversammlungen zu erreichen.

Aktien sollen nicht nur als Investition verstanden werden, sondern auch als greifbares Dokument der Unternehmensverantwortung durch Privatanleger. Darin zeigt sich auch eine (Kurs-)Korrektur des lange einseitig auf kurzfristige Gewinne ausgerichteten wirtschaftlichen Denkens.

Um nachhaltiges Wirtschaften zu gewährleisten, braucht es ehrbare Aufsichtsräte. Der Wirtschaftswissenschaftler, Autor, Steuerberater und Wirtschaftsprüfer Rudolf X. Ruter widmete ihnen 2016 ein ganzes Buch, in dem er dafür plädiert, dass Nachhaltigkeit auch immer ein persönliches Anliegen eines ehrbaren Aufsichtsrats sein sollte. Zudem formuliert er eine Vielzahl von Fragen, die zeigen, worauf es ankommt:

Enthält die Corporate Governance eine Nachhaltigkeitsorientierung? Wie lautet das unternehmerische Verständnis der Nachhaltigkeit? Wie sieht das unternehmerische Nachhaltigkeitsmanagement konkret aus? Was sind die Ziele, wo sind sie verankert, und wo werden sie gemessen? Woran ist erkennbar, dass Nachhaltigkeit ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Unternehmensstrategie ist? Wer ist wofür verantwortlich?

Der ehrbare Aufsichtsrat hat „den Vorstand zu bestellen, zu überwachen und zu beraten und gegebenenfalls in dessen Entscheidungen einzugreifen, indem er zum Wohle der Gesellschaft seine Zustimmung zu Geschäften auch verweigert."" Er lehnt allerdings auch gegebenenfalls eine Berufung in ein Gremium ab und bewertet die Zugehörigkeit zu einer vermeintlich anzustrebenden Gruppe nicht über. „Er folgt lieber seinem eigenen Werte-Kanon"", so Ruter.

Was ihn ausmacht, ist die Fähigkeit zur inneren Reflexion, des Überdenkens und Unterbrechens, „weil er emotional, materiell und persönlich unabhängig ist."" Es geht ihm nicht um das maximale betriebswirtschaftliche Optimum, sondern um das abwägende Innehalten eines rechten Maßes, einer richtigen Urteilsfindung und Entscheidung.

Ruters inhaltlicher Ansatz hängt auch mit der vorgenommenen Änderung innerhalb der Präambel des Deutschen Corporate Governance Index zum Verhalten von Vorständen und Aufsichtsräten zusammen. Hier werden Wirtschaftslenker daran erinnert, dass ihr Verhalten nicht nur legal sein, sondern auch ethisch fundiert und verantwortlich sein sollte. Das sollte zwar selbstverständlich sein, doch wie Ereignisse auch der jüngsten Vergangenheit zeigen, ist es das leider nicht immer. Fairness und eine Haltung der Verantwortlichkeit kann zwar nicht durch Gesetze verordnet werden, aber eine nachhaltige, leistungsfähige und wettbewerbsfähige Wirtschaft braucht Recht und Ethik, die (festgeschriebene) Verpflichtung auf Legalität und auf ethisch fundiertes, verantwortliches Verhalten.

Bereits 1999 stellte der Bundesgerichtshof fest, dass Aufsichtsräte haften, wenn sie Vorstände, die Schaden verursacht haben, dafür nicht in Anspruch nehmen.

Antworten auf die wichtigsten Fragen zum Thema Aufsichtsrat finden sich hier.

• Wer entscheidet darüber, wer in einen Aufsichtsrat gewählt wird?

• Wie setzt sich ein Aufsichtsrat zusammen?

• Was gehört zu den Aufgaben, Rechten und Pflichten eines Aufsichtsrats?

• Welche Kompetenzen müssen Kontrolleure mitbringen, welches Wissen bzw. welche Fähigkeiten sind gefordert?

• Wie können sie sich optimal fachlich, inhaltlich und juristisch auf ihre Aufgabe vorbereiten?

• Wie sieht die Haftung eines Aufsichtsrats aus? Welche Wege gibt es, die Haftungsrisiken zu minimieren?

• Was verdient ein Aufsichtsrat?



Können statt Quote - was einen guten Aufsichtsrat ausmacht

Es geht heute um Können und Kompetenzen statt Quote. Das zeigt sich am Beispiel einer der besten Spitzeningenieurinnen Deutschlands: Univ.-Prof. Dr. Marion A. Weissenberger-Eibl leitet das Fraunhofer-Institut für System- und Innovationsforschung ISI und ist Inhaberin des Lehrstuhls Innovations- und TechnologieManagement am Institut für Entrepreneurship, Technologie-Management und Innovation (ENTECHNON) am Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT).

Seit Juli 2012 ist sie Mitglied im Aufsichtsrat der HeidelbergCement AG. Zuvor konnte der Baustofflieferant keine einzige Frau in Vorstand und Aufsichtsrat vorweisen. Sie bildet mit ihrer Erfahrung und Kompetenz in den Bereichen Innovationsforschung, Foresight, Roadmapping und Szenarienentwicklung, demografische Entwicklung, Nachhaltigkeit und Wissensmanagement eine Ergänzung für das Unternehmen. Außerdem wurde sie im Mai 2013 in den Aufsichtsrat der MTU Aero Engines AG gewählt. Seit Mai 2016 ist sie Mitglied im Aufsichtsrat der Rheinmetall AG.

Das Thema Innovation wird für Unternehmen auch künftig immer essentiell sein - deshalb möchte sie sich auch in Zukunft intensiv damit auseinandersetzen. Ihre Erfahrung ist, dass Entscheider aus allen gesellschaftlichen Teilbereichen, insbesondere aber der Politik, Wirtschaft und Wissenschaft, die Impulse aus der angewandten Innovationsforschung interessiert aufgreifen, um Deutschland auf allen Ebenen voranzubringen.

Neugierde ist für sie eine sehr nützliche Eigenschaft, da sie einen immer aufs Neue motiviert, den Dingen nachzuspüren und die Hintergründe auch komplexester Sachverhalte aufzudecken, die sich nicht auf den ersten Blick erschließen. Sie ist es, die herausragenden Leistungen vorausgeht. Auch in ihrer Arbeit als Aufsichtsrätin profitiert sie von dieser Eigenschaft, denn nachhaltiges Handeln braucht einen ganzheitlichen Blick.

Alas Yogi Adityanath, you have failed us.

When the media was filled with gasps of horrors at a fiery sadhu being handed the reins of Uttar Pradesh, I was secretly excited to learn he was only 5'5"".

The most popular adjective used for the new chief minister of Uttar Pradesh was ""diminutive"".

The New York Times called him ""diminutive, baby-faced"". PTI called him ""diminutive, shaven-headed"" as did Indian Express. The Telegraph described him as a ""diminutive figure in saffron"".

As a height-challenged man myself, I secretly root for my equals, the Jyoti Basus and Pranab Mukherjees, the little men who scuttle their way to the top. I revel in their elevation to power and fortune. I mourn when they get elbowed out at the end. I enjoy the thought that their fans and devotees must look down on them in order to look up to them.

This height challenge is not a figment of my insecurity. Anyone following the Donald Trump reality show knows that size matters. It turns out Trump thought Senator Bob Corker at 5'7"" was too short to be his Secretary of State. Now that Corker has uncorked on him to the New York Times, Trump has taken to taunting him as ""Liddle Bob Corker"". It's always a steeper climb to the top for smaller men, at a disadvantage everywhere except in economy class of airlines.

The current government seems especially keen on statues, the bigger the better.

So it comes as crushing news that the diminutive Adityanath also wants to walk in the footsteps of giants. He will gift us a Lord Ram statue which will be 100 metres tall. Et tu Adityanath? Then fall the League of Diminutive Men. The Age of Pranab-da and Jyoti-babu is truly at an end.

I thought the fiery Adityanath was a David who wanted to slay myriad Goliath. But he turns out to want to be a Goliath himself.

Humanity has a thing for big statues all the way back to the Colossus of Rhodes. But it's a curious thing that these days in India we are hellbent on statue building whereas in much of the world we seem to live in an age of statue toppling. The biggest news in the last decade or so when it comes to statues have been about the ones coming down -– the Confederate heroes of the American South, the Bamiyan Buddhas of Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein in Baghdad, Cecil John Rhodes in Capetown, Cecil John Rhodes in Capetown, Mahatma Gandhi in Ghana. One must be careful about statues. Statues are erected to honour one singular figure. They tend to be brought down in a cathartic rage by nameless masses buzzing with anger.

India it seems to want to buck that trend. The current government seems especially keen on statues, the bigger the better. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was 5'5"" in life. But generations to come will remember him as almost 600-feet tall. Chhatrapati Shivaji was 1.68m according to the Internet. But his Arabian Sea version will be taller than the Statue of Liberty at 190 metres. After laying the foundation stone, Narendra Modi tweeted, ""Shiv Smarak is a fitting tribute to him & his greatness."" It's just that we like to measure greatness not just in deeds but in metres and inches. And the latter is easier, more quantifiable, its wow factor better suited for instant gratification. This history being writ large.

In this government's case, this act of magnification seems even more critical, a special kind of urgency. The BJP has always been on the lookout for heroes from the freedom struggle it could claim for itself. Luckily for it, the Congress with its Nehru-Gandhi fixation had pretty much neglected most other giants in that pantheon. The BJP has latched onto Sardar Patel, a Congressman through and through, and blown him up to 600 feet to show their outsized devotion to him. They want to claim him as their big name.

But times have changed. ""Acche Din"" is no longer as shiny a slogan. The government's leaders are scraping for crumbs of compliments from Nobel laureate Richard Thaler who thought demonetisation was a good idea.

But it's also true that in those heady days of 2014, we yearned to dream big after the measured calibration of Manmohan Singh. Prem Panicker writes in Buzzfeed that Modi's messianic arrival was turbocharged.

One day we heard poverty would be eliminated. The next day the Supreme Court was asked to take a quick decision on MPs with criminal backgrounds. FDI decisions. Bank accounts for all. Bureaucracy shake-ups. Black money. SMART. Make in India. Digital India. Donald Trump said ""We are going to win so much you may even get tired of winning."" Panicker writes that looking back at the first heady days of ""Acche Din"", ""it felt like we were already living Trump's boast two years before he articulated it"". The giant statues were somehow in keeping with the giant claims. Make in India and make it big.

But times have changed. ""Acche Din"" is no longer as shiny a slogan. The government's leaders are scraping for crumbs of compliments from Nobel laureate Richard Thaler who thought demonetisation was a good idea. It's truly a crumb of cold comfort since in the very next tweet Thaler had said, ""really? Damn"" when he heard about the Rs 2000 note. Even with a decimated and ineffective opposition, the government is more petulant these days, fighting off querulous elderly marg-pradarshaks in its own midst and university students and octogenarian writers. And it's equally ignominious to have to take shelter in the shade of a Robert Vadra to defend the business of a Jay Shah when you once claimed the moral high ground of a party with a difference.

When small children keep dying in Gorakhpur's hospitals, the Big Ram seems not just incongruous but a misplaced priority. Now the statues increasingly appear to be reminders of ossified hubris, the frozen blimps of ""Acche Din"" promises.

Die HuffPost hat elf Österreicher gefragt, was jetzt zu tun ist - und wie sie auf die Zukunft ihres Landes blicken

Wenn Österreich am Sonntag einen neuen Nationalrat wählt, geht eine monatelange Schlammschlacht zu Ende.

Alle großen Parteien haben mit immer neue Angriffe auf den politischen Gegner versucht, die Gunst der Wähler zu gewinnen. Islampanik, Meldungen über geheime Firmen in Israel oder gefälschte Studien in islamischen Kindergärten: Die Liste ließe sich beliebig fortsetzen.

Auch das mag ein Grund sein, warum das Land nun so gespalten ist wie selten zuvor. Viele Österreicher sind verunsichert und blicken mit einem schlechten Gefühl auf die Zukunft des Landes.

Die HuffPost hat elf von ihnen gefragt, was jetzt zu tun ist - und wie sie auf die Zukunft ihres Landes blicken. Hier sind ihre Antworten.

""Ich freue ich mich auf den Wahltag. Weil es dann endlich vorbei ist""

Raffaela Lindorfer, Journalistin

""Schwester, was soll ich wählen?"", hat mich mein Bruder, der in Deutschland lebt, kürzlich gefragt. Wäre Kern der bessere Kanzler oder doch Kurz? Kann man Schwarz-Blau irgendwie verhindern? Wäre das wirklich so schlimm, wie alle sagen?

Sollte man aus einem demokratiepolitischen Verantwortungsbewusstsein heraus eine Kleinpartei wie Neos oder die Liste des Ex-Grünen Mandatars Peter Pilz wählen, um sicherzustellen, dass sie nicht aus dem Parlament fliegen? Kann man die Grünen noch irgendwie retten?

Und was soll ich bitte mit den ganzen Umfragewerten anfangen? Ganz ehrlich, ich habe keine Ahnung.

Wovon ich Ahnung habe - so wie mein Bruder, der ein politikinteressierter Mensch ist - ist jedes einzelne Wahlprogramm. Ich kenne jede Aussage jedes Spitzenkandidaten, habe unzählige Interviews, Leitartikel gelesen, Facebook-Postings geliked, geteilt, weggewischt, you name it.

Und so wie viele, die die jüngste Dirty-Campaigning-Affäre desillusioniert hat, was die politische Kultur in diesem Land betrifft, freue ich mich richtiggehend auf den Wahltag. Weil es dann endlich vorbei ist. Wir sind satt, haben genug gehört und gesehen.

Das Problem ist mittlerweile wahrscheinlich: Wir wissen zu viel, wir sehen den Wald vor lauter Bäumen nicht mehr. Deshalb lautet mein Vorschlag an meinen Bruder so: Vergiss das alles. Es ist eigentlich ganz einfach. Wähl den, dem du - so kitschig das klingt - dankbar bist. Dankbar dafür, wie das Leben hier in Österreich aussieht, und was dir woanders fehlt.

So war das mit dem Wahlkampf vor einer gefühlten Ewigkeit - lange vor diese Dirty-Campaigning-Sache - ja gedacht: Dass die Partei versucht, dich, und zwar dich ganz persönlich, von ihrem Plan zu überzeugen.

Im Endeffekt ist es ein gut informiertes Bauchgefühl.

”Kein Volk der Erde würde eine so erfolgreiche Regierung abwählen. Wir laut Umfragen schon”

Livia Klingl, Journalistin und Autorin

Wir haben einen Kanzler, der ist in der Welt sehr angesehen. Nur nicht bei uns.

Wir haben ein sehr gutes Wirtschaftswachstum und eine sinkende Arbeitslosigkeit. Kein Regierungspolitiker auf der Welt würde so eine Regierung sprengen. Bei uns schon.

Kein Volk der Erde würde eine so erfolgreiche Regierung abwählen. Wir laut Umfragen schon.

Wien ist seit Jahren in den Rankings eine der lebenswertesten Städte der Welt. Die Wiener sind darüber böse. Sie ahnen, wir sind ein seltsames Volk.

""Das ist nicht mein Österreich!""

Menerva Hammad, Bloggerin

Ich würde nicht sagen, dass ich mich vor der Zukunft fürchte. Was ich in den Medien höre und im Internet lese, das ist nicht mein Österreich und schon gar nicht mein Wien.

Ich konzentriere mich auf die zwischenmenschliche Beziehung und da haben mich die Österreicher niemals enttäuscht. Ich habe immer das Zitat von Mr. Rogers im Kopf: “Look for the helpers.”

Ich schaue mich in der Öffentlichkeit um. Sei es im Supermarkt, in der U-Bahn, oder einfach auf der Straße. Menschen lächeln mich an, fragen, ob sie mir helfen können und stehen auf, wenn ich mit meiner Tochter in der Straßenbahn einsteige.

DAS ist mein Wien und so lebt mein Österreich. Ganz egal wie die Wahl am Sonntag ausgeht: “I will be looking for the Helpers.”

""Die drei Parteien werden die Prozente unter sich ausmachen und im Moment bin ich über keine Kombination so richtig glücklich""

Pascal Stegemann, Fußball-Redakteur

Als Wahl-Österreicher blicke ich mit gemischten Gefühlen auf die kommenden Wahlen und die Zukunft Österreichs. Der Grund dafür ist, dass für mich keiner der Wahl-Kandidaten der drei großen Parteien (SPÖ, ÖVP, FPÖ) auch nur im Entferntesten wählbar erscheint.

Während mit HC Strache ein gefährlicher Mann an der Regierung beteiligt werden könnte, dem Neonazi-Verbindungen nachgesagt werden und dessen rechtspopulistisches und rassistisches Gedankengut in wackligen Zeiten nur zu gern von der Angst-Gesellschaft übernommen wird, sind die Alternativen unwesentlich besser.

Mit Kanzler Kern steht ein Politiker zur Wahl, der dünnhäutig auf Kritik reagiert und bestimmten Medien den Mund verbietet. Wer als Politiker das Land steuern will, muss in der Lage sein, mit medialer Kritik - wie unsachlich diese auch sein mag - umzugehen. Wer jede zweite Berichterstattung mimöslich aufnimmt und sogar Versuche der Zensur unternimmt, ist im Kanzleramt fehl am Platz!

Zu guter Letzt steht mit der ÖVP jene Partei zur Auswahl, die für mich lediglich als verlängerter Arm der Wirtschaftslobby dient. Der ÖVP geht es darum, Österreich als Wirtschaftsstandort attraktiver machen, mittelgroße und Riesenkonzerne zu unterstützen.

Doch Kurz und Co. vergessen, dass man mit Geld und Kapital eben nicht alles erkaufen kann. Der Zugang zu den Sorgen des kleinen Mannes ist den Herren in Schwarz scheinbar ziemlich gleichgültig. Als Handlanger der Wirtschaftsbosse geht es der ÖVP um maximalen Ertrag.

Wie und ob es dem kleinen Mann gut geht, scheint zweitrangig.

Leider bin ich nicht wahlberechtigt. Diese drei Parteien werden die Prozente unter sich ausmachen und im Moment bin ich über keine Kombination so richtig glücklich.

”Die Solidarität in der Gesellschaft sind dann wichtiger denn je, um gegen das Aushölen der Menschenrechte aufzutreten”

Raphaela Nije, Kindergartenpädagogin, Bezirksrätin

Ich sehe ein Erstarken der Zivilgesellschaft, da aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach Österreich eine rechts-rechte Regierung haben wird.

Der Zusammenhalt und die Solidarität in der Gesellschaft sind dann wichtiger denn je, um gegen den Sozialabbau und das Aushölen der Menschenrechte aufzutreten.

”Österreich läuft Gefahr, in eine gespaltene, von Angst, Neid und Hass geprägte Gesellschaft zu zerbrechen”

Michael Huber-Strasser, Angestellter

Meine Vision ist, dass die Gehälter (im Handel, Verkauf) steigen, die Arbeitslosigkeit sinkt und das Bildungssystem verbessert und ausgebaut wird und dadurch die Zukunftsangst und Abstiegsangst der Menschen sinken und damit auch Fremdenangst, Neidgesellschaft und die Anfälligkeit für Rechtspopulismus.

Dann kann sich eine Gesellschaft entfalten, in der das gemeinsame und respektvolle Miteinander gelebt wird und alle Menschen ein wertgeschätztes, chancenreiches Leben führen können.

Dafür braucht es einen Wahlsieg von Christian Kern, andernfalls läuft Österreich Gefahr in eine gespaltene, von Angst, Neid und Hass geprägte Gesellschaft zu zerbrechen.

”Ich bin optimistisch und schaue mit Zuversicht in unsere gemeinsame Zukunft”

Ich liebe das Land und die Leute. Hier habe ich geheiratet, meine Kinder bekommen, hier arbeite ich, hier lebe ich.

Ich bin überzeugt, dass auch die Zukunft von Österreich, trotz allem was uns derzeit beschäftigt und/oder Sorgen macht, eine großartige wird.

Österreich hat bewiesen, nicht nur einmal, dass Menschen hier ein großes Herz haben und die richtigen Entscheidungen treffen. Ich bin optimistisch und schaue mit Zuversicht in unsere gemeinsame Zukunft.

”Wir werden auch das überleben, was uns der Wahltag bringt!“

Brigitte Hornyik, Juristin und Feministin

Österreich ist reich und schön - nur nicht alle Menschen hier. Wir haben schon viel überstanden, auch eine schwarz-blaue Regierung, einen Burschenschafter und Tierarzt als Frauenminister, und vieles mehr.

Wir werden auch das überleben, was uns der Wahltag bringt!

Und ganz persönlich: Ich lass’ mir dieses schöne Land und meine Heimatstadt Wien sicher nicht nehmen - von nix und niemand! Lieber geh’ ich halt wieder auf die Straße, wie schon so oft, weil: Siamo tutti Antifascisti - Alerta - No pasaran! (zu Deutsch?)

""Ich sehe die Zukunft nur in der gemeinsamen Gestaltung unseres Landes""

Simon INOU, Journalist und Herausgeber von “Fresh Magazine""

Es gibt keine gemeinsame Zukunft solange Österreich nach dem Prinzip ""WIR"" und die ""ANDEREN"" funktioniert. Ich sehe die Zukunft nur in der gemeinsamen Gestaltung unseres Landes.

Wie es woanders im Lande funktioniert: Viele Menschen in ganz Österreich zeigen es tagtäglich auf individueller sowie gesellschaftspolitischer Ebene mit ihrem Engagement und ihrer Solidarität. Das ist für mich Zukunft.

”Die immer schwerer zu kontrollierenden Kräften des Raubritterkapitalismus”

Gernot Galib Stanfel, Musiktherapeut

Die wohl größte Gefahr ist ein aufkeimender Provinzialismus, der die starke Identität Österreichs nur in sich selbst und nicht in einem starken Europa verorten will.

Damit nimmt man sich unter anderem automatisch die Mitgestaltungsmöglichkeit unserer ureigensten Umgebung und setzt sich noch Methoden immer schwerer zu kontrollierenden Kräften des Raubritterkapitalismus aus, der keine geregelten Beiträge zu Gesamtgesellschaft leisten möchten.

Als zweites Problem sehe ich nachhaltige Versuche, eine aus dem christlichen Glauben abgewandelten politische Machtbewegung zu etablieren, die den christlichen Glauben ähnlich pervertiert und missbraucht wie der IS den Islam. Nur nicht mit martialischen Mitteln, sondern mit dem manipulativen Gebrauch von Wissenschaft, Kapital und wirtschaftliche Netzwerken.

Man könnte das in etwa als ""apostolisch christliche Politik"" beschreiben, die durchaus einen gewissen Retrofaktor hat. Diese Politik baut sich offenbar bewusst als Gegensatz zu einem christlichen Pendant eines wahrgenommenen eines ""politischen Islam"" auf.

Das produziert im Endeffekt ein gefährliches Weltbild, in dem Religionen in einer fix zugeordneten Kombination mit Kulturen ausschließlich bestimmter geographischer und territorialer Gebiete zugeordnet werden.

”Ich denke die Wahl wird Österreich nicht allzu dramatisch verändern - das ist leider schon vorher passiert”

Dorothea Schwab, Lehrerin

Ich denke die Wahl wird Österreich nicht allzu dramatisch verändern - das ist leider schon vorher passiert. Gegenseitige Anschuldigungen und Beleidigungen haben auch in Österreich zu einem Klima der Aggression geführt. Jeder ist jedem allein neidig, jeder vermutet hinter allem eine Intrige.

Das Miteinander ist völlig verloren gegangen in unserer Gesellschaft. Die politischen Kleinkriege haben das nur verstärkt.

Nach der Wahl wird es für die Politiker nicht einfach werden, das Vertrauen der Bevölkerung zurück zu gewinnen, vor allem von jenem Teil, der sie nicht gewählt hat. Das wird die politische Arbeit nicht einfacher machen.

These boxes appear so often that it has just become second nature for many of us to fill them in without thinking just to get them to disappear.

So who do we protect agains these?

As Krause points out there are a number of reasons why you’re very very unlikely to ever encounter a fake login box.

For starters they have to be built into the app, which means getting it past Apple’s very strict approval process. Secondly you would need to have downloaded a malicious app, which in turn can be avoided through some checking of the app’s permissions etc.

Most importantly though is activating two-factor authentication.

BENGALURU, Karnataka -- The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Bengaluru Police on Friday released the sketches of the suspects in connection with the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh.

Lankesh was shot dead at her residence by few unidentified assailants on September 5.

""Based on the information we have made the sketches, now we want cooperation from the people,"" the Special Investigation Team (SIT) chief, B.K. Singh, said here.

Singh said they had traced out that the suspects stayed somewhere in Bengaluru for minimum seven days, adding, ""it could be more than 15 days also.""

There are two suspects and the sketches have been made by two artists based on accounts of different eyewitnesses, he said.

Singh emphasised that they couldn't ascertain the religion of the suspects by their external appearances ""like 'tilak or earrings' as they can be misleading too.""

The police didn't confirm if the weapons used in murder of writer M.M. Kalburgi and Lankesh were similar.

The SIT elaborated that they had investigated 200-250 people in connection with the case.

Dee Lundberg has served at the United Church of Christ in Casper, Wyoming, for nine years.
Dee Lundberg Rev.","When Rev. Dee Lundberg joined the United Church Of Christ in Casper, Wyoming, in 2008, the congregation was considering closing its doors. Six years earlier, the inclusive house of worship had announced itself as “open and affirming.” It would welcome everyone, and its clergy would perform same-sex weddings.

But in 2002, the idea of LGBTQ inclusivity was “hugely radical” in Wyoming, Lundberg said. The brutal death of Matthew Shepard, a gay student in the state, had slowly ushered in some change and tolerance, but not much. In the years after the church declared its openness, average attendance at Sunday services had dwindled to 12 people.

After serving as an interim minister in the area, Lundberg came across a position at the struggling church. The job description was the most honest she had ever seen.

“They were laying out their struggles and how they were thinking of voting to close because they’d lost so many members at that time,” she said. “Those who were left wanted to take one more crack at it.”

“Open and affirming” referred to “full inclusion of the LGBTQ community,” Lundberg told HuffPost. Many members of the red-state congregation threatened to leave if the church performed same-sex weddings. Others threatened to leave if it didn’t.

“There was a lot of sadness after that. Some felt they lost family members in a way. But they felt sure that they had done the right thing. Sometimes, doing the right thing hurts,” Lundberg said.

Dee Lundberg Rev. Dee Lundberg and Casper UCC members protest the Defense Of Marriage Act.

In 2012, under Lundberg’s leadership, the church became the first establishment in town to fly a Pride flag. She said a national shift in perspective on LGBTQ issues and a new wave of activism in the city prompted the decision.

“We just as a group decided that we wanted to be louder. The political environment fueled that,” she said. “There’s a crop of younger people that are just ready. We thought, yeah, you know, I think we can do this now. The response wasn’t that bad.”

But Casper, Lundberg said, remains a primarily a conservative Christian town. Fifteen years after publicly committing to equality, church members are “doing our damndest to be open and affirming to all sorts of things,” Lundberg said.

For her, that means maintaining a space for Wyoming’s progressive minority and creating room for more diverse viewpoints. She said young families primarily contribute to the church’s growth.

“They want to raise their kids in a place where they’re going to learn some tolerance and justice and peace, because when they go to school here, they will have a dose of a more fundamentalist student body,” Lundberg said.

Dee Lundberg Rev. Dee Lundberg has served at the United Church of Christ in Casper, Wyoming, for nine years.

Locally, Casper UCC is known for its early commitment to equality. But it’s much more than “the gay church,” Lundberg said: “We’re not a one-trick pony.”

While she tries to avoid explicit social justice or political messages in her sermons, Lundberg said that there are some things, such as the mass shooting in Las Vegas, that there’s “no way I can’t address.”

“My job on Sunday morning isn’t to tell people what to believe, but to throw out the big questions. Sometimes we have a discussion instead of a sermon, because there’s a lot of wisdom in the room,” she said.

Most Sundays, Lundberg focuses her sermons on unity in an increasingly polarized political environment. “It’s a lot of, ‘How do we get through this next week of craziness together?’” she said. “How do we talk to each other and move past these divisions and how do we keep working for social justice and equality in a climate that feels like the waves are always banging against us?”

Lundberg tells congregants to “stay strong.”

“Stay focused. Have hope. Don’t be part of the problem. Don’t feed into the darkness. Find a way to do this with grace. But by all means, don’t stop fighting,” she said.

Dee Lundberg Rev. Dee Lundberg holds a vigil at Casper's United Church Of Christ after the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas.

For Lundberg and Casper UCC, “church” doesn’t simply mean a place of worship. It’s a community.

“My church is by no means all Christian; I have a handful of atheists in there. A truckload of agnostics. They want that community, that tolerant, open, peace-seeking community,” she said.

Lundberg sings in the church band, which primarily performs secular covers. After services on Sunday, the church becomes more of a community center and “sanctuary for people who need a place to voice these more liberal/progressive ideas,” she said.

“People know they can come there. I’ll give them the key, say ‘Make yourself at home.’”

Lundberg grew up in Montana. After getting sober at 26, she was ready to commit her life to social justice.

“I had known since before I can remember that racism and intolerance and war and all was wrong ... and when I got clean and became an addictions therapist, I really launched into the social justice work,” she said.

She has been to D.C. to lobby against the U.S. embargo on Cuba and against the late Defense of Marriage Act. She works to solve hunger and homelessness in Casper, and currently spends most of her energy on suicide prevention work. Under her leadership, a small church in a conservative Christian fundamentalist town became the city’s nexus of progressivism.

But it’s those congregants who stayed with the church in 2002, before LGBTQ equality was popular or feasible, who are “the real heroes of this story,” Lundberg says.

She calls the church’s “open and affirming” journey a “great experiment.” What surprises her most, and makes her most proud, is that it has worked.

“I’m so proud of my people. I’m proud of the fact that it has worked; it has worked for us. It’s like this great experiment in throwing the rulebook away, and finding a way to till the soil for a whole different church experience,” she said.

Dee Lundberg Rev. Dee Lundberg speaks at a rally to protect Medicaid in 2015.

Casper’s United Church of Christ remains small. It continues to struggle with its budget. Wyoming may always be a socially conservative state. But Lundberg and her team have found a stronger currency.

“Every time someone walks through the door and sees the flag, or sits long enough through a sermon, and you see their shoulders kinda relax, or they say something in the prayer time that they finally feel like they’re home or with their people, or it’s okay for me to be who I am ― you can’t put a price on that,” she said.

Cette élection qui se déroule en plusieurs tours sera ensuite validé par l'ensemble des 195 états composant l'Unesco, lors de la 39eme Session plénière (mi-novembre).

Le ou la futur(e) 12ème Directeur général(e) de l'organisation onusienne qui a fait sienne la mission - depuis sa création en novembre 1945 - visant à ""construire la paix dans l'esprit des hommes et des femmes"", aura ainsi la tâche particulièrement ardue de prendre les rênes d'une institution en profonde crise et qui s'interroge quant à son rôle réel en matière de diplomatie culturelle et éducative.

Parmi les 9 candidats initiaux, les quatre premiers tours de scrutin sur les cinq que prévoit le règlement de l'Unesco d'ici la fin de la semaine, en plaçant désormais, au coude à coude, avec chacun 22 voix sur les 30 nécessaires pour être élu, l'ancien ministre de la culture du Qatar et ancien ambassadeur à Paris, Hamid Bin Abdulaziz Al-Kawari, et l'ancienne ministre égyptienne de la famille et de la population, Moushira Mahmoud Khattab (18 voix) et l'ancienne ministre de la culture française, d'ascendance marocaine, Audrey Azoulai (18) semblent conforter un duel entre ces trois candidatures aussi éloignées l'une que l'autre.

Ce duel illustre, du reste, les profonds paradoxes en cours au sein du système multipolaire.

C'est, en effet, sur la base de son mandat, que l'Unesco, parmi les 17 agences onusiennes, agit sur de nombreux terrains dans le but de remplir sa mission essentielle à la stabilité mondiale.

Il est utile cependant de rappeler qu'avec seulement 630 millions d'euros, soit 10% du budget dédié aux opérations de maintien de la paix (7,87 milliards d'euros) les problèmes budgétaires majeurs que rencontre l'agence grèvent encore malheureusement son action et constituent un défi supplémentaire à la réalisation de ses objectifs et devoirs est l'outil de la prévention des conflits.

Il convient ainsi de revenir sur le contexte particulier lié à l'élection en cours.

Bien qu'il soit de tradition que le pays abritant le siège d'une organisation multilatérale ne présente pas de candidat à sa direction, et qu'il avait été tacitement décidé que la succession de la Bulgare Irina Bokova reviendrait à un ressortissant d'un pays arabe, après une domination ""occidentale"" quasi exclusive depuis sa création à la tête de l'exécutif de la place de Fontenoy, la candidature française trouble bien des Etats, qui auraient souhaité qu'une candidature à la fois arabe, musulmane, africaine vienne conforter l'Unesco dans sa dimension multiculturelle.

La perspective d'avoir à la tête de l'institution onusienne, temple de l'humanisme et de l'universalisme, un représentant d'un état farouchement opposé à l'état d'Israël. Le diplomate qatari, n'hésitait ainsi pas lors de ses précédentes fonctions onusiennes - notamment quand il fut vice-président de l'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies, ou lors de sa présidence de la Conférence des Nations Unies pour le Commerce et le Développement (CNUCED) en 2012 - à se singulariser par ses prises de positions.

Ce dernier eu ainsi à ""cautionner des projets et des programmes marqués par des contenus antisémites flagrants"", comme est venu le rappeler la Conférence des présidents, organisation juive américaine, il y a quelques jours, et avant cela le Centre Simon Wisenthal.

Ce choix n'apparaît ainsi pas comme la meilleure des alternatives.

Les Américains ne s'y sont ainsi pas trompé, ayant décidé, ce jeudi 12 octobre de quitter l'Unesco, accusant l'organisation onusienne d'être ""anti-israélienne"", eu égard notamment au vote de novembre 2011 qui permis la reconnaissance de la Palestine au sein de l'UNESCO.

Les Etats-Unis, avaient, du reste, déjà signifié leur profonde désapprobation quant à l'excessive politisation de l'organisation, ayant cessé de payer leur quote-part de l'époque, correspondant tout de même à 20% du budget de fonctionnement de l'organisation. Le Japon lui a emboîté le pas en se retirant de l'organisation en 2016.

Depuis, la résolution d'octobre 2016 portant sur le lien historique entre juifs et Jérusalem, que la résolution récusait, aura cristallisé les critiques quant à une trop forte politisation de l'Unesco, que la perspective d'avoir Hamid Bin Abdulaziz Al-Kawari à la tête de l'institution laisse à redouter irait crescendo.

Même si comparaison n'est pas raison, la question de l'antisémitisme des impétrants demeure aussi un problème significatif.

En effet, déjà en 2009, la candidature de l'ancien ministre de la culture égyptienne, Farouk Hosni, avait été ""repoussée"", pour des propos antisémites et des accusations de corruptions, ""offrant"" le poste à la candidate bulgare, soutenue par la France et les Etats-Unis (qui finançaient, à l'époque, 33% du budget de l'organisation, avant de se retirer, pour cause de reconnaissance de la Palestine au sein de l'Unesco en 2011).

Par ailleurs, l'Unesco, dont la mission régalienne est de promouvoir le dialogue, de renforcer les liens entre nations, d'assurer une mutuelle compréhension entre religions, nationalités et populations différentes pourra t-elle survivre à cette contradiction, qui ferait que le candidat du Qatar soit élu sur une base purement mercantile?

Car le candidat du Qatar, ne cesse de répéter qu'il ""ne vient pas les mains vides"" et que ce dernier avait reçu de la part ""de plusieurs mécènes et instituions qatarie des assurances dans ce sens"", comme ce dernier le confirmait, du reste, dans une interview donnée en mai dernier à Jeune Afrique.

Ce dernier en appelant à un ""Davos"" de la culture, ne levait, d'ailleurs, pas tous les doutes quant à de possibles financements sujets à caution quant à cette idée, au demeurant noble. L'on pense, en tout premier lieu, bien sûr aux fonds d'investissements et entreprises actuellement au cœur du maelström qui a mis le Qatar au ban du Conseil de Coopération du Golfe (CCG) depuis juin dernier.

Bien qu'il ne fasse nul doute que son état ne ""lâcherait"" pas l'organisation alors que cette dernière traverse une profonde crise identitaire autant que budgétaire, est-ce pour autant une raison pour ""privatiser"" voire ""brader"" l'organisation? C'est là un argument qui semble avoir séduit, hélas, plusieurs délégations étrangères.

Pourtant, l'on peut légitimement s'interroger, en portant à la tête de l'organisation qui se proclame être la meilleure promotrice des droits humains fondamentaux, le représentant d'un état, accusé par ses pairs de faire le contraire des desseins onusiens.

En filigrane, c'est bel et bien ""l'utilité"" de l'institution onusienne parisienne qui est en jeu...

Les urgences liées aux changements climatiques, l'impact sur les populations civiles et leurs cadres de vie du terrorisme, les conséquences de la guerre, dont les destructions sont autant matérielles qu'immatérielles, sont autant de priorités que l'UNESCO devrait traiter en urgence et concertation avec le secteur privé, dont les moyens financiers et les gigantesques capacités intellectuelles doivent s'engager dans ce sens.

C'est là, un sujet, qui a déjà été mis à l'ordre du jour à l'occasion du G20 d'Hanovre (6 et 7 juillet), notamment auprès de la Présidence allemande, qui a fait de la mobilisation des acteurs économiques privés en faveur du développement, une de ses priorités. C'est, bien évidemment, un sujet qui tient aussi à cœur de la France, qui préside, depuis le 1er octobre, pour six mois, le Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies.

L'Unesco, sise à Paris, où la culture du dialogue, du partage et de l'échange est érigée en règle, depuis trois siècles de débats républicains, devrait, également, reprendre le chemin des intenses débats intellectuels avec les nombreux think tanks, fondations, centres de recherche académiques, ONG, associations, universitaires, et société civile active et déterminée, en attente et, bien souvent, en quête de tels échanges.

Bref, quand on parle de Paris, l'on parle au monde. L'institution de la Place de Fontenoy, forte désormais de 193 états (dont la Palestine, et encore de la Syrie et le la Corée du Nord, mais désormais sans le Japon et les Etats-Unis), reconnus par l'ONU qui y sont représentés, devrait en être sa caisse de résonance, son porte-voix, même...

The revelations are distressing enough for most readers, but particularly survivors of rape, sexual assault and abuse for whom the reports may be triggering.

Meena Kumari, National Lead for Domestic Violence and Abuse at independent charity Victim Support said the trauma may be “exacerbated when the event or a similar incident are elaborately reported in the media, forcing survivors to relive that experience and past trauma”.

“Sexual violence is a traumatic experience and those who are subjected to it can experience post-traumatic stress symptoms in the same way that those who’ve survived other kinds of trauma might,” a spokesperson for Rape Crisis told HuffPost UK.

Approximately 85,000 women and 12,000 men are raped in England and Wales alone every year, and nearly half a million adults are sexually assaulted.

Not only could certain details cause flashbacks for these individuals, but he manner of reporting can have a lasting impact.

The Rape Crisis spokesperson said: “The way stories like this are reported can sometimes implicitly or less so imply that the victim or survivor was someone partly responsible for the violence perpetrated against them.

“This victim-blaming can add to their own sense of self-blame, shame or guilt, for not being able to prevent or fend off the attack or abuse, for example.”

Caitlin Roper, founder of Collective Shout, a grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification and sexualisation of women, said that revelations such as this can be “devastating” for onlookers with histories of rape and sexual assault.

“It is a painful reminder of how our society regards women who come forward and speak honestly about what has been done to them, and a preview of the treatment they can expect should they speak out themselves.”

However, she believes that the impact of seeing so many women having the bravery to come forward and tell their stories can have a positive impact.

“It can be very validating for survivors to know that other women, perhaps even women they respect, have been through similar experiences and found the strength to overcome them,” she said. “It can be healing to see this abusive treatment of women being widely condemned as wrong and unacceptable.”

It’s important for survivors to safeguard themselves by regularly checking in with how they’re feeling.

Kumari said: “Our advice to anyone who has experienced a sexual assault or for anyone supporting someone through this would be to seek help early on. Early intervention to treat initial signs of stress and trauma can prevent the onset of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).”

Victim Support provided a list of the many potential symptoms associated with trauma:

· Emotional experiences such as shock and numbness, fear and anxiety, helplessness, irritability, lack of confidence, low self-esteem, fear of a similar incident occurring again and also guilt

· Some symptoms may affect people socially such as becoming withdrawn, conflict within relationships and avoidance

· Psychological experiences such as distressing thoughts and images, impaired memory and concentration, disorientation and hypervigilance are common

· There are also physical effects which can range from poor sleep, headaches, insomnia, a lack of appetite and low energy levels

It isn’t just survivors who might be able to spot they aren’t coping with the news cycle, friends and family can also play a crucial role.

Rape Crisis spokesperson advised: “The most important thing is to listen and be patient, allowing them to talk in their own time and not pressuring them into one course of action or another, even if you think something, like therapy or reporting to the police for example, is for their own good or is what you would do in their situation.”

Anupam Kher's newest appointment has led to an outpouring of praise from most quarters, except for the one that should matter to him the most – the students of Pune's Film and Television Institute of India.

The cheerleaders are helmed by his wife Kirron Kher, fellow actor and currently member of Parliament for the Lok Sabha from Chandigarh for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre.

Congratulations my dear @AnupamPkher for becoming FTII Chairman ! Know you will do a great job ! October 11, 2017

A chorus of approval followed, typically summarised by this piece, hailing the elevation of the actor as a step in the right direction. Few would disagree with the fact that Kher has a much more illustrious career than his predecessor Gajendra Chauhan.

A member of the BJP, Chauhan was appointed to the role in 2014, a decision that was widely criticised as a politically partisan move to 'saffronise' the campus. Apart from objecting to Chauhan's ideological leanings, FTII students and alumni pointed out his singularly unimpressive output as an actor.

Compared to towering film personalities like Gulzar, Shyam Benegal and Adoor Gopalakrishnan, who were allegedly in the running for the job, Chauhan seemed like a shockingly ill-judged choice, raising suspicions of nepotism driven by a political agenda.

In Kher's case, at least his acting record is indisputably solid: over 500 films, in several languages, both in industries in India and beyond, scores of stage appearances, and an active engagement with cinema. But, as any sensible employer should know, a shining CV doesn't necessarily make for an ideal candidate.

That statement is especially true in the case of those pursuing creative professions like acting or teaching, which involve an emotional investment quite unlike the impersonal chore of, say, a book-keeper's, and the interplay of one's personal politics and belief systems in the professional sphere.

Kher's public image over the last two years, gleaned from his social media activities, smacks of a stridently pro-BJP agenda.

In 2015, when a group of writers, film personalities and artists decided to return awards conferred on them by the government to protest against the rise of intolerance in India, Kher's response was tellingly abrasive.

Some more usual suspects who never wanted @narendramodi to become PM in d first place have joined the #AwardWapsi gang. Jai Ho.:) — Anupam Kher (@AnupamPkher) October 28, 2015

Instead of engaging with the substance of the gesture by the leading lights of India's intelligentsia, Kher decided to attack them for their criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, under whose watch, as chief minister, Gujarat saw one of the worst communal riots in modern India in 2002.

What's worse, instead of choosing the path of civilised debate and dissent, Kher decided to lump them into a conglomerate — the ""#AwardWapsi gang"" — trivialising their stance and its import. It's not that the matter ended with a sly tweet and an emoticon — Kher actually took to the streets to emphasise his disdain for the lot.

But this was only the beginning.

In February 2016, with student leaders Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), taking the nation to storm with their anti-establishment politics, Kher let loose another malignant remark on Twitter, comparing the young men to cockroaches and vermin that need purging from people's home. He urged for a nationwide ""pest control"" programme, piling vile allegory upon allegory.

घरों में पेस्ट कंट्रोल होता है तो कॉक्रोच, कीड़े मकोड़े इत्यादि बाहर निकलते है। घर साफ़ होता है।वैसे ही आजकल देश का पेस्ट कंट्रोल चल रहा है। — Anupam Kher (@AnupamPkher) February 20, 2016

Days later, he tweeted photographs from the JNU campus, where he addressed the students and ""purified"" it of anti-national slogans chanted earlier by crying ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"".

While love for one's country is a perfectly reasonable feeling to cherish in oneself, it is unfair to impose it as the only acceptable standard of patriotism on others. Given his fractious association with students and institutes of learning, Kher should tread with care as he takes over the running of FTII.

Kher has repeatedly baulked at the slightest hint of the criticism of the ruling government and its policies. Be it to support PM Modi's decision to demonetise high-value currencies last November, which was greeted by widespread public panic, or to abuse 20-year-old pacifist Gurmehar Kaur, he has left no stone unturned to make his allegiances known.

But aside from his right-leaning politics, there is a much bigger concern with Kher's appointment, which his troopers seemed to have conveniently overlooked. He is the founder of a private acting school in Mumbai, which presents a conflict of interest for his new role at FTII — as though being married to a politician, who is a member of the ruling government, and being appointed to run a government-backed institution wasn't problematic enough already.

Kher isn't bothered much. As he told The Quint, ""I am not worried about any clash of interest. I prioritise my various commitments in a very systematic way."" Be that as it may, the students of FTII aren't making matters easy for him.

Within 24 hours of Kher's appointment, they have written an open letter to him, outlining the glitches in the system they are plagued with. From short-term courses running for commercial gains to irregularities over the hiring of staff to the allocation of funds for purchase of equipment to the change in the syllabus, the problems are manifold and require urgent attention.

Hopefully, the new chairman, currently busy pinning tweets of gratitude and basking in the cacophony of applause around him, will pay heed to their demands before long.

Vocal Skills: Initially your infant's vocal skills consist of primarily cries, burps and maybe some 'oooo' sounds. Soon the baby learns to make noises that almost sound like words you speak. Vowels, 'coos' and 'goos' emerge and make way for a more complex repertoire of sounds. As they grow, infants experiment more and more with their mouth, tongue and throat. As parents, you should always react to these sounds your infant is making. When he makes these sounds, go ahead and make them back. Very soon, the two of you will be having a whole ""vocal"" conversation.

Interaction Skills: Babies always have certain preferences that directly lead to wonderful interactions between them and their caregivers. For instance, during the first few months after birth, infants prefer looking at objects varied in shapes and lighting. They like to see something that has angles and curves, as well as differences or contrasts in lightness and darkness. Parents should hold the baby so that they can look at their face. This is an excellent position for boosting his visual skills. The initial smiles which are non-social, are soon shaped into interactive smiling gestures. The way you react to your baby's smile helps him understand this tool for expressing happiness. These preferences of your baby to your face and voice pave a path for future meaningful interactions.

Joint Attention: This is an essential skill that your child needs for developing language. Joint attention is when two or more individuals are focused on, or observing the same object, person or event. This skill is important because when you both are looking at the same object, your comments about that object have more meaning to him. He will benefit from your language models (the way you speak and express) because the language you use is directly tied to the object of his focus.

And at this particular gathering they also stood as a stark representation of the number of New Zealanders who took their own lives between 2016 and 2017.

Around 70 people were in attendance to witness the event -- a silent, solemn crowd paying homage to the suicide crisis crippling their country.

Among the people in attendance, the bagpiper was also someone who has had a child take their own life.

New Zealand's suicide rate has reached a new peak at 606 per year, according to the latest statistics. That puts New Zealand alongside Australia, taking into account the population difference, with a near identical suicide problem (3,027 Australians take their own lives each year).

New Zealand and Australia are above average on suicide rates for OECD countries; Spain, the UK and Canada are well behind while NZ and Australia rank comparably to the United States, Iceland and Switzerland.

For Dave Macpherson, Memorial Park serves as a sombre reminder of the worst day of his life. His son's body was pulled from the river alongside this park in March 2015.

Nicholas Stevens took his own life after multiple stints in an inpatient mental health care centre. He was 21 years old. In among the lines of shoes, Stevens' name could be found etched on a plaque placed on a park bench and dedicated to him with his photo.

Macpherson, a Hamilton City councillor and member of the Waikato District Health Board, told HuffPost Australia the emotional gathering was a reminder of how widespread the issue of suicide is, both in Hamilton and around New Zealand.

""It's a big debate nationwide -- the last two to three years it's become bigger and bigger. Everyday there are stories either about particular cases or the statistics. It's that people have recognised that it's a hell of a problem,"" he said.

""[The shoes were] incredibly effective. We've had photos of these shoes laid out in the far north and far south of the country, in the main street of Auckland, on a bridge in another city, on the beach today in an ocean-side city. It's an icon that tells a story without needing any words.

""The people [in Hamilton] were coming for family or friends and we didn't know them but they all came rushing from down the hill with a pair of shoes for their family members. It was more emotional than I thought it would be.""

The gathering was part of a national roadshow known as The Shoe Project. It's an initiative of the New Zealand healthcare coalition YesWeCare.nz to highlight the devastating effects of suicide around the country.

The Shoe Project was designed to bring awareness to the fact that suicide can affect anyone, from any walk of life.

New Zealand has a population of almost 4.7 million and the 606 Kiwis who took their lives in 2016-17 show that the problem isn't getting any better. This most recent national suicide rate in New Zealand marks the third consecutive year the figure has risen, as well as the highest number for the country since the start of statistics began being recorded.

Campaign organiser Simon Oosterman said the tour of the shoes, mirroring the Maori idea of a hikoi (or protest march across the country), was planned to jump from city to city, ultimately leading to Parliament House in Wellington for International Suicide Prevention Day on September 10.

From place to place, the idea was to show Kiwi lawmakers that suicide has become an issue of national importance just as big as Maori land rights, as has been the theme of famous hikois in the past. It has now become the silent, indiscriminate killer that snakes from one New Zealand island to the other, affecting millions from all walks of life, in no particular order.

As part of the response formed by the tour group, letters addressed to the New Zealand government were written by mothers who had lost children to suicide.

The messages demanded politicians ""have the courage to put aside politics and do what's right"" by introducing a national suicide reduction target, implementing an independent inquiry into the country's mental health sector and focusing on adequate hospital staffing and services.

The hikoi was focussed on the individuals and families affected by suicide across New Zealand.

""People talk about numbers -- using shoes and leaving them empty really shows loss and it really shows visually what's happening. People say, 'Gee, is it really that much?' It gives it more meaning,"" Oosterman told HuffPost Australia.

""You need some way that they can easily participate, and everyone's got a pair of shoes and we've got people who might not have lost someone but still wants to contribute a pair of shoes.

""We've also got people who have lost someone and want to participate but don't want to come to the events because it's too raw, so they donate a pair of shoes, so those families still feel like they're a part of it.""

The problem doesn't stop with New Zealand. Suicide is now a major problem in countries around the world.

And as the roadshow progressed, and the team behind The Shoe Project came to further realise the extent of the problem, Oosterman said it was the heartbreaking, yet sometimes empowering, stories of the people he met at each local event that revealed the gravity of allowing them to talk about their circumstances.

From a mother who hadn't talked about the loss of her child for 25 years but felt supported enough to do so at one of the gatherings, to a 24-year-old from Invercargill who had lost 12 friends to suicide, and another teenager who had attempted taking his own life the night before coming to one of the events, the campaign was offering New Zealanders the opportunity to be part of a solution.

""[The teenager] stayed the whole day with us and brought his friends and he felt like he was a part of something, it wasn't a negative thing for him, it was like he a was part of the solution,"" Oosterman said.

""It was a really touching moment. I think we may have saved a life there.

""If you don't talk about suicide, that means we're leaving bereaved families at home, on their own, in pain, without sharing it.""

Suicide isn't just felt by families from around New Zealand and Kiwis aren't the only people putting their shoes out to send a message. The issue is plaguing countries around the world and there are people from multiple continents who have realised the power of speaking up.

Last year the Movember Foundation, a charity organisation that looks at addressing the biggest health issues faced by men, also arranged empty pairs of shoes in cities around the world as a marker of the devastating effects of suicide on men.

Craig Martin, the Movember Foundation's global director of mental health and suicide prevention, told HuffPost Australia the events were organised on November 1 in Australia, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States to symbolise the extent of loss of human life.

From the sunrise-lit, sandy shores of Sydney's Bondi Beach to the paths lining the River Thames under London's iconic Tower Bridge and to the picturesque serenity of New York's Central Park -- an army of shoes, representing the silent, lost lives of millions, show exactly how severe the impact of suicide has become.

191 pairs of shoes on Sydney's Bondi Beach represented the number of Australian men who take their lives within a month.

""Suicide is a massive issue, it's one of our key cause areas that were really passionate about and that we've invested a lot into,"" Martin said.

""When you're talking about suicide statistics, they just become numbers. The sad reality is that you know the devastating effect suicide has on a family and a community and, while it's really easy to talk about numbers, you lose that reality when you do.

""Laying out shoes symbolises a human life -- this was a man who existed in the world and meant a whole lot to different people and now they're gone.""

And in the United States? 1,620 pairs of shoes were lined up in multiple locations across the country.

And just like The Shoe Project in New Zealand, Martin also said connecting the empty shoes to the identity of a person was a way for the Movember Foundation to send a strong message and start a crucial conversation.

""It's the leading cause of death for young men between the ages of 15-29... [but] statistics can sometimes be so cold,"" he said.

""The [shoe] concept resonated with people and since then people have gone on to replicate that. I think because of that -- it's powerful imagery, it's emotive -- people get more of a sense that these are not just numbers, these are people's lives. Separately to that, people say 'Wow, that's a lot of people'. The response we got was really encouraging.

""There's been quite a narrative about, we need to be asking people and men, are they okay? It's trying to get people around to check in and say, 'How are you really going?' and then go through a process of ask, listen, encourage action and check in, it's a four-step process.""

Another 247 pairs were organised for London's Pottersfield Park in the United Kingdom.

That might seem like an easy process on paper -- but Martin also acknowledged that people around the world still struggle with the assumed implications of having conversations about suicide.

""People want to be there but they often get concerned that maybe they won't be able to deal with it,"" he said.

""There's sometimes a false belief that if you ask someone if they're thinking of killing themselves that they'll go off and do it and we know from research that that just isn't the case.

""It's about helping people to feel confident to have a conversation.""

Shoes were also set up in New York's Central Park, as well as 91 pairs in Stockholm, Sweden, 375 in Dublin, Ireland and 136 across Canada.

As Dave Macpherson stands still behind the Waikato River, the sound of 'Amazing Grace' washing over him and his eyes jumping from one pair of shoes to another, he finds clarity in his pursuit of an answer: the key to addressing suicide is talking about it.

There needs to be a culture change around the way mental health is spoken about and treated for any effective progress to be made.

""The first thing, we've got to start people talking about it and the problems they're having. It's a big issue here, including the families in treatment and support planning,"" Macpherson told HuffPost Australia.

""There are some things that are heading in the right direction but there's a whole culture change that needs to happen.

""We've had nurses in the mental health sector going onto our son's Facebook page and saying to us, 'You guys should forget about it, it happened two years ago get over it'. That's the attitude of the people who say they're caring for the patients, that's the cultural problem we're up against still.""

In October 2015, a little over a year after Narendra Modi became prime minister, the price of pulses suddenly saw a sharp increase. It was, as it often is, election season. Narendra Modi had staked his own persona in the high-pitched battle for Bihar. Lalu Yadav's supporters came up with a biting slogan: Arhar Modi, a pun on Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi – the slogan for the PM's Lok Sabha campaign in Varanasi.

Arhar dal, also known as Tur or Split Pigeon Pea, is an Indian staple. Since Arhar Modi, the government has imported pulses in such large quantity that it has caused a glut in the market. There's mayhem among farmers, they are unable to sell pulses even at the minimum support price, which they complain is already a lot less than minimum should be.

It was only in May 2017 the government finally relented and decreased its Tur import quota, increasing the import duty on it. In financial year 2016-17, the total import of pulses increased by 20 percent.

By not raising MSP the Modi government is exacerbating rural distress, but it doesn't seem to mind: controlling inflation is the top priority.

Agriculture expert Devender Sharma has wondered why the government has been punishing Indian farmers — increasing pulses at a high price while refusing to increase the MSP — making prices crash and farming unviable. While the government has been causing a glut of pulses so that sudden lack of supply doesn't result in inflation, it doesn't want to increase the money in the farmers' pockets as their consumption will boost rural demand and hence inflation. (The government blamed back-to-back droughts as the need to increase imports.)

By not raising MSP the Modi government is exacerbating rural distress, but it doesn't seem to mind: controlling inflation is the top priority.

The case of Tur Dal is just a snapshot of Modi's one-point economic policy: keeping inflation low at any cost. And the Bihar election was no turning point; inflation had been a top priority for Modi from day one.

In March 2015, the Modi government and the Raghuram Rajan-led Reserve Bank of India agreed to make a historic change in India's monetary policy, making inflation-targeting the centerpiece of it. They agreed to amend the RBI Act and create a monetary policy committee that would give the centre a greater say than earlier.

Just before Rajan stepped down as RBI chief, the government agreed with him on setting an inflation target of 4%, with a minimum of 2% and maximum of 6%. Rajan was criticised by many for sacrificing growth at the altar of inflation targeting, because this required him to not lower interest rates beyond a point.

Split pigeon peas are displayed for sale in a store at a local market in Hyderabad, India, on Saturday, July 9, 2016.

But after Rajan left, the RBI and the government have continued with the policy. Modi even hailed inflation targeting in his 2016 independence day speech.

The BJP's in-house loose canon, Subramanian Swamy, had called Raghuram Rajan ""mentally not fully Indian"" for choosing inflation targeting over rate cuts, alleging that he was wrecking the Indian economy. Swamy had demanded Rajan's sacking. But the Modi government's backing of inflation targeting has only proved that it needed that move more than Rajan.

It is nearly impossible for any central government to be re-elected if there's high inflation. People react instantly and angrily to mehngai, price rise, and never blame state governments or global factors for it. In a emerging economy like India, keeping inflation low is often difficult. High growth needs high economic activity resulting in high inflation. Between high growth and losing elections, the Modi government has made a clear choice.

Between high growth and losing elections, the Modi government has made a clear choice.

Given the Reserve Bank of India has lost its claims to being an autonomous institution since demonetisation, it's clear who is calling the shots on the monetary policy.

Demonetisation, by stifling economic activity, resulted in lowering inflation even further. That may well have been one of the considerations in going ahead with demonetisation: an unintended side benefit.

One great risk to inflation is the Goods and Services Tax. Across the world, the introduction of GST, with all the preparation and precautions, results in raising inflation substantially for a year or two. (Thereafter, it helps bring keep inflation in check.)

This is why the government was in a crying hurry to introduce GST in the middle of the financial year. It didn't want GST to happen too close to 2019. Despite keeping more than half the items of the Consumer Price Index out of GST, it is already contributing to raising inflation again. But thanks to the dip caused by demonetisation, GST-caused inflation won't pinch as much.

Defending his government's management of the economy last week, the first data point the prime minister showed was a comparison of inflation in his three years and the last three years of UPA-2.

While UPA-2 lost the political narrative to one alleged scam after another, surveys showed people were most angry about inflation. Thanks to generous increases in MSPs for farmers, high crude prices and other factors, the UPA years were marked by high inflation.

The Modi government has been lucky with inflation thanks to record low oil prices, but those are rising again. There have been other factors, such as the increase in wages of government employees. The economic slowdown, caused partially by the disastrous decision of demonetisation, is helping Modi succeed in his one-point economic agenda: low inflation.

The government could increase MSP for farmers, and provide a rural stimulus, just before the 2019 elections, possibly in the forthcoming budget. That way, it would hope to appease farmers, while making sure inflation impact is not felt before the summer of 2019.",Modi Has A One-Point Economic Agenda And It’s Succeeding,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/12/modi-has-a-one-point-economic-agenda-and-it-s-succeeding_a_23240771/

POLITIQUE - Encore deux mois. Deux mois d'attente pour les partisans de la construction de l'aéroport de Notre-Dame-des-Landes dont quelques centaines ont manifesté à Nantes ce samedi. Deux mois de travail pour les trois médiateurs nommés avant l'été par le gouvernement. Deux mois de silence pour Nicolas Hulot, engagé de longue date contre les travaux mais désormais contraint à la solidarité gouvernementale.

C'est en décembre que l'on connaîtra les résultats des travaux de la mission chargée d'examiner en toute indépendance"" toutes les alternatives pour développer le trafic aérien dans le grand ouest. Deux alternatives sont sur la table: agrandir l'actuel aéroport (devant lequel 300 partisans de NDDL ont manifesté) ou en construire un nouveau.

""Je me plierai à la décision indépendante du gouvernement"" qui sera consécutive au travail de cette médiation, a indiqué Nicolas Hulot mercredi à l'Assemblée nationale où il a du se défendre de tout conflit d'intérêt. Seulement le lendemain sur France Inter, le ministre préféré des Français a quelque peu nuancé son propos. Alors qu'on lui demandait s'il se sentait utile, il a demandé à ce qu'on lui repose la question en décembre. Entre les deux, il a été reçu pour un dîner à l'Elysée avec Emmanuel Macron.

Le ministre de la Transition écologique et solidaire met d'une certaine manière la pression sur le choix final de l'exécutif puisque à demi-mot, il laisse entendre qu'il partira du gouvernement si l'aéroport est construit. ""En ce moment, c'est compliqué pour lui, il se pose beaucoup de questions, rapporte un député de la majorité. Dans sa carrière, jusqu'à maintenant, il a toujours cherché à être dans la synthèse, la recherche du compromis. Or il sait qu'il va bientôt devoir choisir et trancher.""

L'Etat menacé de poursuites judiciaires

Les partisans de l'aéroport de Notre-Dame-des-Landes ont vu dans les sorties de Nicolas Hulot une tentative de chantage. Le ministre était clairement dans leur viseur ce samedi matin. ""Médiation bidon, Hulot démission"", ont-ils par exemple scandé. ""On se demande si Nicolas Hulot n'influence pas de manière directe cette médiation en faveur du maintien de Nantes-Atlantique"", a renchéri Jean-Claude Lemasson, le maire d'une commune ligérienne impacté par ""les nuisances sonores"" de l'actuel aéroport.

""Il faut qu'Emmanuel Macron ait le courage de prendre la bonne décision"", a dit aussi une manifestante. Pour accentuer la pression, le président du conseil général de Loire-Atlantique menace l'Etat de poursuites judiciaires. ""Si Emmanuel Macron renonce, j'attaquerai l'Etat"", annonce Philippe Grosvalet dans Le Figaro.

""We were sitting chatting. There was some sort of commotion outside, the doors were open, but we didn't pay attention until the first shot rang out,"" he said.

Pakade, 22, said the next thing he remembers is a man running into the club with two more men chasing after him.

""One of the men, a short man in a hoodie, fired two shots in the direction of the dance floor.""

Pakade said the man ran through the crowds towards the bathrooms, while the two men chased after him.

""There was another three shots. By that time everyone was trying to get out, it was chaos,"" he said.

""I went over to the woman on the dancefloor. I could see she had been shot on the head... she wasn't breathing,"" he said.

Pakade said after the shooting, club goers were standing around outside shocked and traumatised.

""One girl, I think she is a student, had blood on her. I don't think it was her blood, but she was crying outside looking for her friends,"" he said.

""It was very traumatic. I never thought this could happen here, in Stellenbosch.""

He had read about other recent club shootings, but that had happened in the Cape Town CBD, he said.

Stellenbosch University spokesperson Martin Viljoen told News24 the university community learnt of the news with great concern and sadness, and sends its sincere condolences to all those affected.

No students were killed or injured in the incident, to their knowledge. He said it was possible that students were inside the club at the start of the shooting, raising concern over current safety in public spaces.

Ce mensonge se manifeste principalement en pratiquant le sophisme par amalgame. Cela fonctionne ainsi :

""Le Front national a la position Y, La France insoumise a aussi la position Y, Donc le FN et la FI c'est la même chose"".

Cette rhétorique est intellectuellement malhonnête, donc mensongère. Cela se démontre facilement, en l'appliquant à La République En Marche :

""Le Front national a défendu la suppression de la carte scolaire et l'autonomie des établissements, Et La République En Marche a défendu la suppression de la carte scolaire et l'autonomie des établissements, Donc le FN et LREM c'est la même chose"".

Ou au parti Les Républicains :

""Le Front national veut baisser l'immigration, Et le parti Les Républicains veut baisser l'immigration, Donc le FN et LR c'est la même chose"".

Ici comme ailleurs, la fausseté des sophismes par amalgame repose sur une chose simple : des points communs entre deux choses ne suffisent pas pour conclure que ces deux choses sont identiques.

Contrer ce mensonge est facile. En réalité, le FN et la FI présentent des différences idéologiques tellement profondes que prétendre à leur similarité n'a aucun sens. Notamment, pour ne citer que les plus évidentes:

- Le FN est raciste, alors que la FI est résolument antiraciste.

- Le FN est xénophobe, alors que la FI est ouvertement pour la solidarité internationale entre les peuples.

- Le FN ne propose pas de programme de redistribution des richesses au bénéfice des classes moyennes et des classes populaires, alors que c'est le cœur du projet de la FI.

Le mensonge ""La FI est islamo-gauchiste"" :

Ce point a été analysé avec rigueur par ""Désintox"", la rubrique de vérification des faits du journal Libération.

Le terme ""islamo-gauchisme"" provient notamment de l'historien des idées Pierre-André Taguieff, pour désigner une fraction de l'extrême gauche qui, par jusqu'au-boutisme de la défense des peuples géopolitiquement et économiquement dominés, en viennent à défendre ou excuser le communautarisme, la misogynie, l'homophobie, ou encore le rejet de la laïcité, au nom du droit des dominés à la différence.

Rappelons d'emblée qu'en France, les organisations islamo-gauchistes au sens ainsi défini n'ont jamais réussi à dépasser le stade du groupuscule marginal. Je pense par exemple aux ""Indigènes de la République"", ayant pour porte-parole Houria Bouteldja, dont j'ai combattu les positionssur le plateau de feue l'émission Ce soir (ou jamais !). En dépit de leurs propos et événements provocateurs (notamment un ""camp d'été décolonial interdit aux Blancs""), destinés à attirer l'attention des médias mainstream pour avoir de la publicité gratuite (dont beaucoup tombent stupidement dans le panneau), ce groupuscule n'arrive pas à devenir un mouvement de masse. La raison en est simple : l'écrasante majorité des Français de confession musulmane sont contre le communautarisme, contre le racisme envers qui que ce soit, pour l'égalité hommes-femmes, et pour la laïcité: l'enquête sociologique quantitative publiée par l'Institut Montaigne en 2016 en atteste.

Cela étant, lorsqu'elle était militante antiraciste avant d'être députée de la France insoumise, Danièle Obono compta les Indigènes de la République parmi ses voisins de combat. Le mensonge anti-FI repose donc, à nouveau, sur un sophisme par amalgame :

""Danièle Obono a voisiné les Indigènes de la République dans son militantisme antiraciste, Et les Indigènes de la République sont communautaristes, misogynes, anti-laïcité, racistes, Donc Danièle Obono l'est aussi, Donc à travers elle, la FI inclut une composante qui l'est aussi"".

Contrer ce mensonge est facile, à plusieurs titres :

Danièle Obono a des points communs avec les Indigènes de la République: elle pense par exemple qu'il y a encore une mentalité coloniale dans la société française. Cependant cela ne permet pas de déduire ""Obono = Indigènes"".

Danièle Obono n'a rigoureusement jamais exprimé de position qui soit communautariste, misogyne, anti-laïcité, ou raciste.

Rigoureusement rien dans le programme de la France insoumise, ""L'Avenir en commun"", n'est communautariste, misogyne, anti-laïcité, ou raciste.

Par parenthèse, ces dernières semaines Danièle Obono est régulièrement attaquée pour avoir dit que parler de ""radicalisation"" est hors-sujet à propos d'un chauffeur de bus qui refuserait pour motif religieux de toucher un volant touché par une femme. Or, il se trouve qu'en toute rigueur, elle a raison : le fait d'adhérer à un islam puritain et réactionnaire est une chose, le fait de devenir djihadiste en est une autre.

Elle est également attaquée pour avoir dit que ""la radicalisation n'est pas un concept scientifique arrêté"". Or, là aussi, en toute rigueur elle a raison : la question de savoir si le djihadisme est la dernière étape d'une radicalisation religieuse ou si au contraire, les djihadistes sont majoritairement sans pratique religieuse avant de devenir terroristes, agite encore les experts antiterroristes et les islamologues. Je pense par exemple au débat entre les islamologues Gilles Kepel et Olivier Roy. Bref, là aussi les accusations sont des procès mensongers.

Le mensonge ""La FI n'a pas de programme"":

Sans doute est-ce le mensonge le plus facile à contrer de tous. Il existe en effet un livre complet, toujours en vente à l'heure où j'écris ces lignes : L'Avenir en commun (Seuil, 2017). Il existe également un site Internet avec ce même programme et des livrets thématiques pour détailler certains volets. Il suffit donc de rappeler leur existence à quiconque convoque cette affirmation fausse.

Le mensonge ""FI = danger de dictature"" :

Qu'il s'agisse par exemple d'un Manuel Valls disant que la France insoumise serait ""dangereuse pour notre démocratie"", ou d'un Xavier Bertrand accusant Jean-Luc Mélenchon d'être ""dangereux"", cette diabolisation des Insoumis est de plus en plus courante.

Elément étonnant, cette accusation pourtant très grave ne repose généralement sur aucune preuve concrète : elle est juste affirmée. J'en ai fait moi-même l'expérience lors d'un récent débat télévisé:

Clash entre @juliettemeadel et moi: ""Désolé Madame. Je suis @FranceInsoumise et j'ai oublié de venir avec un couteau entre les dents"" @CNEWSpic.twitter.com/EgjzAw6CQy — Thomas Guénolé (@thomas_guenole) 20 septembre 2017

Là encore, le mensonge est facile à contrer, à double titre :

Il n'y a rigoureusement rien dans le programme de la FI, ""L'Avenir en commun"", qui soit une menace pour la démocratie. Il prévoit au contraire, notamment, la rédaction d'une nouvelle Constitution par une Assemblée constituante élue, ce qui est par définition démocratique ; ainsi que le droit pour les citoyens de déclencher un référendum de révocation de leurs élus (député, maire, voire président), mécanisme qui existe par exemple en Californie pour révoquer le gouverneur par référendum mais qui n'existe pas en France.

Il n'y a rigoureusement rien dans le programme de la FI qui soit une menace pour les droits de l'Homme. Au contraire, Amnesty International, ONG de référence, a conclu que les propositions de la France insoumise rejoignent ses propres recommandations.

Le mensonge ""Mélenchon est pro-Poutine"", ""pro-Assad"", etc.:

Cette accusation revient en boucle, en particulier de la part d'un Benoît Hamon ou d'un Yannick Jadot.

Ce mensonge est lui aussi facile à contrer. Comme l'a expliqué Djordje Kuzmanovic, porte-parole de la campagne présidentielle de Jean-Luc Mélenchon pour la défense et les affaires internationales, il est factuellement faux de prétendre que Jean-Luc Mélenchon serait ""pro-Poutine"", ""pro-Assad"", etc.. En réalité, sa position et celle de ""l'Avenir en commun"" consistent à vouloir rétablir la diplomatie du général De Gaulle: sortie de l'OTAN ; non-alignement sur les Etats-Unis ou sur toute autre puissance; rétablissement de l'entente avec la Russie comme élément de rééquilibrage face à Washington et envers Berlin ; et rôle pour la France de porte-parole, parmi les nations riches, des intérêts des peuples pauvres.

Bei der Wahl in Österreich droht den Sozialdemokraten ein Debakel

Bei einer Kundgebung der SPÖ demonstrierte Kanzler Kern erneut, wieso seine Partei im Wahlkampf untergegangen ist

Die europäische Sozialdemokratie droht nun ein weiterer bitterer Tag

Der Tag, bevor sich Österreich für immer verändern könnte, begann sonnig und mit einer ordentlichen Portion Selbstbetrug.

Auf dem Viktor-Adler-Markt im Bezirk Favoriten hatten sich die Wiener Sozialdemokraten am Samstagvormittag zu einer letzten Kundgebung vor der Nationalratswahl am Sonntag getroffen. ""Unser Favoriten“, sagt die Moderatorin auf der Bühne, in dem Wissen, dass an diesem Ort, der nach einem der Begründer der österreichischen Arbeiterbewegung benannt ist, mittlerweile auch die rechten Populisten der FPÖ ihre Kundgebungen abhalten.

Viele Hundert Menschen stehen im Publikum: Junge wie Alte, Studenten und Arbeiter. Helfer verteilen Schilder mit der Aufschrift ""Gemeinsam kommen wir weiter"". Ein Slogan, der nach dem mit allen Mitteln der Niedertracht geführten Wahlkampf nicht ganz ironiefrei wirkt.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ein österreichischer Journalist berichtet: ""Wer hier rechte Politik kritisiert, muss dafür büßen""



Alle drei großen Parteien haben sich Mühe gegeben, den Gedanken an die durch den politischen Konsens geprägte politische Kultur der österreichischen Nachkriegsgeschichte wie einen historischen Irrtum aussehen zu lassen.

Während der deutsche Bundestagswahlkampf lange Zeit ereignislos dahin plätscherte, wirkte der politische Ideenstreit in Österreich wie eine Doppelfolge ""House of Cards"" nach dem fünften Obstler.

Nur die SPÖ geht in der Schlammschlacht unter

Ein früherer Berater von Christian Kern lancierte verleumderische Webangebote gegen Sebastian Kurz, dem Spitzenkandidaten der ÖVP.

Unter dem Titel ""Die Wahrheit über Sebastian Kurz"" wurden auf Facebook zum Teil ausländerfeindliche und antisemitische Inhalte verbreitet. Auch die ÖVP hatte zuletzt mit einem Skandal um die Verächtlichmachung der politischen Konkurrenz zu kämpfen.

Die FPÖ ihrerseits machte nie einen Hehl daraus, dass ihr Wahlkampf darauf basiert, die politische Konkurrenz madig zu machen. Überall in Österreich stehen Plakate, auf denen die angebliche Verlogenheit der ""Roten"" und der ""Schwarzen"" angeprangert wird.

Es ist jedoch allein die SPÖ, die in dieser wochenlangen Schlammschlacht nicht nur an Zustimmung, sondern auch ganz grundsätzlich an Glaubwürdigkeit verlor.

Was doppelt tragisch ist: Denn im Herbst 2017 deutet sich nicht nur das Ende der österreichischen Sozialdemokratie als staatstragende Kraft an. Eigentlich bräuchte Österreich gerade jetzt ein starkes Gegengewicht zu den Populisten und der nach rechts gerückten Kurz-ÖVP. Die beiden letztgenannten Parteien kommen in den Umfragen auf etwa 60 Prozent der Stimmen.

Kerns 18-Minuten-Rede war voll von Widersprüchen

Als Bundeskanzler Christian Kern die Bühne am Viktor-Adler-Markt betritt, wird deutlich, wo die systemischen Fehler liegen, die der SPÖ derzeit Zustimmungswerte auf der Flughöhe ihrer deutschen Schwesterpartei bescheren.

Kerns 18-minütige Rede war voll von offensichtlichen Widersprüchen, die man nur dann übersehen kann, wenn man seiner politischen Gesinnung anhängt wie ein Fußballfan seinem Lieblingsverein.

Einerseits beklagte Kern den schmutzigen Wahlkampf. Andererseits ließ er gut 20 Stunden vor Öffnung der Wahllokale keine Gelegenheit aus, um noch einmal ein paar rhetorische Tiefschläge zu verteilen.

Der SPÖ-Kanzler stellte sich – trotz aller bekannten Vorwürfe gegen die SPÖ-Kampagne – als Opfer der Medien dar.

""Es hat teilweise richtige Hetzkampagnen in einzelnen Medien gegeben"", klagte Kern. ""Dahinter steht die Idee, dass die glauben, dass sie sich gemeinsam mit der ÖVP aussuchen können, wer der nächste Bundeskanzler ist. Und zwar bevor die Menschen zu den Wahlurnen geschritten sind.""

Es gehe um die Interessen der ""95 Prozent"", und nicht um die die von ein ""paar Superreichen und Herausgebern"".

Es sind Worte, die man anderswo in Europa eher von jenen erwartet, die sich verschwörerisch zuraunen, dass ""die Eliten"" mit Hilfe eines ""Masterplans"" das ""Volk"" um ihr Recht betrügen wollten. Nur dass so etwas in Österreich aus dem Munde des amtierenden Bundeskanzlers kommt.

Der Kanzler wittert eine Verschwörung

Kern unterstellt seinen politisches Kontrahenten außerdem – ohne das so zu nennen – ein oligarchisches Geschäftsmodell. Reiche Geschäftsleute hätten sich mit ihren Spenden politische Positionen bei der ÖVP erkauft, und die FPÖ diene sich als Vollstreckerin dieser Absprachen an.

""Es ist bemerkenswert, wie sich die Freiheitlichen hier den Steigbügelhalter für die Interesse der Großspender von Sebastian Kurz machen"", so Kern. ""Da machen ein paar Leute den Deal ihres Lebens: Du spendest ein paar Millionen, und kriegst Milliarden zurück.""

Auch einen sexistischen Seitenhieb auf die ÖVP konnte sich Kern nicht verkneifen: Die ehemalige Chefberaterin von Ex-Bundeskanzler Wolfgang Schüssel sitze nun ""auf dem Schoß"" von Sebastian Kurz.

Doch es sind nicht nur diese heftigen, bisweilen diffamierenden und unbelegten Vorwürfe, die ein schlechtes Licht auf den Wahlkampf der SPÖ werfen. Bisweilen wirkte Kern so, als sei er dazu verdammt, alle inhaltlichen Fehler zu wiederholen, die bereits dem SPD-Kanzlerkandidaten Martin Schulz zum Verhängnis geworden waren.

Die Sozialdemokraten scheitern nach altem Muster

Kern sagte, dass die SPÖ für Steuergerechtigkeit und kostenlose Hochschulbildung kämpfen wolle. Die Reichen müssten ihren gerechten Anteil bezahlen, um das Gemeinwesen zu finanzieren.

Auch die deutsche SPD setzte auf einen Wahlkampf, der sich auf ""soziale Gerechtigkeit"" fokussierte. Ein wichtiges Thema. Doch ohne den Bezug auf ein funktionierendes Zukunftsbild – das ist die Lehre aus dem deutschen Wahlkampf – verfangen solche Forderungen nicht.

Es zeigte sich zum Beispiel: Wenn Menschen nicht mehr daran glauben, dass Bildung ihnen eine bessere Zukunft sichern kann, dann berührt es sie auch nicht, ob das Studium nun kostet oder nicht.

In einer Zeit, die immer stärker von einer Schutzhaltung vor dem Kommenden geprägt ist, schaffen es Sozialdemokraten in ganz Europa nicht mehr, die Menschen davon zu überzeugen, dass sie sich glaubwürdig für die Emanzipation des Individuums einsetzen.

Und Kern? Der lobte sich in seiner Rede auf dem Viktor-Adler-Markt auch noch dafür, dass es seiner Regierung gelungen sei ""von Monat zu Monat weniger Migration in Österreich“ zuzulassen.

Ein Slogan der Kern-Anhänger zeigt, dass seine Zeit vorbei ist

Es steht zu erwarten, dass die SPÖ am Sonntag am eigenen Leib spüren wird, wie betagt sozialdemokratische Politik im Jahr 2017 bisweilen wirkt.

Die Umfragen deuten darauf hin, dass die österreichischen Sozialdemokraten nicht nur ihr historisch schlechtestes Wahlergebnis einfahren werden. Nach dem derzeitigen Stand der Dinge ist es auch sehr unwahrscheinlich, dass sie an einer neuen Regierung beteiligt sein werden.

Auf dem Viktor-Adler-Markt skandieren die Anhänger von Kern nach dessen Rede ""Yes we can!"".

Ein zehn Jahre alter Slogan. Erfunden von einem Politiker namens Barack Obama, der heute hilflos zuschauen muss, wie sein rechtsradikaler Nachfolger Donald Trump das Land verändert. Eigentlich wäre damit schon alles gesagt. Wenn es nicht so tragisch wäre.

¿Recuerdan cuando el profesor sustituto no podía pronunciar en la clase el nombre del niño ""extranjero"" y que siempre hacían una pausa para tomar aire y poder decirlo en voz alta? Eso me pasaba todo el tiempo. O como en la cola del Starbucks, ya estaba tan frustrada que mejor decía que me llamaba ""Bob"". Fue tal el asunto que cuando era chica deseaba mejor haberme llamado Ella, como la gran Ella Fitzgerald, o hasta como Ellen Woods. Dos mujeres, que, si bien eran tan diferentes, son fantásticas y muy inspiradoras.

No pretendo decir que apenas comencé a tener broncas con mi nombre, mi identidad y el hecho de ser ""diferente"". Como una ciudadana egipcio americana, inmigrante nacida en El Cairo, pero criada en los EU, y una mujer musulmana, ha sido difícil sentirme cómoda en mi propia piel, sobre todo en los Estados Unidos después del 9/11. Pero en tanto he crecido, he comenzado a entender lo histórico de mi nombre, y lo bello y valioso que es. Así que, antes de seguir con esto, me gustaría decir: gracias mamá y papá, por haberme concedido este regalo.

Isis, una diosa de la antigua religión egipcia, y luego adorada por todo el periodo grecorromano, es un auténtico modelo del matriarcado. Las feministas deberían considerar siempre a Isis como una temprana figura de poder.

No es ofensivo, no es un insulto racial, pero se siente totalmente inhumano.

El nombre a menudo se liga a la antigua palabra egipcia de ""trono"" y en su descripción arqueológica en los templos se le ve con un tocado a manera de trono. Este vínculo ha sido interpretado por lo general como una representación del poder del faraón.

Su fuerte influencia femenina me enseñó, desde muy chiquita y en una sociedad dominada por líderes masculinos, que las mujeres pueden tener también el poder. Yo también podía ser fuerte, poderosa e influyente.

Pero esta poderosa y majestuosa figura femenina ha visto un cambio cultural; desde una superheroína (allá a mediados de los 70), a ser el anzuelo para ganar clics en las cadenas de noticias de 24 horas. ""¡Haz clic aquí!"", ""¡peligro, miedo!"", ""¡lee!"", ""¡en tu propio patio!"" Y esta transformación tan dramática se dio a la par de mi entrada a la maestría en Texas.

Empecé a estudiar un programa de maestría en una escuela con nombre de uno de los presidentes de EU y esperaba que mis compañeros supieran o por lo menos tuvieran una idea que mi nombre significa más que la palabra pegadiza que los medios arrojan y con la que enumeran las atrocidades de un grupo terrorista (ISIS es el acrónimo en inglés del grupo armado Estado Islámico).

La diosa Isis, pintada a un lado de un sarcófago en el Museo del Antiguo Egipto, en Luxor.

La primera vez que me di cuenta de este cambio fue en mi primera experiencia de una fiesta antes de un partido de fútbol americano del equipo de mi escuela. Con una cerveza en la mano, emocionada por participar en un festejo estadounidense, me dirigí a un nuevo compañero que, irónicamente, estudiaba relaciones internacionales, y me presenté:

""Hola, me llamo Isis. Estudio políticas públicas"".

""¿Cómo? ¿En serio? Seguro que tus papás se arrepienten por haberte puesto ese nombre"".

¿Qué se puede contestar?

Sin saber bien qué hacer, solté una risilla y dije: ""No. De hecho tiene muchos significados"". Luego me volteé, me alejé y traté de olvidarlo.

Eso fue en 2014. Desde entonces, cada vez que conozco a alguien nuevo, y con las noticias atiborradas de encabezados que mencionan las ""amenazas de ISIS sobre Europa"", o ""ISIS se vuelve global"", me llegan nuevas versiones de ""Qué mala suerte"", o ""Ay, qué mal"".

Aquí podría detallar cada uno de esos momentos, pero, a decir verdad, me tomaría dos años de mi vida y prefiero no volver a pasar por ello. Mejor me reduzco a contar las experiencias que más me han afectado.

Es difícil no solo sentirse diferente, sino ser como una diana, un blanco señalado, nada más.

Fue en un aeropuerto (así es como arrancan las buenas historias) y volaba a Nueva Orleans para visitar a una amiga. Me emocionaba tanto el viaje pero más me angustiaba perder el vuelo. Parada en la fila en el aeropuerto de Houston, lo único que pensaba era: cómo puedo hacer que avancen más rápido... Finalmente, llegué a la oficial de seguridad que revisaba las identificaciones y le sonreí, amable, le entregué mi licencia de conducir del estado de Texas y le dije: ""Hola, ¿cómo va todo?""

La agente me miró y me dijo: ""Mmm, la verdad, deberías cambiar tu nombre"". Lo primero que pensé fue: ""¿Es en serio? ¿Qué puedo responder?"" Luego pensé que una no puede ponerse a discutir con un agente de seguridad en el aeropuerto. Necesito abordar mi vuelo y no quiero que me elijan para una ""revisión al azar"", lo que de todos modos sería muy probable, otro síntoma del hecho de viajar siendo morenita. Así que sonreí y le dije ""Ah, ok"", recogí mi licencia y me alejé.

¿Puedes imaginar que una persona a la que no conoces que te diga que mejor deberías cambiar tu nombre? Se siente tan personal, ofensivo y, al mismo tiempo, es algo aceptable. No es ofensivo, no es un insulto racial, pero se siente totalmente inhumano.

Como inmigrante y como alguien que no tiene el perfil de un millenial estadounidense promedio, para mí está bien ser diferente. Pero, cuando esa etiqueta de la que nadie puede escapar, tu nombre, es una palabra que sueltan en los debates presidenciales, una palabra que fanáticos como Donald Trump, profieren para meter miedo, es difícil no solo sentirse diferente, sino ser como una diana, un blanco señalado, nada más.

En los debates presidenciales y a lo largo de este proceso electoral, la retórica de Trump ha consistido en incitar miedo con frases como ""el terror del Islam"", a lo cual él le da el mismo sentido que a ""ISIS"". Sin embargo, estos dos términos no tienen relación. El Daesh es una organización cuyos orígenes se encuentran en grupos que existieron en el régimen de Saddam Hussein, pero que como los conocemos ahora nacieron, en parte, por la invasión estadounidense a Irak en 2003. Este grupo, para nada representa al islam o a los musulmanes y tampoco me representa a mí o a los miles de bebés estadounidenses a los que llamaron Isis solo en la década pasada.

Y más que eso, basta con considerar el acrónimo del grupo: ISIS, que se supone era una traducción forzada del nombre árabe del grupo. Daesh (Al-Dawla Al-Islamiya fi Al-Iraq wa al-Sham o en español: Estado Islámico de Irak y el Levante). Pero en los recientes conflictos entre EU y organizaciones terroristas, la traducción del nombre no tiene precedentes. Nunca traducimos Al Qaeda, así que, ¿por qué traducir este? ¿Por qué crear este término y asociarlo con una palabra que ya tiene un significado positivo para mucha gente? ¿Para que gente como Donald Trump y los conductores de Fox News y CNN la profieran y capten la atención del público?

Digo Isis y, ¿en qué piensas? Terrorismo, muerte y casi todos los términos negativos que los medios encuentran en el diccionario.

Estos recursos retóricos, utilizados por personajes poderosos (solo hay que ver a los líderes del Comité Nacional Republicano) que escupen odio, de alguna manera se han vuelto aceptables para que el público los use y así se extienda de manera similar el odio. Y eso ha llegado a lugares y rincones que uno no esperaría, como cuando es necesario tramitar una nueva tarjeta del seguro social, comprar un trago en un bar, ante familiares y amigos, y la lista sigue y sigue. Ahora la sociedad escucha ciertas palabras o siglas y las relaciona con imágenes a menudo mal fundamentadas. Es la versión extrema del test clásico de asociación de ideas en el que te presentan imágenes y te piden que digas la primera palabra que pienses. Digo Isis y, ¿en qué piensas? Terrorismo, muerte y casi todos los términos negativos que los medios encuentran en el diccionario. Ya no soy una figura femenina de relieve. Me han reducido a una asociación de ideas. Una odiosa asociación.

Así que, Sr. Trump, déjeme decir que quizá usted sepa cómo se maneja un negocio (con excepción de las veces que ha tenido que declararse en bancarrota), y quizá sepa cómo crear una marca (Trump Steaks... ¿en serio?), pero yo, con una maestría en Servicio Público y Administración, musulmana y una mujer que comparte su nombre con el grupo que utiliza para sembrar el odio ante los electores, conozco más de políticas públicas y gobierno de lo que usted sabe o podría llegar a saber.

No quiero lástima, quiero cambio.

Quiero que la sociedad deje de tener esta práctivca de reiterar las mismas cosas las 24 horas en ciclos noticiosos para conseguir ratings y clicks. Necesitamos estar por encima de la desinformación infinita, las etiquetas equivocadas y los temores.

Quiero que dejen de decirme que mi nombre es ""desafortunado"" (Te estoy viendo Jimmy Kimmel) y que los baristas dejen de tener miedo al gritar mi nombre, o que inmediatamente asuman que es un juego, una broma. ""¡Hay una bomba, escóndanse!""

Mi nombre es Isis. Soy estadunidense, mujer y electora. No aceptaré tu odio o tu ignorancia.

¿Qué hay en nombre? Mi valor, no. Mi poder, sí.

Y en algo a mi favor, al menos cuando voy a Starbucks todos saben cómo pronunciar y decir mi nombre.

Eine Recherche der HuffPost US zeigt nun: Farrows Sender blockierte monatelang die Veröffentlichung seiner Erkenntnisse

Farrow sah deswegen keine andere Möglichkeit, als sein Material einer anderen Medienorganisation zu übermitteln

Die Enthüllung der sexuelle Übergriffe von Hollywood-Produzent Harvey Weinstein auf junge Frauen empört ganz Amerika. Vor knapp einer Woche berichtete erstmals die ""New York Times"" über die Taten des 65-Jährigen.

Dabei hätte die Story schon vor Monaten ans Licht kommen können.

Denn Mitte August gelang es Ronan Farrow, einem Reporter des US-Senders NBC News, eine Frau zu interviewen, die berichtete, von Weinstein vergewaltigt worden zu sein. Sie stimmte einem Interview vor laufender Kamera zu, dabei wurde ihre Identität allerdings nicht preisgegeben. Zu sehen war nur ihre Silhouette.

► Es war ein Schlüsselmoment in einem aufgeheizten, monatelangen Prozess der Berichterstattung zu einer Story, die eine ganze Generation von Hollywoodreportern und Medienangehörigen schockiert.

Doch eine Recherche der HuffPost belegt nun: Der Reporter Farrow wurde von NBC News abgehalten, seine Recherche zu senden. Der Sender versuchte aktiv, die Verbrechen von Harvey Weinstein zu vertuschen.

NBC verlangte von Farrow, die Arbeit an der Weinstein-Story einzustellen

Farrow hatte eine Menge Material gesammelt: Im März dieses Jahres gelangte er an eine brisante Tonbandaufnahme. Darin gab Weinstein zu, ein italienisches Model begrapscht zu haben.

Außerdem hatte der Reporter Interviews mit ehemaligen engen Mitarbeitern von Weinstein geführt, die zahlreiche sexuelle Übergriffe bestätigten.

Doch das reichte offenbar nicht. Dem Reporter waren durch einen NBC-News-Erlass die Hände gebunden: Ihm wurde mitgeteilt, dass es nicht genügend Beweise gebe, um seine Weinstein-Story zu senden, so berichten es vier Quellen der HuffPost.

Außerdem teilte ihm der Sender mit, dass der Reporter seine Arbeit an der Story einstellen solle. NBC versuchte, das Interview mit der Frau, die Harvey Weinstein der Vergewaltigung beschuldigte, zu verhindern.

Farrow wurde verboten, für das Interview auf Mitarbeiter und Equipment von NBC zurückzugreifen. Außerdem musste er seine Zugehörigkeit zu NBC verschweigen. Also bezahlte Farrow eine Filmcrew und Equipment aus eigener Tasche, um das Interview zu filmen.

► Als ein NBC News-Projekt war Farrows Story praktisch tot. Erst später erhielt er die Erlaubnis, die Story über eine andere Medienorganisation zu veröffentlichen.

NBC-Chef bestreitet Versuche der Vertuschung

Die Story, die schließlich dabei herauskam, wurde am Dienstag von dem US-Magazin ""New Yorker"" veröffentlicht.

Es war ein gigantischer Scoop. Gleich mehrere Frauen beschuldigten Weinstein darin der Vergewaltigung oder anderer sexueller Belästigungen. Dazu kam noch die Tonaufnahme von Weinstein selbst, auf der er sexuelle Belästigung zugab.



Eine Tonbandaufnahme, auf der Harvey Weinstein mit einem jungen Model in einem Hotelzimmer streitet, war auch Teil der Reportage von ""The New Yorker""

Am Mittwoch sagte NBC-Präsident Noah Oppenheim: ""Der Gedanke, dass wir versuchen würden, eine mächtige Person zu decken, verletzt uns alle zutiefst. Wir alle haben diese Geschichte gejagt, wollten die Fakten festnageln, aber letztendlich waren es nicht wir, die die Geschichte an die Öffentlichkeit gebracht haben.“

Dann schlug er einen reumütigen Ton an und erklärte, die Story sei bei NBC eines natürlichen Todes gestorben. ""Wir waren im Sommer an einem Punkt angelangt, an dem wir als Organisation das Gefühl hatten, dass wir nicht über all die Einzelteile verfügten, die für eine Veröffentlichung nötig gewesen wären.“

► Interviews mit 12 Personen, innerhalb und außerhalb von NBC, die Kenntnisse von den Hintergründen zu Farrows Story hatten, legen allerdings einen anderen Schluss nahe.

Hochrangige NBC-Mitarbeiter blockierten die Veröffentlichung von Farrows Enthüllungen

Alle Quellen, die mit der HuffPost gesprochen haben, baten darum, anonym zu bleiben: Weil sie nicht die Erlaubnis hatten, mit den Medien über die Geschichte zu sprechen, oder aber aus Angst vor NBC.

Diese Quellen berichteten ausführlich von einem monatelangen Kampf innerhalb von NBC News, bei dem Oppenheim und andere hochrangige NBC-Mitarbeiter Farrows Story durch Zweifel und Unschlüssigkeit blockierten.

Schließlich nahmen diese Zweifel und Bedenken auch einen persönlichen Ton an. Es war schwer zu sagen, wo die Versuche von Weinsteins Team, die Story zu diskreditieren, aufhörten und die Blockaden durch NBC News begannen.

Laut einer Vielzahl von Quellen, die an der abgebrochenen Story mitgearbeitet hatten, erklärte Oppenheim bezüglich Farrow, dass dieser sich in einem Interessenskonflikt befände.

Genau das hatten Weinsteins Anwälte in einer Beschwerde gegenüber NBC zur Sprache gebracht: Dass Farrow sich in einem Interessenskonflikt befände, da Weinstein Farrows Vater, zu dem dieser ein schlechtes Verhältnis habe, zu einem neuen Karrierehoch verholfen habe.

Farrows Geschichte wurde mehrmals überprüft

Sein Vater ist der Regisseur Woody Allen. Weinsteins Anwälte nutzten später abermals eine ähnliche Strategie, als die Story beim ""New Yorker"" landete.

Das Magazin, das für sein strenges Fact-Checking bekannt ist, konnte jedoch keinen Interessenkonflikt Farrows erkennen.

Farrow, der bereits im Januar mit der Arbeit an der Story begonnen und bis Juli mindestens acht Frauen interviewt hatte, wurde von unabhängiger Stelle zweimal bestätigt, dass die Story ""berichtenswert“ sei.

► Das heißt, dass die Story den harten Fakten-Check von NBC und auch die entsprechende juristische Prüfung bestanden hatte. Das berichten vier Personen, die über detaillierte Kenntnisse dieser Prozesse verfügen.

Außerdem wurde eine weitere Investigativjournalistin von NBC darum gebeten, Farrows Arbeit zu überprüfen. Ihre Überprüfung ergab keine Bedenken, so die vier Quellen.



Ronan Farrow wurde Berichten zufolge von NBC-Bossen gesagt, dass seine Weinstein-Story zu lückenhaft sei, um sie zu senden.

Farrow gelangte an brisantes Material über Weinstein

Farrow landete seinen ersten großen journalistischen Coup bereits im Januar. Ein Interview vor laufender Kamera mit der Schauspielerin Rose McGowan. Während des Interviews beschuldigte die Schauspielerin Harvey Weinstein der sexuellen Belästigung als sie 23 Jahre alt war.

Die ""Times"" berichtete, dass McGowan die Anschuldigungen gegen Weinstein gegen Zahlung von 100.000 Dollar im Jahr 1997 beigelegt hätte. Schließlich entzog McGowan NBC die Genehmigung, das Material zu senden, nachdem ihr von Weinstein mit rechtlichen Schritten gedroht worden war.

Im März erhielt Farrow dann eine Tonaufnahme, auf der Weinstein zugab, das italienische Model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez sexuell belästigt zu haben.

Einen Tag, nachdem Gutierrez der New Yorker Polizei von Weinsteins Übergriffen berichtet hatte, wurde das Tonband aufgenommen. Die New Yorker Polizei verkabelte Gutierrez und so konnte eine anschließende Unterhaltung zwischen Gutierrez und Weinstein im Tribeca Grand Hotel in New York aufgezeichnet werden.

Auf dem Band ist zu hören, wie Weinstein Gutierrez drängt, zu ihm ins Hotelzimmer zu kommen. Am Ende der angespannten Unterhaltung gibt er zu, Gutierrez sexuell belästigt zu haben.

Als Gutierrez Weinstein fragt, warum er am Tag zuvor ihre Brüste berührt habe, antwortet dieser:

""Oh bitte, es tut mir Leid, komm einfach rein.“ Und weiter: ""Ich bin das gewohnt. Jetzt mach schon. Bitte.“ Gutierrez fragt: ""Du bist das gewohnt?“ Und Weinsteins Antwort: ""Ja, ich mach’s nicht wieder.“

Die Veröffentlichung sollte andere ermutigen, an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen

Zwei Jahre lang haben Reporter verschiedener Medienunternehmen versucht, das brisante Tonband in die Hände zu bekommen. Für viele Medien wäre allein das schon eine Story wert.

Und selbst wenn NBC das Band als nicht sendenswert abgetan hätte, so hätte NBC die Story immer noch online veröffentlichen können.

Das ist ein Weg, den Farrow zusammen mit Rich McHugh, einem Investigativproduzenten von NBC, ebenfalls in Betracht gezogen hatte. Tatsächlich wollte Farrow sein Material nur irgendwie veröffentlichen, in der Hoffnung, dass dadurch auch andere Frauen ermutigt würden, an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen.

► Im April hatte NBC News zwei dicke Dinger in der Tasche: Ein Kamerainterview mit Rose McGowan und das explosive Tonband, auf dem Weinstein die sexuelle Belästigung eingestand.

Aber Farrow wurde von mehreren hochrangigen NBC-Produzenten mitgeteilt, dass sein Material und die Interviews für einen TV-Bericht nicht ausreichen würden.

Vier Quellen berichten, dass Farrow und McHugh außerdem einen ausführlichen Artikel vorbereitet hätten, der über die NBC-News-Website veröffentlicht werden sollte. Aber dazu sollte es nicht kommen.

Farrow sollte die Arbeit an der Story einstellen

Im Juli hatte Farrow schließlich seine hochexplosive Story über Weinstein zusammengestellt. Sie beinhaltete Videointerviews mit Personen, die Weinstein beschuldigten, sowie mit vier weiblichen und vier männlichen Ex-Mitarbeitern von Miramax und Weinsteins eigener Firma.

Zu diesem Zeitpunkt waren Farrow und McHugh bereit, ihre Story weiter voranzutreiben. Seitens NBC wurde ihnen jedoch gesagt, dass der NBC News-Vorsitzende Andy Lack erst sein OK für die Story geben müsse.

Außerdem müsse die Story noch einmal von Steve Burke überprüft werden, dem Vizepräsidenten von Comcast und Präsidenten und Vorstandsvorsitzenden von NBC Universal.

► Eine so eingehende Überprüfung ist ungewöhnlich. Das berichten drei NBC News-Mitarbeiter, die noch nie davon gehört hatten, dass Burkes Büro eine Story im Vorfeld überprüfen müsse.

Im August wurde Farrow mehrfach von NBC mitgeteilt, dass er seine Arbeit an der Story einstellen solle. So berichten es vier Insider. Das brachte Farrow in eine untragbare Position.

""Vorzeigestück für guten investigativen Journalismus""

Eine der Personen, die Farrow vor laufender Kamera interviewt hatte, war Ken Aluetta, ein erfahrener Journalist. Zu Beginn seiner Karriere hatte Aluetta ebenfalls versucht, eine Story über Weinsteins Taten zu bringen.

Laut zwei HuffPost-Informanten, die dieses Interview kennen, sowie eines Berichts in leicht anderer Form auf der Website ""Daily Beast"", sagte Aluetta, nachdem er Farrows Material gesehen hatte, sinngemäß: ""Wenn NBC die Beweise, über die Ronan verfügt, zurückhält, dann wirft das kein gutes Licht auf das Unternehmen und es ist ein riesiger Skandal.“

► Schließlich übergab Farrow sein Material ""The New Yorker"". Das Magazin brachte Farrows Scoop am Montag, nachdem die Story einer eingehenden Prüfung durch die Redakteure und Fakten-Checker unterzogen wurde.

""Als Ronan Farrow vor zwei Monaten an uns herantrat, hatte er schon sehr sorgfältige journalistische Arbeit geleistet“, sagt David Remnick, Chefredakteur des ""New Yorker"". ""Und mit unglaublich harter Arbeit und der Zusammenarbeit von all den Kollegen hier beim 'New Yorker', hat er dem Bericht noch mehr Fakten hinzugefügt, so dass er veröffentlicht werden konnte. Es ist ein Vorzeigestück für guten investigativen Journalismus.“

NBC hielt sich auch nach der Veröffentlichung zurück

NBC reagierte wortkarg auf ähnliche Berichte über Weinstein auf anderen Medienkanälen. Am vergangenen Donnerstag, als die ""New York Times"" zum ersten Mal über Weinsteins lange Historie angeblicher sexueller Übergriffe berichtete, brachten auch CBS und ABC die Geschichte in den Abendnachrichten.

Doch NBC hielt sich auffällig still zurück und überließ den Konkurrenten das Feld. Obwohl NBC sieben Stunden Zeit gehabt hätte, eine Story zusammenzustellen, fehlte das Thema Weinstein gänzlich in den NBC Nightly News (der Artikel in der ""New York Times"" war um 11 Uhr am Vormittag erschienen).

Einige NBC-Quellen berichten, dass der Sendeplan zum Bersten gefüllt war mit Eilmeldungen, zum Beispiel über die Amoktat von Las Vegas und die Tatsache, dass US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson Donald Trump als ""Idioten“ bezeichnet habe.

► Es gab aber trotzdem noch Platz für einen Bericht über die sexistischen Bemerkungen des Footballspielers Cam Newton gegenüber einer Reporterin und die Nominierten für die Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Zwei Quellen, die mit der Produktion vertraut sind, gaben gegenüber der HuffPost an, dass Oppenheim die finale Entscheidung getroffen habe, Weinstein nicht in das Programm aufzunehmen. Den Mitarbeitern gegenüber sagte er, dass Weinstein keine Person von nationaler Bekanntheit sei.

Als am Wochenende Lorne Michaels, der Produzent von ""Saturday Night Live“ dafür kritisiert wurde, dass er in der Sendung keine Weinstein-Witze aufgenommen habe, sagte er der ""Daily Mail"", dass das ""eine New York-Sache“ sei. Damit argumentierte er ähnlich wie Oppenheim.

NBC-Insider berichteten der HuffPost derweil, dass sich einige Mitarbeiter jetzt fragen, ob es sich dabei um eine interne NBC-Phrase handelt, die NBC-Bosse nutzen, um das Fehlen der Weinstein-Berichterstattung zu rechtfertigen.



NBC-Präsident Noah Oppenheim: “Der Gedanke, dass wir eine mächtige Person decken würden, verletzt uns alle zutiefst“

Verpasste Chance, eine große Story zu bringen

Am nächsten Morgen wurde NBC erneut von seinen Konkurrenten abgehängt. ""Good Morning America“ auf ABC brachte einen zehnminütigen Bericht über Weinstein und in ""This Morning“ auf CBS war ein fünfminütiger Bericht zu sehen.

Die ""Today“-Show auf NBC wartete lediglich mit Nachrichtensprecher Craig Melvin auf, der von einem Teleprompter einen Bericht dazu ablas, wie Weinstein die gegen ihn vorgebrachte Anschuldigungen, von denen in der ""Times"" zu lesen war, weit von sich wies.

Die Nachricht, dass NBC im Besitz des Tonbands war, auf dem Weinstein sexuelle Belästigung zugab, schockierte und frustrierte NBC-News-Mitarbeiter, die mit der HuffPost sprachen. Sie sagten, die Stimmung sei angesichts der verpassten Chance, diese große Story zu bringen, auf dem Tiefpunkt.

► Viele Personen, die mit der HuffPost sprachen, erinnerte diese Geschichte an ein anderes Mal, als NBC nicht die Chance ergriff, eine Story über einen Mann zu bringen, der sexuelle Belästigung eingestand.

Im Oktober 2016 war NBC News im Besitz des nun berühmt-berüchtigten ""Access Hollywood“-Tonbands von Donald Trump, auf dem er zugab, dass er Frauen gerne in den Schritt griff.

Zwar war das Material im Besitz von NBC, veröffentlicht wurde der Artikel jedoch von der ""Washington Post"".

Veltroni è sul palco del Teatro Eliseo, in questo decennale del Pd, disertato da mezzo partito, ulivisti, prodiani, minoranze varie: ""Vorrei – dice - che il nostro sguardo si alzasse, come se volasse, sulla polvere delle zuffe quotidiane, sopra i rivoli di odio e le bave di intolleranza, su frastuono delle urla e la miseria di passioni senza motivazioni"".

In prima fila parecchi ministri, dall'aria quasi smarrita di chi è in scadenza. E gli tocca andare a una cerimonia. Poletti che arriva tenendo la mano alla moglie, l'apprezzatissimo Minniti. Poco più in là Maria Elena Boschi, irresistibile per i fotografi, nei panni della donna-bandiera: scarpa di vernice rossa, pantalone bianco, camicetta di seta verde. Accanto Francesco Bonifazi, al solito sbottonato di tre bottoni, petto villoso di fuori.

Walter cita Prodi, quel governo ""il migliore della storia della Repubblica"" dove sedevano Ciampi e Napolitano, Andreatta, poi caduto a causa di ""massimalismo e divisioni"". Parla divinamente, a una platea abituata al circo quotidiano: parole profonde, colte, non schiacciate dal presente. A proposito: che applauso quando dice che la città delle Fosse Ardeatine non deve conoscere ""l'onta di una marcia celebrativa delle camice nere"". ""Aridatece Walter"" urla il militante, perché il suo discorso è una favola bella che rimuove frizioni, rotture, odi, rancori di questi anni. E in fondo è una favola bella proprio in quanto rimuove frizioni, rotture, odi e rancori di questi anni. Innominato Renzi, evocato Giorgio Napolitano come ministro dell'Interno di allora, non colui che tre giorni fa ha preso a picconate la forzatura della fiducia sulla legge elettorale, ringraziato Prodi di vent'anni fa, non quello di oggi.

Discorso alto, sui principi, sui valori, sulle radici, che delinea un Pd, il ""suo"", quello delle origini, quello che ha mobilitato di più alle primarie, con oltre 3 milioni di votanti e che prese, nel 2008, più di Renzi alle Europee. Anche se perse con Berlusconi, altra rimozione. Sia come sia un Pd, inclusivo, che parte da sinistra per allargare, non dal centro per rompere a sinistra, diverso dall'esistente ""ma anche"" utile qualora Renzi volesse ritrovare un senso smarrito: la vocazione maggioritaria che non è ""autosufficienza o splendido isolamento"", né partito della Nazione: ""Le alleanze – dice Veltroni – si fanno prima e le si fa giudicare dagli elettori. Alleanze che io spero che il Pd faccia"". L'altra speranza è non abbandonare la cultura dell'alternanza e cedere all'inciucio e ai rigurgiti proporzionalisti, i governi ""decisi dai partiti e non dagli elettori"".

L'empatia scatta, con una sala molto diversa dalla grande bellezza dei tempi che furono, quando a Roma il Pd, in queste occasioni coinvolgeva potere e popolo: boiardi di Stato, signore dei salotti, imprenditori, accanto al precario, al vecchio militante testaccino che appeni arrivi ti mostra le tessere del Pci. All'Eliseo manca mezzo Pd, in questo compleanno con poco pathos, a partire dalla minoranza di oggi, di Orlando e Cuperlo. Non si vedono neanche Orfini e altri pezzi importanti del gruppo dirigente. C'è Piero Fassino, Dario Franceschini, Marianna Madia, eleganza sobria, senza note appariscenti. Della vecchia guardia Franco Marini: ""È una festa, oggi è una festa"", dice all'uscita, rispondendo alla famosa domanda ""come ti è sembrato"".

Renzi dal palco ringrazia ""Walter"", cita quel Pd, quelle primarie, così, come un omaggio alla memoria. Quando qualcuno si prende la scena, il segretario non dà il meglio di sé. E lascia cadere l'invito alle alleanze, ma anche il vero passaggio politico del fondatore: ""Paolo e Matteo – aveva detto Veltroni - mi piacerebbe che questa legislatura si concludesse, fate quel che è necessario, con l'approvazione dello ius soli"". È il punto, perché non è una norma a costo zero, soprattutto se uno ha come strategia la rincorsa dei voti a destra. E le larghe intese dopo il voto, con un sistema elettorale che le rende inevitabile. In sala un vecchio compagno ricorda Mitterandt: ""Nell'81 gli portarono un sondaggio sulla pena di morte. La maggioranza dei francesi era favorevole e lui era in corsa per le presidenziali. Fece la campagna promettendo comunque l'abolizione, perché se una battaglia è giusta un leader la fa. Vinse e l'abolì. Sullo ius soli bisognerebbe fare così"".

Aleggia un fantasma, tra i militanti. Il fantasma di Massimo D'Alema: ""Ha fatto più male lui di tutti quanti, compreso Berlusconi"" dice un signore. Quello accanto: ""Purtroppo è così. L'avversario è lui"". E ""quelli che se ne sono andati"". Conoscendo Renzi, si trattiene sull'argomento. Dice un centesimo di quel che pensa: ""Chi va via dal Pd tradisce il popolo, non i leader"". Altro stile, Veltroni, nel suo finale, anche nella polemica: ""Come sapete, la mia vita è e resterà diversa dal passato. Ma ho cercato di dimostrare che si può smettere di avere ogni ruolo e ogni responsabilità senza per questo volere o fare male alle persone con le quali condividi cose importanti della vita"". E aggiunge: ""Diversa, ma non potrebbe essere, non è mai stata e non sarà, altrove"". Standing ovation. Di quelle che si tributano a una riserva della Repubblica o, comunque, a una riserva della sinistra. Finita la favola, si torna alla prosa di tutti i giorni.

Wieso gibt es in Österreich nicht die Ehe für Alle?","Mit nur einem Tweet gelingt es der österreichischen Journalistin und Moderatorin Lou Lorenz die Lage zwischen Deutschland und Österreich auf den Punkt zu bringen.

Am 1. Oktober 2017 schrieb sie: ""In Österreich tritt heute das Vermummungsverbot in Kraft. In Deutschland die Ehe für alle.""

Der Kontrast, der auf nur einen Blick den Unterschied zwischen den zwei deutschsprachigen Ländern zeigt, ist aber noch viel stärker.

Hauptsache, Burkas verbieten!

In Österreich nennt man das Kind ungern beim Namen. Deswegen gilt seit Tagen nicht etwa das jahrelang besprochene ""Burkaverbot"", sondern das ""Vermummungsverbot"". Man soll in der Öffentlichkeit sein Gesicht so zeigen, dass man erkennbar ist. Legitim und fair.

Aber in den Diskussionen dreht es sich immer um muslimischen Frauen, die einen Niqab tragen. Fälschlicherweise wird der Niqab immer mit der Burka verwechselt. Die Hauptsache ist, man will ihn verbieten.

Was ist der Unterschied? Beim Niqab sind nur die Augen sichtbar, bei der Burka nicht einmal diese, denn die Frau sieht darunter nur durch ein Gitter in die Außenwelt hinaus. Absurd? Für manche sicher.

In den letzten Jahren habe ich mit vielen unterschiedlichen Frauen Interviews geführt. Drei von ihnen waren Niqabis.

Eine österreichische Kroatin, die vor einigen Jahren zum Islam konvertiert ist, trug lange Zeit lediglich ein Kopftuch. Durch einen Unfall wurde ihr Gesicht jedoch total entstellt. Sie traute sich wochenlang nicht mehr aus der Wohnung, weil die Menschen auf den Straßen das taten, was sie am besten können: Sie starren.

Erst diese Erfahrung bewegte sie dazu, einen Niqab zu tragen. Die Leute starren immer noch, aber weitaus weniger. Jetzt ist das Vermummungsverbot in Kraft getreten und sie überlegt, nach Kroatien zu ziehen.

Ich lass mir von Männern in Anzügen nicht sagen, wie ich mich zu kleiden habe

Eine andere Bekannte von mir hat nicht lange gezögert: Sie ist sofort nach Serbien gezogen. Ihre letzten Worten waren: ""Ich lasse mir doch von Männern in Anzügen nicht vorschreiben, wie ich mich zu kleiden habe! Ich bin weg.""

Kleidung hin oder her - als Journalistin interessiert mich eine ganz andere Frage: Welches gesellschaftliche Problem ist durch das Gesetz gelöst?

In Österreich gibt es schätzungsweise 150 Niqabis. Angenommen diese werden jetzt alle den ihren Schleier ablegen, was dann? Was wird sich ändern? Sie werden wohl kaum alle erblonden. Aus Fatima wird nicht einfach Stefanie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Frau in Berlin beleidigt eine Muslima und versucht, ihr das Kopftuch herunterzureißen

Die ganze Aktion ist reiner Populismus auf dem Rücken muslimischer Frauen. Doch was denken sich die politischen Akteure dabei? Etwa, ""mit denen können wir es machen, die sind Unterdrückung und Bevormundung von Haus aus gewöhnt?""

Doch nicht nur muslimische Frauen leiden unter der Absurdität des Gesetzes. Laut dem Journalisten Florian Klenk sind sogar Clowns angezeigt worden.

Außerdem mussten Musiker ihre Masken während eines öffentlichen Auftritts abnehmen. Ein Augenzeuge berichtete in einem Post von U-Bahn-Fahrgästen, die fremde Frauen dazu zwangen, ihre Verschleierung abzunehmen.

Frauen werden verbal angefeindet und körperlich attackiert

In der Zeitung las ich einen Bericht über ein Werbemaskottchen, dass von der Polizei dazu gezwungen wurde, den Kopf seines Kostüms abzunehmen. Der junge Mann war als Hai verkleidet und machte Werbung für das Unternehmen McShark.

Doch was ist mit den verschleierten und ach so unterdrückten Frauen? In Österreich werden sie jetzt auf den Straßen verbal angefeindet und sogar körperlich attackiert - meistens in der Anwesenheit ihrer Kinder.

Wo ist die Logik, wenn durch das Gesetz Frauen auf der Straße in die Enge getrieben werden, um ihnen ins Gesicht zu boxen, oder, ihnen buchstäblich die Kleidung vom Leib zu reißen?

Doch wie reagieren Musliminnen eigentlich auf den Versuch den Islam Stück für Stück aus der Öffentlichkeit zu beseitigen?

Die Künstlerin Asma Aiad hat ein Fotoprojekt mit dem Namen ""Ceci n´est pas une Burqa"" in die Welt gesetzt, um zu veranschaulichen, wie ziellos das Gesetz eigentlich ist.

Das Projekt erlangte durch seinen Humor viel mediale Aufmerksamkeit und verbreitete sich schnell im Internet. Auch der Berliner Youtube-Kanal ""Die Datteltäter"" griff das Thema auf. Die Kernthese: ""Solange du einen Besen in der Hand hast, stört sich keiner an deinem Kopftuch.""

In einer Zeit, in der saudi-arabische Frauen endlich Autofahren dürfen ihnen für uns selbstverständliche Freiheiten bietet, verbieten wir Menschen, sich so zu kleiden, wie sie es möchten.

Im Deckmantel der Freiheit müssen sich muslimische Frauen anhören, dass alles was sie tragen, eine Zwangsjacke ist.

""Wir haben damals unsere BHs verbrannt"", teilte mir vor kurzem eine Frau mit. ""Aber Sie tragen doch im Moment einen"", war meine Antwort. Natürlich verbrennen wir symbolisch so einiges, aber nur, um diesen Symbole wieder neu definieren zu können.

Aus dem Auge heißt nicht aus dem Sinn

Nur, weil der Niqab nun aus den Augen ist, ist er noch lange nicht aus dem Sinn. Denn wenn man Unterdrückung bekämpfen möchte, dann sollte man dort anfangen, wo die Idee dieser sitzt: In den Köpfen der Menschen.

Niemand entscheidet darüber, was ein Mensch trägt, wie frei oder unterdrückt er ist.

Angela Merkel wird immer mit Männern verglichen, weil sie auf Make-Up verzichtet und in den Augen der Medien ""einen männlichen Auftritt"" hinlegt. Melania Trump wird als ""Puppe"" bezeichnet, weil sie Model war und für die Medien ""schön weiblich"" ist.

Marylin Monroe war eine eine intelligente Frau und begnadete Schauspielerin, die so lange als Sexsymbol missbraucht wurde, bis sie starb. Nicht viel anders erging es auch Romy Schneider.

Meine Frage darauf konnte sie nicht beantworten: ""Wieso? Würden Sie mit den Frauen sprechen, wenn Sie deren Gesicht sehen würden?"" Wahrscheinlich nicht.

Wie viele Niqab-Trägerinnen steckten hinter Terroranschlägen? Wie viele sind in den letzten Jahren kriminell auffällig geworden?

Und wenn es uns wirklich um die Freiheit der Frauen geht:

Wieso zahlen wir ihnen dann nicht faire Gehälter?

The Values Voter Summit started in 2006 as a gathering for people who want ""to preserve the bedrock values of traditional marriage, religious liberty, sanctity of life and limited government.""

During his remarks at the event in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Trump touted his administrations ""religious freedom"" guidance, arguing that ""no religious group is ever targeted under my administration."" But Trump's actions in the White House so far contradict that statement.

Since January, Trump's administration has been fighting for a travel ban that would keep people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.

A report released in September showed hate crimes have climbed along with Trump's rise in prominence. Trump infamously failed to explicitly condemn white supremacists after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to the death of one anti-racist protester and a number of violent clashes. (Trump argued there were ""some very fine people on both sides"" of that protest.)

But Trump was much quicker to condemn black athletes and their allies who have chosen to kneel when the national anthem plays before games to raise awareness about the oppression of black people in America. He referenced the protests on Friday when he claimed that ""we respect our great American flag,"" prompting a standing ovation from the Values Voter audience.

Trump also spoke about the Las Vegas shooting, as well as hurricanes that recently hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.

The president has been criticised for his response to the devastation in Puerto Rico, much of which has been without power in the weeks since Hurricane Maria wreaked havoc on the island. On Thursday, Trump tweeted, ""We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders... in P.R. forever!""

He seemed to walk back that comment Friday.

""It's not even a question of a choice, we don't even want a choice. We're going to be there as Americans,"" Trump said.

The fact that a staggering number of Indian sportspersons around the country struggle to make ends meet and have a dignified life is common knowledge. Many of them, die in pitiful conditions, their legacy either ignored or forgotten.

One such sporting hero is Rajvir Singh, a double gold-medallist in cycling at the 2015 Los Angeles Special Olympics. In 2015, at the age of 15, Rajvir, son of a daily wage labourer from Ludhiana, Punjab, made the country proud with a double win — in 1km and 2km cycling races — at the Special Olympics World Games. He achieved this feat with only one month of training before the event, after a local businessman donated a professional cycle to him. Rajvir suffers from disability, with below-average intellectual and adaptive functioning.

Two years after his win, the family is yet to receive a bulk of the cash prize promised to Rajvir after his win, reported The Indian Express. The Punjab government had announced Rs 15 lakh for each of the gold medals he won, while the Central government promised the Singh family Rs 10 lakh.

""We received Rs 10 lakh from the Central government. But we never received Rs 30 lakh cash prize from the state government,"" Balbir Singh, Rajvir's father told The Indian Express.

Additionally, Parkash Singh Badal, the former chief minister of Punjab from the Shiromani Akali Dal, had announced a prize of Rs 1 lakh, of which the family has only received Rs 50,000, after a lot of effort. ""Some officials even demanded bribe for releasing [the] Rs 50,000 cheque,"" claims Singh.

With the state government reneging on its promise, the Singh family was left with no option but to seek alternate employment for their gold medallist son. Initially, Rajvir joined his father as a labourer, picking stones and bricks for money. Together, the duo earned Rs 400 a day, just enough to feed the family.

But due to Rajvir's vulnerable mental condition, his father has now placed him in Manukhta Di Sewa, a shelter for disabled and homeless elderly people. There, Rajvir pushes the wheelchairs of the disabled, gives them food, water, helps them bathe, and performs other odd jobs. He earns about Rs 5,000 a month as salary at the shelter.

Paramjit Sachdeva, the area director of the Punjab chapter of Special Olympics said no money could be paid to winners right now because the draft policy for Special Children Olympics medal winners is yet to be notified. Even though the policy was cleared by Sukhbir Singh Badal, the former deputy CM of Punjab, it is lying with the state's sports department, awaiting notification.

Abject poverty has forced the Singhs to stop Rajvir's training, since the family has barely any money for food. And so, cycling, which was once considered an escape that would help their disabled son live a self-reliant life, is now only a distant memory for them.

The list of sportspersons ignored by the Central and state governments, the sports ministry, their sports' federations and politicians who announce hefty cash rewards in the immediate aftermath of their achievements covers the length and breadth of the country and the entire gamut of sports played in India.

Shankar Laxman, India's star hockey goalkeeper who represented India in three successive Olympics and captained the team that won gold at the Asian Games in 1966 died in 2006 while suffering from gangrene and with no money for treatment. Despite his 13-year-long illustrious sports career, he received Rs 25,000 for treatment from the state government.

KD Jadhav, the man who won India its first individual Olympic medal in 1952 for wrestling, lived and died in obscurity. In July this year, his son threatened to auction off the medal Jadhav won to shame the Maharashtra government into building the wrestling academy it had promised to establish in Jadhav's name but had failed to do so.

Here are some tried and tested things you can do to help you deal with the monster.
Identify Your TriggersMost episodes of extreme stress, anxiety, and deep depression are set off by a trigger.
According to NCBI, ""Exercise improves mental health by reducing anxiety, depression, and negative mood and by improving self-esteem and cognitive function.""","ADVERTISEMENT

It happens so quietly that you cannot prepare for it, and before you know, you are enveloped in its grip so tight that escape seems impossible. So what does one do? Does one sit in a corner with the head bowed, eyes shut, and arms tightly wrapped, waiting for it to leave, or does one stand up and fight?

Battling with anxiety, stress, and depression can be hard, but it is not impossible. With a little care, awareness, and self-love, you can manage, if not overcome, the constant feeling of despair. How do I know? Well, I do it every day.

Stress, anxiety and depression are the three demons of modern times trapping more and more people in their clutches every passing day. National Institute of Mental Health describes depression as ""a common but serious mood disorder that causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working"". According to a WHO report, almost 36% of people in India suffer from some form of depression, most of them young and at the peak of their lives.

Here are some tried and tested things you can do to help you deal with the monster.

1. Accept

Acceptance is the beginning of healing. You can, of course, wallow in self-pity, or you can take it in your stride and move ahead. Mental disturbances are quite similar to physical disorders. They are often caused by chemical imbalance in the brain or external triggers just like physical disorders, and just like any physical disorder, they can happen to any of us--some are affected more than the others, and some deal with them better than others. Accepting it makes a whole lot of difference. So breathe deep, smile wide, and embrace yourself wholeheartedly.

2. Share

Having someone who understands makes a lot of difference. If you are not comfortable sharing your feelings with immediate family, spouse, or even close friends, reach out to a support group. There are numerous mental well-being communities worldwide that extend help and support. Look them up online, connect with them on social media, or be an active physical member, the choice is yours. Knowing you are not alone always makes you feel better and more confident.

3. Identify Your Triggers

Most episodes of extreme stress, anxiety, and deep depression are set off by a trigger. The trigger could be an intangible feeling or fear, or a more concrete situation. Is it fatigue or feeling out of control that does it for you? Or is it coming face to face with an unpleasant situation or person that sets you off? Recognizing what triggers the discomfort and despair helps not only dealing with them better but also preventing the feeling to a large extent.

It feels good when people understand you. Or at least try to. When they trust you and believe you. When instead of doling out advice, they listen. Sometimes all you need is someone to talk to without the fear of judgment.

4. Pursue A Hobby

Doing what you love doing is a great and easy way to feel good. Investing time in yourself is proven to make you feel more positive and happier. Recall a long forgotten passion and revive it. Music, arts, dancing, gardening, philately, travel, writing, poetry, pottery--any of these activities will help you heal and feel positive. Join online and offline communities and connect with people who share your love. Creating something new, even as an amateur, gives you a feeling of accomplishment which goes a long way in ensuring metal well being.

5. Walk. Run. Work-out.

Picking yourself up and stepping out for a run is the last thing you'd want to do on a bad day, but trust me, once you have overcome that hurdle, rest will be much easier. Studies have shown that physical activity helps the body produce endorphins, hormones that promote the feeling of happiness and euphoria. According to NCBI, ""Exercise improves mental health by reducing anxiety, depression, and negative mood and by improving self-esteem and cognitive function."" If running or working out seems impossible, just step out for a walk in the park--looking at the green grass and blue sky will do you more good that you can imagine.

6. Love Yourself. Unconditionally.

We live in times where loving ourselves is not the simplest thing to do. The perfection portrayed in the media, films, and social media makes it even more difficult to appreciate our imperfections and flaws. The trick is to understand that what is portrayed is not always complete and that perfection may not always be possible.

Temperatures as high as 25c are predicted to hit isolated parts of east and south east England on Monday, while western and northern parts and Northern Ireland are subject to alerts over strong wind.

The average October temperature is a mild 15c, meaning Monday’s predicted highs would be unusual.

Met Office chief forecaster Steve Ramsdale said: “Understandably, there is a lot of public concern about the potential impacts of ex-Ophilia.

“In readiness, we have already issued Yellow wind warnings for Northern Ireland and parts of western and northern Britain for Monday and Tuesday, suggesting wind gusts possibly reaching up to 80mph in places.

“Although parts of the UK may experience severe conditions, it’s important to realise that not all areas will be affected by this ex-hurricane.

“For example, much of eastern England will be unusually warm for the time of year but quite breezy on Monday and Tuesday.”

Hurricane Ophelia will reduce to a storm by the time it makes landfall later on Monday and will strike three decades after the Great Storm of 1987.

Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Friday said ex-president Pranab Mukherjee had every reason for grievance at being ignored for prime ministership despite being more qualified but knew ""I had no choice"" in the matter, and that smoothened their relationship.

Singh's comments at the launch of Mukherjee's book--'The coalition years--in the presence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her deputy Rahul Gandhi left the audience in splits.

""In 2004 when Soniaji chose me to become the prime minister, Pranabji was one of the most distinguished colleagues that I had.

""He had every reason to feel a grievance that he was better qualified than I was to become the prime minister, but he also knew that I have no choice in the matter,"" the former prime minister said as the audience, including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul, burst into guffaw.

Mukherjee wrote in his book that after the 2004 election victory there was intense speculation in the party about who would be the prime minister, but the consensus within the Congress was that the incumbent should be a political leader with experience in party affairs and administration.

""The prevalent expectation was that I would be the next choice for prime minister after Sonia Gandhi declined. This expectation was possibly based on the fact that I had extensive experience in government,"" he wrote.

Mukherjee also said that when he declined to join the government headed by Manmohan Singh, Sonia insisted on his being a part of it as he would be ""vital to its functioning and also be of support of Singh"".

Mukherjee, in his speech at the book release function, decribed the Congress as a coalition in itself, as it brings all ideas on one platform.

""It was difficult to have one coalition within and another outside. But that was done,"" he said.

Mukherjee said in the book he has described the coalition years and tried not to bring in any personal matters. He said running the coalition government seemed difficult but everything worked out smoothly.

Mukherjee said in writing the book about the coalition years of 1996 to 2012, he did not claim the objectivity of a historian, which he is not, but put down things while viewing them as a political activist.

Singh said with their relation smoothened, they ran the government as a cohesive team. He said history would record Mukherjee's great contribution to the management of Indian polity.

The former prime minister described Mukherjee as the ""most distinguished living parliamentarian and Congressman"", whom everyone in the party looked up to for discussing and resolving ticklish and difficult issues.

""He is a politician by choice. He is the greatest politician living in the country. I became a politician by accident when P V Narasimha Rao asked me to become the finance minister,"" he said.

Singh described Mukherjee and NCP chief Sharad Pawar as respected senior members of his government both of whom were of great calibre. He said if the UPA government ran smoothly, a large measure of credit would go to Pranab Mukherjee.

While Sonia Gandhi and Rahul did not speak nor sit on the dais, a number of leaders including CPI-M general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI Secretary Sudhakar Reddy, SP leader Akhilesh Yadav and DMK leader Kanimozhi spoke.

Akhilesh Yadav, in his brief speech, said Mukherjee's book would come in handy for young politicians like him when elections are due just like good notes ahead of exams.

He also said people look forward to another coalition as elections draw closer. Akhilesh, who was recently re- elected the SP president, said people earlier dealt with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav but would now deal with him.

Yechury said Pranab Mukherjee has an ""elephant-like memory"", remark that prompted Sonia Gandhi to quip he had the memory of ""two elephants"".

Überall, selbst in entlegenen Bergdörfern, lächelt einem alle paar hundert Meter Sebastian Kurz (31) entgegen. Er ist bei den anstehenden Nationalratswahlen nicht nur das Gesicht seiner Partei ÖVP, er ist schlechthin das Gesicht Österreichs. Das Gesicht der Zukunft, glauben seine zahlreichen Anhänger, so einer täte auch Deutschland gut. Mehr geht eigentlich nicht.

Es ist kein Männergesicht, das von den Wahlplakaten lächelt. Seine Züge sind weich, fast kindlich. Das Kantige fehlt völlig, die Wangen glänzen stets rosig, auch in natura. Man mag sich gar nicht ausmalen, wie dieses Gesicht in 30, 40 Jahre aussehen könnte: Vielleicht - und davor möge ihn der Himmel oder sonst wer bewahren - wie ""Mörtel"", das zweitbekannteste Gesicht Österreichs: Richard Lugner, der seit 85 Jahren lächelt, dessen Wangen seit 85 Jahren rosig glänzen?

Hier bekommen Sie ""Das Politikbuch: Wichtige Theorien einfach erklärt""

Sebastian Kurz könnte dem ersten (täuschenden) Eindruck nach 20 sein. Er ist aber schon 31. Nun schickt er sich an, der jüngste Bundeskanzler in der Geschichte Österreichs, ach was: in der Geschichte Europas, zu werden.

Höchst auffällig

Bei allen Weichzeichnungen - Sebastian Kurz ""ist eine höchst auffällige Figur"", sagt der österreichische Karikaturist Gerhard Haderer, dessen bissige Bildgeschichten über 20 Jahre lang im ""Stern"" erschienen sind. Kurz sei ""ein sehr talentierter Redner, eine telegene Lichtgestalt. Er wird im Augenblick gefeiert wie ein Messias... Klugheit würde ich ihm unterstellen, Authentizität nicht. Das fehlt mir. Er ist eine Kunstfigur.""

Ist er wirklich ""so neu, so frisch, so aalglatt"", wie ihn bezeichnenderweise und seltsam sanft die kommunistische ""UZ"", das Organ der DKP bezeichnete? Nach einem der unzähligen TV-Duelle, die nur eines schlüssig bewiesen haben, dass nämlich der sprichwörtliche österreichische Charme auch in abstoßenden Schlammschlachten eine scharfe Waffe sein kann, urteilte die ""Welt"": ""Kurz scheint mit seinen 31 Jahren ohnehin nie etwas anderes als ,staatsmännisch' gewesen zu sein. Man kann ihn sich sogar vorstellen, wie er bereits in der Sandkiste mit vor der Brust verschränkten Armen dastand. Wo wenig Inhalt ist, da muss der Körper analysiert werden. Also sprach ein ,Experte': Sieger nach Punkten: Sebastian Kurz, weil er auch mal mit der Handkante vor dem Moderator auf den Tisch haute.""

""Feschak"" sagt man in Österreich zu attraktiven Typen wie ihm. Seit über einem Jahr führt er mit diesem Image die Rankings der beliebtesten Politiker an. Und im amerikanischen Nachrichtenmagazin ""Time"" wurde Kurz 2017 zu einem von zehn ""Next Generation Leaders"" gekürt. Ein Ausnahme-Talent im drögen, verlogenen Politikbetrieb, der den meisten jungen Leuten so überdrüssig ist?

Das Wunderkind

""Die äußere Geschichte des Aufstiegs von Sebastian Kurz ist leicht zu erzählen"", schreibt das Politmagazin ""Cicero"": ""Ein sehr junger Mann beschließt, Berufspolitiker zu werden. Er überlebt mühelos das innerparteiliche Geklüngel, wird mit 24 Jahren Abgeordneter, mit 25 Staatssekretär, mit 27 jüngster Außenminister der österreichischen Geschichte - ein politisches Wunderkind also. Mit sicherem Instinkt wählt er die brennendsten Gegenwartsfragen zu seiner Agenda: Migration, Integrationsprobleme, Kampf der Kulturen, Flüchtlingskrise.""

Manchmal wirkt Sebastian Kurz wie aus der Zeit gefallen: Chic, jung, dynamisch - die Attribute der Popper, einer Jugendkultur aus den 80ern, die er mühelos verkörpert. Wer ihn zum ersten Mal sieht, assoziiert einen plakativen Hedonismus mit Kaschmir-Pulli, Lacoste-Hemd und Porsche-Cabrio, rein äußerliche Merkmale eines jugendlichen Wertkonservativismus.

Doch diesem Bild und dem damit verbundenen Image des Schnösels aus reichem Elternhaus mit exklusiver Bildung entspricht Kurz' Vita mitnichten. Er stammt aus dem 12. Wiener Gemeindebezirk Meidling, einem Arbeiterviertel. Sein Vater ist Ingenieur, die Mutter Lehrerin. Seine aktuelle Wohnung befindet sich ebenfalls in Meidling, verkehrsgünstig zwischen zwei U-Bahn-Stationen, der berühmte Schlosspark von Schönbrunn ist nicht weit.

Er war früh interessiert

Als Schüler ist er nur aufgefallen, als die Gymnasiasten im Wahlfach Wirtschaftskunde eine Firma gründeten. Unter dem Namen ""Kids and the City"" betreuten sie Grundschulkinder gegen Honorar. Sebastian Kurz war Geschäftsführer und Marketingleiter.

Die Politik hat ihn früh interessiert, man darf vermuten, dass es weniger die Inhalte waren, sondern eher die Karrieremöglichkeiten, die sich einem gewitzten und charmanten jungen Mann wie ihm boten.

Heute beweist er seine umjubelten Fähigkeiten als politischer Entertainer, wenn er die Geschichte erzählt, wie er als 16-Jähriger in die ÖVP eintreten wollte: ""Als ich die Junge Volkspartei in Meidling angerufen habe, sagte mir jemand, ich sei zu jung. Das macht nichts, habe ich gesagt, mein Problem wird mit jedem Tag kleiner. Sie seien auch sehr wenige, hieß es dann. Macht nichts, habe ich geantwortet, ich bringe meine Freunde mit. Aber sie treffen sich eigentlich nie, weil es sich nicht auszahlt, hieß es. Dann habe ich es sein lassen und mich wieder auf Schule, Partys und Tennis konzentriert.""

Er hat natürlich nicht klein beigegeben. Nach dem Abitur und dem Beginn des Jurastudiums (abgebrochen) stand die Politik bei ihm an erster Stelle. Dabei ließ und lässt der ""Freund der Klarheit"", so die Selbstbeschreibung auf seiner Facebook-Seite (mehr als 700.000 Abonnenten), auch gern seine Fantasie schweifen.

""Schwarz macht geil""

Denkwürdig ist seine Kampagne als Chef der Jungen ÖVP im Wiener Kommunalwahlkampf 2010. In Anlehnung an die Parteifarbe Schwarz kreierte Kurz den Slogan ""Schwarz macht geil"". Er bretterte mit einem schwarzen ""Geil-o-Mobil"" vom Typ Hummer durch die Hauptstadt. Auf der Kühlerhaube des Luxusgeländewagens rekelten sich ein paar leicht bekleidete junge Frauen in Hot Pants, die ""Geilmacherinnen"", zur Kurz-Botschaft: ""Schwarz macht geile Politik. Schwarz macht geile Partys. Schwarz macht Wien geil.""

Ein weiterer Teil der Kurz-Kampagne war die Forderung nach einem durchgängigen Betrieb der Wiener U-Bahn in Wien. Auf Bildern war ein junges Paar zu sehen - mit dem Slogan: ""Wenn wir unseren Verkehr so planen, kommen wir nie in Fahrt."" Bei der Gelegenheit verriet Kurz auch, dass er im Alter von 15 Jahren erstmals Sex hatte.

Der Außenminister Sebastian Kurz gilt als nachtragend, Fehler verzeihe er nicht, heißt es. Ständig schaut er auf sein Smartphone, wischt und schaut wieder. Die typische Gestik seiner Generation, den ""Digital Natives"". Doch seine Reflexe als Politiker unterscheiden sich kaum von denen anderer Berufskollegen.

Er habe kein Interesse an ""medialer Präsenz"", wenn es ihm nicht in den Kram passt. Und sein Privatleben sollte - bittschön! - ""nicht medien-öffentlich sein"", falls es mal nicht von ihm gesteuert wird. Immerhin wurde bekannt (oder ließ er streuen), dass er 17.372,50 Euro im Monat verdient plus Sonderbezüge jedes Quartal, was einem 13. und 14. Monatsgehalt entspricht. Er esse leidenschaftlich gern Eiernockerl und gehe trotz seines Stressjobs fast täglich trainieren. Seine Körpergrößte betrage 1,86 Meter, die Jahresurlaube verbringe er meistens in Südtirol beziehungsweise am Gardasee.

Sie erdet ihn

Da fährt dann seine Freundin mit, mit der er auch die Wohnung im 12. Bezirk teilt. Die zierliche blonde Wirtschaftspädagogin Susanne Thier ist als Kommissärin im Finanzministerium tätig. Er ist mit ihr schon im 13. Jahr zusammen, mit 18 hat er sich in sie verliebt. Susanne erde ihn und sei neben seinen Eltern seine wichtigste Beraterin, verriet er dem Radiosender Ö3. Er mache ihr ""regelmäßig Liebeserklärungen.""

Auch über die Familienplanung habe man sich schon Gedanken gemacht. Dann sagt der Mann, der mit 31 Bundeskanzler werden und ein ganzes Land führen will, allen Ernstes, dass er sich eigentlich noch zu jung für Nachwuchs halte.

Diese derart unwiderstehliche Lichtgestalt hat den Satiriker Gerhard Haderer zu einer hübschen Zeichnung inspiriert. Man sieht Kurz als Messias, im Hintergrund lauern ÖVP-Politiker der alten Garde. Sie fordern ihn auf: ""Jetzt zeig mal, was du kannst. Erst gehst du übers Wasser, und dann darfst du noch ein paar Liter Wasser in Wein verwandeln, wir wollen ja auch Spaß haben.""","Sebastian Kurz: Messias, Kanzlerkandidat und Kunstfigur",http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/14/sebastian-kurz-messias-kanzlerkandidat-und-kunstfigur_n_18266820.html

One off-duty officer was charged this week with impaired driving causing death and failing to stop at the scene of an accident after a fatal hit-and-run that killed pedestrian Cody Severight, 23.

""We see people that get killed in car accidents and with impaired driving.","Winnipeg's police chief says off-duty officers have the same right as anyone else to socialize after work, sometimes with alcohol.

But Chief Danny Smyth says like anyone else, if an officer has too much to drink and gets behind the wheel of a car, he or she has crossed a line.

Smyth faced questions at a news conference Friday about whether there is a culture among police officers of going for an after-drink work.

One off-duty officer was charged this week with impaired driving causing death and failing to stop at the scene of an accident after a fatal hit-and-run that killed pedestrian Cody Severight, 23.

Smyth said the investigation being carried out by Manitoba's Independent Investigations Unit could result in further charges against Const. Justin Holz, 34, and also said there will be an internal review that won't be made public.

I would hope that the IIU will investigate it fully and they'll be transparent. Robert Taman

Severight's aunt, Nancy Gabriel, has expressed concern that the person responsible for her nephew's death ""doesn't get away with it,"" adding her family just wants justice.

Smyth noted he does not have to wait for the criminal case to be resolved.

""If I consider their conduct to be so egregious that they can't continue as a police member, my recommendation would be to dismiss,"" Smyth said.

Robert Taman helped establish the IIU while serving on the Manitoba Police Commission after his wife was killed in a collision with an off-duty officer who had been at a party a short time before. He said he knows the heartbreak of the Severight family all too well.

""I would hope that the IIU will investigate it fully and they'll be transparent,"" Taman told CTV Winnipeg. ""And that the family will be satisfied in the end with the investigation.""

Taman has long called for tougher penalties for drunk drivers and spoken out against the behaviour of police who drink and then get in their vehicles.

Our officers are part of the community too; we're not immune from those problems. Danny Smyth, Winnipeg Police Chief

However, Smyth said he sees impaired driving as more of ""a problem in our society in general.""

""We see people that get killed in car accidents and with impaired driving. Our officers are part of the community too; we're not immune from those problems.""

Smyth said when it comes to dealing internally with problem drinking among officers, discipline wouldn't be his first approach.

""Like anything in our society, when we become aware that somebody might be struggling with a problem, my first instinct is to try to help them,"" he said, adding that officers have access to resources for help.

""If they get involved in conduct that involves criminal conduct, that really limits what I can do.""

The allegations against Holz have not been proven in court. He was released on a promise to appear, and will make his first court appearance on Nov. 22.

He was also placed on administrative leave with pay.

EPARA Skincare

Epara Skincare is a luxury skincare line created to “cater to the unique yet underserved needs of women of colour.”

With a brand name that literally translates as ‘to cocoon oneself,’ it’s no wonder this skincare line (founded by Nigerian businesswoman Ozohu Adoh) was snapped up by Harrods within its first year of launching.

Nails & Brows Mayfair

Founded by Sherrille Riley, Nails and Brows has quickly become the go-to boutique for gorgeous, full but natural-looking eyebrows. The manis, too, are particularly chic.

Expanding the business from brick and mortar to digital, Riley launched a line of brow solutions including brow brushes and pencils.

""Man kommt einfach bei der vielen Arbeit nicht dazu"", mögen Führungskräfte nun entgegnen. Dabei fragt man sich, was man dagegen tun könnte und eine Vielzahl an Strategien wie Team-Meetings, Rederunden und feste Zeiten sind möglich, doch eine der besten Lösungen ist die Weihnachtsfeier - eine gut geplante Feier! Auf einer solchen Feier begegnen sich beide Gruppen auf Augenhöhe und haben die Chance, sich ganz neu kennenzulernen.

Eine Weihnachtsfeier ist langweilig, aber Pflicht!

Kaum etwas ist so langweilig wie die alljährlich wiederkehrende Weihnachtsfeier der Firma. Warum? Weil es in jedem Jahr das Gleiche ist: Das gleiche Buffet, dieselbe langweilige Stimmung und dasselbe Gefühl, es nicht abwarten zu können, nach Hause zu kommen. Wenn man es sich aussuchen könnte, dann würde man Zuhause bleiben, doch die Pflicht ruft und so erscheint man Abends und hofft, es möge schnell vorbei sein.

Doch in allem Negativen steckt auch etwas Positives. So kann die Überzeugung der meisten Mitarbeiter über die Weihnachtsfeier dazu genutzt werden, um sich bei der Planung besondere Mühe zu geben. Dazu gehört auch, dass die Weihnachtsfeier als ein wichtiges Event wahrgenommen wird, dass die Beziehung und die Kommunikation zwischen der Führungsebene und den Mitarbeitern verbessern kann. Denn in den meisten Unternehmen herrscht gerade zwischen Führung und Nicht-Führung Funkstille. Daher kann eine solche Feier besonders deren Kommunikation fördern und somit das Unternehmen an sich bereichern.

Überwindet eine Weihnachtsfeier interne Hierarchien?

Der gemeinsame Fokus liegt auf Weihnachten und die Weihnachtsfeier ist das verbindende Element, dass alle Gäste an diesem Abend zusammenschweißt.

Hierbei wird das allzu oft zitierte ""Kompetenzgerangel"" beiseite gelassen. Es geht nicht darum, wer besser oder wichtiger ist. Denn damit kommt es zu keiner guten Feier. Doch wenn sich alle gemeinsam auf ein und dasselbe Ziel konzentrieren und sich darauf freuen, dann, ja dann kann eine Weihnachtsfeier interne Hierarchien überwinden.

Man nennt das auch ""Team Fokus"", indem sich viele Menschen auf ein und dasselbe Ziel konzentrieren. Statt gegeneinander zu arbeiten, arbeiten die Mitarbeiter miteinander und somit entsteht während der Feier eine Art Zusammengehörigkeitsgefühl. Gerade dieses Gefühl beflügelt einen jeden, die bisher gesetzten Schranken zu überwinden und sich als Teil der unternehmerischen Gemeinschaft zu sehen. Denn Hierarchien überwindet man nur dann, wenn man sich gemeinsam auf ein Ziel konzentriert und miteinander arbeitet - für das Wohl aller Beteiligten.

Das Interesse steigt, wenn man Gemeinsamkeiten hat

Erst durch ein Event abseits des normalen Arbeitsalltags lernt man den jeweils anderen Kollegen persönlich kennen. Denn wenn man ehrlich zu sich selbst ist, dann weiß man, dass auf der Arbeit nicht viel Raum für die persönliche Entfaltung ist. Und wenn man sich nicht persönlich entfalten kann, können andere die eigene Persönlichkeit nicht erkennen. Ein Versteckspiel für beide Seiten - leider.

Dinge, die die eigene Persönlichkeit ausmachen und Nichts mit der Arbeit zu tun haben, werden nur dann geäußert, wenn sich die Umstände ändern. Normalerweise ist dies bei Veranstaltungen der Fall. Wenn es keine Terminfrist gibt und man das Gefühl hat, dass alle entspannt sind, dann kann man sich leichter und eher fallen lassen.

Somit zeigt man sich seinen Mitmenschen von einer anderen Seite und gibt ihnen die Gelegenheit, einen selbst kennenzulernen. Unter Umständen - und das ist das Wünschenswerte dabei - tauscht man sich über Gemeinsamkeiten aus, die ein Grundstein einer Beziehung sein können.

Es könnte durch ein Gespräch dazu kommen, dass man von seiner Kollegin erfährt, dass sie gerne Bücher von Jane Austin liest und sich für alte Obstsorten interessiert. Selbst wenn es wie Zufall wirken mag, so kann es passieren, dass ein Kollege die Leidenschaft für Jane Austin Bücher teilt und schon ist das Eis gebrochen und man fühlt sich wohler, weil man etwas hat, worüber man miteinander reden kann. Denn Smalltalk ist auf Dauer schlicht langweilig und ermüdend - für beide Seiten.

""Ach, das sind Ihre Kinder?"", fragte er erstaunt

Man nutzt die Chance, sich über die Kinder kennenzulernen. Durchaus kann es passieren, dass zu einer Firmen-Weihnachtsfeier die Kinder der Mitarbeiter eingeladen werden dürfen. Als positiver Nebeneffekt entsteht dadurch eine familiäre Atmosphäre und die Eltern müssen sich keine Sorgen machen, ob es ihren Kindern gutgeht oder nicht.

Ebenso kann es im Laufe des Abends dazu führen, dass die Kinder eines Kollegen auch des eigenen Chefs sich mit den Kindern eines Mitarbeiters gut verstehen und mit ihnen spielen. Man lernt sich also darüber kennen, dass die Kinder zuerst eine Brücke der Kommunikation schlagen. Urplötzlich stellt man fest, dass man hinsichtlich der Kindererziehung dieselben Prioritäten besitzt und erkennt, dass man diese Gemeinsamkeiten auch im Arbeitsalltag umsetzen könnte, sofern man den Kontakt aufrechterhält.

Die Führungskräfte können sich mal entspannen

Man ist dem Dresscode nicht unterworfen und die Mitarbeiter sehen sie als ebenbürtig an, weil keine Krawatten und Anzüge getragen werden. Denn es kann durchaus sein, dass ich Mitarbeiter von Anzügen und Krawatten eingeschüchtert fühlen und sich wohler fühlen, ihren Chef anzusprechen, wenn sich dieser auf eine Weise kleidet, der keine Hierarchien ausdrückt. Es verringert daher die Hemmschwelle, womit man offener aufeinander zu geht.

Die Führungskräfte müssen an diesem Abend nicht alles kontrollieren und müssen auch nicht alles im Blick haben, sondern sie sind ein Teil der Feier und können sich mal einfach fallen lassen. Statt wie gewohnt, außen vor zu stehen. Denn als Chef ist man es gewohnt, alles im Blick haben zu müssen und nicht abschalten zu dürfen. Für so manchen Chef ist es eine Bürde, denn er muss es erst wieder üben, sich fallen zu lassen und die Verantwortung auf alle anderen abzugeben und ihnen zu vertrauen.

Urplötzlich plaudern die Mitarbeiter

Bei der Arbeit ist normalerweise keine Zeit für Themen, die Nichts mit der Arbeit zu tun haben. Denn sie kosten Zeit und Geld und das sind Ressourcen, die man nicht verschwenden kann und will. Je wohler sich die Mitarbeiter fühlen, weil die Weihnachtsfeier toll organisiert worden ist und weil großartige Unterhaltung an diesem Abend stattfindet, desto selbstbewusster reden sie darüber, was sie mögen, was sie denken und sind offener. Dadurch erkennen Führungskräfte, dass ihre Mitarbeiter etwas zu sagen haben, wenn sie es sich zutrauen.

Denn nur so kann man sich gegenseitig kennenlernen, wenn man sich präsentieren kann in Form eines offenen Gesprächs. Die geladenen Gäste und Mitarbeiter müssen das Gefühl haben, dass nicht bewertet wird, was sie sagen. Dies ist zuweilen nur dann möglich, wenn eine ausgelassene Stimmung zwischen allen Gästen herrscht. Denn dann weiß man auch, dass sie entspannt genug sind und auch die Zeit haben, das Gesagte zu verstehen und nicht nur wie typisch, ein Teil des Flurfunks sind.

A raíz de esto, Roca contestó que mantenía una relación abierta con Del Val.

""Yo no quiero tener una persona al lado que no esté viva, que no desee. Yo quiero que desee. Otra cosa es que no quiera estar conmigo.

Después del programa numerosos medios de comunicación se hicieron eco de lo que contó la pareja. Tras el aluvión de mensajes y de algunas críticas, Nuria Roca ha respondido en un cuenta de Instagram con un amplio mensaje.

""Respeto todas las opiniones y las agradezco siempre que vengan desde la educación y nunca desde la prepotencia de quien no admite una opinión y una manera diferente de entender.

Juan del Val también ha querido responder a los mensajes tras la entrevista en El Hormiguero. ""Yo no veo ninguna opción como la única ni como la mejor. No entiendo por qué alguien se enfada cuando alguien expone su manera de vivir o sentir"", ha dicho en Instagram.

Y también ha sido duro: ""No seáis condescendientes y preocuparos por los vuestros (en referencia a los hijos) que bastante difícil es educar para que sean felices"".

Viewers were left in disbelief when Dot announced she was taking some time away from Albert Square to visit family by the seaside in Wales, telling her grandson Robbie Jackson of her plans, out of the blue.

When an emotional Robbie asked, “how long are you thinking, grandma?”, she ignored the question, instead handing over her cat, Dave, for him to take care of.

BBC The emotional scene between Robbie and Dot moved many viewers

After a rough few years for Dot, distraught ‘EastEnders’ viewers were wondering whether this was it for June Brown’s long-standing character, voicing their concerns on social media:

However, others couldn’t help noticing that she was taking time away from the area just as Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer, was also leaving, prompting some to speculate whether they’d be heading off on a road trip together:

Fortunately, anyone concerned about Dot’s future on ‘EastEnders’ needn’t worry, as a spokesperson for the soap has assured Digital Spy: “Dot will be back on our screens very soon.”

Soap actress June Brown first joined ‘EastEnders’ in 1985, just a few months into the show’s first run, and was introduced as the mother of criminal Nick Cotton.

It didn’t take long for Dot to take centre stage, though, and has been involved in some of the soap’s most famous storylines during her 32 years in Albert Square.

June celebrated her 90th birthday earlier this year, which was commemorated by the BBC with a special tribute show.

“Or that efforts at rehabilitation would be undermined by prisoners having to spend more time isolated in their cells.","Cockroaches, filthy toilets, litter-strewn cells and electric wires hanging above shower cubicles - prisoners are living in “utterly appalling” squalor in UK jails.

That is the conclusion of a damning report from Peter Clarke, Chief Inspector of Prisons, as he warned the violence plaguing UK jails will not end while inmates are held in such poor conditions.

Images from Clarke’s damning report, released his week, show exposed broken windows, poor ventilation, graffiti, damp, exposed wiring and vermin in the UK prison estate.

Now, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon has told HuffPost UK he will launch a review of private sector contracts for jail maintenance with a view to bringing them back in-house.

He said said British prisons were “approaching an emergency situation”, adding: “The outsourcing of facilities management, maintenance and repairs has had a predictable impact on services.

“When there are reports of prisoners remarking it is easier to get drugs than clothing, or when prisoners go for long periods without properly functioning showers, it does nothing to build institutional trust.”

He called for ministers to listen to the prison officers facing the “explosion” of violence on the frontline.

The private sector contracts for prison maintenance in England and Wales, worth around £500m, have so far failed to deliver the £115m savings promised. The Ministry of Justice entered into the five-year deals with Carillion and Geo Amey in 2014.

Burgon said: “In addition to ruling out any more private sector prisons, Labour will undertake a review, working with governors and others, to identify those private service contracts that can be brought back in-house over time that would both save the state money and at the same time improve prison conditions.”

Clarke’s report found some prisoners had no choice but to eat their meals while sitting on their toilets, the report found – something which is in direct contravention of food hygiene guidance.

It also said prisoners and young offenderes were increasingly “frustrated and angry” at being locked up for as long as 22 hours a day in cramped conditions.

Last year, the number of assaults, self-harm incidents and suicides in prisons in England and Wales hit record highs.

Clarke told the BBC the poor state of jails was at the heart of the problem.

He said: “The Government’s ambition for prison reform will not be achieved unless prisons are made safer, the problem of drugs is dealt with and living conditions are improved.”

A number of prisons have been hit by serious disturbances. In the latest episode trouble flared at Long Lartin maximum security jail on Wednesday, with inmates taking control of an entire wing.

Clarke warned inmates were turning to drugs to “break the boredom” as they are locked up in cramped and decrepit cells for long periods.

From Peter Clarkes report From Peter Clarke's HM Inspectorate of Prisons report on living conditions in UK jails - barely half of inmates said they were offered cleaning materials every week

Clarke said: “The inevitable outcome of the conditions in jail and the crowding is that prisoners are very frustrated and angry.

“We have seen an explosion of violence in our jails over the last few years.

“Until things are improved in terms of the frustrations of prisoners in their conditions and being locked up for excessively long periods of time during the day, I’m afraid I can’t see how things are going to improve.”

Clarke went on: “Broken plumbing, blocked lavatories, broken windows, broken furniture, filth, infestations, cockroaches, rats - all the sorts of things that really, in the 21st century, we should be saying ‘this simply is not right’.”

Figures published on Friday also showed the prison population at 85,463, less than 1,000 below the “useable operational capacity” of 86,456, with the high number of prisoners thought to be contributing to the catalogue of problems facing jails.

Earlier this week the president of the Prison Governors Association said jails are “full to bursting” and called on the Government to “be brave” and cut the numbers behind bars.

Andrea Albutt said: “Currently our prisons are full to bursting. The Government must be brave and reduce the prison population and don’t worry about votes. Don’t dabble, just do it – because morally it is the right thing to do.”

Describing sentences of a year or less as “pointless”, she added: “This cohort must be dealt with in a different way in the community. Executive release is possible. We have prisoners on IPP (imprisonment for public protection) sentences years past their tariff but still in prison.”

Burgon said governors had repeatedly raised the problem with him, also.

“I have been struck by the fact every time I meet a prison governor or an officer, they tell me that we are jailing too many people.

“They ask me why we are using vast resources to send someone to prison for a few weeks. They lament seeing the same people over and over.

“When people at the frontline and experts raise such matters, we must take them seriously.”

The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) think tank has suggested the Government should freeing elderly or seriously-ill prisoners , who “pose minimal risk” to the public as it would save £246m a year and ease pressure on jails.

Burgon also hit out at Government failures to recruit more prison officers.

The pay cap for prison officers has been lifted as the Ministry of Justice attempts to hire 2,500 more prison officers.

Prison officers will receive a 1.7% pay rise, but is far less than the 5% the Prison Officer’s Association had been asking for.

Burgon said: “It really should have come as no surprise to this government that prisons would become less safe when staff are more outnumbered.

“Or that efforts at rehabilitation would be undermined by prisoners having to spend more time isolated in their cells. Or that when staff with decades of vital experience are lost to the service – or at breaking point, exhausted after working ever longer hours in ever more stressful conditions – that standards in prisons will become less decent.”

A prison service spokesman said there have “a number of unforeseen operational changes” since the maintenance contracts were awarded which have directly impacted the maintenance of the estate,” adding: “We are now in discussions with contractors.”",Labour Aims To End Tory Privatisation Of Prison Maintenance After Damning Report Exposes Squalid Cells,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/richard-burgon-maintenance_n_18257634.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Ein Angler in England erstickte beinahe an einem Fisch

Die 14 Zentimeter lange Seezunge sprang dem Mann in den Mund

Rettungssanitäter mussten den 28-Jährigen wiederbeleben

Ein Angler am Pier der britischen Stadt Bournemouth erstickte beinahe an einem lebendigen Fisch. Er musste wiederbelebt werden, nachdem er das Tier versehentlich verschluckt hatte, so der britische Sender BBC.

Voller Freude über seinen Fang hielt der Mann sich den Fisch über den Mund, um ihn zu küssen. Doch die 14 Zentimeter große Seezunge zappelte sich frei und sprang in seinen Mund.

Dem 28-Jährigen wurde dadurch die Luftröhre blockiert. Trotz Erste-Hilfe-Maßnahmen durch seine Freunde erlitt der Angler einen Herzstillstand.

Sanitäter Harrison hatte nur einen Versuch, um den Fisch zu entfernen

Die gerufenen Rettungssanitäter konnten den Mann retten, indem sie den Fisch mit Hilfe einer Pinzette entfernten.

“Uns war bewusst, dass wir den Fisch aus dem Hals des Patienten entfernen mussten, sonst hätte er die kurze Fahrt bis zum Royal Bournemouth Hospital nicht überlebt”, sagte Sanitäter Matt Harrison der BBC.

”Tatsächlich hatte ich nur einen Versuch, um den Fisch zu entfernen. Denn wenn ich abgerutscht, ein Stück abgebrochen und der Fisch tiefer gerutscht wäre, hätten wir nichts mehr tun können, um die Blockierung zu lösen.”

“Hier ist es Tradition, seinen ersten Fang zu küssen”

Laut BBC berichtete Harrison, dass die Kiemen und Widerhaken der Seezunge zwar feststeckten, es ihm aber trotzdem gelang, den Fisch in einem Stück zu entfernen.

Die Sanitäter konnten anschließend das Herz des Anglers nach drei Minuten wieder zum Schlagen zu bringen. Für Harrison war es sein bis dahin bizarrster Einsatz.

“Wir sind alle sehr froh, dass der Patient keine Folgen von seinem Herzstillstand davon trägt, denn das Ganze hätte sehr leicht eine tragische Wendung nehmen können.”

Ein Freund des Anglers erklärt den ungewöhnlichen Vorfall so: “Hier ist es Tradition, seinen ersten Fang zu küssen.”

Seine ganze kuriose Geschichte erfahrt ihr im Video oben

Wie verhält man sich am besten, wenn man merkt, dass der Partner kontrollsüchtig ist? Malcolm Applegate suchte jedenfalls statt einem offenen Gespräch einen außergewöhnlichen und extremen Weg: Er verschwand, ohne jemandem Bescheid zu geben, für zehn Jahre.

Die ersten fünf Jahre lebte der Engländer in einem Wald, bevor er in ein Obdachlosenheim in Südlondon zog. Auf der Webseite des Heims veröffentlichten die Mitarbeiter nun Malcolms ungewöhnliche Geschichte. Die Schuld an seiner Obdachlosigkeit gibt er seiner Frau.

“Je mehr ich arbeitete, desto wütender wurde sie”

Er berichtet, dass er 25 Jahre lang als Gärtner gearbeitet hatte, bevor ihn das Verhalten seiner Ehefrau immer mehr belastet habe. “Je mehr ich arbeitete, desto wütender wurde sie”, erzählte Applegate den Mitarbeitern. “Ihr Verhalten geriet außer Hand und sie verlangte von mir, immer weniger zu arbeiten. Nachdem ich lange versucht habe, unsere Ehe zu retten, beschloss ich zu gehen.”

Daraufhin habe der Gärtner für fünf Jahre in einem dichten Wald gezeltet und in einem Altersheim in der Nähe gearbeitet. Dann hörte er von dem Obdachlosenheim, das ihm half, neue Arbeit zu finden und ihm ein Dach über dem Kopf schenkte.

Seine Schwester dachte, er sei bereits tot

Die Mitarbeiter dort ermutigten ihn ebenfalls, sich bei seiner Schwester zu melden. Diese habe er in den vergangenen zehn Jahren nicht gesehen. Sie dachte, ihr Bruder sei bereits verstorben.

Der mittlerweile über 60-Jährige sei nun wieder sehr glücklich mit seinem Leben und den kleinen Jobs, die ihm durch das Heim vermittelt werden. In seiner Freizeit setze er sich nun für andere wohltätige Organisationen ein, die Obdachlose wie ihn unterstützen.

En la misiva, los firmantes apuntan que durante los últimos 10 años, México ha sufrido niveles alarmantes de violencia e impunidad ante el despliegue de miles de elementos militares para realizar labores de seguridad pública en el marco de la guerra contra las drogas.

Acusan que dicha estrategia ha ""fomentado la comisión de graves violaciones a los derechos humanos y crímenes atroces dado que las Fuerzas Armadas no se han limitado únicamente a actuar como apoyo a las autoridades civiles, sino a realizar tareas que corresponden exclusivamente a las policías.""

A continuación te compartimos la carta íntegra:

Las organizaciones que firmamos esta carta, nos dirigimos a usted con el fin de solicitarle que sea abordada la alarmante situación por la que atraviesa México en materia de derechos humanos e impunidad, en la próxima reunión con el Presidente Enrique Peña Nieto en el marco de su visita a nuestro país los próximos 12 y 13 de octubre.Como es probable que usted sepa, durante los últimos 10 años, México sufre niveles alarmantes de violencia e impunidad. El despliegue de miles de elementos militares para realizar labores de seguridad pública en el marco de la guerra contra las drogas ha fomentado la comisión de graves violaciones a los derechos humanos y crímenes atroces dado que las Fuerzas Armadas no se han limitado únicamente a actuar como apoyo a las autoridades civiles, sino a realizar tareas que corresponden exclusivamente a las policías.

Los saldos de esta estrategia de seguridad han sido devastadores. Desde el 2006, la Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) ha contabilizado 5,910 averiguaciones previas por tortura y las Fiscalías de los estados han registrado al menos 6,262. No obstante, hasta el momento solo existen 8 sentencias condenatorias en torno a este grave delito.

Así mismo, ocurren hechos extremadamente violentos y atentados contra el derecho a la vida a un nivel intolerable. Desde el 2006, la Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos ha emitido 77 recomendaciones en las que se documentan hechos de asesinatos. Por su parte, el Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos informó que, de acuerdo a cifras oficiales, se han registrado más de 150 mil homicidios intencionales entre el 2006 y 2015.

Por otro lado, existe un contexto de desapariciones forzadas generalizadas en gran parte del territorio de México, y existen serias dificultades para la prevención, investigación y sanción de las mismas, así como para la búsqueda de las personas desaparecidas. De acuerdo al Registro Nacional de Personas Desaparecidas, 32,943 personas desaparecieron desde el inicio de la guerra contra el narcotráfico, incluyendo 8,525 mujeres y 5,985 menores de edad. Por su parte, la PGR sólo ha iniciado 598 averiguaciones previas por este delito y hasta el momento solo se han emitido 9 sentencias condenatorias por desaparición forzada. De manera preocupante, de acuerdo a datos de 19 procuradurías estatales del país, existe un total de 1,075 fosas clandestinas y 2,014 cuerpos exhumados del año 2007 al 2014.

La violencia e impunidad, además ha propiciado el desplazamiento interno forzado de al menos 310,527 personas dentro del país.

Dichas cifras revelan que los atroces hechos ocurridos o sujetos a investigación durante la administración del Presidente Enrique Peña Nieto, no son casos aislados, por el contrario, son hechos generalizados que evidencian a instituciones que no quieren o no son capaces de investigar y perseguir estos crímenes.

En particular, nos preocupa que gran parte de las violaciones graves a derechos humanos ocurridas en México, se cometan bajo un contexto de militarización de la seguridad pública. Hemos documentado una actuación recurrente de las Fuerzas Armadas mexicanas: el uso indebido de la fuerza, ejecuciones arbitrarias de civiles rendidos o indefensos, alteración de evidencias y ocultamiento de pruebas, seguido de una estrategia mediática para distorsionar los hechos y criminalizar a las víctimas.

En ese sentido, aprovechamos la ocasión para expresarle nuestra preocupación por la aprobación de una Ley de Seguridad de Interior en México. Dicha Ley, tiene como propósito facultar a las Fuerzas Armadas del país en tareas de seguridad pública e incluso pretende que las mismas puedan llegar a suplantar las tareas de la policía llegando a ampliar las facultades para que el Ejército y la Marina puedan tener competencias ministeriales y judiciales. Tememos que, con esta Ley, la autoridad civil termine cediendo a las acciones militares y de que se perpetúe la impunidad de las violaciones graves a los derechos humanos cometidas por las Fuerzas Armadas.

Por otro lado, la población migrante en tránsito es también altamente afectada sin que a la fecha se cuente con cifras oficiales y al menos tres masacres de migrantes documentadas, con cerca de 314 víctimas, permanecen aún en la impunidad. De igual manera, nos preocupa la ausencia de medidas preventivas y de investigación efectiva, así como la permanencia de todo tipo de violencia y discriminación, contra mujeres, siendo el feminicidio la máxima expresión, la violencia cometida contra niños, niñas y adolescentes, personas LGBTTTI, pueblos indígenas y pueblos en defensa de su territorio ancestral. A ello se suma las constantes violaciones de derechos económicos, sociales y culturales, particularmente en el contexto de la actividad empresarial.

Así mismo, desde que el presidente Enrique Peña Nieto asumió su cargo, se han registrado 38 asesinatos de periodistas, lo anterior, a pesar de que el mandatario anunció oficialmente en mayo de 2017 las ""Acciones por la libertad de expresión y para la protección de periodistas y defensores"". Pese a ello, en lo que va del 2017, 11 asesinatos en contra de periodistas han sido documentados, 6 de ellos corresponden a mujeres periodistas. Esto demuestra que las acciones anunciadas por el presidente parecen solo actos de retórica sin indicadores de impacto efectivo. En tanto, 106 personas defensoras han sido asesinadas y 81 desaparecidas, lo que evidencia que las acciones del Estado para promover y proteger la defensa de derechos humanos no han sido efectivas a pesar de los compromisos asumidos.

Es importante destacar, que las agresiones que enfrentan en México las y los periodistas y las personas defensoras, como lo son amenazas, allanamientos, censura, deslegitimación de su trabajo, acoso judicial y espionaje, son un reflejo de la falta de una política integral de protección y prevención a ataques hacia víctimas, personas defensoras y periodistas.

Señor Primer Ministro, en momentos tan difíciles como los que definen hoy la situación de México, hacemos un llamado para que Canadá, país cuyo pilar de la democracia se ha basado en el respeto de los derechos humanos, promueva el respeto de los mismos con sus países aliados, como lo es México.

Cada año su país mantiene un papel crítico y activo en el Consejo de Derechos Humanos de las Naciones Unidas, ha contribuido en el fortalecimiento del mismo, ha promovido la escrupulosa aplicación de los mecanismos de protección de derechos humanos y ha demostrado ser firme ante cualquier amenaza que ponga en riesgo su independencia, imparcialidad.

Es por ello que de la manera más atenta le solicitamos:

Fortalecer la asociación bilateral con México garantizando que los esfuerzos y las acciones conjuntas, contribuyan en el respeto, protección y garantía de los derechos humanos de ambos países. De igual manera, le llamamos a instar al Jefe del Estado mexicano a emprender soluciones estructurales y duraderas para que sus instituciones combatan la preocupante impunidad prevaleciente en México. Promover el cumplimiento de las 14 recomendaciones dirigidas al Gobierno de México por el Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos, en particular, la que se refiere al establecimiento de un Consejo Asesor contra la Impunidad. Ante la falta de capacidad e imparcialidad para investigar actos de corrupción y violaciones a derechos humanos, México necesita de un mecanismo internacional, independiente e imparcial, compuesto por personas expertas que coadyuven con el Estado Mexicano para generar instituciones de procuración y administración de justicia capaces de revertir los alarmantes índices de corrupción e impunidad por violaciones a derechos humanos que existen en el país. Confiamos en que su gobierno, reconociendo la importancia fundamental de los Estados a prestar ayuda mutua de conformidad con sus obligaciones internacionales, ayudará a México a combatir la corrupción e impunidad a través de la promoción del establecimiento del Consejo Asesor y de un Mecanismo Internacional contra la Impunidad con una composición internacional. Promover, dentro del Consejo de Derechos Humanos de Naciones Unidas y otras instancias multilaterales, un diálogo respecto de la preocupante situación de violaciones a derechos humanos en México, con miras a plantear soluciones estructurales e integrales al contexto que vive México. Manifestar la importancia que tienen las víctimas, las personas defensoras de derechos humanos, y la sociedad civil mexicana en la construcción de un estado de derecho, solicitando al Gobierno mexicano que garantice amplios, efectivos y transparentes espacios de consulta, participación y evaluación de la sociedad civil en políticas públicas y otros temas relacionados con derechos humanos. Promover la implementación de los Principios Rectores sobre Empresas y Derechos Humanos de la ONU siguiendo las observaciones hechas por el Grupo de Trabajo de la ONU en la materia al final de su visita al Estado canadiense. México está en un proceso de implementación de dichos Principios a través de un Programa Nacional. La implementación de este Programa constituye una oportunidad para atender los niveles de impunidad con la que operan entes públicos y privados que han causado abusos y violaciones a derechos humanos por sus actividades empresariales. Siendo que México no cuenta con un mecanismo de identificación y sanción a los responsables de dichos abusos, ni con mecanismos efectivos para el acceso a la justicia de personas que resultan afectadas, esta política pública tiene el potencial de fomentar el respeto de los derechos humanos como eje primordial del desarrollo y de todo tratado comercial y de inversión. Hacer una revisión sobre la eficacia de los lineamientos y compromisos adquiridos por el Estado canadiense en materia de respeto a los derechos humanos en sus actividades empresariales y operaciones en el exterior y en su cadena de valor, incorporando el proceso de debida diligencia para identificar, prevenir, mitigar y remediar impactos negativos en derechos humanos en todos los sectores, particularmente en el extractivo, tomando en cuenta que la mayoría de las empresas mineras operando en México son canadienses. Es importante mencionar que en el marco del diálogo debe darse esta conversación teniendo en consideración la modernización, actualización y renegociación del Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte, donde también debe ponerse énfasis en el respeto a los derechos a la tierra, territorio y medio ambiente de comunidades agrarias, indígenas y equiparables, así como en las afectaciones específicas en estos contextos a los derechos de las mujeres y los riesgos de las personas defensoras comunitarias frente a la actividad empresarial.

Agradecemos de antemano su amable atención y aprovechamos para expresarle nuestras más altas y distinguidas consideraciones.

Every publisher wants better search engine rankings. It's always exhilarating if you see one of your links appearing among the top 10 Google search results. But how does Google's ranking algorithm actually evaluate your content, your individual links, or even your entire website? Is there a set formula?

Of course, everybody who has dabbled in a bit of Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) knows some standard ways of improving rankings. Publishing quality content based on your keywords, creating compelling titles and encouraging people to link back to your content, are all standard ways of optimising for better search engine rankings. But these are not the only ways to get better search engine rankings. Google has burned its fingers. It can no longer rely on publishers and webmasters to stick to its guidelines. The ranking algorithm now crowdsources its ranking intelligence.

Consequently, the way people react to your content is as important as publishing optimised, high-quality content. Google ranks your content based on user behaviour vis-à-vis your content. Here are a few lesser-known facts about how Google actually ranks your content:

Your click-through rate on the search engine result pages

How many people are clicking your links from the search engine result pages?

Although your link may appear on Google's first page, if it isn't attracting much traffic, it is moved to the second or third page, and the other links that attract more traffic, are gradually shifted up.

Google takes your click-through rate into account while recalibrating your rankings. Just because suddenly your link is showing up among the top 10 results doesn't mean it is going to stay there forever. Remember that Google is continuously calculating not just your rankings, but rankings of millions of links. So, your link is constantly being compared to other links and is being shuffled around accordingly.

This is how it happens:

Your link begins to show up at position 4 on the search results page.

There is another link that appears at position 6 on the same page.

For the same keyword or search term both the links show up 100 times.

20/100 times people click your link.

40/100 times people click the other link.

This sends Google a message that the other link is more important than yours, and should be given prominence.

So, you are put in position 6 and the other link rises to position 4.

Since this is an ongoing process, all the links that have a better click-through rate than you, begin to bypass you and before you know, your link has vanished from the first or even the second page. The reverse can happen if your click-through rate is better than the link appearing before you. If your link attracts more clicks than the link before you, the positions are interchanged. This is one of the lesser-known ranking secrets that seems to have been recently implemented.

Your bounce rate

The bounce rate is the number many people leave your website after accessing the link they found on Google. If they leave your website without exploring it further, Google thinks that your website is not solving the purpose of the search it is being featured for.

You need to consider bounce rate from Google's perspective. Bounce rate doesn't mean a person coming to your website and then going to another website without further exploring your website. From Google's point of view, bounce rate means a person clicks a link from Google's search results page and then, without exploring your website further, comes back to Google. If many people do this, you have a higher bounce rate which, according to Google, means, your website doesn't have useful content.

The time a reader spends on your website

If a visitor immediately leaves your website after accessing it from Google, it's evident that he or she didn't find what he or she is looking for. On the other hand, if the person spends lots of time on the link that he or she found on Google and then also explores your website further, it signals Google that your website holds quality content and hence, should be ranked better.

The traffic that you get

Google also takes into account the traffic that you are currently getting. You may wonder, if you don't have better search engine rankings, how does Google expect you to get more traffic? From other sources. Google wants to encourage you to use other sources as validation or as plain traffic sources. You can advertise your links on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. You can share your links on your social media timelines. You can use your mailing list. The more traffic you can generate, the better can be your search engine rankings.

The Search Task Accomplishment factor

When you search on Google, it is a task for it. You're looking for some information. When you come across a link, do you find the information, or not? If you find the information on the link you have just found on Google, your task is accomplished. If not, you come back to Google and carry on your research. That link didn't help you accomplish your task.

If a person finds your link, comes to your website and then immediately goes back to Google to carry on the search it means he or she didn't find the information he or she was looking for, and hence, the task wasn't accomplished. This is seen in a negative light by Google, and consequently, your search engine ranking negatively gets impacted. Therefore, it isn't just the quality of your content that affects your search engine rankings. Social validation and user behaviour matter too.

Trump habló en una rueda de prensa en la Casa Blanca junto al primer ministro de Canadá, Justin Trudeau. Al mandatario se le consultó si el TLCAN está muerto, a lo que respondió: ""Ya veremos qué ocurre"".

En una rueda de prensa posterior, al ser consultado sobre los comentarios de Trump, Trudeau dijo que es optimista sobre las posibilidades de modernizar el pacto instaurado en 1994.

""Sigo creyendo en el TLCAN (...) Estamos preparados para que pase cualquier cosa, y vamos a seguir trabajando con diligencia para proteger los intereses de Canadá"", dijo Trudeau, quien destacó que su país es consciente de que Trump es impredecible.

Empresarios le piden a Trump permanecer en el TLCAN

La Cámara de Comercio estadounidense acusó el martes al Gobierno en Washington de intentar sabotear las discusiones con ""propuestas venenosas"".

Las conversaciones sobre el TLCAN podrían estancarse por las agresivas demandas de Estados Unidos de elevar abruptamente los requerimientos de origen local para componentes de autos y autopartes, según expertos comerciales.

Por su parte, el secretario de Comercio de Estados Unidos, Wilbur Ross, uno de los máximos asesores de Trump, desestimó que el final del TLCAN sea necesario. ""No esperamos que pase, no deseamos que pase, no creemos que pase, pero es al menos un posibilidad conceptual mientras avanzamos"", destacó.

Fuentes informadas sobre las propuestas de Estados Unidos dijeron que éstas apuntan a elevar el límite para el contenido de origen norteamericano a 85%, desde el actual 62.5 %, con un requerimiento específico de fabricación estadounidense de 50%.

We've had some rough nights with our daughter who has additional needs, walking up and down the hallway as we take turns to try and soothe her little body.

Running baths to help her feel comfort when she can't find calm. I mix medicines under soft lights and watch the clock tick over from 12 am, 2 am, 3 am and on...

This space is all too familiar. I wonder how many moments of sleep we will get before the sun rises. My mind fast forwards to the day ahead and all of a sudden her additional needs feel bigger than usual. I can't recall the last time we slept a whole night through together, often when she wakes and finally resettles, we are left alert and full of adrenalin, trying to find quiet and calm ourselves.

The hope for health and happiness from parents to their children spans the globe through cultures and time immemorial. When this is taken away, monumental shifts need to occur as we adapt to this whole new way of parenting.

Through these sleepless nights I carry her body as she drapes over my arms, so delicate, fragile and full of mystery. I wonder why she's so unsettled? If only she could talk and let me know. Is she hungry, tired, sore or sad?

I reposition her limbs and try to help her find that space of comfort where she can rest and heal, beyond the labels of her medical conditions.

I have nothing but my intuition to lean on when all else is unknown. Of course, certain things are known, like the stark medical words for the cause of these midnight moments: Stroke in utero. Bilateral Perisylvian Polymicrogyria. Quadraplegic Cerebral Palsy. They are the words of a bad dream. Maybe that's why we no longer sleep.

When her body allows it, I am able to soothe her and hold her close to my heart. But when the rigidity fires, her body forces itself into extension. I sense ways to hold her and bring her body back to balance, waiting for the electrical storm to pass. I hear her soft sighs and yawns after her body has exerted so much energy and has finally found equilibrium.

I think of all the parents around the world who are taking care of their children with medical issues during these testing midnight hours. I wonder how they cope.

The hope for health and happiness from parents to their children spans the globe through cultures and time immemorial. When this is taken away, monumental shifts need to occur as we adapt to this whole new way of parenting.

Through this haze of broken sleep, exhaustion and ongoing physical care, we keep choosing to love over fear.

These tiny micro-milestones of choice in the long run turn out to create some of the biggest shifts of our life, one small midnight moment at a time.

I have a question for Varun Dhawan. Say, he's at a department store with some friends, getting supplies for a party. A random man walks up to a female friend, while she is bent over a shelf, and spanks her butt. Would he — as he probably expected his audience in Judwaa 2 to — break into peals of laughter?

My hunch is, he or any decent person for that matter, won't find harassment of that kind funny. In his latest film, Dhawan plays Raja, a man who cannot control his urge to grab a woman's butt when he sees one. Now the problem is not Dhawan playing the man — he is an actor and he'd ideally play a gamut of different characters — but the film's insistence that this man is its 'hero'. And, like a zillion Hindi films before it, also establish that this butt-grabber, sexual harasser is a man women will eventually fall in love with, because they actually secretly consider being chased and grabbed as a rite of passage to fall in love. I guess, at this point, we should just be thankful that Bollywood movies aren't yet suggesting women actually want to date the T-Rex or that human-chomping shark from Jaws.

In 10 days, Judwaa 2 has made Rs 112 crores. It is hardly surprising, given that the last time he played an entitled Indian man chasing a woman and not taking 'no' for an answer, it was a blockbuster hit, too, that made over Rs 200 crore.

In Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya, his character Badri abducted the girl and locked her inside the trunk of his car... yet the film was being hailed far and wide as 'feminist'.

In Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya, his character Badri abducted the girl and locked her inside the trunk of his car. His father threatened to hang her in the town square and none of them apologised for these specific incidents of violence inflicted on the woman. Yet the film was being hailed far and wide as 'feminist'.

Why?

Because, though true to Bollywood, boor extraordinaire Badri gets the girl, he also gets ridiculously sloshed and tells his horrible, violent father at the conclusion of the film that he is a bad person who doesn't not let women pursue careers. My guess is people in India found it fairly progressive that the protagonist did not actually let the woman he abducted die inside the trunk of the car. Though common human sense says, such a man shouldn't be let alone near an ant unsupervised, forget a human being, in the Indian scheme of gender justice, all was fair in love and two super-hit nightclub numbers. The rousing support for Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya was symptomatic of how even in the presumably 'aware' social circles in India, dignity of women is considered a conditional allowance, not an unquestionable right, the breach of which should be met with punishment, not romance. In a country with a frustrating understanding of gender equality, we actually cannot afford to send out mixed messages as Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya did.

The rousing support for Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya was symptomatic of how even in the presumably 'aware' social circles in India, dignity of women is considered a conditional allowance, not an unquestionable right,

Judwaa 2 doesn't even pretend that nearly two decades have passed since the original film was released, when there were just a few channels to call out it's obnoxious sexism. Which brings us to the question, what gave the makers the courage to go ahead and make the same film, its misogyny intact? Look no further than the film's raging collections and the nearly non-existent protests, to figure what.

One is compelled to wonder if Bollywood's slapstick ideas only have to do with violating women's bodies and ignoring consent? Judwaa 2 showcases every possible way of harassment imaginable to women in India, perpetrated by the male protagonist. A lecherous co-passenger hurling sexually coloured comments at a woman on a flight, a man in a mall who grabs someone's butt, a man who has been rebuffed but comes back to forcibly smooch a girl in a public space, a man who spots a house help in a skirt and immediately grabs her and rubs himself against her — the list is infuriating.

Not only that, the women in the film — obviously — are made out to be the most confusing humans you would know. So the character played by Tapsee Pannu is initially upset that Varun Dhawan's character forcibly smooched her and her mother, but runs right back into his arm thinking it was him who fought a few louts harassing her at a basketball game. A part of me felt that character she plays doesn't need a boyfriend, she needs a lesson in self-respect first.

A part of me felt that character doesn't need a boyfriend, she needs a lesson in self-respect first.

Judwaa 2's success comes unsurprisingly at a time when a host of men and women actually went to town arguing that the repulsive 'Aunty Ki Ghanti' song doing the rounds of the internet was actually about consent. Several 'fans', apart from shouting lines from that song in public places, argued that since the singer is asking 'Bol na anty aoon kya', it is clear that he is seeking consent. Ask them what kind of people actually think saying 'hey should I come and flap your boobs' qualify as consent, they will present you a plethora of arguments that usually make one point — 'but it's a joke!'

Before HuffPost India and a few other news outlets pointed out the frighteningly misogynistic nature of the song, several social media pages of comedy groups and even self-proclaimed 'feminist' content sites made 'funny' memes about the song, helping normalise and legitimise this brand of misogyny as 'fun'. No wonder Judwaa 2 exists and is laughing its way to the bank.

Ask any woman, if a random man grabbed her butt in a mall and gnawed at her mouth, she'd be furious and traumatised. It's high time films start sticking to the script of reality on issues like these.

A Montreal actress has joined a growing chorus of women accusing embattled Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment or sexual assault.

In an interview with the CBC, Erika Rosenbaum alleged the fallen movie mogul made aggressive sexual advances during three separate meetings nearly 15 years ago.

Weinstein, who has been fired from the film company he co-founded, has previously denied through a spokeswoman any allegations of non-consensual contact.

Rosenbaum said she first met Weinstein at a Los Angeles party when she was in her early 20s.

I felt it important to tell the truth and speak out against the sexual harassment I and others have endured. Erika Rosenbaum

She said she met with him three more times to talk about her career, and alleged Weinstein acted inappropriately and tried to be intimate with her.

She alleged that during their third encounter — in a hotel room during the Toronto International Film Festival in the mid-2000s — Weinstein held her by the back of her neck and masturbated while standing behind her.

Rosenbaum is the first Canadian to join the list of some 30 women who have accused Weinstein of inappropriate conduct since the scandal first broke in the New York Times.

""My statements to the media were very difficult to recount,"" Rosenbaum, whose credits include roles in the films ""Brooklyn"" and ""The Trotsky,"" said Friday in a statement.

C'est dans ce contexte que les langues se délient pour dénoncer d'autres hommes et d'autres pratiques punies par la loi: abus sexuels, harcélement, tentatives de chantage, etc...

À l'instar de Tippi Hedren, qui est entrée dans le débat par un message publié le 11 octobre sur Twitter. Ce n'est plus un secret, celle qui a reçu le Golden Globe Award de la révélation féminine en 1964 a connu une expérience difficile avec le réalisateur britannique Alfred Hitchcock.

Sous sa direction sur les tournages des films ""Les Oiseaux"" (1963) et ""Pas de printemps pour Marnie"" (1964), l'ancienne actrice âgée de 87 ans, qui est aussi la mère de Melanie Griffith, avait indiqué avoir subi des actes relevant de l'agression et du harcèlement sexuel.

""Il adorait me réciter des comptines cochonnes""

Dans ses livres ""L'art d'Alfred Hitchcock : 50 ans de films"" (1976) et ""La vraie vie d'Alfred Hitchcock: la face cachée d'un génie"" (1983), l'écrivain et biographe américain Daniel Spoto racontait déjà des confidences de Tippi Hedren sur les avances du réalisateur britannique à son égard.

En novembre 2016, c'est Tippi Hedren qui publiait ses mémoires. Elle y racontait le comportement d'Alfred Hitchcock sur les tournages. ""Il adorait me réciter des comptines cochonnes et faire des plaisanteries salaces sur le plateau"". Tippi Hedren avait pris la décision de rompre ses contrats avec le réalisateur qu'elle accusait surtout de l'avoir forcée à l'embrasser à l'arrière de sa limousine.

En 2012, l'actrice revenait sur ces événements dans une interview au HuffPost américain. ""C'est une terrible chose que d'être l'objet de l'obsession de quelqu'un (...). Hitchcock a ruiné ma carrière.""

Un message de soutien publié sur Twitter

Dans un message publié sur Twitter mercredi 11 octobre, l'actrice exprime son soutien à l'égard des actrices qui ont témoigné ces derniers jours contre Harvey Weinstein.

""Je regarde toute la couverture de l'affaire Weinstein. Il n'y a rien de nouveau, et ce n'est pas limité à l'industrie du divertissement. J'ai dû gérer des intimidations sexuelles tout le temps, pendant ma période de mannequinat et ma carrière d'actrice. Hitchcock n'était pas le premier. Cependant, je n'allais pas l'accepter davantage, alors je me suis tout simplement éloignée et je n'ai pas regardé en arrière. Hitch m'a dit qu'il ruinerait ma carrière et je lui ai répondu qu'il pouvait faire ce qu'il voulait. Ça a pris 50 ans, mais il est temps que les femmes commencent à se défendre comme elles semblent le faire dans cette affaire Weinstein. C'est bien pour elles!""

Dans une interview accordée au magazine Variety en novembre dernier, l'ancienne comédienne indiquait également: ""Je voulais que les femmes, surtout les jeunes femmes, sachent qu'elles n'ont pas à accepter ce genre d'approches, jamais, et qu'il faut insister pour dire aux gens qu'on n'est pas intéressé par ce genre de relation. Ce n'est pas une mauvaise chose de dire non.""

Décédé en avril 1980, Alfred Hitchcock n'a jamais été inquiété par la justice. Tippi Hedren n'a accepté de parler publiquement que dans les années 2010. Dans des propos relayés par Le Point, elle justifiait son silence: ""Le harcèlement sexuel et le harcèlement étaient des mots qui n'existaient pas à l'époque.""

Car plus que toute autre partie de l'humanité, les femmes que nous accueillons ont expérimenté dans leur chair et dans leur intimité toute la violence du monde.

A la Maison des Femmes, nous avons mis en œuvre la semaine de la Sororité Générale!","Créé en 2016 à l'initiative du philosophe Abdennour Bidar et de la productrice Fabienne Servan-Schreiber, le mouvement ""Fraternité Générale"" se veut une réponse apolitique et populaire à la violence qui nous a submergés et au repli identitaire qui nous menace.

A tous ceux qui pensent qu'ils ont une responsabilité dans la marche du monde et qui souhaitent en ""réparer le tissu déchiré"" pour reprendre les termes d'Abdennour Bidar, Fraternité Générale propose de promouvoir des actions culturelles, pédagogiques et citoyennes une semaine par an, partout en France.

Créée pour prendre en charge les femmes les plus vulnérables, la Maison des Femmes de Saint-Denis ne pouvait que se retrouver dans un engagement qui mobilise la société pour une vie citoyenne plus juste, plus solidaire, au service de l'éducation et du vivre ensemble.

Les violences faites aux femmes concernent tous les milieux, même si pauvreté, migration et exclusion aggravent leurs conséquences sanitaires et sociales. Elles imposent une prise en charge plurielle, tant éducative que juridique, et un travail de fond en faveur de l'égalité femmes/hommes. Leurs conséquences sur les femmes et leurs enfants sont d'une extrême gravité, notamment sur la santé.

Conscients que le personnel soignant est le plus souvent l'interlocuteur premier voire unique des femmes, nous avons créé une structure de soin, mais aussi d'orientation et de coordination des parcours, dédiée à toutes les formes de violences et de vulnérabilités.

Ce lieu est apparu d'emblée comme une ressource pour l'ensemble des acteurs du territoire, et permet la formation continue des soignants et la sensibilisation du grand public.

Il est aussi une forme de plaidoyer auprès des pouvoirs publics.

Rappelons quelques chiffres insoutenables et pourtant essentiels à connaître:

- Une femme meurt tous les 2,5 jours sous les coups de son compagnon

- On recense environ 206 viols par jour en France dont seulement 15% sont déclarés

- 3% des Français sont victimes d'inceste

- 1 fille est excisée dans le monde toutes les 5 secondes, 53.000 vivent en France, 500.000 en Europe

- Près de 70.000 mineures sont concernées par le mariage forcé en France

- Les 2/3 des 900 millions d'analphabètes dans le monde sont des femmes

Nous qui sommes témoins de vies injustes et dépourvues de toute solidarité, qui accompagnons tous les jours des femmes qui n'ont jamais eu accès à l'éducation et pour lesquelles autonomie et vivre ensemble sont de vains mots, avons choisi de nous associer à cet élan fraternel en célébrant dignement cette semaine. Car plus que toute autre partie de l'humanité, les femmes que nous accueillons ont expérimenté dans leur chair et dans leur intimité toute la violence du monde. Humiliées, violées, excisées, victimes d'un mari violent ou de familles empêtrées dans des carcans communautaires et des traditions néfastes, elles sont convaincues de n'avoir ni dignité ni avenir.

Ainsi, du 13 au 15 octobre, nous avons choisi d'offrir à nos patientes quelques parenthèses que nous espérons, même modestement, réparatrices:

- Par un atelier ""Bien-être"" parce que prendre soin de soi est un luxe auquel elles n'ont pas accès, préoccupées par la recherche d'un toit, d'un repas chaud ou de papiers. Créer des bijoux qui parlent d'elles, bénéficier de massages et de maquillages, valoriser et fixer leur transformation sous forme de photos artistiques, autant d'événements anodins pour nombre d'entre nous, inoubliables pour elles.

- Par la projection du film ""14 kilomètres"", qui raconte l'épopée de 2 adolescents partis d'Afrique vers l'Europe à la recherche d'une vie moins âpre, pour fuir un quotidien violent et un mariage forcé, pour réaliser un rêve de foot et de gloire, et qui font face à la cruauté, à la violence et à la cupidité des passeurs. Parcours qui résume le destin de nombre de nos femmes, traumatisées à jamais.

- Enfin par une initiation au Haidong Gumdo, le sabre coréen, pour reprendre confiance en soi et se sentir plus fortes pour affronter le monde. Les arts martiaux permettent de maintenir une forme physique et apprennent à faire face et à répondre à une agression. La confiance en soi fait appel aux mêmes qualités et réflexes!

Ces parenthèses magiques ne sont possibles que par la grâce de nos bénévoles, si soucieuses de ""réparer"" et qui tentent par leur implication de rendre un peu de justice et de solidarité à celles qui en sont dépourvues.

A la Maison des Femmes, nous avons mis en œuvre la semaine de la Sororité Générale! Puisse-t-elle se renouveler tout au long de l'année.

Née au lendemain des attentats de novembre 2015, l'association Fraternité générale!, présidée par le philosophe Abdennour Bidar, s'est donnée pour but de replacer au centre de la société française la valeur oubliée de notre devise républicaine : la Fraternité. L'association organise une opération annuelle de ""Fraternité générale!"" dont le but est de valoriser tous les acteurs de la société qui contribuent à recréer le lien social, et ce à travers des actions culturelles, citoyennes, et sportives, créatrices de partage, la rencontre, et d'ouverture sur l'autre. Elle a lieu cette année du 13 au 15 octobre 2017.

Letztere plädierten in ihrem Artikel dafür, dass Deutschland mehr Risikoteilung zulassen solle und Frankreich mehr Marktdisziplin.

Konkret plädierten die französisch-deutschen Schreiber für eine gemeinsame Einlagensicherung für Sparvermögen in der EU und gleichzeitig für eine Risikogewichtung der Banken beim Kauf von Staatsanleihen. Derzeit fehle es an einem gemeinsamen Kapitalmarkt, und die Risiken in der Eurozone würden auf die jeweiligen Staaten und die EZB verteilt.

Wer trägt das Risiko?

Die Einlagensicherung sieht vor, dass Spareinlagen mit 100.000 Euro bei der jeweiligen Bank versichert sind, egal ob in Flensburg, Siena oder Athen.

Die Frage ist: Wer trägt das Risiko einer Bankenschieflage im jeweiligen Land? Ist es die Sicherungseinrichtung in Spanien, Italien oder Griechenland? Oder ist in einem gemeinsamen Währungsraum eine gemeinsame Einlagensicherung dafür verantwortlich, also auch die Einlagensicherungseinrichtungen von Sparkassen und Volksbanken in Deutschland? Um dieses Frage geht es.

Die EU-Kommission hat dafür in dieser Woche einen Kompromiss vorgeschlagen, der zu Beginn eine Art Rückversicherung vorsieht. Erstmal sollen die nationalen Einlagensicherungssysteme greifen.

Haben diese kein Geld mehr, können sie sich von anderen Einlagensicherungssystemen Geld leihen. Erst langfristig sollen die Einlagensicherungssysteme zu einem einheitlichen System verschmolzen werden.

Die Gefahr ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen

Bei der Nullgewichtung von Staatsanleihen doktert die Politik schon lange herum. Letztlich geht es darum, ob aufsichtsrechtlich eine griechische Staatsanleihe ebenso sicher ist wie eine deutsche. Das ist in der Realität natürlich nicht so, doch das ficht die Bankenaufsicht nicht an.

Während Kredite an den Mittelstand mit 20 Prozent Eigenkapital von der Bank unterlegt werden müssen, kann eine Bank Staatsanleihen von Griechenland, Portugal oder Zypern ohne Eigenkapital in ihre Bücher nehmen.

Viele europäische Regierungen, aber auch die italienischen Autoren des FAZ-Artikels, wehren sich gegen eine Risikogewichtung. Sie vertreten die Ansicht, dass dann die folgenden Zinsunterschiede sofort wieder eine neue Krise heraufbeschwören würden.

Die Gefahr ist durchaus nicht von der Hand zu weisen. Denn die öffentliche Verschuldung in Europa ist in den letzten Jahren massiv auf über 90 Prozent der Wirtschaftskraft angestiegen.

Würden die Zinsunterschiede zwischen Italien und Deutschland wieder ansteigen, dann wäre die italienische Verschuldung nicht mehr so einfach, vielleicht gar nicht mehr zu finanzieren. Italiens Staatsschulden erklimmen Monat für Monat einen neuen Höchststand. Er liegt derzeit bei 2.300 Milliarden Euro, im Verhältnis zur Wirtschaftskraft bei 134,5 Prozent (Juli 2017).

Während die Verschuldung steigt, sinken die dafür zu zahlenden Zinsen enorm. In den 1980-Jahren betrugen die Renditen 10-jährigern Italienischer Staatsanleihen über 16 Prozent. Mit der Einführung des Euro sank die Rendite auf 6 Prozent und fiel dann auf 4 Prozent.

Mit der Eurokrise stieg das Risiko wieder auf bis zu 7 Prozent. Erst mit der Intervention der EZB trat eine Beruhigung ein. Heute rentiert die italienische Anleihe mit 2 Prozent. Diesen Zustand will Italien möglichst lange konservieren.

Sie retten sich gegenseitig

Die italienischen Autoren, aber auch die deutsch-französischen Ökonomen in abgeschwächter Form, wollen das tragende Prinzip der Marktwirtschaft von Risiko und Haftung auseinanderfallen lassen.

Wer die Einlagensicherung vereinheitlicht, sei es heute, morgen oder übermorgen, sorgt dafür, dass finnische, deutsche und niederländische Sparer für Schieflagen spanischer, griechischer oder italienischer Banken haften müssen, obwohl sie als Bürger weder auf die dortige Regierungspolitik noch auf die Geschäftspolitik der dortigen Banken irgendeinen Einfluss haben.

Vielleicht wäre es an dieser Stelle viel besser, das Absicherungsniveau in der Europäischen Richtlinie abzusenken. Denn haben Sparer mehrere Konten bei mehreren Banken, dann hängen sie über diesen Weg sehr leicht mit mehreren hunderttausend Euro mit drin.

Muss dieses Risiko über eine staatlich festgelegte Versicherung in der ganzen Europäischen Union abgesichert werden? Wer das will, kann das gerne national oder in der jeweiligen Bank selbst tun. Die Sparkassen und Volksbanken in Deutschland kennen die sogenannte Institutssicherung.

Sie retten sich gegenseitig und schützen damit die Spareinlagen ihrer Einleger faktisch unbegrenzt. Ihre Dachorganisationen überwachen die Institute, damit es zu keiner Schieflage kommt.

Die Beiträge für die Institutssicherung richten sich nach dem Risiko der Bank. Wer weniger solide wirtschaftet, zahlt mehr und umgekehrt.

Irgendwann ist auch die Zeit des free lunch vorbei

Risiko und Haftung fallen erst recht bei der Nullgewichtung der Staatsanleihen auseinander. Ein Wechsel zu einem risikogewichteten Modell ist nicht einfach, aber mit Übergangsfristen möglich und notwendig.

Ansonsten finanziert die EZB die Freibiermentalität der Euro-Staaten immer weiter. Doch irgendwann ist auch die Zeit des free lunch vorbei und die Realität kehr wieder ein. Wie groß der Kater danach ist, hängt davon ab, wie lange der Rausch angehalten hat.

Europa muss mehr Marktwirtschaft wagen - nicht weniger.

Après les témoignages d'actrices américaines et française, et l'ouverture d'une enquête policière à New York, le magnat d'Hollywood est désormais visé par une enquête au Royaume-Uni également, et a été accusé jeudi 12 octobre d'un quatrième viol.

L'actrice Rose McGowan, mentionnée par le New York Times dans l'article qui a mis le feu au poudre, a affirmé qu'elle aussi avait été violée par le producteur. Ses accusations de viol s'ajoutent à celles de la star italienne Asia Argento, de l'actrice Lucia Evans et d'une autre femme restée anonyme.

Les investigations de la police new-yorkaise se cantonnent pour l'instant à une agression sexuelle présumée remontant à 2004. L'enquête de la police britannique concerne elle une agression sexuelle qui aurait été commise dans les années 1980 dans la région de Londres.

Mais les choses ne devraient pas s'arrêter là, le producteur étant suspecté d'avoir sévi durant plusieurs décennies, obtenant à chaque fois que c'était possible le silence de ses victimes grâce à des accords de confidentialité grassement payés. Interrogée par l'AFP, la police de Los Angeles, où se trouve Hollywood, a indiqué qu'aucune enquête n'était ouverte sur Harvey Weinstein à ce stade.

Depuis les premières révélations du New York Times le 5 octobre, le producteur a vu fondre ses soutiens et a même été licencié par sa propre maison de production, The Weinstein Company.

Faits prescrits, ou pas?

Les faits étudiées par les polices britanniques et américaines remontent au moins à une dizaine d'années. Mais ""aucune plainte n'a pour l'instant été enregistrée et, comme toujours, la police de New York encourage toute personne détentrice d'éventuelles informations à le faire savoir"", a indiqué J. Peter Donald, porte-parole du New York Police Department.

Selon le quotidien new-yorkais Daily News, la police new-yorkaise cherche à recueillir des éléments concernant des accusations de l'actrice Lucia Evans, publiées mardi par le magazine américain The New Yorker. Elle assure que Harvey Weinstein l'a forcée à lui faire une fellation en 2004, à New York, ce qui relève du viol selon la loi.

Harvey Weinstein a affirmé, par la voix de sa porte-parole, que les relations sexuelles publiquement révélées étaient consenties.

La liste des femmes se disant victimes de ses abus, principalement des mannequins et actrices, parfois débutantes à l'époque, ne cesse de s'allonger: Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Judith Godrèche, Katherine Kendall, Emma de Caunes, Cara Delevingne, Ashley Judd, Léa Seydoux, Mira Sorvino, Florence Darel...

Jeudi, c'est la comédienne britannique Kate Beckinsale qui a raconté que Harvey Weinstein lui avait fait des avances dans une chambre d'hôtel, en peignoir, alors qu'elle n'avait que 17 ans.

Bataille judiciaire en vue

La bataille judiciaire qui se profile se déroulera vraisemblablement autant au civil qu'au pénal, et les proches du producteur risquent d'être eux-mêmes emportés par le grand déballage. Selon le Hollywood Reporter, Harvey Weinstein a étoffé son équipe d'avocats. Il s'est attaché les services d'une ténor du barreau de Los Angeles, Blair Berk. Cette diplômée d'Harvard a défendu des stars d'Hollywood comme Mel Gibson et Lindsay Lohan.

La question des complicités éventuelles est d'ores-et-déjà posée. Le New York Times assure que les responsables de la maison de production Weinstein étaient au courant depuis 2015 de très embarrassants accords de confidentialité liant leur patron et plusieurs femmes. Or plusieurs membres du conseil d'administration, dont le frère d'Harvey et cofondateur de la société, Bob Weinstein, ont fait part de leur ""surprise totale"" à l'éclatement du scandale.

""J'ai besoin de trouver de l'aide""

Pour la première fois depuis que l'affaire a été révélée, l'homme de 65 ans a été vu alors qu'il sortait mercredi après-midi de la maison de sa fille à Los Angeles. Interpellé par les paparazzi sur son moral, le faiseur de stars a concédé: ""Je ne vais pas fort. Mais j'essaie. J'ai besoin de trouver de l'aide"".

""Je tiens bon, je fais de mon mieux"", a ajouté Harvey Weinstein, vêtu d'un jean et d'un tee-shirt foncé. ""On fait tous des erreurs. J'espère une seconde chance"", a-t-il poursuivi avant de s'engouffrer dans une grosse voiture de type 4x4. Selon le site people TMZ, le mécène démocrate s'est ensuite envolé pour l'Arizona, où il a intégré un centre de traitement de la dépendance sexuelle.

L'actrice Tippi Hedren qui a tourné dans ""Les Oiseaux"" d'Alfred Hitchcock a rappelé jeudi qu'elle avait subi le même type de harcèlement, il y a 50 ans, de la part du célèbre réalisateur. Hitchcock ""m'a dit qu'il ruinerait ma carrière et je lui ai dit de faire ce qu'il voulait. Cela a pris 50 ans mais il est temps que les femmes se défendent"", a-t-elle déclaré sur son compte Twitter.

I write to you regarding your remuneration for the 2018 AFL season, in which you intend to play with the Geelong Football Club.

It's an exciting and romantic prospect. A bit like your mum and dad getting back together after a divorce. One day you realise that the tanned Argentinian tennis coach (The Gold Coast Football Club in this analogy, and yes Gary, you are Mum) wasn't the love match you'd thought it would be -- compared to the strong, familiar arms of Dad (Geelong).

Please understand I am in no way affiliated with the club. I'm not even a paid member. I am just a keen supporter who drives past Kardinia Park each day, dreaming dreams and pontificating schemes.

My biggest concern is this thing may not happen for financial reasons. So I propose to outline a case on why you should play for free. If you agree, this will allow Dad to pay out the Tennis Coach your share of the house you built together...

Confused?

What I'm suggesting is Geelong pays out your 2018 Gold Coast contract in cash, fruit from Frank Costa or the tears of Joel Selwood (which are so rare they are worth more than BitCoin) or a combination of all three, and you come play with us for free.

Good idea, right?

Here are some compelling reasons why playing for Geelong is worth doing for nothing.

Geelong is cool now. Our coffee is off the hook, our restaurants are now on lists and we even have a brewery where people with beards can work. My mate Mike opened a barbers shop and he's got tattoos! Not that you'd need his services, but he has assured me if you come back, Get Shorty's will start offering head polishes.

I know you are a man of God, so we have you covered there. My church will put you up and even offer you the comfort of an upgraded massage physiotherapy chair to aid recovery. Should you have a Sunday game, we'll be happy to move a service to match your schedule.

Your friend Zac Smith is down at the club. Who wouldn't want to work with their good mate? Personally, I wouldn't -- my mate Mick is the only person I know who is taller than me -- so if he were around my office I wouldn't have that strange tallest-person-in-the-room-power I've become so used to.

In regards to your number, we have a few options. Cam Guthrie feels he has made the number 29 his own and won't give it up. He feels the same way about his hair though. Nakia Cockatoo could move down a step to Andrew Mackie's vacated number four giving you access to Senior's number. But if you're like me, you don't want to dress too much like your Dad so, can I suggest we use 00. It's unique. Plus, if you get mud flecks in the middle of each zero it would look like intimidating eyes.

Post footy, your employment prospects are looking better down here than when your old man and Billy Brownless were kicking around. Our major employers are now the likes of Cotton On Group. I know Joel has a sweet gig out there as an 'Ambassador' so I'm sure they could hook you up as Visual Merchandiser and throw you a few free pairs of carrot jeans.

Housing is much more affordable down here compared to the major cities, but a man of your means could afford anything along the Great Ocean Road. You could afford to buy the entire great ocean and its associated road if you wanted. Living down there seems to have worked for Danger. He may not like someone getting in on that football-recluse-from-the-sand-dunes vibe that he has going on though.

Ford will hook you up with a car, too. They still sponsor the Cats. I was thinking something low profile and unsuspecting, so you can get to and from the Aldi carpark without getting noticed. Maybe a Fiesta? Or even better still a Transit, so that you can be designated driver on Taco Tuesdays.

The best reason why you should choose to play for free? Because it would be revolutionary for a player to play AFL in 2018 purely for the love of the game and club. But then maybe that's the romantic in me. I'm hoping there's one in you too.",Why Gary Ablett Jnr Should Play At Geelong Next Year For Free,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/lach-ryan/why-gary-ablett-jnr-should-play-at-geelong-next-year-for-free_a_23241952/

The director starts the note by explaining he was discussing the allegations against Weinstein with female friends and was horrified by how casually the women spoke of abuse they’ve endured.

″And then another round of stories started, of these women being grabbed and molested and abused by bosses and managers and agents,” Gunn said. “And then another round started: endless incidents of these women being subject to the unsolicited sexual advances of men, ranging from your every day entitled Hollywood scumbucket douchebag to attempted rape.”

Gunn criticized “everyone who enabled [Weinstein] to get away with such behavior.”

The 65-year-old Weinstein was fired from his own production company on Sunday night, but many have criticized the board of The Weinstein Company for not acting sooner amid years of rumors about his behavior. The New York Times set off the furor with a story last Thursday that detailed numerous allegations of sexual harassment by Weinstein spanning decades. The article said Weinstein had agreed to at least eight private settlements with women.

A former New York Times reporter, Sharon Waxman, claims that while working for the paper in 2004, she tracked down evidence of Weinstein’s misconduct. But, Waxman said, pressure from the influential filmmaker and actors Matt Damon and Russell Crowe resulted in her story being “gutted.”

Gunn, in his post, said that while Hollywood was “rife” with sexual predators, it’s widespread “EVERYWHERE.”

“When someone is coerced sexually it not only affects that person, but the lives of those around that person, like rows of dominoes falling in every direction,” Gunn said. “It demolishes trust and comfort in all of society.

Twenty families were first allegedly boycotted, then threatened and turned away from their homes even as police continued to look for two men who killed a Rajasthani folk singer in Jaisalmer's Danta village.

The entire episode started when during Navaratri, a faith healer, Ramesh Suthar, complained that Amad Khan, a singer from the Manganiyar community of Muslim folk singers, did not sing the Raag Parcha correctly because of which he could not reach a state of trance during a ritual.

Reports suggest that on the same night, Suthar and two of his relatives, Shyam Ram and Tara Ram, allegedly dragged Khan out of his house and killed him. His body was found in the temple next morning, after which his family silently buried him.

Ramesh Suthar, who belongs to an upper caste Hindu community, and others from his community allegedly threatened others of the Manganiyar community in the Danta village and forced 20 families to leave the village and seek refuge with their relatives in Balad.

The incident has put the spotlight on the Manganiyar's of Rajasthan – a Muslim community that has been singing praises of Hindu gods for generations.

Manganiyars originate from Rajasthan's Jaisalmer and Barmer, and in Pakistan's Sindh province.

Though they are Muslims, for centuries they have been singing peans of Hindu gods.

Shalini Ayyagari, an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkely, writes in her dissertation, Small Voices Sing Big Songs: Music and Institutional Culture in Western Rajasthan:

""Customarily the Manganiyar, a community considered to have been extremely low caste and lacking voice and class mobility, have provided family genealogies and ceremonial music to their hereditary patrons for remuneration for at least the past three centuries. They have been affiliated not only with individual patron families, but entire family lineages over many generations through social and economic co-dependence. With modernization the importance of these customary patronage relationships is waning and in their location, development initiatives, cultural tourism, and more modern modes of musical production are filling in, pointing to new ways of understanding the ways in which cultural subjectivities can be imagined and inscribed through music. ""

Manganiyars have lived under the patronage of Hindu landlords and nobility for years.

They pass on their singing tradition from generation to generation and are said to have been entertainers in courts of Rajput princess. They even travelled with them to war to provide entertainment.

The genre of Rajasthani folk music sung by them is world famous.

The Hindu in a report about the community says that while till 1950 their music was confined to only Rajasthan, with the help of an activist, Komal Kothari, groups of singers and performers from the community have travelled far and wide in India and outside.

Caroline. Cole. Christian. Tous ne possédaient qu'une vision minime et étaient condamnés à la perdre en raison d'une maladie héréditaire de l'œil pour laquelle on ne disposait d'aucun traitement — jusqu'à maintenant.

Un comité de la puissante Food and Drug Administration des États-Unis a recommandé à l'unanimité, au cours des derniers jours, l'approbation une nouvelle thérapie génique qui a amélioré la vue de ces trois jeunes et d'autres touchés par une cécité héréditaire.

Il s'agit de la première thérapie génique autorisée aux États-Unis pour soigner une maladie héréditaire, et la première lors de laquelle un gène de correction est administré directement au patient. La seule autre thérapie génique actuellement disponible aux États-Unis est un traitement contre le cancer qui a été autorisé en août et qui reprogramme les cellules sanguines du patient en laboratoire.

Cole Carper, qui a été traité à l'âge de 8 ans et qui en a maintenant 11, a raconté comment sa vision a changé sa perception du monde. Quand il est rentré chez lui à Little Rock, dans l'Arkansas, «j'ai regardé vers le haut et j'ai dit, 'Quelles sont ces petites choses brillantes?', et ma mère m'a dit, 'ce sont des étoiles'».

Sa sœur Caroline a été soignée à l'âge de 10 ans. Elle raconte qu'ensuite, «J'ai vu la neige tomber et la pluie tomber. J'ai été complètement surprise. Je savais qu'il y avait de l'eau au sol et de la neige au sol. Je n'avais jamais imaginé que ça tombait», puisque le ciel était quelque chose qu'elle ne pouvait pas voir — comme le sourire de sa mère.

Christian Guardino a tellement ébloui les juges d'«America's Got Talent» qu'ils lui ont octroyé le «golden buzzer» — et il a pu voir la pluie de confettis dorés qui s'est ensuite abattue sur lui.

Le traitement Luxturna est fabriqué par Spark Therapeutics, une firme de Philadelphie. Il ne fournit pas une vision 20/20 et ne fonctionne pas pour tout le monde, mais une étude financée par l'entreprise a constaté qu'il améliore la vision de pratiquement tous les récipiendaires et qu'il semble sécuritaire.

«C'est excitant» et dans certains cas on peut envisager une guérison, mais on ne sait pas combien de temps dureront les bienfaits, a dit le docteur Paul Yang, un ophtalmologue du centre médical de l'Université de l'Oregon qui teste les thérapies géniques d'autres compagnies. «Il n'y a rien d'autre pour ces enfants.»

La thérapie a des implications plus larges, mais elle a été testée pour l'amaurose congénitale de Leber (ACL), qui est provoquée par la défaillance du gène RPE65. Ceux qui en souffrent sont incapables de produire une protéine dont a besoin la rétine, le tissu à l'arrière de l'œil qui convertit la lumière en signaux que le cerveau peut interpréter. Les patients ne voient souvent qu'une lumière embrouillée ou des formes floues, et éventuellement ils perdent la vue.

Le gène défectueux peut passer inaperçu pendant des générations, puis s'activer quand un enfant malchanceux en reçoit deux copies.

«C'est habituellement une surprise (pour les parents) d'avoir un enfant aveugle», a dit la docteur Jean Bennett, qui a mis la thérapie à l'essai à l'Hôpital pour enfants de Philadelphie.

La docteure Bennett et son mari, le docteur Albert Maguire, ont conçu une course à obstacles pour tester les enfants après le traitement, et la FDA a estimé que cela constituait une mesure valide de l'efficacité de la thérapie.

«Le labyrinthe était en fait l'idée d'Al, a dit le docteur Bennett. Je l'ai assemblé dans notre entrée de garage», en utilisant des tuiles blanches avec des flèches, des rouleaux de mousse et des cônes. Des tuiles noires simulaient les trous que devaient éviter les enfants.

Lors de l'intervention d'une durée de 45 minutes, le médecin perce la partie blanche de l'œil et y injecte un virus modifié qui transporte le gène de correction jusqu'à la rétine. Les bienfaits apparaissent au cours du mois suivant.

Dix-huit des 20 participants à l'étude avaient amélioré leur performance dans le labyrinthe un an plus tard. Les deux autres ne disposaient possiblement plus de suffisamment de cellules rétiniennes pour répondre à la thérapie: l'un d'entre eux a mieux fait lors d'autres tests et la condition du dernier a cessé de se détériorer.

La FDA doit décider, d'ici le 12 janvier, si elle approuve formellement le Luxturna.

Der renommierte Paarforscher John Gottman hat eine Formel entwickelt, mit der er erkennt, ob eine Beziehung zum Scheitern verurteilt ist

Anhand von vier Anzeichen kann er in nur wenigen Minuten den Fortgang einer Beziehung fast zu 100 Prozent genau vorhersagen

Wenn Paare beschließen zu heiraten, tun sie das meistens mit der Überzeugung, dass die Liebe bis an ihr Lebensende halten wird. Doch bei einem erheblichen Teil von ihnen trennen sich die Wege, lange bevor der Tod sie scheidet.

In Deutschland etwa werden 35 Prozent der Ehen in den ersten 25 Jahren geschieden.

Was aber machen Paare richtig, deren Vorstellung einer glücklichen, andauernden Ehe Realität wird? Gibt es so etwas wie eine geheime Liebesformel?

Der Psychologe und Paarforscher John Gottman geht diesen Fragen bereits seit Jahrzehnten nach - und sagt: Ja, eine solche Formel gibt es. Mit der Zeit hat er ein Muster erkannt, nach dem Beziehungen funktionieren.

Jahrzehntelange Paarforschung

Weltweit bekannt wurde Gottman durch die Erwähnung in Malcolm Gladwells 2006 erschienenen Bestseller ""Blink”. Das Buch behandelt die Frage, wie Bauchgefühl das menschliche Handeln bestimmt.

Der Autor und Journalist beschreibt Gottmans Vorgehensweise am Beispiel des jungen Paares Susan und Bill.

Für die Versuchsanordnung werden die Beiden an einen Tisch gesetzt. Dann sollen sie ein belangloses Gespräch beginnen und unterhalten sich über ihren gemeinsamen Hund. Nach 15 Minuten wird das Gespräch gestoppt.

Gottman saß währenddessen hinter einer Scheibe und hat die beiden beobachtet. “Die Beiden werden sich trennen”, urteilt Gottman, ohne lange zu überlegen.

Eine ziemlich gewagte Aussage nach gerade mal 15 Minuten Gespräch, werden die meisten jetzt sagen. Doch der Psychologe liegt mit seinen Schätzungen zum Fortgang von Liebesbeziehungen mit durchschnittlich 94 Prozent so gut wie immer richtig.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 29 intime Fotos zeigen, wie wahre Leidenschaft zwischen zwei Menschen aussieht

In seinem Forschungsinstitut The Gottman Relationship Institute an der University of Wahington in Seattle, das er selbst “das Liebeslabor” nennt, analysiert er seit den 70er Jahren mit Video und Mikrosensoren Gespräche zwischen Paaren.

Anhand der Analyse von Mimik und Gestik, dem Verhalten in Konfliksituationen und Blutdruckwerten entwickelte er über die Jahrzehnte ein Muster für die Interaktion von Paaren. Er ist überzeugt, sichere Anzeichen dafür identifiziert zu haben, dass eine Beziehung scheitern wird.

Das sind Gottmans vier ""apokalyptische Reiter"":

1. Verallgemeinernde Kritik: Der Partner richtet häufig Sätze an den anderen, die “immer” oder “nie” beinhalten. (“Nie hörst du mir zu” oder “Ich muss immer alles alleine machen.”)

2. Verachtung: Das beginnt mit abwertenden Kommentaren zur Meinung des Partners, und reicht über Sarkasmus, Spott, Abfälligkeit bis hin zu Beschimpfungen. Verachtung ist laut Gottman die schädlichste Kommunikationsform für eine Beziehung.

3. Rechtfertigung: Aussagen wie: “Ja, aber…” deuten auf ein defensives Verhalten hin und zeigen, dass jemand keine Verantwortung übernehmen möchte.

4. Rückzug: Bei Konflikten, aber auch in Alltagssituationen gehen die Partner nicht aufeinander ein und scheuen sich, die Sicht des anderen einzunehmen und wertzuschätzen.

Anhand dieser Erkenntnisse urteilte Gottman auch bei Susan und Bill, dass das Ende der Beziehung bevorstand.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese 4 Dinge zerstören nicht nur eure Beziehung, sondern schaden auch der Karriere

An dem 15 minütigen Gespräch erkannte der Psychologe: Offensichtlich spürte Susan eine tiefere Verbundenheit zu ihrem Hund als zu ihrem Mann. Er wiederum hatte das Gefühl, das Tier beeinträchtige das Sozialleben des Paares.

Indizien, die ihn laut Gladwells Buch zu diesem Ergebnis kommen ließen, waren: Susan reagierte mit kaum merklichen Augenrollen, einer verachtenden Geste, woraufhin Bill in den Verteidigungsmodus ging.

Aussagen von ihm wie ""Ich verstehe dich, aber..."" führten dazu, dass ihr Ärger größer wurde - und das verstärkte seine wiederum seine abwehrende Haltung mehr und mehr.

Obwohl die beiden bestimmt nicht der Ansicht waren, dass es sich um einen richtigen Streit handelte, stand für Gottman die Sache fest. Für ihn war die Beziehung am Ende, lange, bevor die Beiden selbst sich dessen bewusst waren.

Ob die Liebe zwischen Susan und Bill tatsächlich zerbrach oder nicht, geht aus “Blink” leider nicht hervor.

""Man kommt einfach bei der vielen Arbeit nicht dazu"", mögen Führungskräfte nun entgegnen. Dabei fragt man sich, was man dagegen tun könnte und eine Vielzahl an Strategien wie Team-Meetings, Rederunden und feste Zeiten sind möglich, doch eine der besten Lösungen ist die Weihnachtsfeier - eine gut geplante Feier! Auf einer solchen Feier begegnen sich beide Gruppen auf Augenhöhe und haben die Chance, sich ganz neu kennenzulernen.

Eine Weihnachtsfeier ist langweilig, aber Pflicht!

Kaum etwas ist so langweilig wie die alljährlich wiederkehrende Weihnachtsfeier der Firma. Warum? Weil es in jedem Jahr das Gleiche ist: Das gleiche Buffet, dieselbe langweilige Stimmung und dasselbe Gefühl, es nicht abwarten zu können, nach Hause zu kommen. Wenn man es sich aussuchen könnte, dann würde man Zuhause bleiben, doch die Pflicht ruft und so erscheint man Abends und hofft, es möge schnell vorbei sein.

Doch in allem Negativen steckt auch etwas Positives. So kann die Überzeugung der meisten Mitarbeiter über die Weihnachtsfeier dazu genutzt werden, um sich bei der Planung besondere Mühe zu geben. Dazu gehört auch, dass die Weihnachtsfeier als ein wichtiges Event wahrgenommen wird, dass die Beziehung und die Kommunikation zwischen der Führungsebene und den Mitarbeitern verbessern kann. Denn in den meisten Unternehmen herrscht gerade zwischen Führung und Nicht-Führung Funkstille. Daher kann eine solche Feier besonders deren Kommunikation fördern und somit das Unternehmen an sich bereichern.

Überwindet eine Weihnachtsfeier interne Hierarchien?

Der gemeinsame Fokus liegt auf Weihnachten und die Weihnachtsfeier ist das verbindende Element, dass alle Gäste an diesem Abend zusammenschweißt.

Hierbei wird das allzu oft zitierte ""Kompetenzgerangel"" beiseite gelassen. Es geht nicht darum, wer besser oder wichtiger ist. Denn damit kommt es zu keiner guten Feier. Doch wenn sich alle gemeinsam auf ein und dasselbe Ziel konzentrieren und sich darauf freuen, dann, ja dann kann eine Weihnachtsfeier interne Hierarchien überwinden.

Man nennt das auch ""Team Fokus"", indem sich viele Menschen auf ein und dasselbe Ziel konzentrieren. Statt gegeneinander zu arbeiten, arbeiten die Mitarbeiter miteinander und somit entsteht während der Feier eine Art Zusammengehörigkeitsgefühl. Gerade dieses Gefühl beflügelt einen jeden, die bisher gesetzten Schranken zu überwinden und sich als Teil der unternehmerischen Gemeinschaft zu sehen. Denn Hierarchien überwindet man nur dann, wenn man sich gemeinsam auf ein Ziel konzentriert und miteinander arbeitet - für das Wohl aller Beteiligten.

Das Interesse steigt, wenn man Gemeinsamkeiten hat

Erst durch ein Event abseits des normalen Arbeitsalltags lernt man den jeweils anderen Kollegen persönlich kennen. Denn wenn man ehrlich zu sich selbst ist, dann weiß man, dass auf der Arbeit nicht viel Raum für die persönliche Entfaltung ist. Und wenn man sich nicht persönlich entfalten kann, können andere die eigene Persönlichkeit nicht erkennen. Ein Versteckspiel für beide Seiten - leider.

Dinge, die die eigene Persönlichkeit ausmachen und Nichts mit der Arbeit zu tun haben, werden nur dann geäußert, wenn sich die Umstände ändern. Normalerweise ist dies bei Veranstaltungen der Fall. Wenn es keine Terminfrist gibt und man das Gefühl hat, dass alle entspannt sind, dann kann man sich leichter und eher fallen lassen.

Somit zeigt man sich seinen Mitmenschen von einer anderen Seite und gibt ihnen die Gelegenheit, einen selbst kennenzulernen. Unter Umständen - und das ist das Wünschenswerte dabei - tauscht man sich über Gemeinsamkeiten aus, die ein Grundstein einer Beziehung sein können.

Es könnte durch ein Gespräch dazu kommen, dass man von seiner Kollegin erfährt, dass sie gerne Bücher von Jane Austin liest und sich für alte Obstsorten interessiert. Selbst wenn es wie Zufall wirken mag, so kann es passieren, dass ein Kollege die Leidenschaft für Jane Austin Bücher teilt und schon ist das Eis gebrochen und man fühlt sich wohler, weil man etwas hat, worüber man miteinander reden kann. Denn Smalltalk ist auf Dauer schlicht langweilig und ermüdend - für beide Seiten.

""Ach, das sind Ihre Kinder?"", fragte er erstaunt

Man nutzt die Chance, sich über die Kinder kennenzulernen. Durchaus kann es passieren, dass zu einer Firmen-Weihnachtsfeier die Kinder der Mitarbeiter eingeladen werden dürfen. Als positiver Nebeneffekt entsteht dadurch eine familiäre Atmosphäre und die Eltern müssen sich keine Sorgen machen, ob es ihren Kindern gutgeht oder nicht.

Ebenso kann es im Laufe des Abends dazu führen, dass die Kinder eines Kollegen auch des eigenen Chefs sich mit den Kindern eines Mitarbeiters gut verstehen und mit ihnen spielen. Man lernt sich also darüber kennen, dass die Kinder zuerst eine Brücke der Kommunikation schlagen. Urplötzlich stellt man fest, dass man hinsichtlich der Kindererziehung dieselben Prioritäten besitzt und erkennt, dass man diese Gemeinsamkeiten auch im Arbeitsalltag umsetzen könnte, sofern man den Kontakt aufrechterhält.

Die Führungskräfte können sich mal entspannen

Man ist dem Dresscode nicht unterworfen und die Mitarbeiter sehen sie als ebenbürtig an, weil keine Krawatten und Anzüge getragen werden. Denn es kann durchaus sein, dass ich Mitarbeiter von Anzügen und Krawatten eingeschüchtert fühlen und sich wohler fühlen, ihren Chef anzusprechen, wenn sich dieser auf eine Weise kleidet, der keine Hierarchien ausdrückt. Es verringert daher die Hemmschwelle, womit man offener aufeinander zu geht.

Die Führungskräfte müssen an diesem Abend nicht alles kontrollieren und müssen auch nicht alles im Blick haben, sondern sie sind ein Teil der Feier und können sich mal einfach fallen lassen. Statt wie gewohnt, außen vor zu stehen. Denn als Chef ist man es gewohnt, alles im Blick haben zu müssen und nicht abschalten zu dürfen. Für so manchen Chef ist es eine Bürde, denn er muss es erst wieder üben, sich fallen zu lassen und die Verantwortung auf alle anderen abzugeben und ihnen zu vertrauen.

Urplötzlich plaudern die Mitarbeiter

Bei der Arbeit ist normalerweise keine Zeit für Themen, die Nichts mit der Arbeit zu tun haben. Denn sie kosten Zeit und Geld und das sind Ressourcen, die man nicht verschwenden kann und will. Je wohler sich die Mitarbeiter fühlen, weil die Weihnachtsfeier toll organisiert worden ist und weil großartige Unterhaltung an diesem Abend stattfindet, desto selbstbewusster reden sie darüber, was sie mögen, was sie denken und sind offener. Dadurch erkennen Führungskräfte, dass ihre Mitarbeiter etwas zu sagen haben, wenn sie es sich zutrauen.

Denn nur so kann man sich gegenseitig kennenlernen, wenn man sich präsentieren kann in Form eines offenen Gesprächs. Die geladenen Gäste und Mitarbeiter müssen das Gefühl haben, dass nicht bewertet wird, was sie sagen. Dies ist zuweilen nur dann möglich, wenn eine ausgelassene Stimmung zwischen allen Gästen herrscht. Denn dann weiß man auch, dass sie entspannt genug sind und auch die Zeit haben, das Gesagte zu verstehen und nicht nur wie typisch, ein Teil des Flurfunks sind.

There are many types of chronic pain that are known and probably many others that research hasn't discovered yet. One form of chronic pain is 'Pain Disorder' which is thought to be established purely by psychological means.

What Is Pain Disorder?

Pain Disorder is a form of chronic pain that is thought to be driven by psychological distress. Pain Disorder is complex both in its manifestation in the body and in its definition.

In basic terms, a person has Pain Disorder when all other avenues of diagnosis have been ruled out and the pain the person is experiencing is believed to be driven by psychological stress over anything else.

""When there is no clear mental illness driving the pain and when there is no clear physical cause that is driving it that is observable, then it falls under the pain disorder bracket,"" neuroscientist Dr Bernadette Fitzgibbon, a National Health and Medical Research Council fellow told HuffPost Australia.

Just because you can't see it in a scan or your can't make sense of it doesn't make it any less real for the individual who lives with it.

Fitzgibbon also says that it's important to note that Pain Disorder is not caused by mental illness, even though it currently sits under the mental health diagnostic criteria. If a person is experiencing pain driven by a mental illness, this pain will be diagnosed as part of that already existing problem. In fact, this is the case with any other diagnosis that might involve chronic pain, like Fibromyalgia or Arthritis. Where there is a definite diagnosis, the pain is classified as part of that disorder.

Pain Disorder is diagnosed when all diagnostic avenues have been exhausted. This doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't a psychological cause for the pain, it's just that researchers and clinicians may not understand where the pain in coming from at this stage. This is where the complexity of Pain Disorder's definition and cause comes into play.

What Causes Pain Disorder?

The cause of Pain Disorder itself is unclear, which forms part of the reason why people are diagnosed with it. While this is both ambiguous and confusing, using trauma as an example can help clarify how this type of chronic pain can develop and how there can be missing links between initial events in a person's life and how pain can then manifest elsewhere in the body.

""When you look at something like trauma not everybody who has a trauma develops PTSD and not everyone who has a trauma has a chronic pain,"" Fitzgibbon explained.

""When it comes to pain there is a higher rate of people who have a history of trauma who have chronic pain later on. Now that doesn't necessarily mean that it is purely psychologically driven like a pain disorder might infer because having a trauma can execute your nervous system's response to stimuli that you are experiencing in day-to-day life.

""There is something that has happened in your life and your nervous system has responded to the psychological stress and it has responded in a way that has made it heightened, more responded, more reactive.""

You need to have a multi-modality, a multi-disciplinary approach to treat persistent pain problems.

Professor Mark Hutchinson from University Of Adelaide explains this with another example.

""The classic story we often hear is someone is having a rough trot at work and then they go and try and pick up a box at work and they do their back, they go on workers comp and suddenly their back injury --which every other Joe would be fine [with] -- suddenly one case of a little twinge of a back turns into a massive long term or back injury,"" Hutchinson told HuffPost Australia.

""The rates of pain in those people who have ongoing life problems are much higher than someone who isn't experiencing that.""

So essentially, it is well established in medicine that there is a connection between trauma and chronic pain like Pain Disorder, however, the way in which these are connected remains unclear.

People with on-going life problems are more likely to experience chronic pain.

Is It Most Common In Men Or Women?

""Women absolutely outnumber men in persistent pain presentation,"" Hutchinson said.

""What is interesting is that the rates of persistent pain in boys and girls are almost identical. As soon as puberty kicks in, girls turning into women rapidly increase their rates of persistent pain so we know that there is a hormonal component to it.""

As for Pain Disorder specifically, there are no exact numbers as to how many people have it, as it is so difficult to define.

How Is It Managed?

Pain Disorder is incredibly difficult to diagnose, as often evidence of the pain doesn't show up on scans or in tests. As there is no cure for Pain Disorder, the treatment focuses on managing the pain.

""You need to have a multi-modality, a multi-disciplinary approach to treat persistent pain problems,"" Hutchinson said.

Managing Pain Disorder requires a multi-disciplinary approach.

This means Pain Disorder treatments involve consulting a range of professionals including pain specialists, psychologists, pharmacologists, physical therapists or occupational therapists.

Fitzgibbon also told HuffPost Australia that psychology can be a key way to manage Pain Disorder.

""They are treated in a variety of different ways and the stand out treatments would be Cognitive Behaviour Therapy where you are dressing someone's thinking profiles and trying to improve the way that they cope with incoming information,"" Fitzgibbon said.

Other treatment types like massage, mindfulness and medication can be used to ease the condition, while surgical solutions are used in last resort cases.

CBT and mindfulness are two common treatments for Pain Disorder.

The fact is, chronic pain problems like Pain Disorder are serious medical conditions that affect a person's quality of life. Both Fitzgibbon and Hutchinson say that simply because scans or tests return clear, doesn't mean that the pain doesn't exist.

""The fear of treating or acknowledging the presence of a persistent pain when there is 'nothing' -- and I am doing air quotes here -- 'nothing' wrong with the person simply because a scan didn't come up positive. It doesn't gel with the modern understanding of where pain originates from,"" Hutchinson said.

""Pain itself is real with or without something to show it,"" Fitzgibbon said. ""If somebody says they are in pain and they are feeling pain and that is real for them, then it is a real thing.

""Just because you can't see it in a scan or your can't make sense of it doesn't make it any less real for the individual who lives with it.""",Pain Disorder : Chronic Pain With No Explanation,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/12/pain-disorder-chronic-pain-with-no-explanation_a_23240605/

Calls to the dedicated phone number for Universal Credit cost up to 55p per minute from some mobiles, while calls to an HMRC number for self-described tax avoiders cost up to 40p per minute.

Labour’s shadow treasury chief secretary Peter Dowd accused the government of being “on the side of tax dodgers and not hard working families”.

HuffPost UK Calls to the Universal Credit helpline cost claimants up to 55p per minute, more than tax avoiders calling HMRC

It comes as the government on Thursday was forced into an embarrassing backtrack after admitting Universal Credit claimants did need to call a costly helpline to receive welfare payments.

That admission followed just a day after the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said claimants could manage accounts entirely online, and only after HuffPost UK confronted officials with detailed accounts of hardship caused by phone fees.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged Theresa May at Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions to “show humanity” and scrap the call fees, a move Downing Street has thus far resisted.

But now HuffPost has found those who describe themselves as tax avoiders and wish to discuss their tax status with HMRC are asked to call a special 0300 helpline.

0300 numbers count towards inclusive minutes on phone contracts, and cost up to 40p per minute for pay as you go users, according to a government call charge list.

HM Government 'Phone HMRC if you're in a tax avoidance scheme and want to leave,' the government's website advises

As an 0345 number, the Universal Credit helpline can count as inclusive minutes for phone contracts, and costs up to 55p per minute for pay as you go users.

Universal Credit claimants who contacted HuffPost this week said they couldn’t afford a monthly phone contract with inclusive minutes, or didn’t have good enough credit to apply for one.

Dowd, MP for Bootle, said: “The stark contrast between the amount HMRC charges for tax avoiders calling for advice and families who are struggling to access Universal Credit is sadly indicative of this out of touch Conservative Government, who find themselves once again on the side of tax dodgers and not hard working families.”

In an earlier defence of the call fees, a spokesperson for the prime minister said there was an option for a callback “straight away” for those Universal Credit claimants concerned about costs.

But HuffPost revealed on Wednesday how the request of a call back “straight away” was refused after a reporter who tested the helpline spent 12 and a half minutes of waiting on hold.

After eventually reaching an advisor, the reporter was told an immediate call back was not possible due to data protection rules.

In the end, the 12-and-a-half minute call would have cost as much as £7.51 to someone calling from a mobile.

That’s more than 11 percent of the weekly allowance of someone aged under 25 without children.

And claimants have said they are forced to rely on the helpline to set up accounts and make simple changes to appointments.

Donna Plant, 33, from Walsall told HuffPost: “To do anything, to set up, to make an appointment you have to ring the Universal Credit line.

“If you can’t attend an appointment you have to ring the helpline.

“The job centre don’t really do anything any more. There is no other option.”

Letters sent to people requesting them to call the helpline and seen by HuffPost do not outline alternative options to manage Universal Credit accounts.

Many said they had got rid of landline phones, which provide cheaper call rates but often require line rental, in a bid to cut costs.

And the head of the Public and Commerical Services Union Mark Serwotka told BBC Radio 4′s World at One that job centre closures were making matters worse.

“What I am absolutely against is that you make assumptions that everybody can use the technology, or use the telephone lines, often where there are huge delays aside from the cost,” Serwotka said.

A spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said: “Most people claim Universal Credit online, but for those who want to call us, they are charged at local rates which are free for many people as part of their call package. People can request a call back at no charge.”",Universal Credit Claimants Charged More Than Tax Avoiders To Call Government,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/universal-credit-claimants-charged-more-for-helpline-than-tax-avoiders_n_18260316.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Επιθυμία της ήταν η κηδεία της να γίνει στον Καθεδρικό της Ουψάλα, της πόλης που μεγάλωσε και αγάπησε.
Η οικογένεια μου έχασε και την τιμή της και την κόρη της.","Είχε αρχίσει να βραδιάζει όταν περάσαμε τον ποταμό Φύρι και σταθήκαμε για λίγο σε μία πολύ μικρή πλατεία έτσι ώστε να ακούσουμε δύο λόγια από τον καθηγητή μας . Αμέσως μετά θα πηγαίναμε για φαγητό και ανυπομονούσαμε να τελειώσει η ημέρα μας εκεί αλλά δεν ξέραμε ότι η ιστορία και το όνομα της πλατείας θα μας συντρόφευε για αρκετές ώρες μετά. Το όνομα της πλατείας ήταν Fadimes plats, δηλαδή η πλατεία της Fadime. Η σύντομη ιστορία της Φαντιμέ άνοιξε μία μακρυά και έντονη συζήτηση εκείνο το βράδυ στο τραπέζι μας όπως ακριβώς εκείνη που άνοιξε πριν 15 χρόνια στη Σουηδία και εξακολουθεί να τη στοιχειώνει ως μία ιστορία ντροπής και φόβου.

H Φαντιμέ έφτασε στη Σουηδία όταν ήταν εφτά ετών. Καταγόταν από το Ελμπιστάν, ένα κουρδικό χωριό στη Νοτιοανατολική Τουρκία. Ο πατέρας της Ραχμί είχε μεταναστεύσει στην Ουψάλα λίγα χρόνια νωρίτερα και η οικογένεια τον ακολούθησε στα μέσα της δεκαετίας του '80.

«Το σχολείο και η εκπαίδευση ήταν καλή για την οικογένεια μου μόνο εφόσον μάθαινα να γράφω και να διαβάζω. Θεωρούσαν ότι η ανώτερη εκπαίδευση δεν προοριζόταν για εμένα. Σκοπός ήταν να ολοκληρώσω το σχολείο και να γυρίσω στο χωριό για να παντρευτώ κάποιον Κούρδο. Τον Κούρδο που θα έχουν επιλέξει αυτοί για εμένα. Όταν έφτασα στη Σουηδία και ξεκίνησα το σχολείο, οι γονείς μου μού έλεγαν να μην παίζω με τους συμμαθητές μου που ήταν από τη Σουηδία και να γυρίζω αμέσως μετά το σχολείο στο σπίτι».

Η Φαντιμέ στα 18 της γνώρισε και ερωτεύτηκε τον Σουηδό -Ιρανό Πάτρικ Λιντεσος. Κρύβονταν για έναν ολόκληρο χρόνο από την οικογένεια της ώσπου ξαφνικά τους είδε ο πατέρας της στο κέντρο της Ουψάλα. Χτύπησε και τους δύο ενώ τόσο ο πατέρας της όσο και ο δεκαεξάχρονος αδερφός της απείλησαν το ζευγάρι ότι θα το σκοτώσουν. Η Φαντιμέ και ο Πάτρικ έκαναν μήνυση στην οικογένεια και αποφάσισαν να μετακομίσουν στην περιοχή του Sundsvall.



«Η πρώτη αντίδραση του πατέρα μου ήταν να μας χτυπήσει. Πίστευε ότι ο ρόλος του σωστού πατέρα ήταν να υπερασπίζεται και να προστατεύει την τιμή της κόρης του. Υπέθεσε ότι ο Πάτρικ κι εγώ είχαμε σεξουαλικές σχέσεις. Για τη κουλτούρα του, ήταν σημαντικό να είμαι παρθένα. Υπάρχει ακόμα η παράδοση με το σημάδι από το αίμα στο σεντόνι. Για την οικογένεια μου, ο σκοπός της ζωής μου ήταν να παντρευτώ κάποιον Κούρδο. Από ένα καλό κορίτσι κούρδικης οικογένειας είχα μεταμορφωθεί σε μία ξετσίπωτη που είχε παρασυρθεί από τη ζωή των Σουηδών και τους είχα προδώσει. Αποφάσισα να κόψω τις επαφές με την οικογένεια μου και να μετακομίσω στο Sundsvall. Ο αδερφός μου με βρήκε και με απείλησε. Η κατάσταση πήγαινε από το κακό στο χειρότερο. Ο λόγος για τον οποίο στέλνανε τον ανήλικο αδερφό μου ήταν γιατί ο νόμος δεν θα τιμωρούσε λόγω της ηλικίας του»

Λίγες ημέρες πριν φύγουν με τον Πάτρικ, ο σύντροφος της σκοτώθηκε σε αυτοκινητιστικό δυστύχημα. Η ίδια αποφάσισε να μην φύγει σαν κυνηγημένη αλλά να μείνει στον τόπο όπου μεγάλωσε και γνώρισε τον έρωτα της ζωής της. Παρόλα αυτά, οι απειλές για τη ζωή της από την οικογένεια της δεν σταμάτησαν ακόμα και μετά τον θάνατο του Πάτρικ. Απευθύνθηκε επανειλημμένως στη σουηδική αστυνομία για να λάβει αδιάφορες απαντήσεις.

«Κατήγγειλα τα περιστατικά στην αστυνομία αλλά κανένας δεν με πήρε στα σοβαρά. Αντίθετα, δεν κατάλαβαν καθόλου την επικινδυνότητα της κατάστασης και την απειλή της ζωής μου και με συμβούλεψαν να προσπαθήσω να τα βρω μαζί τους ή να τους μιλήσω και να τους ζητήσω να μην με ενοχλήσουν ξανά».

Η Φαντιμέ βρήκε ως τελευταία λύση τα Μέσα Μαζικής Ενημέρωσης. Στράφηκε στη δημοσιότητα για να προστατέψει τον εαυτό της, να ενημερώσει για την κατάσταση της και την περίπτωση η οποία όπως φάνηκε δεν ήταν η μοναδική στην «παραδεισένια» σουηδική κοινωνία.

«Η περίπτωση μου συγκέντρωσε τεράστιο ενδιαφέρον. Ένας αριθμός παρόμοιων περιπτώσεων αποκαλύφθηκε την ίδια περίοδο σε όλη τη Σουηδία. Έδωσα φωνή και πρόσωπο στην καταπίεση»

Η Φαντιμέ δολοφονήθηκε στις 21 Νοεμβρίου 2002 από τον πατέρα της λίγες ημέρες πριν φύγει για σπουδές στην Κένυα. Είχε βρεθεί με τη μητέρα της και τις δύο αδερφές της στο διαμέρισμα της αδερφής στην Ουψάλα ώσπου χτύπησε η πόρτα. Πηγαίνοντας να ανοίξει, ο πατέρας της την πυροβόλησε δύο φορές στο κεφάλι. Η Φαντιμέ πέθανε στην αγκαλιά της μητέρας η οποία δεν ήταν ικανή να τη σώσει.

Η Σουηδία ταρακουνήθηκε από την μαρτυρία και τον θάνατο της Φαντιμέ. Η κοινωνία διχάστηκε για την αποτελεσματική ενσωμάτωση των μεταναστών και πολλά μέσα μαζικής ενημέρωσης προσπάθησαν να ταυτίσουν τα εγκλήματα τιμής με το Ισλάμ.

Η Anne Patterson και η Unni Wikan στο βιβλίο της : In Honor of Fadime, Murder and Shame προσπάθησαν να αποσυνδέσουν τα εγκλήματα τιμής από τη θρησκεία και από συγκεκριμένες θρησκευτικές κοινότητες.

«Τα εγκλήματα τιμής και η έννοια της τιμής και της ντροπής δεν συνδέονται με τη θρησκεία. Οι έννοιες και οι ιδέες αυτές βρίσκονται σε συγκεκριμένες εθνοτικές ομάδες. Μπορούν να βρεθούν σε διάφορα πολιτιστικά σκηνικά τόσο μέσα στον Δυτικό κόσμο όσο και έξω από αυτόν. Το έγκλημα τιμής δεν αφορά τη θρησκεία αλλά τον κοινωνικό περίγυρο. Τιμή και ντροπή υπάρχουν μόνο εφόσον ο κόσμος γνωρίζει. Το έγκλημα γίνεται για να επικροτηθεί ο θύτης από το κοινωνικό περιβάλλον που θεωρεί την πράξη σωστή. Ακούστηκαν πολλά για τη θρησκεία της Φαντιμέ και το Ισλάμ. Ναι, η οικογένεια της Φαντιμέ ήταν μουσουλμάνοι όχι όμως πιστοί. Δεν ακολουθούσαν βασικούς κανόνες της θρησκείας άρα η πράξη αυτή δεν ήταν απόρροια μίας θρησκευτικής υποχρέωσης. Δεν είχε να κάνει με τον Θεό αλλά με τους ανθρώπους. Αντίθετα, στο Ισλάμ επικρατεί η ιδέα ότι κάθε ανθρώπινο ον είναι υπεύθυνο απέναντι στον Θεό κατά τη διάρκεια της Τελικής Κρίσης. Κανένας άνθρωπος δεν είναι σε θέση να κρίνει έναν άλλον άνθρωπο. 'Ένα χαρακτηριστικό παράδειγμα αποσύνδεσης των εγκλημάτων τιμής από τη θρησκεία είναι η δολοφονία ενός κοριτσιού το οποίο προερχόταν από οικογένεια Παλαιστίνιων χριστιανών και το οποίο αρνήθηκε έναν κανονισμένο γάμο, πριν λίγα χρόνια στη Σουηδία».

Μετά τον θάνατο της Φαντιμέ, οι πολιτικοί είδαν υπό νέο φως τις πολιτικές ενσωμάτωσης των μεταναστών στη σουηδική κοινωνία. Η αντίθεση ανάμεσα στη σουηδική μοντέρνα κοινωνία και σε παραδόσεις όπως εγκλήματα τιμής και κανονισμένοι γάμοι έφερνε σε απόγνωση τους νέους που δεν μπορούσαν να βρουν που πραγματικά ανήκουν. Είναι παιδιά μιας οικογένειας με απαρχαιωμένες αξίες ή μέλη μίας ισότιμης κοινωνίας όπου επιλέγουν ελεύθερα και συνειδητά για τον εαυτό τους;

Το Σοσιαλιστικό - Δημοκρατικό Κόμμα το οποίο βρισκόταν στην κυβέρνηση έδωσε μεγαλύτερες επιχορηγήσεις σε ειδικά κέντρα στήριξης έτσι ώστε να βοηθήσουν νεαρά κορίτσια να αποφύγουν γάμους ή να ξεφύγουν από τη βία της οικογένειας τους. Νομοθετικά, ρύθμισαν το όριο ηλικίας γάμου για τους μετανάστες στα 18 ενώ πριν ήταν στα 15. Η Mona Sahlin, τότε υπουργός Μετανάστευσης είχε δηλώσει για την Φαντιμέ: «Η Φαντιμέ και η λαχτάρα της να ζήσει τη δική της ζωή αποτελούν το ιδανικό πρότυπο για όλες τις νέες γυναίκες. Τα μίντια την αποκαλούν μία μάρτυρα η οποία θυσίασε τη ζωή της για την ισότητα αντρών -γυναικών και για το δικαίωμα να αποφασίσει για τη ζωή της».

Επιθυμία της ήταν η κηδεία της να γίνει στον Καθεδρικό της Ουψάλα, της πόλης που μεγάλωσε και αγάπησε. Θέλησε να ταφεί δίπλα στον αγαπημένο της Πάτρικ στο προτεσταντικό νεκροταφείο της Ουψάλα. 4.000 άνθρωποι συγκεντρώθηκαν στον Καθεδρικό για να αποχαιρετήσουν την Φαντιμέ. Να την αποχαιρετήσουν όχι ένα κορίτσι μίας πατριαρχικής οικογένειας Κούρδων αλλά μία πολίτη της Σουηδίας που είχε το θάρρος να βγει μπροστά και να μιλήσει ανοιχτά για όσα η σουηδική κοινωνία έβαζε κάτω από το χαλί.

Το φέρετρο της κουβάλησαν γυναίκες συγγενείς της ενώ κατά τη διάρκεια της κηδείας της έπαιξαν τα αγαπημένα της κομμάτια: το Tears in Heaven του Eric Clapton, το One των U2 και ένα παραδοσιακό κουρδικό κομμάτι θλίψης από κλαρίνο.

«Έπρεπε να αφήσω όλο μου το παρελθόν και να δημιουργήσω μία νέα ταυτότητα. Έπρεπε να αφήσω την οικογένεια μου. Πλήρωσα πολύ ακριβό τίμημα για αυτό. Δεν μετανιώνω που άφησα την οικογένεια μου αλλά λυπάμαι που ήμουν αναγκασμένη να το κάνω. Η οικογένεια μου έχασε και την τιμή της και την κόρη της. Θα μπορούσε να είχε αποφευχθεί. Εάν η κοινωνία είχε θεωρήσει ότι είναι υποχρέωση της να ενσωματώσει την οικογένεια μου, θα μπορούσαμε να αποφύγουμε όλα αυτά. Εάν η Ένωση Κούρδων είχε βοηθήσει την οικογένεια μου, θα μπορούσε να είχε αποφευχθεί. Δεν νιώθω καμία πικρία αλλά νομίζω ότι είναι σημαντικό να μάθουμε όλοι από αυτό και να μην συμβεί ποτέ ξανά. Νομίζω ότι είναι σημαντικό να μην κλείνουμε τα μάτια μας στην κατάσταση των κοριτσιών από οικογένειες μεταναστών».

Τα αποσπάσματα ήταν από τον λόγο της Φαντιμέ δύο μήνες πριν τον θανατό της.

Την είχε καλέσει η σουηδική Βουλή για να μιλήσει σε συζήτηση για τη βία κατά των γυναικών και για την αποτελεσματική ενσωμάτωση των μεταναστευτικών κοινοτήτων. Στη μνήμη της Φαντιμέ ιδρύθηκε ο οργανισμός GAPF -- Glöm aldrig Pela och Fadime, δηλαδή «Μην ξεχνάς ποτέ την Πέλα και την Φαντιμέ». Σκοπός του οργανισμού είναι να ενημερώνει για τα εγκλήματα τιμής και να προστατεύει όσους απευθυνθούν σε αυτόν ζητώντας μας να θυμόμαστε ότι κάθε χρόνο δολοφονούνται 5.000 γυναίκες για λόγους τιμής.

Almost 20,000 people have signed an online petition calling on all state governments to introduce the CNS -- a 24-hour legal advice and helpline for Aboriginal and Torres Islanders who have been taken into police custody already in operation in NSW and the ACT.

Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion called on states to make a firm commitment to accept federal government help to accelerate its implementation, while advocates credit it with improving transparency and ending preventable deaths in states such as NSW and the ACT.

The Federal Government is currently in talks with the NT, SA, and Victorian governments and says preventing deaths in custody must be urgently addressed.

""The CNS is not a silver bullet to addressing this issue,"" a spokesman for federal indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion told HuffPost Australia.

""However, providing culturally-appropriate welfare support to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in police custody is a crucial first step to ending preventable deaths in custody.""

""The Minister calls on states and territories to make a firm commitment to accept the Australian Government's offer of funding to introduce the CNS and accelerate its implementation.""

But suicide prevention campaigner Gerry Georgatos says the some states -- such as Queensland and WA -- are dragging their feet to implement the full service.

""Every state and territory should be in line with one another with the best possible service and that's the two-decade-long tried and tested CNS in NSW,"" the anti-suicide campaigner told HuffPost Australia.

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait imprisonment rate (per 100,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population): Increased from 2,253 in 2015 to 2,346 in 2016;

The non-Indigenous imprisonment rate increased from 146 to 154 prisoners per 100,000 non-Indigenous population;

increased in every jurisdiction except South Australia;

was highest in Western Australia (3,997), followed by the Northern Territory (2,914);

When age standardised, was 13 times greater than the age standardised imprisonment rate for non-Indigenous persons (2,039 compared to 163). Source: ABS

""This is the opportunity to put an end to Black deaths in custody at least in police watch houses. Why would anyone get in the way of this?""

He said the Queensland and Victorian services -- which are not law like in NSW -- are not good enough.

""Nearly 100 percent of police watch house custodial deaths are of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islanders and to not implement a service that puts an end to such deaths in police watch houses does indeed translate toxically as racism and is an indictment of our governments, one after another,"" he said.

Family and friends gathered outside Maitland Police station this morning for a memorial to mark a year since aboriginal woman, Rebecca Maher, died in police custody.

WA's Attorney General told the ABC he was committed to a CNS and that he and Premier Mark McGowen are entering into ""good faith negations"" with the Commonwealth.

Meanwhile Queensland's Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships, Mark Furner, told the National Broadcaster he was satisfied with the state's current system. State administrators earlier this year rejected the federal government's proposal to establish a hotline.

There Have Been Calls For A National CNS For 26 Years

Late last month tributes were held to mark 34 years since the death of Roebourne teenager John Pat, the 16-year-old Yindjibarndi boy whose death in WA police custody in 1983 sparked the 1987 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.

The Commonwealth offered to fund a CNS more than a year ago, after a recommendation from a coronial inquest into the death of 22-year-old Ms Dhu in in a Western Australian watch house.

But it wasn't the first recommendation. A compulsory custody notification service was recommended by the Royal Commission when it wrapped up in 1991, some 26 years ago.

The family of Ms Dhu believe a CNS could have saved her life.

""There's no doubt in my mind Ms Dhu would still be here, as well as other victims of deaths in custody, we need it implemented,"" her uncle Shaun Harris said on Wednesday.

Georgatos also believes Ms Dhu's life could have been saved by a CNS.

He also believes the psychological burden on police officers who have to sit on suicide watch from making health and welfare judgments.

There has been just one indigenous death in watch-house custody in NSW the CNS scheme was introduced in 2000.

Rebecca Maher, 36, was found dead in a cell at Maitland police station in July last year. Aboriginal Legal Service NSW has called for an independent investigation into her death, saying police failed to alert them to Maher's incarceration.

Overall, the imprisonment rate of Indigenous Australians has increased over the past decade, with Indigenous Australians representing 28 percent of the prisoner population.

Indigenous Australians make up just 3 percent of the general population.

So many deaths in custody - the silence from non-Indigenous Australia is deafening #StandAgainstBlackDeathsInCustody https://t.co/K4YWLVOn8V — NITV (@NITV) September 28, 2017

Georgatos said the CNS responds to nearly 16,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have been taken into custody in NSW per year.

That's an average of 300 people per week.

The CNS costs only $526,000 per year, said Georgatos.

""That's it,"" he said.

Voyager seule vous prouve ce dont vous êtes capable et vous démontre que oui, vous êtes à la hauteur!
Si vous ne vous sentez pas l'âme d'une exploratrice la première fois, partez quelques jours seulement.","Il y a quelques semaines, j'étais assise dans le métro face à deux jeunes femmes en train de discuter de leurs vacances quand l'une d'elles dit: ""Finalement je ne suis pas partie cet été, car personne ne pouvait partir avec moi."" Son amie répondit: ""ah oui je comprends, imagine que tu te fasses attaquer par un dingue ou que tu te perdes ?""

STOP. Je suis une grande adepte du voyage en solo et je suis convaincue que voyager seule est une expérience que chaque femme devrait faire au moins une fois dans sa vie. Ce qui nous bloque est la peur. La peur de se faire agresser, de s'ennuyer ou de se perdre. Or la plupart de ces peurs sont dues à notre éducation ou à notre entourage. Combien de fois les parents disent-ils à leurs enfants ""c'est dangereux"". Oui c'est important de protéger un enfant et de lui apprendre le bon sens, mais il faut aussi lui donner le gout de la découverte et de l'aventure!

Agression et peur de se perdre

Je sais que le risque zéro n'existe pas, mais depuis 10 ans que je voyage seule je ne me suis jamais fait agresser en voyage alors que dans ma ville, je ne compte pas le nombre de fois où les gens m'ont fait des réflexions très désagréables. Quand on voyage comme fille seule, il faut faire attention sans être paranoïaque. Par exemple, je suis ces règles simples: j'évite d'arriver dans une nouvelle ville de nuit, je réserve mon hôtel avant d'arriver sur place, je m'assure que mon téléphone est bien chargé et je demande à la réception les quartiers à éviter pour ne pas avoir de mauvaise surprise.

""L'homme ne peut découvrir de nouveaux océans tant qu'il n'a pas le courage de perdre de vue le rivage"" dit André Gide. Il faut accepter de se perdre en voyage. D'abord parce que dans une ville que l'on ne connait pas on est forcément un peu perdu, et puis si comme moi vous faites partie des gens qui ont un sens épouvantable de l'orientation vous allez forcément vous perdre. Mais ça fait partie de l'expérience! Et puis... de nos jours on n'est jamais vraiment perdu, il suffit de dégainer son téléphone et Google Maps vous dira exactement où vous êtes ! (À condition, bien sûr, d'avoir de la batterie !)

Savoir compter sur soi

Voyager seule est la solution idéale pour apprendre à se débrouiller seule, car il n'y a personne d'autre sur qui compter. Bien sûr, c'est important de savoir demander de l'aide quand on en a besoin, mais c'est encore plus important de savoir que vous pouvez compter sur vous-même!

Personne pour me dire quoi faire et passé un petit instant de panique, j'ai découvert qu'être seule était très agréable, car je pouvais partir quand je voulais et faire ce qui me plaisait.

La première fois que je suis partie voyager en solo, j'avais 19 ans. Je partais 2 mois pour l'Irlande comme jeune fille au pair et je commençais mon séjour par un road trip solo. J'ai dû organiser et gérer mon voyage toute seule. J'étais tellement fière d'être arrivée à me débrouiller seule pour prendre l'avion, trouver le terminal de bus avec les destinations en gaélique (surprise, surprise!) comprendre l'accent irlandais, planifier mes journées avec ma carte Michelin et les recommandations de l'auberge. Personne pour me dire quoi faire et passé un petit instant de panique, j'ai découvert qu'être seule était très agréable, car je pouvais partir quand je voulais et faire ce qui me plaisait. Être libre en somme.

Rendez-vous avec vous!

On a tous besoin d'être entourés de personnes que l'on aime. Pour certaines femmes, l'idée de partir seule est effrayante et vous trouvez peut-être bizarre l'idée de partir admirer des paysages sans personne avec qui les partager. Mais en vérité, c'est l'occasion de vivre une expérience pour vous-même. Au quotidien nous sommes toutes prises dans le rythme de nos vies et l'on n'a pas le temps de faire le point avec soi-même sur qui l'on est et ce que l'on veut vraiment. Voyager seule donne l'occasion de réfléchir et d'apprendre à s'aimer vraiment, car après tout, vous êtes coincée avec vous même pour le reste de votre vie alors autant bien s'entendre!

C'était une expérience que je n'oublierai jamais. Un moment calme, beau et uniquement pour moi.

Je me souviendrai toujours d'une randonnée de 17km avec sac à dos sur une petite ile des Canaries. Le chemin de randonnée que j'avais choisi était difficile, et quand après 3h de montée, je suis enfin arrivée en haut de la montagne, fatiguée et en nage et que j'ai pu admirer le paysage j'étais vraiment heureuse et fière de moi. Je ne pouvais pas m'arrêter de sourire. Le paysage était magnifique, le site était désert, il faisait beau, tout était silencieux, immobile, il n'y avait que le bruit du vent et celui de ma propre respiration. C'était une expérience que je n'oublierai jamais. Un moment calme, beau et uniquement pour moi.

Savoir ne compter que sur soi est essentiel pour progresser dans sa vie professionnelle. Combien de femmes, jeunes et moins jeunes hésitent à demander une promotion, car elles ont peur de ne pas être à la hauteur? Voyager seule vous prouve ce dont vous êtes capable et vous démontre que oui, vous êtes à la hauteur! Le voyage booste la confiance en soi et rares sont les femmes qui ont trop confiance en elles au travail...

N'attendez pas le ""bon"" moment pour partir

Ce moment n'existe pas. Il y aura toujours des projets au travail, un ami qui aura besoin d'aide pour un déménagement, le mariage d'un tel et le pot de départ d'un collègue. Arrêtez d'attendre et partez! Fixez-vous une date de départ, économisez pendant quelques mois et achetez ce billet d'avion.

Si vous ne vous sentez pas l'âme d'une exploratrice la première fois, partez quelques jours seulement. Pas besoin de partir loin pour être émerveillée ! Faites les choses à votre rythme, car comme dit le proverbe «Même un voyage de 1000km doit commencer par le premier pas"". En route.

La mannequin est devenue la première femme albinos au monde à devenir l'égérie d'une marque de beauté, comme le note le site de beauté Refinery29.

""Tellement enthousiaste de vous annoncer que je suis l'un des visages de la nouvelle campagne de Wet & Wild"", écrivait-elle sur son compte instagram, ce mercredi 11 octobre. Aux côtés de quatre autres femmes, elle rejoint la campagne Breaking Beauty qui célèbre les femmes dans toute leur diversité.

So excited to announce that I am one of the faces of the new Wet & Wild BREAKING BEAUTY CAMPAIGN. 😁 It's always great to be apart of a brand that celebrates diversity, and prides itself on being inclusive to all!

""Grandir en fréquentant une école publique m'a été très difficile, j'ai été beaucoup harcelée"", témoigne-t-elle dans une vidéo publiée sur son compte Instagram. Sa mère, mannequin, la place dans un nouvel établissement, où elle découvre l'athlétisme.

""Quand j'ai gagné ma première course, tout le monde était tellement heureux et fier de moi, c'était juste merveilleux"", continue-t-elle. ""Je me sentais confiante, belle, j'étais heureuse qu'il y ait des gens qui m'aiment pour qui je suis.""

A 18 ans, elle devient finalement mannequin. ""Je n'étais pas à 100% à l'aise avec mon albinisme"", racontait-elle au mois de mars au site Glamour. Elle a cependant des objectifs bien précis en tête. ""Je voulais normaliser la façon dont l'albinisme était représenté"", témoigne-t-elle auprès de Refinery29. ""Je voulais le faire pour moi, et pour toutes les filles qui grandissent.""

Un défi d'autant plus fort que les maquillages sont très peu souvent adaptés aux teintes de celles atteintes d'albinisme. ""La nuance est ou trop foncée, ou trop claire"" à chaque fois, témoigne Diandra Forrest.

""Ça peut être dur pour certains d'entendre la réalité derrière une industrie largement adorée, mais le manque de diversité, l'objectification, la pression à faire des compromis avec qui vous êtes, les problèmes de paiements sont très réels. Nous avons parcouru du chemin, mais nous pouvons aller plus loin, et briser le silence pousse au changement!

Quand j'ai commencé le mannequinat, il n'y avait qu'une place pour une femme noire dans un défilé de la fashion week. Maintenant, il y a environ deux places pour les filles noires, dans un défilé avec 50 mannequins. Dans certains, il n'y en en a même pas du tout.

J'ai le sentiment qu'ils ne voient même pas les filles noires pendant les castings. En particulier quand j'étais à Paris, je parlais aux autres mannequins et j'avais environ 13 ou 20 castings, les filles blanches en avaient presque 40.""

""J'ai toujours voulu prendre part à une campagne de beauté, notamment pour une marque qui célébrerait la diversité et la singularité"", poursuit-elle. Un souhait qu'elle réalise pour cette marque, aux côtés d'autres femmes aux parcours singuliers.

Elle rejoint ainsi Valentijn De Hingh, écrivaine, DJ et mannequin transgenre, ainsi que Mama Cāx, mannequin ayant survécu au cancer et porteuse de prothèses.

Suivie par 136.000 personnes sur Instagram, elle raconte recevoir beaucoup de messages de parents d'enfants, qui lui demandent des conseils. ""Ils veulent savoir comment ils peuvent l'expliquer à leurs enfants et à leurs camarades de classe, demandent quelle est la meilleure crème solaire.""

""Encouragez vos enfants, et donnez leur de l'estime de soi pour qu'ils ne grandissent pas en cherchant les compliments autre part"", leur répond Diandra Forrest. ""C'est ce que j'enseigne à ma fille Rain.""

Kennedy, una incógnita sobre la que hay innumerables teorías que pudieran despejar miles de archivos secretos cuya divulgación ahora depende de Donald Trump.

Los Archivos Nacionales mantienen bajo su custodia unos 3.100 expedientes clasificados sobre el asesinato del que fuera presidente de Estados Unidos entre 1961 y 1963, que los historiadores y expertos en el tema creen que pueden aclarar los entresijos del magnicidio y quizá cambiar la historia oficial.

Ahora, los responsables de los Archivos Nacionales tienen hasta el 26 de octubre para decidir cuáles de esos documentos, en su mayoría pertenecientes al Buró Federal de Investigaciones (FBI) y la CIA, pueden salir a la luz y cuáles deben seguir en secreto.

Pero la última palabra la tendrá el actual presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, quien tiene la autoridad final para decidir la publicación de los archivos o demorarla durante otros 25 años.

Los responsables de los Archivos Nacionales tienen hasta el 26 de octubre para decidir cuáles de esos documentos pueden salir a la luz y cuáles deben seguir en secreto

La divulgación de estos documentos responde a la ""JFK Records Act"", una ley aprobada en 1992 a raíz del renovado interés despertado por el caso tras el estreno de la película JFK, en la que Oliver Stone daba su visión sobre el asesinato cometido el 22 de noviembre de 1963 en Dallas (Texas).

En su filme, Stone planteaba una hipótesis defendida por los investigadores Jim Garrison y Jim Marrs en sus respectivos libros On the Trail of the Assassins y Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy, que alimentaba las viejas teorías conspirativas y descartaba el informe oficial de la famosa Comisión Warren, que apuntó a un solo hombre como responsable: Lee Harvey Oswald.

En el momento de su estreno, el expresidente Gerald Ford, que integró la Comisión Warren, tildó el filme de ""fraude"" y lo calificó como ""la gran mentira"".

John Fitzgerald Kennedy en la década de los 60.

Veintiséis años después, otros dos estudiosos del drama de Dallas, Roger Stone and Gerald Posner, ambos de The New York Times, esperan con ansiedad la divulgación de los nuevos documentos con la esperanza de que respalden sus propias teorías.

Pese a coincidir en el mismo diario, Stone y Posner defienden teorías totalmente contrapuestas.

En el libro que publicó en 2013, titulado The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ, Stone defiende la teoría de que fue el vicepresidente de Kennedy, Lyndon B. Jonhson, quien precisamente le sucedió en el cargo, el cerebro que estuvo detrás del magnicidio.

Stone defiende la teoría de que fue el vicepresidente de Kennedy, Lyndon B. Jonhson el cerebro que estuvo detrás del magnicidio.

La hipótesis de Stone, además de a Johnson, incluye a gran parte de los personajes habituales de las teorías conspirativas en torno al asesinato de Kennedy, a saber: la industria petrolífera texana financió la trama, que fue ejecutada por la mafia con la ayuda de elementos de la CIA y luego el FBI de Edgar Hoover la tapó.

Stone, que fue confidente y asesor de Richard Nixon, considera que el asesinato de Kennedy, la frustrada invasión de Bahía Cochinos para derrocar a Fidel Castro y el escándalo Watergate ""están inextricablemente relacionados"".

Por su parte, Posner, que en 1993 fue finalista del Pulitzer de Historia con su libro Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK, considera que las conclusiones de la llamada Comisión Warren son correctas y que no hubo ninguna conspiración.

Tras la tragedia, con el país aún conmocionado, se organizó una comisión de investigación liderada por el entonces presidente del Tribunal Supremo, Earl Warren, que determinó, no sin controversia, que Oswald cometió el crimen por cuenta propia y sin ayuda.

Pese a sus visiones contrarias sobre este episodio de la historia, uno de los que sigue atrayendo más atención entre los estadounidenses, Stone y Posner han unido sus voces para que se den a conocer los documentos que aún se mantienen en secreto.

El autor, que se mostró convencido de que no se podrá dar por cerrado el caso hasta que se conozca el último documento, criticó al Gobierno por ampararse en la ""seguridad nacional"" para negarse a dar a conocer los documentos clasificados durante décadas.

Posner considera que las conclusiones de la llamada Comisión Warren son correctas y que no hubo ninguna conspiración.

""Sé que el director de la CIA, (Mike) Pompeo, está instando al presidente (Trump) a demorar la publicación de estos registros durante otros 25 años"", dijo Stone.

En caso de que Trump no autorizase la divulgación de los documentos, como es su prerrogativa como presidente, podría ordenar que no vean la luz durante otros 25 años.

Sobre otro caso polémico de la época, el anterior presidente, Barack Obama, decidió retrasar la publicación de los documentos de la CIA sobre la invasión de Bahía Cochinos, lo que impide aclarar el alcance del compromiso de Kennedy de ayudar al puñado de exiliados cubanos que intentó derrocar en 1961 a Fidel Castro.","Los archivos secretos del asesinato de Kennedy, en manos de Donald Trump",http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/10/14/los-archivos-secretos-del-asesinato-de-kennedy-en-manos-de-donald-trump_a_23243479/

Der Vorwurf: Einkommensschwache Deutsche werden im Stich gelassen

Jetzt meldet sich der Mieterbund zu Wort - mit einer klaren Ansage

Es ist nur ein Ausschnitt einer Zeitungsseite, aber er wird gerade tausendfach von Rechten im Netz geteilt.

Darauf zu sehen sind vier Wohnungsgesuche von Flüchtlingshelfern für syrische Familien, außerdem eine Anzeige einer alleinerziehenden Mutter.

Die Anzeige wurde schon im Frühjahr in der ""Südwestpresse"" geschaltet, sorgt allerdings jetzt erst für Aufregung.

Flüchtlinge erschwerten ""Normalbürgern"" die Wohnungssuche, weil deren Miete ""nicht vom Amt"" komme, schreibt etwa die neurechte Bloggerin Anabel Schunke auf Facebook. Der hier lebende Bürger sei der Dumme.

""Ich kann den Ärger verstehen""

Solche Kommentare landeten auch bei den Flüchtlingshelfern, die in der Anzeige aufgeführt sind. Im Umlauf ist der Ausschnitt nämlich ohne geschwärzte Namen, Telefonnummern und Mailadressen.

Einer* sagte im Gespräch mit der HuffPost: ""In einem Fall wurde mir von einem Anrufer gesagt, dass er es ekelhaft fände, was ich mache. Meine Antwort war: Ich finde es ekelhaft, was Sie machen. Und dann habe ich aufgelegt.""

Eine* andere sagte: ""Ich kann den Ärger verstehen. Nicht nur Flüchtlinge, sondern viele andere in Deutschland haben Hilfebedarf bei der Wohnungssuche. Es gibt viel Not, und je mehr Leute sich in irgendeiner Weise für andere stark machen und das in vielen Bereichen, nur dann wird die Not geringer.""

Falscher Eindruck

In den Kommentaren auf Facebook jedoch soll der Eindruck erweckt werden, dass Deutsche, die es ohnehin schwer auf dem hartumkämpften Wohnungsmarkt haben, bei ihrer Suche alleine gelassen werden.

Die rechten Nutzer glauben, dass deutsche Staatsbürger chancenlos um Wohnungen konkurrieren würden und am Ende gar auf der Straße landen könnten, während der Flüchtling mit seiner Familie im Warmen sitze.

Was ist dran an diesen Vorwürfen?

Der Mieterbund jedenfalls sieht das Problem der Wohnungsnot nicht bei den Flüchtlingen - sondern darin, dass n den vergangenen Jahren in Deutschland viel zu wenige Wohnungen gebaut wurden.

In Deutschland fehlen rund eine Million Wohnungen

""In den letzten Jahren ist viel zu wenig neu gebaut worden, insbesondere in Städten ist die Nachfrage nach Wohnungen deutlich höher als das Angebot"", sagt Ulrich Ropertz, Geschäftsführer des Deutschen Mieterbundes, der HuffPost.

400.000 neue Wohnungen müssten pro Jahr gebaut werden, rechnet Ropertz vor. Davon mindestens 80.000 Sozialwohnungen. Nach Wohnungen würden unter den Asylbewerbern eigentlich nur die anerkannten Flüchtlinge suchen. ""2017 dürften es 140.000 sein"", sagt Ropertz.

Zum Vergleich: Studienanfänger, die ebenfalls in vielen Fällen nach einer Wohnung suchen, gab es in diesem Studienjahr 507.779. Flüchtlinge leisten so nur ein kleinen Beitrag zu einem großen strukturellen Problem.

In Deutschland fehlten zurzeit rund eine Million Wohnungen – ein Fehlbestand, der sich über Jahre aufgebaut habe und jetzt Schritt für Schritt abgebaut werden müsse.

Aber haben Flüchtlinge tatsächlich einen Vorteil, weil ihre Mietzahlung vom Amt gesichert ist?

Ropertz findet das ""zweifelhaft"". Zumindest habe noch nie jemand behauptet, dass es ein Vorteil auf dem Wohnungsmarkt sei, ALG-II-Bezieher zu sein. ""Auch hier übernimmt die Stadt die Wohnkosten zu 100 Prozent"", sagt Ropertz.

""Flüchtlinge dürften es ausgesprochen schwer haben""

Mehr noch: ""Tatsächlich dürften es Flüchtlinge auf dem Wohnungsmarkt ausgesprochen schwer haben"", sagt Ropertz.

Wie alle einkommensschwächeren Personen hätten sie Probleme, eine Wohnung zu finden. ""Hinzu kommen auch Vorurteile potenzieller Vermieter und Sprachschwierigkeiten.""

""Il Pd appartiene al popolo che lo ha creato e chi se ne va tradisce se stesso"", evita la conta Matteo Renzi, sul palco con Walter Veltroni e con il premier Paolo Gentiloni. Più che al passato e alle divisioni, però, il leader dem è interessato al futuro prossimo: ""Se passa il Rosatellum abbiamo di fronte a noi un corpo a corpo in tutti i collegi con un centrodestra populista"", prevede l'ex premier dopo aver messo in chiaro che sarà lui il candidato premier della nascitura coalizione.

Manifestazione sobria all'insegna della ""sinistra di governo"", con tutti i ministri, tranne Andrea Orlando, in prima fila per dimostrare che il Pd è riuscito a sconfiggere uno dei mali antichi della sinistra di lotta e non di governo. Ma, dopo le note dell'inno dell'Ulivo vincente, la Canzone popolare di Fossati, è Walter Veltroni, regista della kermesse, a ripartire dal passato citando Romano Prodi e il ""miglior governo della storia repubblicana per l'autorevolezza del premier e dei suoi ministri"", da Ciampi a Napolitano. ""Perchè non c'è?"", grida qualcuno dalla platea notando l'assenza del fondatore dell'Ulivo. Ma troppa acqua è passata sotto i ponti e, 5 segretari dopo, non è stato sconfitto quello che il primo segretario definisce uno dei ""demoni della sinistra"": le divisioni con scissioni annesse.

""Dobbiamo essere grati - è il tributo di Gentiloni - ai diversi segretari, da Veltroni a Franceschini da Bersani a Epifani. Non sono stati anni facili, ma teniamocelo stretto questo Pd perché, senza, non so come sarebbe sopravissuta una sinistra di governo e una sinistra in generale"". Parole che con un altro stile, e senza ringraziamenti ai predecessori che se ne sono andati, scandisce anche Matteo Renzi: ""Senza il Pd oggi la sinistra in Italia sarebbe irrilevante come è totalmente irrilevante oggi in Spagna, Francia, Olanda, Germania e Inghilterra"". Il segretario dem indica un nemico e un avversario. ""Il nostro nemico è l'autoreferenzialità, il parlarsi addosso, le nostre divisioni"". Mentre l'avversario per Renzi sono le destre, sia quella M5S sia la coalizione Berlusconi-Salvini, quelli che ""ci ha lasciato con lo spread e la più grande crisi economica del dopoguerra"".

E al ""corpo a corpo"" collegio per collegio, se passerà il Rosatellum, l'ex premier si prepara condividendo l'appello di Veltroni a ""non aver paura della parola sinistra"".

Several patrons who were in Cubana at the time took to social media to express their shock, with different versions of events.

According to Phaks Photh'inja two men had entered the club, shooting into the crowd while chasing someone towards the bathroom.

Many patrons who witnessed the shooting were traumatised.

2 people just got shot in cubana! I saw everything happen and I'm just ..... idk — Minana💫✨ (@Twinheart_) October 13, 2017

Chairperson of the Stellenbosch University SRC, Lwando Nkamisa, called on students affected by the shooting to seek counselling.

""The students who witnessed this violence please come to our offices in the Neelsie top floor if you need someone to talk to, or visit the Counselling Unit in Victoria street or call 082 557 0880 if you need a professional to talk to,"" he posted.

Nkamisa said he was not sure if the two deceased had ties with the university.The shooting is the third club-related one in about seven months.It was not clear what spurred the Cubana shooting, but the lucrative nightclub security industry has recently spurred violence as two groupings are intent on dominating it.

Areas around Cape Town with hubs of nightclubs on which the groupings have had their focus include Long Street in the city centre, Stellenbosch and Bellville.

The Hawks are heading a mammoth investigation into underworld violence.For a detailed breakdown on what has been happening in the underworld, see News24's showcase Underworld Unmasked here.Earlier this year controversial businessman Nafiz Modack and a group of men starting taking control of the lucrative nightclub security industry in Cape Town from a more established grouping.

They also started doing this in Johannesburg, and more recently, were said to be taking over nightclub security in Durban.This takeover has sparked violence and several shootings.Two patrons were wounded in a shooting inside Cafe Caprice, a restaurant in Camps Bay, on April 17.

Three suspects have since been arrested for this.In an exclusive interview with News24 last month, Modack said he was the intended target of the shooting at Cafe Caprice.

""That particular day, we were supposed to have a meeting there. At the last minute, I cancelled,"" he said.

A patron and a DJ were also wounded in a shooting just outside Coco nightclub in the Cape Town city centre on May 5, 2017. -- News24",Cape Town Club Wars: Two People Have Been Shot Dead In Stellenbosch,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/10/14/cape-town-club-wars-two-people-have-been-shot-dead-in-stellenbosch_a_23243210/

Die Krankheit ist meist nicht gefährlich, dafür umso unangenehmer. Die Milbeninfektion sorgt für einen extremen Juckreiz, ein beißendes Gefühl auf der Haut. Die Schülerin klagt über Schlaflosigkeit.

""Es juckt fürchterlich im unteren Bereich des Rückens""

""Erst hat es meinen 16-jährigen Bruder erwischt, jetzt mich. Ich bin krankgeschrieben und es juckt fürchterlich an den Handgelenken und im unteren Bereich des Rückens“, zitiert der ""Express"" das Mädchen.

Bereits seit vergangenem Jahr beobachten Experten einen bundesweiten Anstieg der Krankheitsfälle. Seit Januar dieses Jahres seien der Behörde bereits 128 Fälle gemeldet worden. Im Vorjahr waren es 113 Fälle.

Milben übertragen die Hautkrankheit, legen ihre Eier unter die Haut des Menschen. Mehrere Wochen lang sorgen sie für teilweise heftige Juck-Attacken gegen die Ärzte vor allem Salben verschreiben. Übertragen wird die Krankheit für normal durch langen und intensiven Hautkontakt mit infizierten Menschen.

STOCKHOLM -- U.S. economist Richard Thaler won the 2017 Nobel Economics Prize for his contributions in the field of behavioral economics, showing how human traits affect supposedly rational markets, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Monday.

Thaler brought to prominence the idea of ""nudge"" economics, where humans are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviors without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world.

In his award citation, the Academy said his research had harnessed psychologically realistic assumptions in analyses of economic decision-making, exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control.

""In total, Richard Thaler's contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making,"" the award-giving body said on announcing the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize.

""His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.""

The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel's 1895 will.

Economy is the last of this year's Nobels. The prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were all awarded last week.

The United States has dominated the economics prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the award. Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, U.S. academics won or shared the prize every year.

While few economists are household names, past winners have included Milton Friedman, in 1976, whose work is a cornerstone of current monetary policy, and James Tobin, in 1981, who proposed countries should tax financial transactions.

Some countries in the European Union agreed on such a tax to help fight the debt crisis, but implementation has been delayed, among other things by Britain's decision to leave the bloc.

WEINSTEIN, DESPEDIDOThe Weinstein Company despidió a Harvey Weinstein el domingo 7 de octubre ""tras las informaciones acerca de su mala conducta"".
La decisión la tomaron los cuatro miembros de la junta de la compañía (incluido Bob Weinstein, su hermano).
Unas horas después Rose McGowan —una de las actrices que aparecían en el artículo que destapó el escándalo— le acusó de mentir.
Este miércoles 11 escribió: ""No hay excusa para el acoso y el abuso sexual, sin importar quién eres ni qué profesión tienes.","Un terremoto sacudió Hollywood hace unos días y sus réplicas no dejan de sentirse. El desencadenante fue un artículo de The New York Times que destapaba el supuesto acoso y abuso sexual de un productor, Harvey Weinstein, a distintas actrices a lo largo de dos décadas. Tras su publicación, más intérpretes denunciaron públicamente episodios similares y numerosas voces del cine han señalado que estos comportamientos no son infrecuentes.

Estas son las claves para entender el caso, que a Weinstein le ha costado su trabajo y su matrimonio, y sobre el que se han pronunciado personalidades como Meryl Streep, George Clooney, Hillary Clinton, Donna Karan, Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow o Ben Affleck.

QUIÉN ES HARVEY WEINSTEIN

Quizá su cara no te suene demasiado, pero este productor cinematográfico de 65 años es una de las personas más poderosas de Hollywood. Junto a su hermano Bob fundó las productoras Miramax y The Weinstein Company.

Está detrás de películas tan conocidas como Pulp Fiction, Shakespeare in Love, El indomable Will Hunting, Chicago o las sagas Kill Bill, Scream y Scary Movie, entre muchas otras (en Imdb figuran 331 títulos de los que es productor).

POR QUÉ SE HABLA DE ÉL ESTOS DÍAS

Por un artículo publicado en The New York Times el jueves 5 de octubre titulado Harvey Weinstein pagó para poner fin a denuncias por acoso sexual durante décadas. En el texto se documentaban hasta ocho acuerdos extrajudiciales en demandas interpuestas por antiguas empleadas y asociadas, como las actrices Ashley Judd (Heat, Divergente) y Rose McGowan (Scream, Death Proof).

Judd relató al diario que hace 20 años Weinstein la invitó a lo que ella pensaba que era un desayuno de trabajo en un hotel en Beverly Hills, pero él la hizo subir a su habitación, donde apareció en bata y le preguntó si le podía dar un masaje o mirarlo mientras se duchaba.

El artículo también hablaba de un acuerdo alcanzado en 1997 entre Weinstein y Rose McGowan, cuando ésta tenía 23 años, tras un episodio en la habitación de un hotel durante el Festival de Sundance del que no se daban más detalles.

LA DISCULPA DE WEINSTEIN

El mismo 5 de octubre Harvey Weinstein envió un comunicado a The New York Times en respuesta al artículo. En él, señalaba que alcanzó ""la mayoría de edad en los 60 y los 70, cuando las normas de comportamiento en los lugares de trabajo eran diferentes"". ""Me doy cuenta de que el modo en el que me he comportado con mis colegas en el pasado ha causado mucho daño y me disculpo sinceramente por ello"", añadió.

Weistein también apuntó que se había puesto en manos de terapeutas y reiteró que ""respetaba a las mujeres y lamentaba lo que pasó"". También citó una letra de una canción del rapero Jay Z para pedir ""una segunda oportunidad"".

WEINSTEIN, DESPEDIDO

The Weinstein Company despidió a Harvey Weinstein el domingo 7 de octubre ""tras las informaciones acerca de su mala conducta"". La decisión la tomaron los cuatro miembros de la junta de la compañía (incluido Bob Weinstein, su hermano). Un quinto socio había dimitido el día anterior.

Según recoge The Independent, en las horas previas Weinstein se había dirigido por email a los grandes ejecutivos de Hollywood, suplicándoles que lo ayudaran porque su empresa lo iba a despedir: ""Permítanme resucitar con una segunda oportunidad [...] Si pueden, necesito que envíen una carta a mi Gmail personal. La carta sería para la junta y no la vería nadie más. Lo que el consejo está tratando de hacer no solo está mal, sino que podría ser ilegal y destruiría la empresa"".

LA REACCIÓN DE HOLLYWOOD

Tras las publicación del artículo se han sucedido multitud de reacciones en la industria. Muchos actores, algunos que habían trabajado codo con codo con Weinstein, otros que habían oído rumores sobre su comportamiento hace tiempo y algunas actrices que han vivido acoso en Hollywood, se han pronunciado sobre el caso. Aquí puedes repasar qué han dicho de manera cronológica:

LENA DUNHAM

El lunes 9 de octubre la actriz y creadora de la serie Girls escribió una carta en The New York Times lamentándose del silencio de los hombres de la industria a la hora de condenar el acoso sexual en Hollywood. ""El abuso, las amenazas y la coerción han sido la norma para muchas mujeres que trataban de hacer negocio o de hacer arte [...] Hollywood tiene otra oportunidad de hacer una declaración ruidosa sobre lo que debemos y no debemos tolerar como sociedad"". Dunham también recordó que ella misma había vivido un episodio de acoso por parte de un director.

MERYL STREEP

La oscarizada Meryl Streep envió​​​ una declaración a la edición estadounidense del HuffPost el martes 10 de octubre. Streep, que había trabajado con él en películas como Agosto y La dama de hierro, aseguró que no estaba al tanto de su comportamiento: ""Yo no sabía nada de los mencionados agravios: no me constaban sus compensaciones económicas a otras actrices y compañeras, no sabía nada de sus reuniones en sus habitaciones de hotel, en su cuarto de baño ni tampoco de cualquier otro comportamiento inapropiado y coercitivo"". La actriz calificó de ""heroínas"" a las mujeres que habían dado su testimonio para destapar el caso.

JENNIFER LAWRENCE

La actriz consiguió el Oscar a Mejor actriz en 2013 por Silver Linings Playbook, cinta producida por Weinstein. Después de que se destapara el escándalo, Lawrence ha asegurado en un comunicado emitido el 9 de octubre que no sabía nada: ""Trabajé con Weinstein hace cinco años y no experimenté ninguna forma de acoso [...] Mi corazón está con todas esas mujeres afectadas por esas desagradables acciones. Y quiero darles las gracias por haber dado un valiente paso adelante"".

KATE WINSLET

Winslet también consiguió el Oscar gracias a una producción de The Weinstein Company, The Reader (2009). En un comunicado enviado a Variety el lunes 9, señaló: ""Esperaba que esas historias fueran rumores, tal vez hemos sido todos ingenuos. Eso me enfada mucho. No se debe tolerar este trato degradante y vil a las mujeres en ningún lugar de trabajo en ningún lugar del mundo"".

GLENN CLOSE

""Estoy aquí, profundamente molesta, reconociéndome a mí misma que sí, que durante muchos años he sido consciente de los vagos rumores de que Harvey Weinstein tenía un patrón de comportamiento inadecuado hacia las mujeres. Harvey siempre ha sido decente conmigo pero ahora que los rumores se corroboran me siento enojada y profundamente triste"", dijo Glenn Close a The New York Times el 9 de octubre.

JESSICA CHASTAIN

A través de un tuit, la actriz —que nunca ha trabajado con Weinstein— afirmó el lunes 9: ""Estaba avisada desde el principio. Las historias estaban por todas partes. Negarlo es crear el ambiente para que vuelva a ocurrir"".

I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an enviornment for it to happen again. — Jessica Chastain (@jes_chastain) 9 de octubre de 2017

DONNA KARAN

La diseñadora realizó unas polémicas declaraciones el domingo 8 de las que se retractó al día siguiente. La modista, amiga de la mujer de Weinstein —Georgina Chapman, también diseñadora—, afirmó en una alfombra roja: ""Mira cómo se han vestido las mujeres hoy y lo que están pidiendo con solo presentarse de esa manera. ¿Qué están pidiendo? Problemas"". El día después matizó sus palabras y aseguró que sus palabras se habían sacado de contexto. ""Creo que el acoso sexual no es aceptable y este es un tema que debe ser abordado de una vez por todas, independientemente del individuo"", apuntó.

ASIA ARGENTO

El 10 de octubre The New Yorker publicó un amplio reportaje que incluía varios testimonios de mujeres que relataban los abusos recibidos por parte de Weinstein, entre ellas, la intérprete Mira Sorvino y la actriz y directora de origen italiano Asia Argento. Ésta acusa al productor de violación y asegura que la forzó a tener sexo oral. ""Sé que ha aplastado a mucha más gente antes"", asegura Argento.

En su cuenta de Twitter, Argento recuperó una escena que dirigió en 1999 inspirada en la historia de Rosanna Arquette, actriz a la que Weinstein también recibió en bata ""diciendo que le dolía el cuello y que necesitaba un masaje"".

En ese artículo también se cuentan los casos de otras actrices como Lucia Evans, que asegura que la forzó a tener sexo oral, y Louisette Geiss, que sostiene que Weinstein le dijo que la ayudaría en su carrera si le miraba masturbarse.

ANGELINA JOLIE Y GWYNETH PALTROW

Un reportaje de The New York Times publicado el día 10 recogía el testimonio de dos pesos pesados de la gran pantalla: las actrices Angelina Jolie y Gwyneth Paltrow.

Sobre esta última se cuenta que antes de empezar el rodaje de Emma, cuando Paltrow tenía 22 años, Weinstein la citó en un hotel. La reunión transcurrió con normalidad hasta que él intentó tocarla y le sugirió que debían darse unos masajes. La actriz rechazó las intentonas del productor y se lo contó a su pareja por aquel entonces, el actor Brad Pitt, que se peleó con el productor. ""Pensé que me iba a despedir"", cuenta.

Por su parte, Angelina Jolie recuerda un episodio durante la promoción de Playing by Heart en 1998, cuando tenía 23 años: ""Tuve una mala experiencia con Harvey Weinstein en mi juventud y, como resultado, decidí no volver a trabajar con él nunca más y advertir a otros cuando así lo hicieran"".

GEORGE CLOONEY

El actor, que conoce a Harvey Weinstein desde hace 20 años, ha asegurado que ""es indefendible"". ""Me dio mi primer gran papel en películas como From Dusk Till Dawn y mi primera oportunidad como director en Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Hemos compartido cenas, hemos ido junto a localizaciones, hemos discutido pero puedo decir que nunca le he visto este tipo de comportamiento, nunca"", aseguró a Daily Beast el martes 10.

JEFF BRIDGES

El actor, que trabajó con Weinstein en 2014 en The Giver, señaló en Hollywood Reporter este martes que el productor ""se enfrenta ahora a sus demonios"". ""Espero que se apoye en esos demonios para pasar al otro lado siendo una persona mejor. Le deseo lo mejor"", prosiguió.

BEN AFFLECK

Facebook ha sido la vía elegida por Ben Affleck. ""Estoy triste y enfadado porque un hombre con el que he trabajado [produjo El indomable Will Hunting] usara su posición de poder para intimidar, acosar sexualmente y manipular a muchas mujeres durante décadas"", afirmó este martes. ""Necesitamos mejorar en la protección de nuestras hermanas, amigas, compañeras e hijas"", añadió.

Unas horas después Rose McGowan —una de las actrices que aparecían en el artículo que destapó el escándalo— le acusó de mentir. ""Le dije que dejara de hacerlo', me dijiste a la cara. La rueda de prensa a la que me hicieron ir después del asalto. Mientes"", afirmó en un tuit, sugiriendo que el actor tenía conocimiento del comportamiento de Weinstein. En un mensaje posterior la actriz escribió: ""Que te j****, Ben Affleck"".

CHARLIZE THERON

La actriz y Weinstein trabajaron juntos en varias películas, como The Cider House Rules. En un comunicado enviado a BuzzFeed este martes, aseguró que ""desafortunadamente"" no podía decir que se sorprendiera. ""Esta cultura ha existido siempre, no solo en Hollywood sino en todo el mundo. Y muchos hombres con puestos de poder han campado a sus anchas durante mucho tiempo. No podemos culpar a las víctimas"", apostilló.

LINDSAY LOHAN

La actriz y cantante ha sido una de las pocas defensoras del productor. ""Me siento muy mal por Harvey Weinstein"", aseguró a través de Instagram Stories. ""No creo que lo que está pasando esté bien"". En su publicación, que después borró pero circula por internet, escribió el nombre del productor junto a un emoji con halo de santo.

LEONARDO DICAPRIO

El actor, que ha participado en varias películas de Weinstein como Gangs of New York, El aviador y Django Desencadenado, también ha recurrido a Facebook para expresarse. Este miércoles 11 escribió: ""No hay excusa para el acoso y el abuso sexual, sin importar quién eres ni qué profesión tienes. Aplaudo la fuerza y el coraje de las mujeres que han dado un paso al frente y han hecho que su voz se escuche"".

REACCIONES POLÍTICAS

El escándalo ha sobrepasado Hollywood y ha entrado en la esfera política. Hillary Clinton y su partido recibieron dinero del productor para su campaña electoral. Clinton envió un comunicado a CNN este miércoles 11 en el que asegura estar ""impactada y paralizada"". ""El comportamiento descrito por las mujeres que le han denunciado no puede ser tolerado. Su valentía y el apoyo de los demás es fundamental para ayudar a frenar este tipo de actitudes"", añadió.

El expresidente Barack Obama y Michelle han afirmado, también a través de un comunicado, que se declaran ""disgustados"". ""Cualquier hombre que degrada a las mujeres de tal manera debe ser condenado y responsabilizado, independientemente de su riqueza o estatus"", añaden.

¿Y LA MUJER DE WEINSTEIN?

El escándalo también ha tenido consecuencias en la vida personal de Weinstein. Su mujer, Georgina Chapman —de 41 años y diseñadora y fundadora de la firma Marchesa— lo ha dejado. ""Mi corazón se rompe por todas las mujeres que han sufrido un daño terrible por sus imperdonables acciones. He decidido dejar a mi marido. Cuidar de mis hijos pequeños es mi prioridad"", apuntó en un comunicado publicado en People este martes 10.

Weinstein y Chapman se casaron en 2007 y tienen dos hijos: India Pearl, de 7 años, y Dashiel Max Robert, de 4.

In the course of the work with adolescents and young people, the Population Foundation of India (PFI) has documented a churn in the status quo in states such as Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Adolescent girls have come together in groups called Kishori Clubs to discuss the issues that nobody will talk to them about, such as child marriage, family planning, contraception, and menstruation. Through the use of social behaviour change communication materials and discussions at these meetings, the girls raised awareness and action on these issues and have even managed to bring a positive influence on the families who are still caught up in ignorant practices that are anti-girl and anti-woman.

By coming together in groups, they have created safe spaces for girls to talk not only about social issues, but also a place to share their dreams.

The girls are not shy and make no pretence of menstruation, and are aware of the need to be able to manage their own menstrual hygiene. In Hardiya village, Rajauli block of the Nawada district in Bihar, they have begun the conversation on menstrual health management and have a system where they pool their resources, contributing at least one rupee a day, ₹ 30 a month, to buy sanitary napkins for every girl in the group. This then becomes a 'bank of sanitary napkins' that will be used to distribute to girls who could not afford to pay. Due to the fantastic success of the initiative, it is now being scaled up in neighbouring areas.

In another example, the girls from the Kishori Club identified 45 cases of child marriage in the Kawakol, Rajauli and Singhwara blocks of Nawada and Darbhanga districts, also in Bihar. Subsequently, the group met and discussed the negative implications of child marriage with the adolescents and their parents. They made compelling arguments against early marriage and also explained to these families the benefits of delaying marriage – the opportunities it presents for these girls like being better prepared physically, mentally and financially. Most of these marriages were stopped.

These girls are creating a tectonic shift in the way they are perceived. By coming together in groups, they have created safe spaces for girls to talk not only about social issues, but also a place to share their dreams and goals or discuss the personal problems that they face at home. There are hundreds of similar, inspiring stories that come out from under the shadows of the mainstream. And more girls are realising that they can dream big and achieve these dreams, they too can move the world.

A Muslim teen has alleged that he was picked up by the police in Uttar Pradesh and charged with hacking, following a status update he posted on a recent court ruling on rivers Ganga and Yamuna. Speaking at a press conference organised by the Bhim Army in New Delhi, 18-year-old Zakir Ali Tyagi said that in April this year, police arrested him and then tortured him in their custody on the basis of various unfounded allegations.

Tyagi's status message had read: ""The Ganga has been declared a living entity; will criminal charges be initiated if someone drowns in it?"" Telegraph reports that Tyagi had meant it as a wisecrack on a High Court ruling on Ganga and Yamuna, asking the rivers to be treated as persons with rights.

However, he was charged under Section 66 of the Information Technology Act which could lead to a jail term of three years and deals with 'hacking'. The Telegraph quotes the FIR accusing Tyagi of posting 'galat tareeke ke (wrong type of) comments"" on Facebook.

The Telegraph spoke to Wasim Nadeeq Khan, who got Tyagi legal aid. He told them: ""The police had initially registered the FIR under Section 66A, which prescribes three years' jail for offensive posts, unaware that the Supreme Court had struck it down as unconstitutional in March 2015. When they realised the mistake, they merely dropped the letter 'A'.""

Tyagi was also booked under Section 420 of the IPC for having the picture of a police officer as his profile picture. The picture was of Akhtar Khan, a police officer killed on duty in Greater Noida, he had out the picture as a protest against his murder like people on Facebook tend to do.

Tyagi was let off almost after a month, following postponed bail hearings. In fact, once he was remanded in custody as the magistrate decided his was a 'serious' matter and he deserved to spend more time in jail.

The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is a legacy of the British Raj that was brought into force in 1860 to consolidate various penal statutes that were spread far and wide, owing to the diversity of the nation. The IPC was based on the prevalent customs and norms as it existed in those days. However, it has failed to keep up with evolution of society that has resulted in certain archaic and socially abhorrent provisions used till date.

Section 377, which criminalises homosexual intercourse, is one, another being 'Exception 2' to Section 375 which criminalises rape. The exception provides that sexual intercourse with minor wife who is of or above the age of 15 would not qualify as rape. This became specially contradictory to the amendment made to Section 375 in 2013 raising the age of consent from 16 years to 18 years.

The result of the amendment was that there was now a category of women between the ages of 15 to 18 who could not enjoy the protection of law if they were forced into sexual intercourse, without their consent, by their husbands. This legal position was challenged before the Supreme Court by a NGO named 'Independent Thought' for being unconstitutional by virtue of being arbitrary, discriminatory and devoid of dignity as it would render the same violative of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner also contended that such women could not even give informed consent due to lack of maturity.

Interestingly, the judgment as authored by Justice Lokur did not find it viable to declare Exception 2 to Section 375 as being in violation of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 as the Petitioner had given up this relief during the course of arguments.

Interestingly, both the UPA government in 2013 and the current NDA government chose to oppose the petition by stating that since child marriages were still prevalent in the country it would be difficult to criminalise marital rape of minor wives. The government shied away from disturbing the social order despite the same being a social ill. This gave rise to a peculiar situation where the Government was reluctant to cure an evil which necessitated the Supreme Court's intervention.

The government's ambivalence was rendered even more peculiar as there are specific statutes protecting children below 18 years from sexual offences, but the government failed to amend Section 375 to bring it line with such statutes. Further, by enacting the Prevention of Child Marriages Act, 2006 the Government had already criminalized child marriage where any man above the age of 18 years marrying a minor girl was punishable by rigorous imprisonment. However, such marriages were considered voidable at the choice of either of the parties, but not void at inception. Even this enactment did not bring about an amendment to Section 375.

Child bride Krishna,11, sits during a marriage ceremony at her husband's home in a village near Kota in May, 2016.

Another dichotomy in the IPC, as noted by the Supreme Court, was that a man would be held liable for 'lesser offences' against his minor wife, like causing grievous hurt etc., but could not be held liable for marital rape of minor wife.

Taking note of the above, among various other factors, a bench comprising Justice Madan B. Lokur and Justice Deepak Gupta of the Supreme Court allowed the petition by striking down the exception as being unconstitutional and inconsistent with Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO). This inconsistency should have been cured at the inception of POCSO in 2012 itself by way of amendment to section 375 but the failure of the legislature forced the Supreme Court to state the obvious.

The SC did refute the stand taken by the government during course of arguments that criminalising marital rape would destroy the institution of marriage.

The court sought to harmoniously interpret special statutes enacted for the protection of the girl child with the provisions of the Indian Penal Code. Such an interpretation was found to be important to preserve and protect the human rights of the girl child. Interestingly, the judgment as authored by Justice Lokur did not find it viable to declare Exception 2 to Section 375 as being in violation of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 as the Petitioner had given up this relief during the course of arguments. Justice Lokur however harmonised the various child protection laws read down Exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC to now be meaningfully read as: ""Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape.""

Justice Deepak Gupta, on the other hand, while concurring with the judgment authored by Justice Lokur declared that the Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code was unconstitutional for being arbitrary and discriminatory and thus in violation of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court refrained from giving any finding or opinion on marital rape of adult wife as the said issue was not in consideration in this case. However, it did refute the stand taken by the government during course of arguments that criminalising marital rape would destroy the institution of marriage. While this view has been taken in context of marital rape of girl child, the Petitioners before the Delhi High Court seeking criminalization of marital rape could use this to their advantage.

This judgment has been declared to be prospective in nature, which means that any prosecution for marital rape of girl child can only be initiated for such rape occurring after the date of the judgment, and no such act alleged to have occurred prior to the judgment can be treated as an offence.

Therefore the law as it stands now is that, notwithstanding consent, sexual intercourse with a minor girl would constitute the offence of rape under Section 375 of the IPC.",What The SC Ruling On Sex With Minor Wives Means For The Child Brides Of India,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/11/what-the-sc-judgement-on-sex-with-minor-wives-means-for-the-child-brides-of-india_a_23239875/

Photographer Mihaela Noroc offers a refreshing break from this tired norm by celebrating the diverse beauty of women from around the world as part of her photography project ‘The Atlas Of Beauty’.

The project started in 2013 online and became popular on social media, accruing millions of fans across Facebook and Instagram. The images have now been bound together to form a coffee table book featuring 500 portraits, many of which are being seen for the first time.

‘Atlas Of Beauty’ is wonderfully inclusive, featuring a range of women of different ages, ethnicities, religions, sexualities, gender identities and women with disabilities.

It’s no surprise therefore that Noroc does not subscribe to the traditional notion of female beauty.

“I think beauty shouldn’t have a definition,” she tells HuffPost UK. “As I see it, beauty is about being yourself, natural and authentic. It’s in our differences, we just have to open our eyes and see it.”

Travelling the world photographing women for the past few years, Noroc realised beauty is so much more than what we see in the mass media and she wanted to celebrate that.

“If you put the words ‘beautiful woman’ into Google, you’ll mostly see very similar images of seductive women. But on the streets of the world beauty has many more facets and I love to capture them,” she explains.

For Noroc, capturing beauty in this way is not simply about aesthetics but crucial to shaping the way we see other cultures and communities.

“We live in a time of hate and intolerance so it was important for me to send a message about love and diversity. I created many contrasting juxtapositions in the book to show that although we are so different, we are all part of the same beautiful family,” she says. “Beauty has no borders, so kindness and tolerance shouldn’t have either.”

Mihaela Noroc Self-portrait by Mihaela Noroc

When finding her subjects, most of the time Noroc approaches the women on the street, but she is also contacted by people on social media with suggestions for women to photograph.

When asked to define what makes a good subject, she explains that selecting the women is largely “instinctive”.

“I walk almost continuously on the streets of the world. And in all these crowded places you don’t have a lot of time to think. Everything is instinctive like when you’re driving a car,” she says. “The huge difference is that in photography you also put a lot of soul into the process, besides instinct.”

A perfect example of this is the woman who graces the cover of the book (below). Noroc was walking around the Ganga river, in Varanasi, India. It is a holy site for Hinduism, visited by thousands daily.

Noroc was drawn to one particular young woman who was preparing to make an offering.

Mihaela Noroc The Atlas Of Beauty cover, by Mihaela Noroc

“Her serene expression seemed to be from another world, and the morning light was great. I was so fascinated by this magic moment that I entered deep into the river and I even forgot that my phone was in my pocket. In such atemporal moments, objects don’t mean anything. I asked her permission to take a photo and after that I let her continue the ritual,” she recalls.

“Usually, I try to spend more time with the women that I photograph. I take a few photos and listen to their stories. But this time, I didn’t have the chance, so we spent only a few seconds together.”

While many women are happy to be approached about the project, Noroc says there are women who have refused to be photographed.

“I have been refused by women living in conservative environments, who were preoccupied by what the other members of the community will say about them being photographed. Other times, by women living in dangerous places where they didn’t feel secure,” she says.

“All these refusals made me realise that many women in the world feel a lot of pressure. This convinced me even more that our world really needs an Atlas of Beauty to represent the struggles and the dreams of women from all over the world.”

My cousin was here from Ireland a few years ago and summed up Sydney drivers like so: ""It's like everyone has a boat, but they're like 'beep beep get outta my f**kin way I need to get to the beach and relax on my boat'.""

Flash forward a year and there's this huge bloke who's blocked me and my wife Tracy into a cul de sac in Canterbury, and he's out of his car and challenging me to a fight.

Minutes earlier, apparently, we'd gotten in the way of his boat ride. We were cruising down a wide but quiet street and old mate was right up our bums, so Tracy pulled over to let him pass.

Admittedly I gave him a sarcastic thumbs up as he passed. ""He's on his way to pick up his boat,"" I said, or something like that.

Suddenly, old mate screeches to a halt and gets out of his car. ""Why'd you stick your finger up at me?"" he yelled.

Um.

He comes at us. ""Do you wanna fight me?"" he shouted.

People who know me sometimes confuse my lyrical and silky Irish tones for exaggerated flair, so you can take this cold-hard-print as gospel truth; this bloke was a giant. He looked like Bane from Batman but with a moustache and a slightly shorter jacket. Bull shoulders coated in fur emerging from a tiny Silver VW Polo like a dreadful cosmic joke.

He starts coming towards us. ""Get out of the car, pussy"". Or something.

At the time, Tracy and I were home in Australia on holiday from our jobs in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, one of the world's car jacking capitals.

We didn't need this shit.

Tracy reversed the car back 50 metres, then drove around him and through a STOP sign to get away. She'd had some near misses in Moresby and wasn't going to take it from this bloke.

So we continued on our way. But this guy hops back in his car and starts chasing us through the streets. We end up in another cul de sac with his car across the street and him out of it blocking our only escape.

""Come on, fight me! Why'd you stick your finger up at me?""

Tracy and I had only left the house that day to pick up some work equipment from home base. Clutching my shiny new tripod I make for the door handle. I'm pretty stressed at this point.

The People's Republic of The Inner-West was, after all, our oasis after an extremely stressful year in PNG (a mutiny, a political crisis and guns, guns, guns in my face, while Tracy got two strains of Malaria, and I lucked out with one.)

So I was stressed, Tracy was stressed and Bigger Bane from Batman was stressed. Something had to give.

""I'm gonna batter this bastard"" I told Tracy, who suddenly (and wisely) locked the door.

""Nah,"" she said.

She reversed the car again, getting caught in a fast but complicated three point turn. Old mate advanced, stepped in the way and raged ""c'mon"", and then suddenly Tracy found herself driving towards him.

He jumped out of the way but grabbed my arm through an open window. Tracy pushed on, mounting the curb slightly and suddenly we were clear. She ducked around a few corners at speed and we were home. Safe.

It didn't occur to us to call the cops. Sorry about that. Again, stressful year in a country with sub-standard policing. If it happened again I'd be onto them in a shot.

Back In PNG, a year after our Canterbury drama, Tracy had another frightening experience. She was returning from a late night party with friends when a car suddenly pulled up in front of them.

A group of men, weapons in hand, got out and suddenly made for their car. Tracy's driver reversed, blowing a tyre on the jagged stump of a worn-out roundabout.

With sparks flying they drove at high speed through the pre-dawn darkness to the DFAT residences at Konedobu.

This morning I asked her which experience she found more stressful: PNG or Canterbury.

""Canterbury,"" she replied. ""In PNG it was somewhat expected. It's opportunistic and born out of poverty and desperation. But in Sydney it was just pure malicious, vindictive rage. I was not prepared for it to happen. That bizarre Sydney driver rage.""",Living In A Land Of Carjackings And Murder Was Less Stressful Than Driving In Sydney,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/eoin-blackwell/living-in-a-land-of-carjackings-and-murder-was-less-stressful-than-driving-in-sydney_a_23240658/

Zwar führt seit Februar Martin Schulz die Partei an - doch auch Ex-Parteichef Sigmar Gabriel ist für den Absturz der Sozialdemokraten verantwortlich

Der Außenminister hat nun angedeutet, dass er seine politische Karriere beenden könnte

Sigmar Gabriel gewährt einen Blick in sein Seelenleben. Es sei schon ein ""ganz schräges Gefühl"", immer noch als Außenminister unterwegs zu sein, während die anderen an Jamaika basteln, erzählt er im ""Café Spesso"" in Hannover, Stadtteil Bothfeld.

Nebenan verramscht ein Matratzenladen seine Produkte zu Kampfpreisen, vor der Fensterfront donnert die Straßenbahn in die City. Zwei alte Damen, die sich für den Vizekanzler im azur-blauen Jackett hübsch gemacht haben, verputzen vergnügt ihr Tiramisu.

Die SPD ist gerade bei der Bundestagswahl auf 20,5 Prozent abgeschmiert. Aus und vorbei. Keine neue GroKo in Berlin, wie Gabriel bis zum Schluss gehofft hat. Kein Ministeramt mehr. Bye-bye Weltpolitik. Opposition. Generationenwechsel bei den Sozialdemokraten. Für Gabriel ist da kein Platz mehr in der ersten Reihe. Jedenfalls sieht es derzeit stark danach aus.

""Na, hast Du Dich schon daran gewöhnt, nicht mehr wichtig zu sein?""

Im neuen ARD-Deutschlandtrend geht es mit der Popularität des Chefdiplomaten bereits steil bergab.

Seine Frau Anke stimme ihn längst auf die Zeit nach dem grellen Scheinwerferlicht ein, sagt Gabriel. ""Na, hast Du Dich schon daran gewöhnt, nicht mehr wichtig zu sein?"", bekomme er seit der Bundestagswahl in Goslar zu hören.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Bild""-Zeitung: Sigmar Gabriel soll mit der Politik abgeschlossen haben - und einen neuen Job suchen

Der eigentliche Kampf finde eben nicht im Wahlkampf, sondern zu Hause statt, scherzt Gabriel bei der Veranstaltung in Hannover, die den Titel ""Auf ein Wort mit..."" trägt.

Edmund Stoiber, der frühere CSU-Ministerpräsident, richte immer schöne Grüße an Anke aus. Sie sei ""der einzige Mensch mit Verstand"" im Hause Gabriel - die Zahnärztin, mit der der 58-Jährige gerade erst noch ein kleines Mädchen bekommen hat, ist Bayern-Fan. Gabriel drückt Werder Bremen die Daumen.

Die im Minutentakt in freier Rede den Jusos und Omas dahingeworfenen Anekdoten sollen den Schmerz überspielen, der ihn ohne Frage plagen dürfte.

Gabriel trat hinter Schulz zurück

Siebeneinhalb Jahre war der frühere Lehrer, der als Kind unter einem hasserfüllten Nazi-Vater litt, SPD-Vorsitzender. So lange wie keiner seit Willy Brandt. Anfang Januar, nach Monaten des Zauderns, trat er zurück. Gabriel überließ Martin Schulz die Bühne.

""Mach Du es, mich wollen sie nicht"", sagte er da zu Schulz, der nur kurz im 100-Prozent-Glück baden durfte. Die Partei, die mit Gabriel stets haderte und er mit ihr, applaudierte. Die Rede war von einer heroischen Tat.

Mittlerweile sind andere Töne zu vernehmen. Spitzengenossen glauben, Gabriel habe nicht ganz uneigennützig gehandelt. Als er Frank-Walter Steinmeier gegen den Willen der Kanzlerin zum Bundespräsidenten machte, war für ihn selbst der Weg ins Auswärtige Amt frei.

Schulz sollte sich als Kanzlerkandidat abstrampeln, um dann Seit' an Seit' mit Gabriel in einer neuen Groko zu landen. Daraus wurde nichts. Drei, vier Prozentpunkte fehlten der SPD, sonst wäre Gabriels Kalkül aufgegangen.

Noch ist Schulz als Parteivorsitzender da, Olaf Scholz, Manuela Schwesig warten ab. Das neue Machtzentrum liegt in der Fraktion, bei Andrea Nahles. Und Gabriel? Kann er damit seinen Frieden machen?

Nach der Wahl tauchte Gabriel ab

Nach der Wahl fiel er in Loch. Am Abend des 24. September stand er im Willy-Brandt-Haus ganz hinten auf der Bühne. Geduckt, erschüttert. Zehn Tage lang tauchte Gabriel ab. Seine Mitarbeiter machten sich Sorgen. Dann meldete er sich zurück. Wo? Natürlich in der Heimat.

Vom ""roten Klops"" spricht Gabriel stolz. Während die SPD überall den Bach runterging, verteidigten Gabriel und seine Mitstreiter die Bastion Braunschweig und Umgebung. Er holte mit knapp 43 Prozent wieder sein Direktmandat - das zweitbeste Ergebnis eines SPD-Kandidaten im ganzen Land. ""Wir kümmern uns jeden Tag, nicht nur vier Wochen vor der Wahl.""

Er gab dem Kreml-nahen TV-Sender ""Russia Today"" ein umstrittenes Interview, um die Russland-Deutschen in seinem Wahlkreis zu erreichen: ""Mit denen redet doch sonst keiner.""

Demnächst, wenn er nicht mehr ""Mister Wichtig"" in Berlin ist (""Ich hab' ja jetzt Zeit""), will er einen VW-Bus mieten, einen pensionierten Arbeits- und Sozialrechtler einladen und jene Stadtteile abklappern, wo 40 Prozent der Menschen AfD gewählt haben.

Die SPD dürfe der schwierigsten aller Fragen jetzt nicht ausweichen: ""Warum waren wir so sehr zufrieden mit unserem Programm, aber die Wählerinnen und Wähler nicht?"" Der Fokus auf soziale Gerechtigkeit habe die Menschen nicht überzeugt.

Die Deutschen hätten auf Stabilität geschaut - und dort, wo der Staat Schulen, Krankenhäuser und Bushaltestellen dichtgemacht habe, aus Protest die Rechten gewählt.

Nach der Wahl tauchte Gabriel ab

Gabriel kennt die Mechanismen in der SPD. Unter seiner Führung wurden die Pleiten von 2009 und 2013 verdrängt. ""Die Lieblingsausrede ist, die Plakate waren schlecht."" Einfach werde es nicht, es gebe sicher viele Gründe: ""Viele Hunde sind des Hasen Tod.""

Die SPD sei nicht nah genug an den Alltagssorgen der Bürger, zu elitär. Gabriels Funktionärs-Bashing ist berüchtigt. ""Könnt ihr Euch vorstellen, im SPD-Ortsverein steht einer auf und sagt: Ich bin Raucher, gucke RTL und finde das mit den Flüchtlingen schwierig"", fragte er dieser Tage in Helmstedt in die Runde. ""Oder schließen wir ihn unmittelbar aus der SPD aus?""

""Irgendwann"" werde er sich mit Vorschlägen zur SPD-Erneuerung zu Wort melden. Für viele in der Partei dürfte das wie eine Drohung klingen.

In der Fraktion hoffen sie, Gabriel, der Architekt der Groko 2013, habe kapiert, dass seine große Zeit vorbei sei. Aber ist das wirklich so? Gabriel, der brave Hinterbänkler? Wie eine Abschiedstournee wirken seine Auftritte in Niedersachsen, wo SPD-Ministerpräsident Stephan Weil am Sonntag eine überraschende Titelverteidigung winkt, keineswegs.

Gabriel wird beobachten, was Andrea Nahles (die er lobt) an der Fraktionsspitze macht. Was aus dem angeschlagenen Schulz wird, den er bei seinen jüngsten Auftritten mit keinem Wort erwähnt.

Nach der Wahl tauchte Gabriel ab

Am Montag fliegt Gabriel noch mal zum EU-Außenministertreffen nach Luxemburg. Andere Auslandsreisen sind in Planung, bis Jamaika die Regierungsgeschäfte übernimmt.

Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU), der Bundestagspräsident wird, knallt er noch vor den Latz, die CDU wolle das Auswärtige Amt ""plündern"" und in der Europapolitik entmachten. Ein kostenloser Tipp für Cem Özdemir, sich nicht über den Tisch ziehen zu lassen.

Nach dem Kaffekränzchen in Hannover taucht Gabriel in Einbeck auf. Südniedersachsen, ""Hotel Panorama"", Publikum 60 plus, viel weißes Haar. Dort schließt sich für ihn gewissermaßen ein Kreis. Als junger Mann arbeitete er als Bierkutscher bei der ortsansässigen Brauerei, übrigens die älteste in Deutschland.

Fast jeder Sozialdemokrat hat von Gabriel schon mal die Geschichte erzählt bekommen, wie er als Fahrer täglich ein ""Deputat"" von sechs Flaschen Bier bekam. ""Der schönste Job meines Lebens"", sagt er auch jetzt. ""Ich hab' da nur aus gesundheitlichen Gründen aufgehört.""

Einem Jungsozialisten rät Gabriel, den alten Hasen zu widersprechen, mutig zu sein, den Laden aufzumischen. Wie er sich da so reden hört, sagt Gabriel grinsend: ""Ich schaufle mir mein eigenes Grab."" Um spöttisch nachzuschieben: ""Das ist auch schon ausgehoben.""

Aber wer weiß, bis zur Beerdigung seiner politischen Laufbahn könnte noch einiges passieren.

Clairement, ça sent le roussi à l'Édifice Price, puisqu'un ministère des Affaires anglophones a même été créé dans le but de s'assurer que les électeurs les plus fidèles du PLQ ne le désertent pas le premier octobre 2018.

Dans la foulée du remaniement, les commentateurs Luc Lavoie et Bernard Drainville ont laissé entendre que Philippe Couillard pourrait ne pas briguer un second mandat et préparerait Pierre Moreau pour la chefferie du PLQ. De plus en plus, les députés de son caucus n'ont plus aucune hésitation à parler contre lui publiquement, que ce soit le député de Chomedey Guy Ouellette ou Patrick Huot et Véronyque Tremblay, tous deux élus dans la région de Québec.

Après tout, c'est bien arrivé à la fin du second mandat de René Lévesque, lorsque les sondeurs lui préféraient Pierre-Marc Johnson...

Si ce n'était que de cela, on pourrait simplement dire que le PLQ, monument du paysage politique Québécois depuis 150 ans, traverse simplement une mauvaise passe et qu'il s'en remettra bien assez vite.

The chancellor faced criticism on Friday after he was asked about accusations from within the Tory party that he is taking too soft an approach to Brexit.

The Tory minister said it was time for the Conservatives to cease their in-fighting over the Brexit talks and said the “opponents” were on the “other side of the table”.

“I understand that passions are high, I understand that people have very strong views about this, but we are all going to the same place, we all have the same agenda,” he told Sky News.

“The enemy, the opponents, are out there on the other side of the table.

Auf dem Viktor-Adler-Markt im Bezirk Favoriten hatten sich die Wiener Sozialdemokraten am Samstagvormittag zu einer letzten Kundgebung vor der Nationalratswahl am Sonntag getroffen. ""Unser Favoriten“, sagt die Moderatorin auf der Bühne, in dem Wissen, dass an diesem Ort, der nach einem der Begründer der österreichischen Arbeiterbewegung benannt ist, mittlerweile auch die rechten Populisten der FPÖ ihre Kundgebungen abhalten.

Viele Hundert Menschen stehen im Publikum: Junge wie Alte, Studenten und Arbeiter. Helfer verteilen Schilder mit der Aufschrift ""Gemeinsam kommen wir weiter"". Ein Slogan, der nach dem mit allen Mitteln der Niedertracht geführten Wahlkampf nicht ganz ironiefrei wirkt.

Alle drei großen Parteien haben sich Mühe gegeben, den Gedanken an die durch den politischen Konsens geprägte politische Kultur der österreichischen Nachkriegsgeschichte wie einen historischen Irrtum aussehen zu lassen.

Während der deutsche Bundestagswahlkampf lange Zeit ereignislos dahin plätscherte, wirkte der politische Ideenstreit in Österreich wie eine Doppelfolge ""House of Cards"" nach dem fünften Obstler.

Nur die SPÖ geht in der Schlammschlacht unter

Ein früherer Berater von Christian Kern lancierte verleumderische Webangebote gegen Sebastian Kurz, dem Spitzenkandidaten der ÖVP.

Unter dem Titel ""Die Wahrheit über Sebastian Kurz"" wurden auf Facebook zum Teil ausländerfeindliche und antisemitische Inhalte verbreitet. Auch die ÖVP hatte zuletzt mit einem Skandal um die Verächtlichmachung der politischen Konkurrenz zu kämpfen.

Die FPÖ ihrerseits machte nie einen Hehl daraus, dass ihr Wahlkampf darauf basiert, die politische Konkurrenz madig zu machen. Überall in Österreich stehen Plakate, auf denen die angebliche Verlogenheit der ""Roten"" und der ""Schwarzen"" angeprangert wird.

Es ist jedoch allein die SPÖ, die in dieser wochenlangen Schlammschlacht nicht nur an Zustimmung, sondern auch ganz grundsätzlich an Glaubwürdigkeit verlor.

Was doppelt tragisch ist: Denn im Herbst 2017 deutet sich nicht nur das Ende der österreichischen Sozialdemokratie als staatstragende Kraft an. Eigentlich bräuchte Österreich gerade jetzt ein starkes Gegengewicht zu den Populisten und der nach rechts gerückten Kurz-ÖVP. Die beiden letztgenannten Parteien kommen in den Umfragen auf etwa 60 Prozent der Stimmen.

Kerns 18-Minuten-Rede war voll von Widersprüchen

Als Bundeskanzler Christian Kern die Bühne am Viktor-Adler-Markt betritt, wird deutlich, wo die systemischen Fehler liegen, die der SPÖ derzeit Zustimmungswerte auf der Flughöhe ihrer deutschen Schwesterpartei bescheren.

Kerns 18-minütige Rede war voll von offensichtlichen Widersprüchen, die man nur dann übersehen kann, wenn man seiner politischen Gesinnung anhängt wie ein Fußballfan seinem Lieblingsverein.

Einerseits beklagte Kern den schmutzigen Wahlkampf. Andererseits ließ er gut 20 Stunden vor Öffnung der Wahllokale keine Gelegenheit aus, um noch einmal ein paar rhetorische Tiefschläge zu verteilen.

Der SPÖ-Kanzler stellte sich – trotz aller bekannten Vorwürfe gegen die SPÖ-Kampagne – als Opfer der Medien dar.

""Es hat teilweise richtige Hetzkampagnen in einzelnen Medien gegeben"", klagte Kern. ""Dahinter steht die Idee, dass die glauben, dass sie sich gemeinsam mit der ÖVP aussuchen können, wer der nächste Bundeskanzler ist. Und zwar bevor die Menschen zu den Wahlurnen geschritten sind.""

Es gehe um die Interessen der ""95 Prozent"", und nicht um die die von ein ""paar Superreichen und Herausgebern"".

Es sind Worte, die man anderswo in Europa eher von jenen erwartet, die sich verschwörerisch zuraunen, dass ""die Eliten"" mit Hilfe eines ""Masterplans"" das ""Volk"" um ihr Recht betrügen wollten. Nur dass so etwas in Österreich aus dem Munde des amtierenden Bundeskanzlers kommt.

Der Kanzler wittert eine Verschwörung

Kern unterstellt seinen politisches Kontrahenten außerdem – ohne das so zu nennen – ein oligarchisches Geschäftsmodell. Reiche Geschäftsleute hätten sich mit ihren Spenden politische Positionen bei der ÖVP erkauft, und die FPÖ diene sich als Vollstreckerin dieser Absprachen an.

""Es ist bemerkenswert, wie sich die Freiheitlichen hier den Steigbügelhalter für die Interesse der Großspender von Sebastian Kurz machen"", so Kern. ""Da machen ein paar Leute den Deal ihres Lebens: Du spendest ein paar Millionen, und kriegst Milliarden zurück.""

Auch einen sexistischen Seitenhieb auf die ÖVP konnte sich Kern nicht verkneifen: Die ehemalige Chefberaterin von Ex-Bundeskanzler Wolfgang Schüssel sitze nun ""auf dem Schoß"" von Sebastian Kurz.

Doch es sind nicht nur diese heftigen, bisweilen diffamierenden und unbelegten Vorwürfe, die ein schlechtes Licht auf den Wahlkampf der SPÖ werfen. Bisweilen wirkte Kern so, als sei er dazu verdammt, alle inhaltlichen Fehler zu wiederholen, die bereits dem SPD-Kanzlerkandidaten Martin Schulz zum Verhängnis geworden waren.

Die Sozialdemokraten scheitern nach altem Muster

Kern sagte, dass die SPÖ für Steuergerechtigkeit und kostenlose Hochschulbildung kämpfen wolle. Die Reichen müssten ihren gerechten Anteil bezahlen, um das Gemeinwesen zu finanzieren.

Auch die deutsche SPD setzte auf einen Wahlkampf, der sich auf ""soziale Gerechtigkeit"" fokussierte. Ein wichtiges Thema. Doch ohne den Bezug auf ein funktionierendes Zukunftsbild – das ist die Lehre aus dem deutschen Wahlkampf – verfangen solche Forderungen nicht.

Es zeigte sich zum Beispiel: Wenn Menschen nicht mehr daran glauben, dass Bildung ihnen eine bessere Zukunft sichern kann, dann berührt es sie auch nicht, ob das Studium nun kostet oder nicht.

In einer Zeit, die immer stärker von einer Schutzhaltung vor dem Kommenden geprägt ist, schaffen es Sozialdemokraten in ganz Europa nicht mehr, die Menschen davon zu überzeugen, dass sie sich glaubwürdig für die Emanzipation des Individuums einsetzen.

Und Kern? Der lobte sich in seiner Rede auf dem Viktor-Adler-Markt auch noch dafür, dass es seiner Regierung gelungen sei ""von Monat zu Monat weniger Migration in Österreich“ zuzulassen.

Ein Slogan der Kern-Anhänger zeigt, dass seine Zeit vorbei ist

Es steht zu erwarten, dass die SPÖ am Sonntag am eigenen Leib spüren wird, wie betagt sozialdemokratische Politik im Jahr 2017 bisweilen wirkt.

Die Umfragen deuten darauf hin, dass die österreichischen Sozialdemokraten nicht nur ihr historisch schlechtestes Wahlergebnis einfahren werden. Nach dem derzeitigen Stand der Dinge ist es auch sehr unwahrscheinlich, dass sie an einer neuen Regierung beteiligt sein werden.

Auf dem Viktor-Adler-Markt skandieren die Anhänger von Kern nach dessen Rede ""Yes we can!"".

Ein zehn Jahre alter Slogan. Erfunden von einem Politiker namens Barack Obama, der heute hilflos zuschauen muss, wie sein rechtsradikaler Nachfolger Donald Trump das Land verändert. Eigentlich wäre damit schon alles gesagt. Wenn es nicht so tragisch wäre.

Michael Moore, célèbre réalisateur de documentaires américains, connu pour ses prises de positions tranchées, s'est attaqué à Harvey Weinstein et aux prédateurs sexuels dans une lettre ouverte, publiée sur Facebook ce vendredi 13 octobre.

Intitulée ""Profitons de ce moment pour créer un monde sans Harveys"", Michael Moore établit d'abord un constat sur les violences sexuelles faites aux femmes: ""Pourquoi vivons-nous dans une société où les hommes n'interviennent pas lorsqu'ils sont témoins de mauvais traitements faits aux femmes? Je suis intervenu plus d'une fois, et j'ai déjà renvoyé un homme qui harcelait sexuellement des femmes"". Le réalisateur en profite pour rappeler qu'il a été ""le seul à avoir intenté un procès à Weinstein (parce qu'il est un voleur, ce qui est une autre caractéristique de son côté sociopathe)"".

Il écrit ensuite: ""Tous autant que nous sommes (les hommes) devons endosser la responsabilité d'approuver l'existence d'une société dans laquelle les femmes ne se sentent pas en sécurité. Une société dans laquelle, quand elles sont agressées, elles ne peuvent pas raconter leur histoire sans peur d'être punies ni honte"".

Dans cette lettre ouverte, il demande de ""profiter de ce moment pour arrêter les agressions et abus de femmes dans notre industrie. Faisons de cette affaire un appel aux hommes pour qu'ils s'érigent contre les autres hommes qui perpétuent ce comportement criminel, pour qu'ils les nomment et les fassent taire. Nous pouvons le faire. Tout ce que cela requiert est de la volonté, et la décision de dire ""trop c'est trop!"".

Michael Moore s'adresse ensuite à plusieurs interlocuteurs: les agresseurs qui se reconnaissent (""vous savez qui vous êtes, et tous vos employés, passés et présents, savent qui vous êtes. (...) Vous avez deux options: démissionner ou faire face à une armée d'hommes et de femmes qui feront tout pour vous enlever votre pouvoir""), ceux qui ignorent les avertissements (""vous serez dénoncés, humiliés publiquement et, je l'espère, viré. Evitez ce sort cruel en vous retirant maintenant""), mais également aux hommes qui soutiennent les femmes dans ce combat (""C'est votre moment! (...) Si vous voyez quelque chose, vous devez le dire""), et enfin les directeurs des studios d'Hollywood. Le réalisateur leur demande de mettre en place la parité hommes/femmes.

The Challenges Faced By A Prison Psychiatrist Severely psychiatrically unwell prisoners are people who, very likely, have been failed by services over and over again. They are very likely to have had horrific experiences (abuse seems to come as standard for the women, and even the men that I have assessed in prison). Sure, some of them have made poor choices and may have wronged others, and that can't be ignored. Nevertheless, for those who are too unwell to look out for themselves, we, as an apparently mature, developed society should step in and shoulder some of the responsibilities. It is not always simple; there are complications and barriers, but there are no excuses for floridly unwell psychotic prisoners to be trapped inside cells for weeks and months awaiting treatment.

It was the fourth annual conference, having begun in 2014 as a response to the dire state of our ocean's health and the recognition of the importance of the seas and oceans in our lives.



With over three billion people directly depending on our oceans for their livelihoods the issue of ocean health cannot be ignored. Yet if you look around the world you cannot escape the fact that the state of our oceans has never been more precarious.



So at Malta, it was encouraging to hear from many people who wanted to take action; pledging a series of wide-ranging commitments to start reversing the damage done to our oceans.



HRH The Prince of Wales announced a bold blue economy initiative, with policies to support sustainable development. China committed to the creation of 66 'blue bays' around its coastline to protect marine life. And Carrefour announced that by 2020, half of all fish that it sells will come from sustainable sources.



The worrying truth is that the oceans face a range of issues, largely man made. One of those issues is ocean pollution and in particular the damage we are doing by the vast amounts of plastic washing up all over our shores. Our oceans are now drowning in plastic.



According to The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, without change, all the plastic in the ocean could weigh more than all the fish by 2050. The average UK household uses one rubbish truck's worth of single use plastics a year - contributing to the eight million tonnes of plastic that enters our oceans annually.



This is both dire and depressing, and the duty to act never so urgent.



At Sky we are determined to make a stand. Our Sky Ocean Rescue campaign will continue to shine a spotlight on the issues our oceans face, why they are happening and what can be done about it.



We have committed to transform our business and eradicate all single-use plastics from our operations, products and supply chains by 2020. As a start we have removed plastic bottles, cups, cutlery and straws from all our sites and replaced them with corn starch, or paper alternatives. Everyday stuff that soon adds up - we've already reduced our plastic bottle use by 300,000 in just nine months



We are also creating an Ocean Rescue Innovation Fund, anchored by our own capital to help spur innovation in this area. The fund will look for businesses and start-ups that are developing ideas and technology to eradicate single-use plastics from supply chains right across the globe and to stop plastic from ending up in the ocean.



We are inviting others to co-invest with us because we believe that by finding and funding the best ideas from around the world, we will discover new ways to help to solve this problem. By harnessing the capital, expertise and voice of the business community we can, together, accelerate innovation to reverse some of the damage already done.



The reality is not enough is being done by enough businesses. It needs us all to play our part. As an island nation, we are never more than 70 miles from the coast. This could not be more important. Three million people live on the coastline, hundreds of thousands more rely on the ocean for employment and almost every one of us for the food it provides.



This is a vast and complex issue, but what gives me hope is that there are some relatively easy, everyday things businesses can do. If you walked into a bathroom overflowing with water, what would you do? You wouldn't start mopping up the water... you would turn off the tap. So what can businesses do? Start by turning off the plastic tap. We have started. But we need more businesses to join us - now.",Why We Need To Turn Off The Plastic Tap,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jeremy-darroch/why-we-need-to-turn-off_b_18229486.html

Four Easy Tips For Stronger Pelvic Floor Muscles 1.
Activate the pelvic floor first, then the lower abdominal muscles to make sure the pelvic floor is getting all the benefit.
Another type of treatment is radiation therapy and both of these treatments can lead to weakened pelvic floor muscles.""","The pelvic floor muscles are responsible for supporting our organs from the bladder to the anus and all in between.

They're a great big sling of muscles that sit between the coccyx -- or tailbone -- all the way to the front near the bladder and also extend out to the side of the pelvis. It's really important to make sure your pelvic muscles are strong enough to hold you in place, but not too tight that they cause you pain.

So, if these muscles are so important, what kind of practical things can each of us do everyday to ensure our pelvic floor muscles are ship-shape?

It's important to make sure those pelvic muscles are happy and strong.

First of all, there is an easy test you can do to work out how strong your muscles are.

The Flow Stop

""If you sit on the toilet and you are about halfway mid-stream, and you are trying to cut off mid-stream. If you are able to do that then yes, you have got a correct pelvic floor muscle contraction,"" pelvic floor physiotherapist Sherin Jarvis told HuffPost Australia.

Do this once a month as an easy way to test how your pelvic floor is fairing.

Four Easy Tips For Stronger Pelvic Floor Muscles 1. Squeeze The Anus ""The muscles go all the way through to the coccyx and the muscle is actually pierced by the urethra and then the vagina and then the rectum and the anus go through the muscle,"" Jarvis said. ""If you don't squeeze in the anus then you have ignored half of the muscle's power."" 2. Get Both Locations Working ""The muscle has a dual action. It squeezes and it lifts up and forward -- so not in the direction of [the] head but up and behind [the] pubic bone and behind your belly button. Squeeze everything closed and then up and forward."" ""It's that action that helps you stay dry when you are coughing and sneezing,"" Jarvis explained. 3. Use The Lower Abdominal Muscles You know, the ones between your belly button and your pubic bone.These act as helper muscles to the pelvic floor, according to Jarvis. Use these to help the upward lift of the exercise rather than as the driver of the lift. Activate the pelvic floor first, then the lower abdominal muscles to make sure the pelvic floor is getting all the benefit. 4. Breathe Normally It might sound like a cliche, but it's important. ""You must be able to breathe normally when you do a squeeze and lift otherwise you will push down,"" Jarvis said. The pushing down will make the exercise less effective.

One of Jarvis' top tips when doing the exercises is to incorporate them into your daily routine, so you don't forget to do them.

""Maybe when you get on the bus or the train before you get your phone out and you look at your messages and Facebook, maybe you could do a set of pelvic floor exercises in the morning and then maybe the same at night,"" Jarvis told HuffPost Australia.

""[Do that] Monday to Friday and forget about the weekend.

""If you have triggers to remember to do the exercise, it is easier then to go, 'That's right, every time I get on the bus' -- make it a routine so you remember to do them.""

A daily trigger can act as a reminder to do your exercises.

Having proper pelvic floor function is important for both men and women and there is more to that than just organ support.

Urologist Dr Vincent Tse says that looking after the pelvic floor ensures avoiding pain and uncomfortable complications.

""Their function in women is to support the pelvic organs such as the bladder, uterus, vagina and the rectum,"" Tse told HuffPost Australia.

""The other important feature of the pelvic floor muscles in women is that they can prevent incontinence. The type that is associated with pelvic floor is stress incontinence and that's not stress that is created with psychological stress -- it is activity stress like coughing [or] sneezing.

""If we have strong pelvic floor muscles when you want to cough or sneeze and or pick up something there is actually a reflex that is built into that muscle that contract a split second before.""

A strong pelvic floor can prevent leaking when you cough or sneeze.

Tse says that pelvic floor strength is important for men who are treated for prostate cancer.

""Men also need good pelvic floor muscles mainly because there is a select group of men that develop prostate cancer when they get older,"" Tse said.

""One treatment ... for prostate cancer is what we call radical prostatectomy which is the total removal of the prostate. Another type of treatment is radiation therapy and both of these treatments can lead to weakened pelvic floor muscles.""

In the case of men who develop prostate cancer, they will be introduced to pelvic floor exercises before they undergo the surgery and a strong set of pelvic floor muscles ensures an easier recovery.

Ensuring your pelvic floor is in shape can reduce the chance of developing uncomfortable problems and generally improve your quality of life.

The South Africa that we want cannot be the current one where more than half of the South African population lives below the poverty datum line.
The South Africa that we want is summarised in the Freedom Charter, which is our democratic South Africa's foundational document.
The South Africa that we should aspire to is spelt out in the ten clauses of the Freedom Charter.
It is also the democratically representative that should be the custodian of what the South Africa should actually be that we aspire to have.","It is indeed a great honour for me to have been invited to the Gordon Institute of Business Science [GIBS] to share my views and our vision for a South Africa that all our citizens aspire to build. I think it is also necessary to deliver my thoughts on these socioeconomic issues at a business school like GIBS, because you play an important role in educating our future business and public leaders through your business and executive education programmes.

I say this, while I must simultaneously emphasise that I do not subscribe to any exclusivist or elitist idea that it is only economists and academics at institutions like yours that can have ideas and pronounce on our economy. Every single South African has the right to have their views about our economy heard, and to be taken seriously for those views, because of the economy and how it is structured impacts on the lives of each one of us.

However, what is important is that a world-class business institution such as you, that made us proud by having attained various international accreditations, have an important role to contribute to the critical conversation that so many concerned South Africans have about the current state of our economy and the urgent transformation that is required.

At the core of this serious engagement about the future shape that our economy must take is the reality that South Africans aspire to live in a country that is fundamentally just for all our citizens. This requires a growing economy that is inclusive, recognises that corrective action to redress the apartheid injustices of the past is essential, and will create opportunities for all our citizens. A fundamental -– and indeed non-negotiable -- requirement is that no-one should be left behind!

I am on record to have said that while the attainment of our non-racial democratic vote was a very important achievement and victory, our liberation struggle has never just been about the vote it has always also been about the economic liberation of all South Africans –- but especially about economic justice for the black majority [with a specific emphasis on Africans]. The reality is that we have not yet achieved such economic justice -– we still live in a deeply unequal society, where the fault-lines of that inequality are primarily defined by race.

That is why it remains so important for us to recognise, without any prevarication, that White Monopoly Capital still controls the destiny of the majority of black South Africans. I very deliberately refer to monopoly capital in South Africa as white, because that is the reality of our country, and that is what every black South African still experience daily on their very skins. An honest and productive discussion demands that we do not beat about the bush concerning these matters.

The South Africa that we want cannot be the current one where more than half of the South African population lives below the poverty datum line.

I am also on record to have said that there is no reason for anyone to feel threatened by us acknowledging this reality, because not recognising it and not taking the necessary steps to redress it, is far more problematic and dangerous. The current situation with the huge gap between the rich and poor, and with a disturbingly large number of unemployed young people, is untenable and will most definitely result in increasing socio-political instability. The real threat that all of us should be concerned about are the dire consequences if we do not address these issues practically and urgently.

More than half of South Africa's population has been left behind, as was evidenced by the recent statistics on poverty levels published by Stats SA. The South Africa that we want cannot be the current one where more than half of the South African population lives below the poverty datum line. It cannot be the South Africa where the Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, now stands at 0.69, and where there has been a reverse distribution from the poor to the rich with the share of national income having declined from 56 percent in 1995 to 51 percent.

The South Africa that we want is summarised in the Freedom Charter, which is our democratic South Africa's foundational document. With the current exploitative and unequal economic status quo in mind, the Freedom Charter necessarily and realistically calls for profound economic changes. It calls for radical agrarian reform to restore the land to our people, the wide spread restructuring of our financial institutions such as the big banks and insurance industry and where necessary nationalisation of key industries with the specific intention to fundamentally change the power dynamics in our economy in favour of the black majority, and to break the grip of White Monopoly Capital on the main economic centres.

The South Africa that we should aspire to is spelt out in the ten clauses of the Freedom Charter. Though we place equal weight on each of the separate clauses, the first five set out the most pressing political economic and social reforms our democratic state must embark on, and to my mind, it is the core. When we enact these measures socio-economic power will indeed transfer into the hands of the black [especially African] majority, and South Africa will be transformed from a country belonging to and being exploited by a small minority of white capitalists and their imperialist backers, into a country belonging to all who live in it –- black and white.

A developmental state approach is required to give the government the focus and stamina to push a policy agenda that will truly not leave anyone behind.

Therefore, before we proceed it is necessary that I remind you of the Ten Clauses of the Freedom Charter that summarise the South Africa we aspire to have:

1. The People Shall Govern!

2. All National Groups Shall have Equal Rights!

3. The People Shall Share in the Country's Wealth.

4. The Land Shall be shared among those who work It!

5. All Shall be Equal Before the Law!

6. There Shall be Work and Security!

7. The Doors of Learning and Culture Shall be Opened!

8. All Shall Enjoy Equal Human Rights!

9. There Shall be Houses, Security and Comfort!

10.There shall be Peace and Friendship!

It is exactly in this context that we talk about Radical Socio-economic Transformation [RET]. In our January 8th Statement of this year, the ANC said: ""We must focus on radical economic transformation. The economy must be in the hands of our people. We must return the land to the people, and we must dedicate more resources to education and in particular higher education and training.""

In the 2017 State of the Nation Speech [SONA] Radical Socio-Economic Transformation was described as follows: ""The quest for radical socio economic transformation must seek fundamental change in the structure, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership, management and control of the economy in favour of all South Africans, especially the poor, the majority of whom are African and female.""

A developmental state approach is required to give the government the focus and stamina to push a policy agenda that will truly not leave anyone behind. This approach also dovetails with the core aspirations of Africa Vision 2063, which I have championed when I was Chair of the African Union Commission.

The well-known White Monopoly Capital ownership and control of our economy will have to change so that private ownership patterns should reflect our population demographics.

Let me tease out the interrelated elements of Radical Socio-economic Transformation:

Structure: This is about the fundamental changes that are required in the composition of output in order to promote broad based industrialisation led by manufacturing and the agricultural value chain. It is critical that we reduce raw mineral exports, and increase value-added exports. We must drive value-addition of our raw minerals and local procurement in the course of infrastructure development and the delivery of basic services.

Systems: This includes the patterns and exchange of goods, services and financial flows within the economy, and between our economy and the rest of the world. It must also include a transformation of the value chains in favour of the black majority and legislation to ensure that the financial sectors will promote and provide affordable capital to black entrepreneurs.

Institutions: This refers to our economic organisations and the rules that govern their activities. In order to bring about Radical Socio-economic Transformation there are pieces of legislation that will have to be repealed or amended, and new legislation that will have to be introduced in order to make it possible to promote economic activity that will enhance black empowerment and prohibit White Monopoly Capital exploitation. Fundamental changes in the economic institutions will have to include changes in the way that existing forms of organisation in the economy are managed, and the introduction of new forms of people's orientated organisational structures in state institutions and associated agencies. This also entails the re-calibration of the roles of the state, private sector and cooperatives in the mixed-economy setup in favour of a stronger developmental state.

Ownership: The well-known White Monopoly Capital ownership and control of our economy will have to change so that private ownership patterns should reflect our population demographics. In this regard, it is our view that strategic sectors of the economy need to be owned by the people collectively through democratic state ownership. The issue of democratic state ownership is critical because otherwise Radical Socio-economic Transformation can become an elitist drive to enrich a minority in the black population. It must, therefore, be emphasised that the question of ownership cannot be separated from the degree and balance of state, the private sector and co-operative activity in a mixed economy. To my mind, a strong and economically interventionist developmental state will be essential in order to ensure that this balance remains in favour of the majority of black [especially African] people.

Management: This is about ensuring that the majority of managers are black [and actually reflect our population demographics], while their thinking and managerial practices in terms of the allocation of resources are driven by considerations of corrective action in favour of the black majority. Managerial decisions must be aligned with the overall national development plan in order to ensure the economic empowerment of the majority of black South Africans.

Control: Changes in economic control involve changes in the policies that regulate economic activity. So, for example, the developmental state should exert its control in order to ensure that a certain degree of value addition takes place before minerals can be exported. These changes in economic control will have to be accompanied by wide-ranging legislative reforms that must always be orientated towards giving increased economic control to a broad base of the black [African] majority.

We have no doubt that a radical restructuring of the unacceptable inequalities and skewed pro-white power balances in our economy will be essential for getting our economy back on track.

Having highlighted these critical elements let me now delve into the specific areas of our economy where their application are imperative for bringing about the South Africa we aspire to have.

The South African economic growth trajectory was interrupted by the financial crisis of 2008, and it has not been able to recover sustainability yet. From 1993 to 2016, South Africa's GDP growth averaged 2.9 percent. However, in the middle 2000's, when it reached the highest growth rate, the creation of new jobs and reduction of poverty levels still remained severely constrained. In reality, the growth that was registered was non-inclusive and jobless growth.

It did not benefit the majority of black [especially African] South Africans and was disproportionately advantageous to White Monopoly Capital and their control over the South African economy. So it is clear that when we talk about the need for inclusive growth it will not be achieved by maintaining the existing economic power relations. The only way we will secure inclusive growth, that will deliver jobs, will be by implementing Radical Socio-economic Transformation.

This is evident with the paradox that the current untenable system has led to between government and the private sector. The government is running a deficit that has been rising, while most of the corporate sector remains flush with excess capital balances, but there is an unpatriotic reluctance to invest domestically. Simultaneously foreign direct investment has been stagnant, while investment abroad by South African based corporates is on the rise.

We have no doubt that a radical restructuring of the unacceptable inequalities and skewed pro-white power balances in our economy will be essential for getting our economy back on track. Black Economic Empowerment needs to impact positively on our economy in new ways that will make all our citizens prosper by closing the opportunity, poverty and inequality gap. This will not happen through the 'invisible hand' of the 'free market' as neoliberal economists try to tell us, but it can be achieved through the deliberate implementation of Radical Socio-economic Transformation driven by a developmental democratic state.

The interventions of developmental states in our peer group economies in the BRICS countries succeeded to generate faster [and indeed inclusive] growth that generates jobs. We need to catch up with our peers. To achieve our ideal for a more prosperous, equal and more just society we need job creating growth of 5 percent that will move many South Africans who are currently stuck on the second level of the economy of insecure jobs and the informal economy, to the first level of secure and sustainable employment or entrepreneurship. The bridge that needs to be build to span that gap cannot be constructed by White Monopoly Capital in a free market, it will only come about through deliberate government intervention in a developmental state.

My dear fellow South Africans, together with all our people we need to dream again about enabling every citizen to realise the fruits of a democratic South Africa. I stand for a developmental state with macroeconomic management, job creation, skills development, enhanced service delivery, smart and job-creating infrastructure investment, smart-urbanisation, driving up domestic and foreign investment, enhancing the efficiency of state enterprises, entrepreneurship-orientated Black Economic Empowerment programmes and overall better and more affordable access to finance.

The excessive outsourcing by government departments is depriving the government of the opportunity to attract, develop and retain skills, and create jobs in government.

In order to achieve this, we must ensure that the South African Reserve bank will not hold onto an amorphous 'independency' but has as its clear and deliberate task to implement the developmental policies of the people's orientated developmental plan of the majority ANC government.

We will have to follow catalytic macro economic management setting targets for the National Treasury in terms of inclusive growth objectives that must be driven by the objective to create jobs and reduce poverty. We should keep track about how much poverty has been reduced. How many jobs have been created, and if the inequality gap narrows.

In this regard, all cabinet Ministers should be given performance targets, and underachievers should be told to find alternative employment.

Job Creation and in sourcing strategies in Government

The government has to contribute to creating opportunities for jobs through in sourcing strategies. Insourcing here means that government will develop skills, systems and processes to deliver most services that are currently outsourced. The excessive outsourcing by government departments is depriving the government of the opportunity to attract, develop and retain skills, and create jobs in government.

The government should introduce a comprehensive trainee program for those leaving university and others, so as to create a cadre of future employees. These additional employees can only be absorbed by the government if insourcing is the norm rather than outsourcing. This also makes it easier for government to target issues such as gender equity and empowerment in hiring policy.

There are about 460,000 national government employees, a further 1.2 million people working for provincial authorities, 320,000 people are employed by local authorities and 300,000 employees work for ""other government institutions"" like libraries, parks, zoos and education and training authorities. This adds up to a total of 2 million civil servants.

Through insourcing by the government, more jobs beyond the 2 million government jobs, can be created. The State Owned Enterprises [SOE's] need to make concerted efforts to increase employment. They should drop the requirement for previous experience for entry level job seekers, as long as they have the required academic qualification. This should be accompanied by a dedication to the overall training of youth in order to provide them with the skills that will increase their employability as in-job trainees.

Furthermore, in the private sector, the pioneering entrepreneurship spirit of South Africa business people and youth, needs to be kept alive and harnessed effectively. Part of getting this done requires a building of trust between government and the private sector. There is a need to create a sector-focused business advisory grouping, such as the banking sector advisory grouping, the manufacturing sector advisory grouping, the retail sector advisory grouping, and other appropriate groupings.

These advisory groupings must comprise key captains of industry in that sector, who should meet with government regularly, and advise the government on issues in their sector, that if dealt with by government, they will be able to ignite more investment, create more jobs and opportunity. The pioneering entrepreneurship spirit of all South Africans should be unleashed! We cannot only focus on foreign direct investment [FDI] but also need to pay attention to Direct Domestic Investment [DDI]. This is possible, given the cash-pile that SA corporate possesses.

One of the impediments to job creation is the existence of monopolies who have created an uncompetitive environment that has impeded new entrants into the economy, especially new black businesses.

The government has a role to play in opening up the economy through its procurement strategies. Currently, the bulk of procurement contracts by government departments are won by big businesses who have developed monopolistic practices. The government needs to map out the value chain of the services it requires and outsource these services to businesses of the previously disadvantaged. This will not only serve to give these new entrants business experience but also make their businesses more viable.

There is an imperative to train a cadre of people in procurement skills. A procurement certificate program must be launched and run by GTAC in National Treasury, working with South African education institutions like GIBS, for the certification and quality control. GIBs, you have a role to play!

Skills Development, Artisanal training and Education

The job creation agenda should recognise the need to develop more job-ready individuals with appropriate skills to enter the job market. This can be done with a bifurcated education system similar to that of Switzerland or Germany, which has both an academic channel into university degree and a vocational channel, where the degree course involves both work [internship] and study -- the result of which is a degree qualification with a strong practical streak.

The debate needs to shift from one of an outcomes-based education or not, to a job-readiness education model or not!

The second stream, with vocational education and work [internship], not only creates a pool of affordable workforce for business but makes the employees more job-ready when they attain their qualifications. Needless to say that, this will also contribute to solving the problem of funding higher education. It is not surprising that most learners in places like Switzerland prefer the vocational route with an internship with income earnings. South Africa should develop this model as a partnership between government, the private sector and education institutions. The debate needs to shift from one of an outcomes-based education or not, to a job-readiness education model or not!

Up-steam, there is need to invest in teacher-training colleges, making sure that teachers receive the best skills in delivering knowledge material to learners on both academic and vocational education.

Far more basic is the development of artisanal skills. Right through primary and secondary schools, simple artisanal skills should be taught along the academic curriculum. Such skills include sewing, woodwork, metalwork, arts and culture, technical drawing skills, among others. For example at grade 12 level, a learner could receive a certificate in woodwork in addition to a certificate in academic subjects. The artisanal skills course could be offered as an alternative to the Life Orientation course at Grade 12 level, for example. This will also enable those who wish to continue with artisanal activities to choose the vocational education route where these skills would then be further developed.

How about those people who have already left school, are unemployed or need new skills? For these individuals, artisanal training programs should be introduced in sewing, woodwork and furniture manufacturing, metal work and welding, car mechanics and repair, bricklaying, crafts [clay-pots for example], cultural activities, film industry, recording studios for music, among other skills. These programs could be run from the current TVET Colleges in additional to specialised institutions and programs.

Those who have acquired skills could form cooperatives for mass production of their products and to improve access to markets and access to finance. For example, women's groups could form cooperatives that produce crafts, such as traditional baskets, for both local and export markets.

On metalwork, learners could receive skills for the manufacturing of small agricultural equipment, as has been the case in countries in Asia, such as China.

State enterprises should also contribute tangibly to skills development and entrepreneurship. All state enterprises should run entrepreneurship programs, targeted procurement programs for SMEs, and also be involved in vocational skills development along with TVETs. Trainees should be able to acquire basic engineering skills through apprenticeship programs run by State Enterprises and TVETs. State enterprises should be a source of electricians, plumbers, mechanics, fitter and turners, for example, for the whole of South Africa.

The interests of a privileged few must never be elevated above those of the vast majority, who are black and African.

Entrepreneurship-driven Black Economic Empowerment model

Black Economic Empowerment [BEE] was introduced in South Africa in order to deal with economic imbalances created by the history of an apartheid system. While in the first phases BEE focused on share-transfer, there is a need to firmly shift this into an Entrepreneurship-driven Black Economic Empowerment [EBEE] model, focusing on the creation of new businesses rather than mere share purchases in existing businesses, I believe this will create new opportunities and grow the economic cake. For example, a BEE grouping invested in a listed company on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange [JSE] should be encouraged to reverse-list its BEE company on the JSE and raise new capital on the back of the BEE equity and grow its own business from there.

The key to growing BEE companies is not just to sell the shares for cash, but to increase and strengthen the balance-sheet of the BEE company so that its charts its own business path. Funding entrepreneurs for start-up and growth are also key to the EBEE model. Building entrepreneurship ecosystems to support these start-ups will go a long way in ensuring their future success.

Infrastructural Investment

South Africa should invest more in infrastructure that will have a greater impact per Rand spent and will create jobs. Whatever infrastructure projects are being implemented, these need to be implemented as public-private-partnerships [PPPs]. These infrastructure projects must primarily be driven by the Radical Socio-economic Transformation objectives of the developmental state to create jobs, deepen supply chains and generate innovation.

Key in order to succeed with all of this must be that the needs and interests of the broadest sector of the South African society must be addressed. Thus the interests of a privileged few must never be elevated above those of the vast majority, who are black and African.

The elements of this Freedom Charter anchored program for Radical Socio- economic Transformation are up for debate as the ANC, as the most important political organization in South Africa, moves towards our National Elective Conference. The critical issues that were raised at our National Policy Conference and were referred for further discussion in our branches cannot be avoided.

I re-iterate again that it just simply cannot any longer be allowed that the Reserve Bank be policy independent from government. The Reserve Bank must be aligned to support and implement government economic transformation policy. Furthermore, the private ownership of shares in the Reserve Bank must cease, and government must be the sole owner of all Reserve Bank shares.

A State Bank should be established that must be dedicated to promoting and funding black entrepreneurship through making affordable capital available. With regards to the ownership of our land, the concept of the willing buyer and willing seller must be rejected and replaced by land restitution without compensation. The state should take ownership of the land, and determine the preferred developmental objectives and tenure of the land as a national asset. In doing so government must prioritise agricultural training and integrate the usage of the land by integrating people into value chains.

Radical Socio-economic Transformation is in essence about a change in the ownership and control of strategic sectors.

It is important to understand that when the ANC says that the economy must be in the hands of the majority of the people, it discounts the transfer of strategic sectors into the hands a minority, be they black or white. The strategic sectors of the economy must be in the hands of a democratic government that controls the execution of its policies through a developmental state.

Such a democratic government is indeed the only institution that can justly claim to represent us all. It is also the democratically representative that should be the custodian of what the South Africa should actually be that we aspire to have.

Radical Socio-economic Transformation is in essence about a change in the ownership and control of strategic sectors. It will only succeed when the democratic government is at the centre, and it can only succeed when our country's basic resources are at the disposal of the people as a whole and are not manipulated by sections of society or individuals.

In proposing this I cannot imagine that any progressive and patriotic South African would oppose this plan to build a more just and equitable society.

South Africa is there for all to contribute economically and to benefit from. In the first democratic elections that the ANC participated in 1994, we promised A Better Life For All. Twenty-three years later we should keep that promise in mind. We dare not fail.

SANTÉ - Les One Direction peuvent avoir un effet néfaste sur votre santé. C'est en tout cas ce que semble suggérer l'histoire d'une fan du boys band britannique. L'Américaine anonyme, qui avait alors 16 ans, s'est lassée emportée par la passion lors d'un concert du groupe, il y a maintenant quelques années.

Elle a tellement crié que ses poumons se sont affaissés, comme le relayait le site Live Science ce mercredi 11 octobre. Son cas est tellement rare qu'il a même fait l'objet d'une étude de cas scientifique, publiée ce 4 octobre dans The Journal of Emergency Medecine.

Le lendemain du concert, a-t-elle expliqué à ses médecins, cette jeune américaine restait essoufflée. Un essoufflement qui perdurait encore le surlendemain. Elle s'est alors décidée à se rendre aux urgences du centre hospitalier universitaire de Dallas, au Texas.

Comme s'ils écrasaient du riz soufflé

Auteur de l'étude de cas, le docteur Mack Slaughter Jr. raconte que son souffle paraissait normal, même si elle respirait rapidement. Celui qui était interne au moment des faits poursuit néanmoins. En pressant leurs mains autour du cou et du thorax de la fille, les médecins notent un bruit étrange. Comme s'ils écrasaient entre leurs doigts du riz soufflé, décrit-il au site Live Science.

Pour les praticiens, c'était le signe d'un affaissement des poumons -en termes médicaux, un pneumothorax. Autrement dit, de l'air s'était enfuit de ses poumons par un trou ou une déchirure pour se réfugier dans sa poitrine.

Si la description peut paraître grave, le cas de l'adolescente n'était pas préoccupant, rassure le médecin.

Après une radio des poumons, l'équipe médicale lui a ainsi diagnostiqué un pneumothorax, c'est-à-dire la présence d'air entre les poumons et la cage thoracique. Puis un pneumomediastinum -de l'air dans l'espace qui sépare les deux poumons. Et enfin un pneumoretropharyngeum: de l'air à l'arrière de la gorge, cette fois.

Il est possible que les cris aient ouvert un trou dans sa trachée

""Des pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum et pneumorethropharyngeum spontanés sont rares, diagnostiqués séparément, et en plus la combinaison des trois doit encore être décrite dans la littérature scientifique"", témoigne l'étude de cas.

Malgré des examens sous scanner, les médecins n'ont pas pu trouver la déchirure par laquelle l'air aurait pu s'enfuir. Pour Mack Slaughter Jr., il est possible qu'un trou se soit ouvert dans la trachée de la jeune américaine sous la force de ses cris passionnés, puis qu'il se soit refermé aussitôt.

Après une nuit à l'hôpital, la patiente a pu rentrer chez elle, puis se rétablir complètement.

""Je ne me souviens pas d'autres cas où des poumons se seraient affaissés à cause de cris dans un concert de pop"", indique au HuffPost britannique la docteure Claire Morrison, du service en ligne MedExpress. ""Il y a une première fois à tout.""

If Diwali came around in July or August, firecrackers would not have caused as much pollution as they do in October or November. The main reason for the Delhi winter smog is the weather. The winds change in such a way they trap pollutants.

This is why Diwali firecracker pollution isn't a one-day affair that can be overlooked; at least in Delhi, meteorological conditions make sure the pollutants are trapped in the air for days. In 2016, there was a clear spike in air pollution in the days following Diwali.

This year, thanks to the Supreme Court, we'll have data to tell us the link between firecrackers and pollution. Banning the sale of firecrackers in Delhi NCR till 1 November, the Supreme Court said yesterday, ""We are of the view that the order suspending the licenses should be given one chance to test itself in order to find out as to whether there would be positive effect of this suspension, particularly during Diwali period.""

If the SC's ban on sale of firecrackers is strictly implemented across Delhi and NCR, it will help us compare the pollution figures around Diwali in 2015 and 2016. In both years, Diwali and the days after saw a significant spike. And this year, Delhi has a lot more pollution meters to gather data.

The Supreme Court's experiment of banning the sale of firecrackers is worth trying because already we have enough data to show that pollution does go up immediately after Diwali.

It is possible that by 1 November, we may find that banning firecrackers has not resulted in changing the annual spike in air pollutants. If that happens, we'll be able to conclude that Diwali firecrackers are an insignificant contributor. It may be a hint that the burning of harvest residue by farmers in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh is a greater contributor.

The Supreme Court's experiment of banning the sale of firecrackers is worth trying because already we have enough data to show that pollution does go up immediately after Diwali. One study in 2015 found outdoor PM 2.5 particulates increase by as much as 3.5 times.

In 2016, people probably didn't burst any more crackers than they did in 2015. But meterological conditions were worse. Slow wind speed meant firecracker pollutants wouldn't disperse easily, leading to smog so strong that visibility dropped to 200 meters.

For days the smog wouldn't leave town. It came to be known as the Great Smog of Delhi.

Commuters drive amid heavy smog in New Delhi on October 31, 2016, the day after the Diwali.

NOT WORTH EVEN A DAY

Even if Diwali increases air pollution only for a day or two, that's not something Delhi can afford given Delhi's already unbearable pollution levels. Studies have shown the exceedingly high PM 2.5 and 2.10 levels are making people sick, shortening their lives, and could be causing as many as 8 deaths.

It is not reasonable to argue that if we are unable to stop farm fires, Diwali firecrackers must be allowed to pollute the air as well.

One study found 70% respondents in a resettlement colony in Delhi had respiratory problems after Diwali. PM 2.10 is dangerous because they are particles so small they enter the lung. PM 2.5 is fatal because they are particles that enter the blood from the lungs, a silent killer.

The impact of Diwali firecracker on respiratory health, especially that of infants, asthamatics and the elderly, is well documented. Last year, doctors in Gurgaon found respiratory diseases among children tripled after Diwali. This alone should be good enough reason to ban firecrackers. We are not even talking about the large numbers of children who suffer burns from firecracker accidents.

NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

There are those who argue that farm fires weren't the main reason for the November 2016 smog, such as the Met department. ""Had farm fires been the reason for the smog, cities between Delhi and Punjab would have also witnessed low visibility conditions, but that was not the case,"" IGI Met director-in-charge R K Jenamani told The Times of India after Diwali in 2013.

Or perhaps the weather in Delhi NCR is particularly conducive to trapping pollutants?

The point is, we have a paucity of data and studies on pollution in Delhi and its suburbs. What we do have is often conflicting.

There is little doubt that all sources of pollutants must be brought down. Some argue that main cause of winter pollution is not Diwali firecrackers but road dust, forgetting that Diwali firecrackers turn into road dust.

Some argue the main cause is vehicular pollution, but the failed odd-even car rationing did not bear this out. During the odd-even experiment when pollution did decrease it was more on account of weather conditions. On poor weather days, the smog was as bad as ever.

It is not reasonable to argue that if we are unable to stop farm fires, Diwali firecrackers must be allowed to pollute the air as well. Similarly, farmers could argue why they are being punished when Diwali firecrackers are allowed.

A top view of heavy air pollution on the day after Diwali in 2016.

NOT JUST FIRECRACKERS

It is factually incorrect to say that only Diwali firecrackers are being targeted. Last year, shocked by government inaction over tackling air pollution, the Supreme Court ordered the union environment ministry to come up with a plan in just 48 hours. Here is the plan.

Amongst the temporary or permanent bans the crackdown on pollution has seen is the banning of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana – not so easy to implement because other means of stubble disposal are expensive. Punjab is threatening to deny loans to farmers to burn stubble, and Haryana is filing cases.

Other temporary bans have included those on cars on odd-even days, on trucks entering Delhi, on construction during peak pollution days, on a thermal power plant in the winters. It is therefore simply not true that Diwali firecrackers are being singled out.

A lot more needs to be done, surely. What's coming in the way is that both Modi and Kejriwal governments are not showing a sense of urgency and panic. Implementing the plan devised by the Supreme Court-monitored panel requires co-ordination between 16 government agencies. We can guess how smooth that process would be.

Polluting particles are present in the environment throughout the year. If the winter weather traps and circulates them in the air, the monsoon rains wash them down to the ground. Ultimately, Delhi will have to do mass scale water sprinkling and even think of artificial rain to make Delhi breathe-able in winters.

NOTHING HINDU ABOUT FIRECRACKERS

Those opposed to the banning of firecrackers also argue that it's an assault on Hindu religious rights. Originating in China, firecrackers have nothing to do with the Hindu faith and are not a religious requirement in Diwali. The festival of lights is not the festival of smoke and fury.

They say why doesn't the Supreme Court ban construction or motor vehicles altogether. Quite simply, those are necessities, and even they are often restricted in the fight against air pollution. Firecrackers are not a necessity.

It is hypocritical for one to champion animal rights on Bakra Eid but not on Diwali. Birds die, pets go into shock.

They also argue that Diwali firecrackers should not be banned unless sacrificial slaughter of animals during Bakra Eid is also banned. This makes little sense: sacrificial slaughter of animals does not increase PM 2.5 particles in the air. The morning after Diwali, the smog adversely affects everyone: Hindus and Muslims, human and animals.

It is hypocritical for one to champion animal rights on Bakra Eid but not on Diwali. Birds die, pets go into shock.

They further argue that banning firecrackers around Diwali alone is anti-Hindu. They should be banned throughout the year. People use them on New Year's eve for instance. Agreed. The Supreme Court has itself said this is a trial. If data shows substantially less pollution in Delhi NCR this Diwali as compared to last few Diwalis, the SC is likely to extend the ban permanently.",In Defence Of The Supreme Court’s Ban On Sale of Firecrackers In Delhi NCR,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/10/in-defence-of-the-supreme-court-s-ban-on-sale-of-firecrackers-in-delhi-ncr_a_23238237/

ALIMENTATION - Mangez-vous des carottes 100% bio? Contrairement à ce qu'on peut penser, une enquête de France Télévision révèle, ce jeudi 12 octobre, que les carottes bio proposées en grandes surfaces ne sont pas toutes vendues sans pesticides. Riche en vitamines et deuxième légume préféré des Français, la carotte est connue pour retenir facilement les pesticides. Dans le cadre de cette enquête, 8 marques ont été testées: 4 provenant de l'agriculture classique et 4 autres marques, certifiées biologiques, toutes produites en France.

Et le résultat à de quoi surprendre. Après analyse dans un laboratoire certifié, du côté des carottes cultivées de manière classique, aucune trace n'a été décelée dans les produits des enseignes Leader Price et Carrefour. Pour celles vendues chez Lidl et par un primeur de quartier, elles contiennent des traces qui restent toutefois ""inférieures aux limites maximales autorisées"".

Concernant les carottes bio, certaines enseignes sont ""irréprochables"" d'après les analyses, comme chez Naturalia, La vie Claire ou Carrefour. Celles de la marque Bio c'Bon en revanche, ont présenté ""des résidus de trois produits phytosanitaire"". Des produits qui sont interdits dans la culture biologique.

Résultat: ""Nos carottes non-bio achetées 89 centimes le kilo contiennent moins de résidus que ces carottes bio à 2 euros 10"", constate donc France 3 dans son reportage.



Des tests de pesticides sur les carottes bio

L'entreprise dément

Contactée par la chaîne, Bio c'Bon se défend et estime que ""la qualification bio n'est pas susceptible d'être remise en cause."" Selon l'enseigne, ""l'évolution de l'écosystème peut expliquer la présence de quantité infime de ces produits, mais ne saurait remettre en cause la rigueur et le process biologique de nos producteurs.""

En France, la loi tolère en effet la présence de résidus de pesticide dans les produits bio en cas de contamination accidentelle. Une explication qui pourrait justifier le cas de ""Bio c'Bon"", d'après l'UFC Que Choisir.

L'association de consommateurs rassure également sur son impact sur la santé, les taux sont trop faibles pour provoquer un problème de santé publique, mais s'inquiète de cette nouvelle sur le plan éthique.

""J'ai placé la question de l'accès aux soins au rang de mes priorités"", a déclaré Agnès Buzyn, 48 heures avant de présenter un plan de lutte contre les déserts médicaux. Accompagné du premier ministre, elle dévoile ce vendredi 13 octobre dans la Haute-Vienne des mesures pour faire face à un constat alarmant dressé en 2016 par l'Ordre des médecins: il y aura, en 2025, un quart de généralistes en moins par rapport à 2007 alors même que la France n'a jamais compté autant de docteurs.

""Le problème, est que l'exercice de la profession a profondément changé. Il faudrait des procédures pour les inciter à venir dans les zones défavorisées. Si la liberté de s'installer doit être préservée, on pourrait imaginer que là où il y a suffisamment de praticiens, que cette liberté soit dissociée du fait d'être conventionné"", imagine Didier Reveau, le maire (UDI) de La Ferté-Bernard.

Cette commune de 9500 habitants dans la Sarthe, au coeur d'un bassin de population de 30.000 personnes à moins de deux heures de Paris, est confrontée à cette difficulté depuis qu'en 2010, trois généralistes ont fermé leur cabinet médical pour partir à la retraite. Du jour au lendemain, 8000 patients ont été confrontés au problème de trouver un nouveau médecin, ceux déjà installés ayant une patientèle déjà complète.

""Ce n'est pas faute d'avoir tout tenté pour les remplacer, se rappelle celui qui était alors adjoint. Nous avions ainsi démarché 1500 généralistes de la région parisienne pour leur proposer de venir s'installer. Nous leur proposions des locaux et même une voiture pour les attirer."" En vain. Seulement sept se sont rapprochés de la mairie mais aucun n'a finalement franchi le pas. S'installer en libéral dans une zone rurale (Le Mans est à 40 minutes de voiture) ne correspondait pas à leur envie.

Un contrat à 42h par semaine payés 4500 euros par mois

Le maire de l'époque, Jean-Carles Grelier (qui a cédé son siège après avoir été élu député LR en juin) fait alors un choix radical mais payant: salarier un puis plusieurs praticiens et répondre ainsi aux souhaits des médecins qui, selon une étude de l'ordre sont 66% à aspirer au statut de salariés. ""Nous étions alors les premiers du Grand ouest à faire ce choix pour pallier un manque"", rapporte son successeur.

A la suite de discussion avec la Sécurité sociale et l'Autorité régionale de santé (ARS), un premier docteur est recruté. Après quelques années dans l'armée, il s'était installé dans les Pyrénées-Orientales mais voulait en finir avec le rythme infernal de l'exercice libéral. Pendant quelques semaines, il a travaillé sur le projet de centre de santé qui a finalement ouvert en septembre 2011, moins d'un an après que l'idée a été lancée.

Le contrat présenté est clair et avantageux: 42 heures par semaine (du lundi au vendredi) payées selon la grille des praticiens hospitaliers, soit environ 4500 euros par mois. Le généraliste exerce dans un local municipal avec l'aide d'une secrétaire pour la prise de rendez-vous et la gestion des tâches administratives. Problème pour la cohabitation avec les libéraux du secteur: son contrat rend impossible les gardes nocturnes et le week-end. ""Les liaisons ont été un peu compliquées dans les premiers temps mais avec le temps tout s'est apaisé. Parmi les huit médecins que nous avons eu sous contrat depuis septembre 2011, deux sont même devenus libéraux dans le secteur"", se félicite Didier Reveau dont le seul regret est de ne pas pouvoir -la loi ne l'y autorise pas- leur faire signer directement un CDI.

L'autre motif de satisfaction est le coût (quasi-nul) pour la municipalité. En six ans, ce sont 64.565 consultations qui ont eu lieu dans cette nouvelle maison de santé (où il y a eu jusqu'à trois salariés simultanément). Les dépenses de fonctionnement (remise en état du local et salaires) ont atteint 2.064.293 euros tandis que les consultations ont rapporté 2.022.606 euros; quand ils font leur chèque, les patients règlent au trésor public, l'argent entrant directement dans les caisses de la ville. ""En clair, c'est un service public qui ne coûte pas cher"", salue Didier Reveau.

Un Espagnol vient visiter la ville la semaine prochaine

Avec cet établissement qui est devenu un exemple pour de nombreux territoires ruraux et péri-urbains, les élus fertois pensaient bien avoir trouvé la parade au manque de généralistes. Seulement cette année 2017 place la municipalité devant une situation inédite: elle ne parvient pas à trouver un successeur à un médecin décédé il y a quelques mois.

""Les étudiants que nous contactons ou les jeunes docteurs préfèrent faire des remplacements. Nous sommes contraints de nous tourner vers l'étranger pour nos recherches"", constate le maire. La municipalité vient de prendre contact avec le cabinet Sup'Garcia -installé à Pau- qui s'est fait une spécialité de faire venir en France des spécialistes hispaniques. C'est un professeur franco-espagnol qui est derrière la structure. Il recrute les médecins et leur apprend le français pour qu'ils puissent satisfaire aux exigences de l'Ordre. ""Un premier vient découvrir la ville la semaine prochaine. Nous espérons avoir deux Espagnols au début de l'année 2018"", reprend Didier Reveau.

Ils ne devraient pas être les seuls praticiens européens à venir combler le vide dans cette commune sarthoise. Un rapprochement est en cours avec le centre hospitalier pour faire venir deux pédiatres grecs dans les prochains mois.

When it comes to retail therapy, that emotional money trigger may be getting the best of you.
Dealing with your money triggersIf our money triggers are tied to our emotional well-being, how do we deal with our spending?","Despite being a ""personal finance expert,"" I sometimes find that I'm prone to overspending. I'm usually great at staying the course, but like most people, I have moments or times in my life where I spend more than I normally do. I try not to get too upset about it, but I've also wondered, what's the cause of this excess spending?

Often the reason is just laziness. It's so much easier to buy dinner as opposed to cooking and is it really a big deal if I treat myself to a slice of cake every now and then? Probably not, but it seems like I tend to overspend at certain times and I've recognized a bit of a pattern.

My money trigger

I have this weird obsession with sweets. I seriously can't get enough of them. It could be cake, cupcakes, doughnuts or chocolate chip cookies; I want them all. I'm always looking for an excuse to devour those delicious treats, but usually, I just convince myself that I deserve a treat. I should also note that one my co-workers also loves cake, so we end up enabling each other, but that's why we get along.

I clearly have a sweet tooth, but I honestly think my money trigger might be psychological. It's not like I NEED a piece of cake, but for some reason, I get a rush out of spending money even if it's just a dollar or two. Perhaps it's boredom, but I think many people can relate to that feeling you get when you make a purchase for yourself.

Oddly enough, even though I know my money trigger, I'm OK with it, since it's not costing me too much. That being said, these small purchases can add up, which is why you need to figure out your triggers and how they may be affecting your financial well-being.

What your money trigger might be

Now, you might not binge on one specific thing like I do, but an emotional money trigger applies to many of us. Do any of the following scenarios apply to you?

Fear of missing out: Referred to as FOMO by all the cool kids, this can apply to a variety of situations. Maybe you've seen your friend taking a cool vacation or posting pictures of the newest food trends on Instagram and now you want to do the same. It's easy to get in on the action, but if you don't have the money saved, you might put it on your credit cards which will cost you big in the long run.

You don't want to miss out on a deal: This problem used to affect me a lot. I would see something on sale, and I would buy it. It's kind of funny when you think about it. You have to spend money to save money. How does that make any sense? I would usually justify the purchase by saying I got a deal, but what's the point if I never needed it in the first place?

Retail therapy: Let's be honest, spending money feels good, especially when it's cake. When it comes to retail therapy, that emotional money trigger may be getting the best of you. If you're making small purchases, it's probably OK, but if you're overspending just to get your fix, things could out of hand fast.

Being alone: I used to think it was odd when people would spend money when they're alone, but there might be a variety of reasons why you're feeling this way. Perhaps you've moved to a new place and are struggling to make friends or perhaps you simply get restless while being at home. Spending money to get you back in the right mindset makes sense at times, but how much are you willing to spend?

Dealing with your money triggers

If our money triggers are tied to our emotional well-being, how do we deal with our spending? It's not like we can just tell our brain to stop feeling a certain way and seeing a psychiatrist might be a bit much.

The solution is simple. Continue to spend!

Now hear me out, I'm not suggesting that you buy whatever you want to feel better, but if you budget for your purchases, is it really a big deal if you want to buy a new top?

Spending money to get you back in the right mindset makes sense at times, but how much are you willing to spend?

The same thing applies to major purchases. FOMO won't be an issue if you're budgeting for vacations and eating out. Soon enough it'll be your friends who have FOMO.

Keep in mind that you still need to be realistic about your budget. It doesn't make much sense to allocate the majority of your income to fun stuff while ignoring saving for the long term.

I know, saving is never fun, but a balanced budget is something to be proud of. More importantly, there's no need to feel guilty when you make those inevitable purchases.

Figuring out your own money triggers shouldn't be too hard. Getting over them can be the tricky part. Try to avoid any situations where you'll be tempted to spend or think big picture and prioritize where your money goes.

Wie verhält man sich am besten, wenn man merkt, dass der Partner kontrollsüchtig ist? Malcolm Applegate suchte jedenfalls statt einem offenen Gespräch einen außergewöhnlichen und extremen Weg: Er verschwand, ohne jemandem Bescheid zu geben, für zehn Jahre.

Die ersten fünf Jahre lebte der Engländer in einem Wald, bevor er in ein Obdachlosenheim in Südlondon zog. Auf der Webseite des Heims veröffentlichten die Mitarbeiter nun Malcolms ungewöhnliche Geschichte. Die Schuld an seiner Obdachlosigkeit gibt er seiner Frau.

“Je mehr ich arbeitete, desto wütender wurde sie”

Er berichtet, dass er 25 Jahre lang als Gärtner gearbeitet hatte, bevor ihn das Verhalten seiner Ehefrau immer mehr belastet habe. “Je mehr ich arbeitete, desto wütender wurde sie”, erzählte Applegate den Mitarbeitern. “Ihr Verhalten geriet außer Hand und sie verlangte von mir, immer weniger zu arbeiten. Nachdem ich lange versucht habe, unsere Ehe zu retten, beschloss ich zu gehen.”

Daraufhin habe der Gärtner für fünf Jahre in einem dichten Wald gezeltet und in einem Altersheim in der Nähe gearbeitet. Dann hörte er von dem Obdachlosenheim, das ihm half, neue Arbeit zu finden und ihm ein Dach über dem Kopf schenkte.

Seine Schwester dachte, er sei bereits tot

Die Mitarbeiter dort ermutigten ihn ebenfalls, sich bei seiner Schwester zu melden. Diese habe er in den vergangenen zehn Jahren nicht gesehen. Sie dachte, ihr Bruder sei bereits verstorben.

Der mittlerweile über 60-Jährige sei nun wieder sehr glücklich mit seinem Leben und den kleinen Jobs, die ihm durch das Heim vermittelt werden. In seiner Freizeit setze er sich nun für andere wohltätige Organisationen ein, die Obdachlose wie ihn unterstützen.

The family paid $5000, and Border Force over-rode the decision of the court,"" Peters told HuffPost Australia.
""Immigration Detention Facilities have communication facilities including landline phones, faxes, video-conferencing and internet rooms.
Legal advisors are able to visit their clients in an immigration detention facility in line with departmental policy and procedures.""","A Brisbane lawyer has accused the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of ""interference with the administration of justice"" after two of his clients awaiting criminal trial had their visas stripped and were thrown in detention centres despite being granted bail by courts.

Bruce Peters is representing two men, on unrelated charges, who are foreign citizens but were granted visas to visit and work in Australia: a Solomon Islands man, who we'll call Simon, facing charges of using the internet to procure sex with an underage girl, and a man from New Zealand, who we'll call Ben, who has been charged with a historical sexual assault.

After being charged by police, the men had been granted bail by judges in their respective cases ahead of their court dates later this year. Ben was initially refused bail and held in custody for two months, but a Supreme Court judge later overturned the initial bail decision and granted his release.

Peters claims that -- despite courts assessing the flight risk and risk to society posed by the two men, and ruling that they should be allowed back into the community to await trial -- both Simon and Ben were intercepted and detained by Australian Border Force agents within days of being granted bail, had their visas revoked and were sent to detention centres.

Simon has been sent to a facility in Western Australia, despite residing in Queensland, while Ben was sent to Christmas Island. Both men have been in detention around three months. Peters claimed he had been allowed almost zero access to the men, sharing just one phone call with Ben and only a ""five minute"" conversation with Simon.

""It's presumptuous. With [Ben], the Supreme Court granted him bail, and the justice remarked he was not sure why he was detained. The family paid $5000, and Border Force over-rode the decision of the court,"" Peters told HuffPost Australia.

""Their access to their lawyer has been curtailed. How can I build a defence when I can't get access to them?""

""It's a denial of natural justice.""

Under section 501 of the Migration Act, visas can be cancelled on the basis of a serious criminal conviction or past criminal record. The two men Peters represents have not been convicted of their crimes, only charged, but under broad powers granted to the Minister for Immigration, the minister can cancel a visa simply by deciding that a person is ""is not of good character"".

Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton

""You will not pass the character test if... your past and present criminal or general conduct shows that you are not of good character,"" states a fact sheet on DIBP's website.

Criminal barrister Greg Barns, of the Australian Lawyers Alliance, called the treatment of Peters' clients and the powers available to cancel visas ""outrageous"". He said the situation was unfortunate, but not unheard of, saying he had had clients of his subjected to the same.

""The Department of Immigration has no respect for the presumption of innocence, no respect for the rights of defendants to properly instruct their lawyers and it has no respect for rights of individuals to stay close to their families and support networks during what is a very stressful time,"" Barns told HuffPost Australia

""This is a department which regards the rule of law as a luxury not a necessity. It happens. They revoke visas when there's no finding from a court yet. This is unfortunately a very common practice.""

""It's the sort of practice you'd expect in an authoritarian country with no respect for court processes, not the sort of thing you'd expect in a democracy.""

Peters was outraged over several facets of the case. First, Peters claimed that since the men do not have any legal status to be in Australia after their visas were cancelled, they should have been deported instead of being placed in detention. In similar cases, Peters claimed, people in such situations would be granted a ""justice visa"" to give them standing to remain in Australia, but neither man has been given such a visa.

He said he was preparing a case to accuse the government of falsely detaining the men, considering they now had no legal right or visa to remain in Australia.

""They don't have a business visa, they've been refused a justice visa, they should deport them. [Border Force] are manipulating the act. If he's had his visa cancelled, been refused a visa, the only thing under the act is to deport him,"" Peters said.

Secondly, Peters said, time detained in a detention centre awaiting trial will not count as time served against a future jail term, unlike time served on remand if bail is refused. That is, if the men are detained for months then sentenced to a term of imprisonment, their time in detention will not count as time served, where time served in remand would be.

""Time in detention can't be declared under a sentence as time served. Detaining them is a direct interference with the administration of justice. It's a loophole of the act,"" Peters said.

Thirdly, the men had initially been fee-paying customers of Peters' firm, but now with their visas revoked and residing in detention, they are relying on taxpayer-funded legal aid. The taxpayer is also footing the bill to house and feed the pair, as well as to fly them back to Queensland from WA and Christmas Island.

Peters said the cases were a worrying precedent that could damage Australia's legal reputation on the world stage.

""All of this being done on back of the taxpayer. These are two cases that involve immigration, so anyone who comes to Australia on a visa can expect kangaroo justice, they can expect detention, and to be denied legal access or have that access made difficult,"" he said.

""It's a matter of policy. Australia will get a reputation that you can expect to be put in detention no matter the charge.""

A spokesperson for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said the department was ""aware"" of the two men but unable to comment further on the specifics of their cases, and defended against Peters' claims that he had only limited access to his clients.

""General visa cancellation provisions under the Migration Act 1958 allow for visa cancellation on a number of grounds, including non-compliance with visa conditions or where the presence of the visa holder in Australia is or may be a risk to the health or safety of the community,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

""Immigration Detention Facilities have communication facilities including landline phones, faxes, video-conferencing and internet rooms. Legal advisors are also able to call or email their client. Legal advisors are able to visit their clients in an immigration detention facility in line with departmental policy and procedures.""

The department did not respond to questions about why the men had their visas revoked, or whether their visas would be reinstated if they were acquitted of the charges.

The actress said that she “said no to him professionally many times over the years,” which sometimes led to outbursts, “screaming at me calling me a cunt and making threats.”

Beckinsale believes these alleged incidents with Weinstein “undoubtedly harmed” her career.

Beckinsale also praised the women who came forward before her, such as Cara Delevingne, Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, after the New York Times and The New Yorker released exposés on Weinstein’s sexual misconduct. She also tried to encourage other women to speak out as well.

“For every moment like this there have been thousands where a vulnerable person has confided outrageous unprofessional behavior and found they have no recourse, due to an atmosphere of fear that it seems almost everyone has been living in,” she wrote.

In the week since the exposés on Weinstein, the executive was fired from his position at the Weinstein Company and his actions roundly condemned by Hollywood and political heavyweights, including Barack and Michelle Obama. On Wednesday, Disney announced that Weinstein’s name would be removed as a producer on an upcoming film.",Kate Beckinsale Says Weinstein Came On To Her At 17,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/10/12/kate-beckinsale-says-weinstein-harassed-her-at-17-and-didnt-remember_n_18249886.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&ir=UK

Noch ist völlig unklar, wer das Rennen macht, denn es gibt viele strittige Themen, wie zum Beispiel die Flüchtlingskrise. Ein anderes Problem sorgt in Niedersachsen ebenfalls für kontroverse Diskussionen und dieses Problem lebt im Wald. Es geht um ein Rudel Wölfe, das Niedersachsen in Atem hält, genauer gesagt um ein „Problemwolfsrudel"", das zum Abschuss freigeben werden soll.

Ein härterer Kurs

Wie „T-Online"" berichtet, will die rot-grüne Landesregierung in Niedersachsen einen deutlich härteren Kurs anschlagen, wenn es um das Thema Wölfe geht. Ministerpräsident Stefan Weil, Bundesumweltministerin Barbara Hendricks (beide SPD) und der grüne Landesminister Stefan Wenzel haben bereits signalisiert, dass es auch im Artenschutz Ausnahmefälle gibt, die den Abschluss legitimieren. Eine Zäsur gibt es nicht, sagte Regierungschef Weil und jedes Vorgehen gegen die Wölfe ist eine Einzelentscheidung. Es gibt keine Obergrenze für Wölfe, sagte Hendricks und der Wolf wird auch nicht in das Jagdrecht aufgenommen. Wo ist denn dann eigentlich das Problem?

Zu hohe Schäden?

Seit 2008 sind Wölfe in Niedersachsen wieder heimisch. Die ersten Rudel haben sich in der Nähe von Lüneburg angesiedelt und sorgen seitdem für Probleme. Insgesamt haben die Wölfe seit 2008 knapp 700 Nutztiere gerissen und damit einen Schaden von 70.000 Euro angerichtet. Das ist kein sonderlich hoher Schaden, im Vergleich dazu, was andere Wildtiere anrichten. Mittlerweile gibt es elf Rudel in Niedersachsen, in denen nach Meinung des Naturschutzbundes nicht mehr als 140 Tiere leben.

Die Problemtiere loswerden

Anders als seine Kollegin Barbara Hendricks hat der Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister Christian Schmidt (CSU) kein Problem damit, Wölfe einfach abzuschießen. Nach Ansicht von Schmidt ist die Zeit des Redens vorbei, die Bestände müssen so reguliert werden, dass weder für Nutztiere noch für Menschen eine Gefahr besteht. Der Bundesminister fordert ein „Wolfsmanagement"" vonseiten der Interessenvertretung der Landwirtschaft. Schmidt hat sich nicht zum ersten Mal zum Thema Wölfe in Deutschland geäußert. Er macht sich schon seit längerer Zeit für die Eindämmung der Wolfspopulation stark. Der Minister begründet das mit dem Argument, dass der Wolf das größte in Deutschland lebende Landraubtier ist, das außer dem Menschen keine Feinde hat.

Tina Gayle received an official rebuke and a ban over the coloured printed cups which Charnworth Council in Leicestershire said “breached trading rules”.

Vintage book seller Gayle said she had been told the council “had a complaint that the mugs might be offensive to Muslims”.

SWNS.com Tina Gayle was left dumbfounded by the council's decision

A letter stated she was in breach of trading terms and conditions and had to leave her pitch of three years at Loughborough Vintage Market.

The mugs, also stamped with the Christian chivalric order’s Latin motto which translates as: “Not to us Lord, not to us, but to your name give the glory”, brought a single complaint.

But now the council appears to have re-considered its approach, summoning Gayle for a meeting with market bosses next week.

(Tina Gayle/PA)

The council said it had “got this one wrong”, and apologised for the way it handled the matter.

In a statement, it added it was the fact the mugs were not vintage which had been at issue, but this fact had been communicated “poorly” to Ms Gayle.

Gayle, 57, from Didcot, Oxfordshire, who also travels the country selling Second World War vintage books, said she was “appreciative” for the council’s change of approach.

“I’ve been summoned to a meeting with the markets manager on Thursday. They haven’t apologised to me directly, but have called me to that meeting,” she said.

“I’m very optimistic.

“But I realise it’s a very big thing for the council to issue a public apology and I’m appreciative.

“Should I be offered my pitch back, I’ll obviously be very happy.”

(Tina Gayle/PA)

Her ban had come in the form of a letter handed to her on October 6, after a previous run-in over the sale of some mugs bearing Second World War-era Nazi symbols.

Gayle said she had been told the council “had a complaint that the mugs might be offensive to Muslims”.

She added: “The person who complained wasn’t offended himself, but thought Muslims might be.

“I’ve never had a Muslim come into my stall and say they were offended by the mugs.”

However, Gayle said she has “no bad feelings” towards the council, and understood it had been put in a “dilemma”.

The council had previously formally told Gayle to stop selling mugs bearing what it described as “Nazi symbols” in August or new items which may cause offence, following a separate complaint.

Market authorities then received the complaint about the Templar mugs, and when Gayle refused to remove them from sale, she was banned.

In a statement reported by the Press Association, the council said: “Firstly, we would like to apologise. We are open and honest enough to say we got this one wrong.

“We did receive a complaint because someone was offended by the mugs, but we do not find the mugs offensive.

“Our main issue was that it is a vintage market and these items were new when we only want vintage or used items on sale.

“We communicated that poorly to the trader and we will be reviewing how this happened to learn lessons for the future.

1998년 10월 6일, 와이오밍 대학교의 게이 학생 매튜 셰퍼드가 잔혹하게 공격당한 동성애 증오 범죄 사건이 있었다. 셰퍼드는 구타와 고문을 당하고 와이오밍 주 라라미 외곽 울타리에 묶인 채 버려졌다. 셰퍼드는 22번째 생일을 50일 앞둔 1998년 10월 12일에 사망했다.

1993년에 태어난 나는 매튜 셰퍼드에게 일어난 일을 알거나 이해할 수 있는 나이가 아니었다. 나는 2007년에 매튜의 죽음에 대한 다큐멘터리 연극 ‘라라미 프로젝트’를 보고서야 그가 누구였는지, 증오 범죄의 구성 요소가 무엇인지 알게 되었다. 그리고 내 자신이 동성애자라는 것을 받아들이고 ‘라라미 프로젝트’에 출연하고 나서야 진정으로 그의 죽음의 심각성에 공감하고 이해할 수 있었다.

나는 매튜 생각을 많이 한다. 23세 게이 남성으로서 그러지 않기란 쉽지 않다. 우리는 여러 모로 비슷하다. 체구가 작고, 여성적이고, 어떤 면으로 봐도 절대 몸이 탄탄하지 않다. 나는 그를 생각할 때 그의 입장에 처하면 어떨지를 상상하지 않을 수가 없다. 내 성적 지향 때문에 죽도록 내버려지는 게 어떨지 상상하지 않을 수가 없다. 우리가 지난 18년 동안 LGBTQ+ 운동으로 큰 진전을 이루었지만, 사실 상황이 많이 나아지지 않았기 때문이다. 트랜스들은 기본적 인권을 부정 당하고 있고, 유색 퀴어들은 소외되고 살해당한다. 게이인 십대들은 이성애자 또래들에 비해 자살율이 8.4배 더 높다.

매튜를 생각하고, 내가 매튜보다 더 오래 살았다는 걸 생각하면 나는 매튜가 지금 우리가 사는 세상을 어떻게 생각할지 궁금해진다. 동성 결혼 합법화, 노스 캐롤라이나 같은 주의 화장실 차별법에 대해 어떻게 느낄까? 우리가 사는 나라를 자랑스러워할까, 1998년 이후 진전이 너무 없었다고 실망할까?

매튜 셰퍼드는 바로 여기 묶인 채 죽었다.

매튜의 18주기를 맞아, 나는 2016년 6월 12일에 일어난 일에 대해서도 생각해 본다. 나는 게이 클럽에 갈 때마다, 동성애 혐오주의자나 트랜스 혐오주의자를 볼 때마다, 나는 오마르 마틴과 그가 펄스에서 학살한 49명을 생각한다. LGBTQ+ 평등을 위한 싸움은 끝났다는 말을 들을 때마다, 나는 그 발언이 얼마나 지독하게도 부정확한지를 상기해야 한다. 우리는 1998년에 싸웠던 것과 똑같은 싸움을 지금도 계속하고 있고, 2034년에도 지금과 같은 장애물을 극복하려 하고 있을 거라고 자신있게 말할 수 있다. 변화는 느리고 고통스럽다. 지금 상황이 좋지 않다는 걸 우리가 인지해야만 상황이 나아진다. 동성 결혼은 합법이지만, 우리가 싸워야 할 추함은 정말 많다. 우리는 이러한 추함을 지속시키는 문화가 우리와 타인들의 책임이라는 걸 인정해야만 싸울 수 있다.

우리는 매튜 셰퍼드 같은 사람들을 잊을 수 없다. 펄스와 같은 비극에서 거리를 두려고 할 수도 없다. 우리는 추함을 우리의 것으로 인정해야 하며, 세상을 더 낫게 만들겠다고 다짐해야 한다. 우리는 우리의 동성애 혐오와 트랜스 혐오를 인지하고 분석해야 한다. 우리의 편견에 의문을 던지고 검토해야 한다. 동료들 사이에서 인기가 없어진다 해도 나설 때는 나서야 한다. 매튜, 무의미하게 학살 당한 크리스털 에드몬즈 같은 모든 트랜스들, 스스로 목숨을 끊은 제이미 로드마이어와 릴라 알콘 같은 모든 LGBTQ+ 청소년들, 펄스에서 우리를 떠나야 했던 49명의 형제 자매들을 위해서 그래야 한다. 그게 우리가 그들에게, 그리고 우리 자신에게 해야 할 일이다.

Isn't it ironic that we learn to start talking by 18 – 24 months, but we are never formally taught effective communication?

Well, it's never too late to learn! Here are six tips for those of us who missed the early training. Try tackling these to help improve your communication abilities with the kiddos.

Listen more, talk less

Parents are especially guilty of over-talking because we underestimate what our kids know and how much they can contribute to a conversation. We get very excited about teaching them and giving them instructions, but we don't ask what they know, think, or have an opinion about.

The next time you are planning a weekend away, ask your kids for some ideas of where they would like to go or what they would like to see and do. When your child has a bad day at school and you want them to open up and tell you about it, just listen and offer a free space for them to speak. If we interrupt with interrogating questions, or try to solve their problems for them, we inadvertently clam them up.

The important part of listening to our children is to help them express their feelings and to make them feel understood.

The important part of listening to our children is to help them express their feelings and to make them feel understood. If they are upset they did poorly on a test, your focus should be on expressing empathy towards their feelings of disappointment, not reprimanding them for not studying enough. Empathy and validation of their feelings is good listening. How they want to handle their next test can be discussed later.

Mean what you say

Besides talking less, think about the content of your speech. Kids tune us out and ignore us when we spend too much time pestering them. In fact, you'd be surprised to learn that our kids usually do make their beds, and the lunch box does eventually come out of the backpack, if we bite our tongue.

If you nag them to make their bed but then go make it for them, you are proving to them that your words are empty and meaningless. If you threaten to cancel the family trip if the kids don't stop fighting in the car, but you just keep driving, you might as well throw your words out the window. Think cautiously before you speak and know you can follow through on anything you say.

Be friendly and respectful

Isn't that a simple rule for speaking to a fellow human being? Yet, we often talk down to our children.

Fellow parenting author Barbara Coloroso suggests that you ask yourself, ""Would I talk to my friend this way?"" So much communication would improve if we just made this one change! Instead, we fall into the habits that relationship experts Julie and John Gottman call ""The 4 horsemen of the relationship apocalypse"" which are: contempt, criticism, defensiveness and stone walling.

Sarcasm isn't a form of humour, it's a form of criticism and contempt and has no place in child rearing.

These communication styles rip deep at the relationship. They diminish the worthiness of our children and ultimately hurts their self-esteem. For those of you who don't know, sarcasm isn't a form of humour, it's a form of criticism and contempt and has no place in child rearing.

Watch your tone and body language

We all know that we communicate a lot with our body language (the exact percentage is up for debate). So, you might say to your child that you are not mad at them, but if your voice is gruff, your jaw taught, and your hands are on your hips, they are likely reading all the other clues that clearly state you are mad.

Children learn more from behaviour than words, so pay attention to what you are saying with your posture, tone, inflection, etc. Rolling your eyeballs is a non-verbal sign of contempt, and hands on your hips are tantamount to putting your dukes up.

Always have your kids' back

Assume your children are good people and in the right. You might suffer some confirmation bias that your eldest is always the one who picks on their little sister, but you don't know for sure. Instead of close-minded assumption and categorical statements like ""You always"" or ""You never,"" try to remain open-minded.

Speak only to this specific situation and make your point about those facts only. This is especially important when communicating with children who still have dualistic thinking. They either believe you are for them, or against them.

If your child is in some altercation, take the stance that your assumption is that they are good and you have their back, always. They need to know there is no situation so difficult that they can't come to you and that you can't work it out together.

Start by saying ""Thank you for telling me — that took a lot of courage"" and continue with, ""I know you're a good kid, so if you ended up in the principal's office today, something must have been amiss for you. Help me understand.""

If your child is in some altercation, take the stance that your assumption is that they are good and you have their back, always.

Children make mistakes. A lot of them. In fact, it's how they learn! If we show them our positive expectations for their behaviour and keep a focus on what they've learned and what they will do differently next time, we avoid being punitive and attacking their character.

Talk in private

""Yes, I am talking to you like a child because you are acting like a child!"" screamed the mother at the mall to her teenage daughter. GULP. Nothing is more embarrassing than being corrected or given a talking-to in public.

It doesn't matter if you're surrounded by strangers or your friends, kids need to be asked to step aside for some privacy for such discussions. In fact, you don't always have to talk to your children immediately about all issues. If your daughter was late bringing the car back from the mall, you can simply let her know that you'd like to discuss the matter later when her friends are gone. Or, you can say nothing at all, but request a time to talk when you know you will have her full attention.

Interrupting studying for a test the next day, or barging into their rooms when there is only four minutes left of ""Grey's Anatomy"" is probably not the best time for having an engaged dialogue with your teen. Make an appointment to talk. Sometimes going out for coffee or lunch adds a little gravitas to conversation and keeps everyone on topic longer.

Der Bischof von Rhodos hat ausländischen Paaren verboten, in einer berühmten Kirche zu heiraten

Der Grund: Ein Blowjob-Hochzeitsfoto eines britischen Paares vor der Kirche

Hunderte Heiratswillige sind von dem Verbot betroffen

Hunderte Heiratswillige aus aller Welt lassen sich jedes Jahr in der St. Paul Kirche auf der griechischen Insel Rhodos trauen. Doch damit soll es nun vorbei sein.

Denn der Bischof von Rhodos hat nun nach Berichten von britischen Medien ausländischen Paaren verboten, an dem idyllischen Ort zu heiraten.

Schuld daran ist wohl ein Hochzeitsfoto, das ein Hochzeitspaar bei einem simulierten Blowjob zeigt - mit der berühmten Kirche im Hintergrund.

""Wir dürfen dieses widerliche Verhalten nicht dulden“

Ein Affront für die griechischen Kirchenoberen und die Gläubigen. Das Foto hatte das britische Paar nach der Hochzeit bei Facebook hochgeladen. Es zeigt den Bräutigam mit heruntergelassenen Hosen und hochgereckter Faust, während die Braut vor ihm kniet und einen Blowjob simuliert.

Auf Facebook zog das Foto die Aufmerksamkeit tausender Internet-Nutzer auf sich und gelangte auch in die griechischen Medien. Giorgos Eleftheriou, Präsident der Lindos Gemeinschaft auf Rhodos, sagte der britischen ""Times"": ""Wir sind Griechen und wir schätzen unsere Traditionen und die Heiligkeit unserer religiöser Stätten. Wir dürfen dieses widerliche Verhalten nicht dulden.“

Und er fügte hinzu: ""Schande über die Beiden, die diesen Schaden angerichtet haben.""

Böse Folgen für Heiratswillige und die Einwohner von Rhodos

Nun stehen hunderte Paare, die in den nächsten Jahren in der besagten Kirche heiraten wollen, vor einem großen Problem. Laut einem Bericht des ""Independent"" haben schon einige Betroffene die Hochzeit abgesagt und suchen nach Alternativen. Andere warten voller Angst auf die endgültige Entscheidung des Bürgermeisters von Rhodos, die in etwa einer Woche getroffen werden soll.

Das Verbot hat nicht nur Folgen für die Heiratswilligen, sondern auch für die Bewohner der griechischen Insel, deren Einkommen stark vom Tourismus abhängt.

Die Braut auf dem verhängnisvollen Foto sagte der ""DailyMail"" zu der von ihr und ihrem Mann ausgelösten Misere: ""Wir haben es doch nur als Witz gemeint.""

After Grenfell, Tenants Must Take Control Of Their Housing The most uncomfortable truth lurking within this tragedy is that there is a stigma attached to people who live in social housing. Narrowly, this means that a discount is applied to their views when they are expressed to the relevant authorities. Broadly it also means that the lives and wellbeing of people who live in council blocks are seen as having less value than home owners.

The Labour leader said Theresa May’s Government was in a “shocking mess” over Britain’s exit from the EU in his speech to the Co-Operative Party conference on Saturday.

He added they were making a Brexit without a deal with the EU more likely, which he warned could cause a “jobs meltdown”.

“The Tories are transparently failing in the Brexit negotiations,” he told delegrates in London.

“They are making a shocking mess of Brexit. They are split down the middle, negotiating with each other instead of the EU.

“With each passing day they are driving us closer to a no-deal Brexit.”

DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS via Getty Images Jeremy Corbyn told the Co-Operative Party Conference the Tories were 'transparently failing' on Brexit

As Brexit negotiations continue, the prime minister has said that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.

But Corbyn warned in his speech that a no-deal Brexit could mean “economic disaster” in “sector after sector”.

“The risk would be that key manufacturers leave for the European mainland, taking skilled jobs with them,” he warned.

“Theresa May’s Cabinet of chaos is risking a jobs meltdown across Britain.

“A powerful faction of the Tories want a no-deal outcome because they think they can use it to turn our economy into a deregulated tax haven. We must not let them.”

Corbyn also mocked Chancellor Philip Hammond’s claim at Conservative Party Conference earlier this month that Labour represents “an existential challenge to our economic model”.

“Well Philip, yes we do,” Corbyn said, adding the party would not “sit back” while homelessness spiralled.

“Their economic model is broken,” he added of the Tories.

Empics Entertainment Chancellor Philip Hammond told Conservative Conference that Corbyn's Labour represented 'an existential challenge to our economic model'

The Co-Operative Party does not field its own political candidates but 38 Labour MPs were elected on a joint ticket with the party.

Corbyn also hit out at Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, accusing both of them of “macho posturing” in the war of words between the two countries over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.

He said: “We live in a world riven by conflict, spurred on by ego and neo-imperial ambition.

YANGON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Myanmar's military has launched an internal probe into the conduct of soldiers during a counteroffensive that has sent more than half a million Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, many saying they witnessed killings, rape and arson by troops.

Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response in the Muslim-majority northern part of Rakhine state that the United Nations has said was ethnic cleansing.

A committee led by military Lieutenant-General Aye Win has begun an investigation into the behavior of military personnel, the office of the commander in chief said on Friday, insisting the operation was justified under Buddhist-majority Myanmar's constitution.

According to a statement posted on Senior General Min Aung Hlaing's Facebook page, the panel will ask, ""Did they follow the military code of conduct? Did they exactly follow the command during the operation? After that (the committee) will release full information.""

Myanmar is refusing entry to a U.N. panel that was tasked with investigating allegations of abuses after a smaller military counteroffensive launched in October 2016.

Rohingya refugees line up to receive food at a camp near Teknaf, Bangladesh.

But domestic investigations, including a previous internal military probe, have largely dismissed refugees' claims of abuses committed during security forces' ""clearance operations"".

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar's Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar insists military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

Aid agencies estimate that 536,000 people have arrived in the Cox's Bazar district, straining scarce resources of aid groups and local communities.

About 200,000 Rohingya were already in Bangladesh after fleeing persecution in Myanmar, where they have long been denied citizenship and faced restrictions on their movements and access to basic services.

Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has pledged accountability for human rights abuses and says Myanmar will accept back refugees who can prove they were residents of Myanmar.

The villages were allegedly torch by the Myanmar army.

The powerful army chief has taken a harder stance, however, telling the U.S. ambassador in Myanmar this week that the exodus of Rohingya, who he said were non-native ""Bengalis,"" was exaggerated.

In comments to Japan's ambassador carried in state media on Friday, Min Aung Hlaing denied ethnic cleansing was taking place on the grounds that photos showed Muslims ""departing calmly rather than fleeing in terror"".

Former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, who led a commission set up by Suu Kyi to find solutions for the ethnically and religiously divided Rakhine, briefed the U.N. Security Council and other key states in an informal closed-door meeting on Friday.

Some council members are exploring if the 15-member body could agree a formal statement or even a resolution to call for an end to the violence, for full aid access, the safe return of refugees, access for a U.N. fact-finding mission to ensure accountability and implementation of Annan's recommendations.

Annan said he hoped any possible Security Council resolution ""urges the government to really press ahead and create conditions that will allow the refugees to return in dignity and with a sense of security, they should not be returned to camps.""

Mientras tanto, Puigdemont guarda silencio tras reunirse anoche con varios de sus consejeros. El que sí ha hablado es Oriol Junqueras, vicepresidente del Govern y líder de ERC, quien ha pedido ""unidad"" a las fuerzas independentistas y ""confianza"" en el presidente catalán.

Según Junqueras, la unidad del independentismo ha sido determinante para haber llegado hasta el actual momento y para haber hecho posible ""el referéndum del 1 de octubre, pese a ser perseguido por todos los medios por parte del Estado español"". ""Pese a todas las trabas y la represión, el referéndum se hizo en condiciones inimaginables en un país democrático, porque no hay ninguna democracia que ordene golpear a los votantes que quieren depositar una papeleta en una urna"", ha subrayado Junqueras.

Ha reclamado ""confiar en nosotros mismos"" y en el presidente de la Generalitat ""para cumplir el mandato de las elecciones del 27"" de septiembre de 2015 ""y del referéndum del 1 de octubre, que es declarar la República Catalana"".

Junqueras coincide con Puigdemont en que hay que seguir apostando por la vía del ""diálogo"" y la ""mediación"" como ""mejor forma"" para conseguir la República Catalana, pese a admitir que el Gobierno español ""se niega"" a negociar.

En este contexto, y sin precisar cuándo debería producirse a su entender la declaración de independencia, Junqueras sí ha querido dejar claro su ""compromiso inequívoco y absoluto de cumplir el mandato de 1 de octubre"".","La CUP exige a Puigdemont que su respuesta al Gobierno sea ""nítidamente afirmativa""",http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/10/14/la-cup-exige-a-puigdemont-que-su-respuesta-al-gobierno-sea-nitidamente-afirmativa_a_23243329/

Beim Thema soziale Gerechtigkeit lachte sie FDP-Vize Kubicki aus

Doch die möglichen Jamaika-Partner FDP und Grüne entdeckten viele – teils überraschende – Gemeinsamkeiten

""Jamaika in, Gerechtigkeit out?“, fragte Maybrit Illner. Nachdem zuletzt die Debatte über die Aufnahme und Integration von Flüchtlingen die Phase der Annäherung zwischen Union, FDP und Grünen bestimmt hatte, sollte es in der ZDF-Talkshow um die Sozialpolitik der so ungleichen möglichen Partner gehen.

Dass Gerechtigkeit zumindest nicht ""in“ ist, musste die neue SPD-Fraktionsvorsitzende Andrea Nahles am Wahltag feststellen. Die SPD fiel auf ihr schwächstes Wahlergebnis der Nachkriegsgeschichte – nachdem man sich so dick wie lange nicht das Wort ""Gerechtigkeit"" auf die rot-weiße Fahne gepinselt hatte.

Bei Illner gab Nahles jetzt zu: ""Wir Sozialdemokraten haben nicht die richtigen Themen getroffen."" Dann wandte sie den Blick nach vorne und griff das mögliche Jamaika-Bündnis an: ""Es wundert mich, dass die Jamaika-Koalition in Schleswig-Holstein einen Antrag eingereicht hat, der den Mindestlohn aushöhlt.""

Kontra bekam die bisherige Arbeitsministerin dann gleich von FDP-Vize und Schleswig-Holstein-Chef Wolfgang Kubicki. Es gehe bei der angestrebten Abschaffung der Dokumentationspflicht nicht – wie von Nahles behauptet – um den Abbau von Arbeitnehmerrechten. ""Das ist Quatsch. Das ist doch völliger Unsinn"", warf Kubicki ein.

► Zum Hintergrund: Als ""Dokumentationspflicht"" versteht man die Pflicht, dass geringfügig Beschäftigte ihre genaue Stundenanzahl notieren müssen, um für diese den Lohn ausgezahlt zu bekommen. Der FDP-Vize sieht darin eine ""komplett irre Bürokratie"".

Kubicki betonte, der Mindestlohn an sich solle überhaupt nicht angetastet werden. Nahles fing an spöttisch, fast selbstzufrieden, zu lachen: ""Aber er wird hinten rum aufgemacht, ja?""

Die SPD-Politikerin, die sich von Kubicki mehrfach vorwerfen lassen musste, in der Regierung selbst nicht für eine sozialere Politik gesorgt zu haben, setzte hier bereits den Ton für die zukünftig angestrebte Oppositionsarbeit.

""Deshalb freue ich mich auch über die Opposition, die dann ja vehement dafür Sorge tragen wird, dass Jamaika sozialere Politik macht, als es die Sozialdemokraten bisher getan haben"" spottete Kubicki.

Da wurde Nahles angriffslustig: ""Das ist nicht die neue FDP, das ist wieder ganz die alte. Aber Sie haben ja gesagt, Sie wollen die sozialste Politik ever machen.“

Kubicki und Trittin sind sich einig wie selten

Während sich FDP und SPD so erwartungsgemäß fleißig beharkten und einen Vorgeschmack dafür lieferten, wie sich die Debatten nach dem Ende der Großen Koalition wieder verschärfen könnten, kam es auf der Seite der möglichen Jamaika-Partner zu erstaunlichen Annäherungen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Der Pflegenotstand in Deutschland ist gravierend - schon die Änderung eines Satzes im Pflegegesetz könnte helfen

Als Nahles wieder einmal über den ""digitalen Kapitalismus"" meckerte, meldete sich Grünen-Urgestein Jürgen Trittin zu Wort. Seine Idee: ""Der Bund verkauft endlich seine letzten Telekom-Anteile, und nutzt sie endlich, um Glasfaser zum letzten Haushalt zu verlegen.""



Kubicki schaute den Parteilinken fast ungläubig an. Dann: ""Ich habe ja heute gelernt, dass entgegen meinen Vorurteilen manche Vorstellungen von Jürgen Trittin ganz vernünftig sind.""



Ein erster Flirt der oft so unversöhnlichen Parteien. ""Das ist FDP-Programm"", erklärte Kubicki. ""Nein, das ist grünes Programm"", entgegnete Trittin. Am Ende ist es vielleicht Jamaika-Programm?

Auch Trittin und Nahles harmonieren

Doch auf ganz neue Wege begab sich Trittin nicht – er machte auch der SPD ein Versprechen. Eine Flexibilisierung der Arbeit, wie sie auch DIW-Präsident Marcel Fratscher bei Illner forderte, sei nur unter bestimmten Bedingungen denkbar.

Es brauche 11-Stunden-Ruhephasen und den Achtstundentag, war Trittin überzeugt. Auch Nahles sprach sich dafür aus. Fast entgeistert fragte sie Kubicki, als der davon schwärmte, die besten Ideen oft am späten Abend zu haben: ""Wollen sie jetzt die Arbeitszeiten deregulieren – oder wie, verstehe ich das...?""

Kubicki entgegnete, das genau das bereits passiere. Und auch CSU-Frau Ilse Aigner setzte unter das Projekt ""Flexible Arbeitszeit"" ihren Stempel: ""Wir wollen keine Mehrarbeit, sondern mehr Flexibilität in der Arbeit.""

Eine Koalition hat diese TV-Runde zumindest nicht unwahrscheinlicher gemacht. Und Nahles, das hat ""Maybritt Illner"" gezeigt, ist schon ganz in der Rolle der Oppositionsführerin.

TORONTO — A ""touchy-feely'' anesthesiologist handed a 10-year sentence for sexually assaulting 21 sedated women during surgery has failed to have his conviction overturned.

In a decision Friday, Ontario's top court ruled that the judge who convicted Dr. George Doodnaught after a 76-day trial was bang on.

""The grounds of appeal advanced track closely the submissions made to, and rejected by, the trial judge,'' the Court of Appeal said. ""They are the subject of lengthy and detailed reasons which describe the findings of fact essential to proof of guilt and the evidentiary stuff of which those findings were made.''

WARNING: Graphic details follow.

Doodnaught, who is in his late 60s, was convicted in November 2013 on all counts for assaulting women, who ranged from 25 to 75 years old, while they were semi-conscious at the North York General Hospital. Among other things, Doodnaught inserted his penis into women's mouths, used some for masturbation, and sexually fondled others over a four-year period.

The defence never argued the women fabricated their complaints or colluded with one another, but at trial and on appeal suggested the complainants may have been hallucinating while under anesthetic. Doodnaught's lawyers further argued that the assaults, in the confined space of an operating theatre close to others in the surgical team, could not have happened.

Earlier on HuffPost: Victim describes Dr. George Doodnaught as ""coward""

Superior Court Justice David McCombs rejected the defence arguments, siding with the prosecution that Doodnaught had the opportunity to commit the assaults from behind a screen and that the women's accounts of what happened were honest and realistic.

McCombs found Doodnaught's closeness to patients during surgery didn't draw suspicion because he was known as a ""touchy-feely'' doctor who stroked a patient's cheek or hair to soothe her during procedures. The judge also lambasted him for compounding his victims' distress by trying to make them believe they were somehow responsible for what happened.

Lawyers argued gas made victims hallucinate

On appeal, the doctor argued the evidence at trial fell short of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the offences actually happened. His lawyers pointed at expert evidence about the hallucinogenic properties of the anesthetics in support of their position.

""This case is overwhelming only if one presumes that the possibility of drug-induced dream-like states is impossible, as the trial judge did,'' Doodnaught's lawyers argued on appeal. ""The trial judge failed to adequately consider the defence submission that a significant proportion, indeed the majority, of the alleged incidents were impossible.''

The Appeal Court would have none of it.

The higher court noted McCombs had even visited the operating rooms in which the anesthetist had worked to gain a better understanding of the layout before finding that Doodnaught did indeed have the opportunity to commit the assaults as alleged.

He could barred from ever practicing

The Appeal Court also found the judge had carefully looked at the expert evidence on whether patients might hallucinate about sexual experiences, noting no witness had ever heard of a case of multiple allegations of sexual assault on patients under the kind of sedation Doodnaught administered.

""The appellant's quarrel is not rooted in any legal principle so far as I can determine but rather in the factual findings the trial judge made,'' Justice David Watt wrote for the Appeal Court. ""Those factual findings put paid to the defence position that the conduct each complainant honestly believed took place — and which amounted to sexual assault — simply never happened.''

Doodnaught's medical licence has been suspended for several years but a disciplinary hearing that could see him barred from ever practising again has been awaiting the outcome of the appeal.

India is one of the few countries worldwide where child marriage continues to be widely accepted--legally and socially. Despite reports suggesting that child marriage is on the decline in the country since 2001, the latest Census report on the decadal headcount in 2011 reveals that child marriage is rampant, with almost one in every three married women being below 18 years. What is worse, a whopping 78.5 lakh girls (2.3% of all women or girls who were ever married or were married in 2011) were married before they were 10 years old. Even the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data shows that 26.8% of women are married before the age of 18 years.

The high prevalence of child marriage in the first place speaks volumes of the times we live in. Even after 70 years of Independence, this discriminatory social practice remains widespread in many parts of the country and does not seem to be going away anytime soon because for the simple fact that it is a socially accepted custom in the first place.

Child marriage affects both boys and girls, however, in most cases it is the girls who are vulnerable. Child brides have a diminished chance of completing their education and are at a higher risk of being physically and sexually abused, contracting HIV and other diseases, and dying while pregnant or giving birth. Child marriage among girls perpetuates unequal community and family decision-making power, gender gaps in educational achievement and economic independence, and poor reproductive and sexual health. As per the NFHS 4, the percentage of women aged 15-19 years who were already mothers or pregnant is 6.3%.

Despite all the efforts to curb the practice, in some states, the prevalence of child marriage exceeds 60%.... thanks to a poor conviction rate and loopholes...

The Government of India has enacted the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 to prevent child marriages, as opposed to only restraining them. States/Union Territories from time to time also regularly pursue the effective implementation of the Act. Despite all the efforts to curb the practice, in some states, the prevalence of child marriage exceeds 60% with the practice being more prevalent in rural areas as compared to urban areas—thanks to a poor conviction rate and loopholes within the law and system. As per the National Crime Records Bureau data, a total number of 280, 293 and 326 cases were registered under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 in the year 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively.

The reasons for child marriage are complex as it is a 'mindset' problem where girls are considered a burden and her sexuality a concern. Social customs, tradition, illiteracy, poverty, low status of women in society, lack of awareness about consequences of child marriage are the other reasons that encourage the practice. In Rajasthan, for example, child marriages are a part of the fabric of society and widely accepted. In other parts of the country like Bihar and Jharkhand, child marriage is practised due to poverty and economic reasons. Recent reports of child brides being sold to rich Sheikhs from the Middle East countries have sent shock waves across the country.

To prevent child marriage in the first place, strict measures must be taken by the government on an urgent basis. At the policy front, we need to promote girls' access to quality secondary education by providing easier and safer access to quality secondary schools. We must develop stronger coordination among stakeholders such as government bodies, law enforcement officials, civil society organisations, and community leaders to create a social force that can change the norms around child marriage. We need to strengthen law enforcement as it is critical to identify and prosecute parties involved in child marriage so that the law becomes a deterrent. Lastly, and most importantly, introduce economic empowerment initiatives that empower girls and women, specifically in locations where there's a high prevalence of child marriage and marginalised communities. Addressing poverty, one of the key precipitating causes of child marriage has the potential to reduce the practice drastically.

However, not all the issues involved in child marriage can be tackled by legislative interventions alone. The role of community assumes importance as well. For example, at the local level, Community Based Organisations or non-profit groups can develop systems for regular engagement with parents of high-risk families. These can include: home visits, promote livelihood programmes, vocational and skills-based training to help delay the marriage of girls and implement community education programs that emphasise the need to respect the decisions of girls to remain unmarried if they wish. NGOs also need to ensure that overall focus on the issue is not lost and child marriage prevention is kept among the primary objectives as opposed to a secondary or tertiary objective subsumed under other social initiatives.

These programmes and policies, if implemented in an effective and timely manner, will go a long way in delaying the marriage of girls and achieving the larger goal of reducing the prevalence of child marriage. For India's child marriage epidemic to be cured, we need to creatively solve the problem, as merely enforcing laws may not be the answer.

Enter smartphone users.

It's no surprise that Australians love their technology -- we even have more phones in this country than people -- but this love has become an unhealthy and dangerous obsession, particularly when those who insist on walking and texting bump into blind or visually impaired people.

Close to 60 percent of people who were bumped in to reported that it was caused by a fellow pedestrian engrossed in their mobile phone.

Close to 60 percent of people who were bumped into while using their white cane reported that the incidents were caused by fellow pedestrians who were too busy to take their eyes off their phone, according to a Guide Dogs Australia report.

What's even worse is that in the last two years almost half of all cane users had their canes broken by someone walking into them.

""Sometimes running into someone can just be a shock but other times it can be very harmful, upsetting and disorienting for the person with vision loss, particularly when it results in an injury or a broken cane,"" Karen Hayes, CEO of Guide Dogs Victoria, said.

""The most common cause for these situations, when it can be identified, is that the other person was on their mobile phone and not paying attention to where they were walking.

""We all have a role to play in helping to make sure people who with low vision or blindness can get around their communities safely and confidently, just like everyone else.""

One way to do this is to keep your phone in your pocket while moving about or if that's too difficult, ""using more caution by slowing your pace and looking up often"".

Tips for assisting people who are blind or have low vision It should go without saying but don't be a dickhead -- put the phone away while you're walking in public or regularly look up from it; Approach: if you suspect someone may need a hand, walk up, greet them and identify yourself; Ask: ""Would you like some help?"" The person will either accept your offer or tell you if they don't require assistance; Assist: Listen to the reply and assist as required. Not all people who are blind or vision impaired will want assistance -- don't be offended if your assistance is not required.

""Many of us have become accustomed to using our mobile devices constantly, but it's something we can easily be more mindful of to help ensure all Australians are able to feel safe and independent,"" Hayes said.

""Our instructors work with white cane users across Australia to teach them the skills they need to get around their communities safely and independently, but unfortunately there are certain environmental factors, like moving people, that they can't identify until it's too late.""",Smartphone Obsessed Aussies Are Knocking Over Blind People In The Streets,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/11/smartphone-obsessed-aussies-are-knocking-over-blind-people-in-the-streets_a_23240604/

The documentary-maker, a father-of-two who said he wanted to “die young as late as possible”, was in the last few weeks of his travels around the world with his wife Hilary.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are providing assistance to the family of a British man following his tragic death in India on October 13.

“Our thoughts are with the family at this sad time.”

Writing on their blog, ourmiddleagedgapyear.wordpress.com, the couple said they were renting out their home and trying to live on £100 a day.

They said: “We are Hilary and Roger a married couple from England/Scotland who are in their mid fifties.

“Hilary’s motto is ‘just do it’ whilst Roger’s is ‘to die young as late as possible’.

“We took the view that on your deathbed you never wish you’d spent more time in the office.

“We’ve seen our two kids off into the wider world and we have no more caring responsibilities for our parents.

“So we thought now is the time to take a gap year and travel whilst we still have the health and energy. After all you only live once.”

The couple started with a two-month tour of Italy before taking in south and north America, Australia, and several Asian countries. India was intended to be their final stop, according to the blog.

Describing their motivations for the project, they said: “Rather than drift into comfortable retirement we wanted to do something different.

“Also there are many parts of the world we want to see and we figured continual travel would be more of a switch off and better value for money.

“One aim is to experience countries as travellers rather than time-conscious tourists.

“We had kids soon after we married so hadn’t travelled much as a couple and wanted to experience living abroad for an extended time.”

Labor said the new fund would support Australian manufacturing firms who wanted to grow their businesses and create jobs, but who were struggling to access private finance.

The big new fund, modelled on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, could help give firms a boost in blue collar sectors like the auto industry, food manufacturing and metal fabricating, Labor said.

The automotive industry has been battered recently by the shutdown of Holden, Ford and Toyota, including the closure of plants and the loss of thousands of local jobs.

""Labor wants Australia to be a successful advanced manufacturing nation, but we recognise that firms need assistance to modernise and move into high-value production to make them globally competitive,"" Shorten said in a joint Labor media statement.

The opposition said the fund would especially back investment in advanced manufacturing, engineering and design by partnering with private finance to reduce the perceived risk in innovative projects.

""Reducing that risk will make these projects more attractive to lenders of private capital,"" Shorten added.

“After the election... it was never really a serious thought in my mind ‘I’m going to give it all up, go and be a goat herder’,” Miliband said on Robinson’s podcast Political Thinking.

Discusiones sobre el origen del hummus, tours de pan de muerto y qué tan orgánico es el jitomate que tienes en tu mesa plagan las redes sociales y pareciera que ""todo el mundo"" está involucrado en la discusión sobre dónde comer el mejor ramen posible.

Aun cuando muchas veces pensamos en los ""niños que no tienen que comer"", en pocas ocasiones pensamos en aquellos que incluso cuando tienen que comer, no cuentan con los recursos o conocimientos para mantener una dieta balanceada. La comida da dignidad , cuando comemos no solo alimentamos nuestro cuerpo sino que mostramos nuestra personalidad, recordamos quienes somos y encontramos momentos reconfortantes aun en medio del caos. Cuando cocinamos entonces es importante pensar que aquel que se sentara en nuestra mesa no solo está buscando calorías, sino un momento de calma y de descanso, una buena charla con el de junto , en pocas palabras "" un abrazo gastronómico"".

Y fue justo esta de idea de alimentar a otros para recordarles quiénes son, para agradecer y consolar la que guió a algunos de los miles de mexicanos que decidieron ponerse a cocinar para ayudar a los demás durante el terremoto del 19S. Ya recorren las redes sociales decenas de listas con nombres de aclamados chefs y restaurantes que piden se regrese a sus restaurantes y se ayude a revivir la Condesa. Otras listas nos dicen quiénes ayudaron y de qué manera. Sin duda son estos negocios los que deberíamos favorecer cuando salimos a cenar.

La comida está de moda, y eso ha ocasionado que en muchas ocasiones banalicemos su importancia.

Sin embargo, los pequeños héroes parecen estar un poco en el olvido. Me refiero a aquellos negocios no tan conocidos y que arriesgando todo decidieron ayudar el 19S. Hay dos casos que a mí me emocionan muchísimo, pues no solo se dieron a la tarea de alimentar evacuados y rescatistas, además recordaron que su deber no era tan solo hacer tortas de jamón y queso, sino proveer a aquellos que los buscaran con comidas dignas que los apapacharan un poco en medio de la tragedia.

El primer caso es el del servicio de catering Oficina Gourmet dirigido por el chef Luis Ordaz. Oficina Gourmet se dedica principalmente al catering social y empresarial así como a la organización de eventos como bodas. Durante los días siguientes al temblor y hasta ahora que escribo, Oficina Gourmet ha decidido servir miles de comidas tanto a rescatistas como a damnificados donando tiempo, instalaciones y mano de obra y contando con donaciones de particulares no solo en México sino de Bélgica, Canadá y China.

Pero no solo se sentaron a hacer sándwiches de pan blanco. No, el menú preparado cambió frecuentemente respondiendo a las necesidades de los voluntarios: ""La gente está harta de tortas, ayúdenos trayendo pasta y otros alimentos que podamos cocinar"". Y así fue que al día siguiente sirvieron pasta con crema de mole y ha continuado variando el menú. Sin embargo, el negocio ha caído desde el temblor y les han cancelado más de diez eventos: ""La gente no tiene ganas de festejar"". Así que si tienes ganar de seguir ayudando puedes donar productos a Oficina Gourmet o de casualidad tienes un evento pronto ¡recuérdalos! Puedes contactar al chef Luis por Facebook.

Otro caso es el de la cafetería Romanata, ubicada en la calle de Manzanillo. Su dueña, Adriana, no solo utilizo las instalaciones del lugar para preparar comida para los rescatistas y vecinos de la colonia Roma y del Colegio Rébsamen, sino que donó todos los productos y el inventario que tenía en existencia y cerró la cafetería para establecer un centro de acopio. ""Cuando vi lo que estaba pasando a mi alrededor deje de pensar en el negocio y done todo, solo quería ayudar y eso hicimos"", explica ella. Y fue eso exactamente lo que hizo, desde pan dulce y café para calentar las noches y mañanas de rescatistas y voluntarios a sándwiches saludables y elegantes aguas minerales, Adriana decidió donar absolutamente todo.

Ahora Romanata necesita nuestra ayuda; desde el terremoto la clientela ha bajado muchísimo y necesitan que vayamos. Así que si pasas por la Roma, ¿porque no desayunar una de sus gloriosas conchas de matcha o su pan de muerto relleno de nata?

La comida está de moda, y eso ha ocasionado que en muchas ocasiones banalicemos su importancia. Espero que el 19S nos haya recordado que cocinar para otros es un acto de generosidad inmenso sobre todo cuando ponemos lo mejor de nosotros en ello. Romanata y Oficina Gourmet son solo dos ejemplos de los muchos negocios que ayudaron y que ahora necesitan que todos los foodies les echen la mano ahora.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon Studios chief Roy Price was put on an immediate leave of absence Thursday, the company said, following allegations that he harassed a producer and ignored an actress's claim of a sexual assault by producer Harvey Weinstein.

The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday reported an allegation by Isa Hackett, a producer on one of Amazon.com Inc's shows, that Price had lewdly propositioned her in 2015.

Amazon said in a statement: ""Roy Price is on leave of absence effective immediately. We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with The Weinstein Co.""

Hackett did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not independently confirm the allegation. Price could not immediately be reached independently by Reuters and he declined to comment to the Hollywood Reporter.

Price's removal creates uncertainty about the studio's direction when Amazon is investing more on video content than ever before - some $4.5 billion this year.

The studio's Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng will step in as the interim chief, Amazon said.

Hackett is the daughter of famed science fiction author Philip K. Dick, whose book ""The Man in the High Castle"" served as the basis for Amazon's eponymous show.

Also on Thursday, actress Rose McGowan said on Twitter that she had told Price that she had been assaulted by Weinstein, who was forced out of his company this week following reports in the New Yorker and the New York Times that he had harassed and assaulted numerous women over the years. In tweets directed at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, she criticized the company for doing business with the Weinstein Co.

A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein said: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.""

Price has been integral to Amazon's movie business, helping steer it through an attempt to crowd-source television scripts and garnering Hollywood awards for shows such as ""Transparent.""

Amazon hopes original movies and TV shows will draw new people to join its streaming and shopping club Prime, and in turn buy more goods from the online retailer.

The studio picked up three Oscars this year under Price's helm, though its failure to show at the Emmy Awards last month was seen by many in Hollywood as a setback.

Photographer's Choice RF

According to Dr. Sarah Johns, an evolutionary psychology expert at the University of Kent, kissing with tongues is our attempt to ""sniff out"" a genetically compatible partner.

Kissing with tongues is our attempt to ""sniff out"" a genetically compatible partner.

""Humans don't have strong olfactory skills and kissing allows you to smell and taste a person and see if you have different immune responses as we tend to feel more attracted to someone with a different immune response,"" Dr. Johns explained to The Telegraph.

This is because having a different immune response than your partner means there's a higher chance you'll have a child with a strong immune system and thus, a better ability to fight off infectious diseases.

Past studies support this and have actually shown that we're attracted to people with strong immune systems and not just their physical appearance.

""Initial attraction may include facial, body and social cues. Then assessments become more and more intimate as we go deeper into the courtship stages, and this is where kissing comes in,"" explained behavioural scientist Rafael Wlodarski, who conducted an Oxford University study on kissing in 2013.

By assessing compatible immune responses through kissing, we can also ""reduce the risk of miscarriages — ultimately supporting the survival of the species,"" Fulvio D'Acquisto, an immunology professor at Roehampton University, added in an interview with The Telegraph.

Looks like kissing with tongues is about more than just arousal. However, arousal does play critical role when it comes to assessing a potential partner.

""Research shows that sexual arousal lessens feelings of disgust,"" Dr. Johns noted, which is why we're able to look past the grossness when it comes to swapping saliva. Who knew?

Um die Rechten zu verstehen, lohnt ein Blick nach Österreich und in die Schweiz

Denn die rechtsnationale FPÖ und die völkische SVP haben nicht nur eine ähnliche Geschichte, wie die AfD - sondern auch ähnliche Schwächen

Von Österreich lernen heißt manchmal auch zu lernen, wie man es nicht macht.

Es war im Mai 2016, der Abend nach dem zweiten Wahlgang zur österreichischen Bundespräsidentenwahl. Noch weiß niemand, dass dieses Votum Wochen später annulliert werden sollte, weil es zu Unregelmäßigkeiten bei der Briefwahl kam.

Für die österreichischen Grünen war der Politiker Alexander Van der Bellen ins Rennen gegangen. Im zweiten Wahlgang wurde er auch von den österreichischen Sozialdemokraten unterstützt. Van der Bellens Anhänger feierten in einem piekfeinen Palais am Wiener Ring. Goldverzierter Stuck an den Wänden, aufwändige Malereien. Die Decken so hoch die die Fabrikhalle eines mittelständischen Maschinenbaubetriebs.

Zutritt gab es nur durch eine Eingangsschleuse. Und während das linke Österreich auf die knappen Wahlergebnisse wartete, hielt es sich vornehmlich am Sekt- oder am Weinglas fest.

Einige Kilometer weiter, im Prater, feierte die FPÖ mit ihrem Kandidaten Norbert Hofer. Einlass gab es für jeden, der kommen wollte. Auf der Bühne sang eine volkstümliche Kapelle. Hendl und literweise Bier wurden gratis serviert. Noch vor Sonnenuntergang, und lang bevor es irgendwelche Ergebnisse gab, begann Österreichs Rechte zu tanzen und zu singen.

Es war ein Bild wie bei Don Camillo und Peppone, das Wien an diesem Abend abgab. Ein schauriges Spiegelbild eines total verunglückten Wahlkampfs.

Gute Argumente sind wichtig – aber manchmal reichen sie nicht

Auf der einen Seite das linke Establishment, das sich selbst mit Pomp und Prunk feierte. Auf der anderen Seite die ewig attackierende Rechte, die selbst in den Stunden der Ungewissheit von sich behaupten konnte, dass sie etwas kommuniziert: Nämlich, dass sie die Sache mit der Volkstümlichkeit besser versteht als die alte Arbeiterpartei SPÖ.

In Österreich, und auch in der Schweiz, sind rechtsradikale Positionen schon seit Jahren in den Mittelpunkt der öffentlichen Debatte gerückt. Das drückt sich auch in den Wahlergebnissen aus: Die FPÖ schaffte es im vergangenen Jahr, beinahe den Bundespräsidenten zu stellen.

Und die SVP ist mit 29,4 Prozent der Stimmen bei der Nationalratswahl 2015 die mit Abstand stärkste Kraft geworden.

Der Aufstieg der Rechtspopulisten in unseren Nachbarländern zeigt uns, was schief laufen kann im Kampf gegen fremdenfeindliches Gedankengut, so wie es die AfD in Deutschland bisweilen vertritt. Gute Argumente sind wichtig – aber manchmal reichen sie nicht.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 8 Dinge, die jeder tun kann, um den Aufstieg der AfD zu stoppen



Immer wieder beruft sich die Alternative für Deutschland etwa auf die SVP in der Schweiz – was nicht selten Unmut bei der Volkspartei hervorruft.

In der Schweiz gibt man sich als Rechter gerne bürgerlich, in Deutschland operiert die AfD gezielt mit Bildern der Revolution und des Umsturzes – zuletzt im Wahlkampf, als Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel im Rahmen einer Kampagne als „Eidbrecherin“ bezeichnet wurde.

Beide Parteien jedoch beherrschen geschickt das Spiel mit den Ängsten der Bürger. Sie stoßen damit jeweils in eine Lücke auf dem Markt der politischen Ideen, die durch jahrelange Konsenspolitik erzeugt wurde.

Stimmungsmache gegen die Konsenskultur

In der Schweiz war der Konsens jahrzehntelang das wichtigste Mittel der Politik. Der Bundesrat, das Äquivalent zur deutschen Bundesregierung, wird aus Vertretern aller größeren Parteien gebildet. Die Große Koalition in Berlin wiederum repräsentierte 80 Prozent der Abgeordneten. Mehr Konsens geht in der deutschen Politik kaum.

Seit den 1990er-Jahren hat es die SVP geschickt verstanden, gegen die Konsenskultur Stimmung zu machen. Dadurch sind Positionen sagbar geworden, die noch vor einigen Jahren allenfalls an Stammtischen auf Unterstützung getroffen werden.

Die AfD hat diese Strategie schon im Namen: Sie will eine ""Alternative“ zu den so genannten ""Altparteien“ sein.

Eine ""Alternative“ zu sein reicht jedoch noch nicht. Ob eine ""Alternative“ auch vom Wähler als solche wahrgenommen wird, hängt maßgeblich davon ab, welche Zukunftsbilder sie im Angebot hat.

Die Autorin Charlotte Theile zitiert in ihrem Buch ""Ist die AfD zu stoppen?“ den Werbestrategen der SVP, Alexander Segert, der im Vorfeld des Bundestagswahlkampfs 2017 auch mit der AfD zusammengearbeitet hat: ""Ich gebe der Angst eine Stimme.“

Die deutschenParteien haben verlernt, die Bürger direkt anzusprechen

Man kann sich zurecht über die Plakatkampagnen der SVP echauffieren: Sie zeigen Minarette, die wie Schwerter aussehen oder schwarze Schafe, die aus der Schweiz heraus gekickt werden. Aber sie sprechen eine klare, eindringliche Sprache, die von der Zielgruppe verstanden wird. Wer für die Begehren der SVP stimmt, weiß am Ende, welche Schweiz er bekommt.

Das haben die deutschen Parteien verlernt. Dabei konnten sie es mal sehr gut: Adenauer, der sich 1957 mit dem Slogan ""Keine Experimente!“ plakatieren ließ. Das traf den Nerv, denn Deutschland hatte damals die Wahl zwischen einer Fortsetzung der Unionspolitik und dem Wechsel zur damals noch sozialistisch-marxistischen SPD.

#Merkel's pressekonference og kommende valgkamp synes inspireret af Konrad Adenauer fra 1957 - Keine Experimente efter Brexit, Trump etc pic.twitter.com/9gsXMnx3mB — Lykke Friis (@lykkefriis) 20. November 2016

Oder 1998, als die SPD das Bild von Gerhard Schröder mit dem Slogan ""Ich bin bereit!“ versah. Deutschland war es damals auch, nach 16 Jahren Kanzlerschaft von Helmut Kohl wollten viele Bürger einen Wechsel. Seitdem war wohl nie wieder so viel Zukunft in der SPD zu spüren.

Dabei wollen die Menschen wissen, in welche Richtung sich ihr Land in politisch unruhigen Zeiten entwickelt.

Die Rechten spielen die Metropolen gegen die Provinz aus

Die FPÖ wiederum beherrscht meisterhaft das Spiel mit den Gegensätzen zwischen Stadt und Land. Österreich hat acht Millionen Einwohner. Die Mehrheit davon lebt außerhalb Wiens, und doch hat die Stadt mit ihren knapp zwei Millionen Einwohnern eine dominante Stellung in Österreich.

Der frühere Bürgermeister von Hamburg, Klaus von Dohnanyi, merkte kürzlich bei Sandra Maischberger an, dass in Zeiten der Globalisierung nicht umsonst die Tracht eine Renaissance erlebt. Die Leute sehnten sich nach Identität. Dafür erntete er viel Gelächter. Doch er traf genau den Punkt.

In Österreich wird die globalisierte Metropole Wien von den Rechten gegen die ländlichen Regionen ausgespielt. In Deutschland schafft es die AfD ebenfalls sehr geschickt, die Komplexe der deutschen Provinz gegenüber dem florierenden Berlin für ihre Zwecke zu instrumentalisieren.

In der Schweiz ist es die ""Operation Libero“, die maßgeblich am erfolgreichen Wahlkampf gegen die ""Ausschaffungsinitiative“ (etwa: ""Abschiebungsinitiative“) im Jahr 2016 beteiligt war. In Österreich sind es die ""Neos“, denen im Oktober der Wiedereinzug ins Parlament gelingen könnte.

In Deutschland dagegen wanzt sich FDP-Chef Christian Lindner mit seinen Aussagen zur Russland-Politik an AfD-Wähler heran. Auch hier gibt es noch einiges zu tun.

In a post to Facebook on Thursday night, event organisers from management group Kicks Entertainment said planning, risk assessment, insurance and legal framework documents were not provided by the Safety Testing Advisory Service at Festivals and Events (STA-SAFE), a collaborative body of health organisations who were behind the pill testing trial, in time for a festival licence application to be lodged with the federal National Capital Authority (NCA).

#BREAKING Aus-first trial of pill testing at a music festival will no longer go ahead after the organisers of Spilt Milk pulled out — Avani (@AvaniDias) October 12, 2017

Due to the fact that the Spilt Milk festival is held at Commonwealth Park, which is land owned by the Federal Government, STA-SAFE needed to meet the NCA festival licence application deadline in order for pill testing to be approved and included as an aspect of the event.

""Since the ACT Government's progressive announcement that pill testing would be conducted by STA-SAFE at this year's Spilt Milk event, we have been awaiting STA-SAFE's operational plan, associated risk assessment, insurance and legal framework for their trialling of pill testing on federal land,"" the post said.

""With these items not yet received, and Spilt Milk just six weeks away, we had to submit 2017 event operation planning without STA-SAFE's pill testing to the NCA, the owner of the land on which Spilt Milk takes place. We had to do this to ensure everything necessary was in place for the event to take place on the 25th of November.

""Unfortunately, what this means is that pill testing is not able to be trialled at this year's event. We are hugely disappointed as Spilt Milk strongly supports pill testing as a harm minimisation measure, but we would be more disappointed for this hugely complicated and important issue to be handled incorrectly and result in a trial that doesn't institute change in Australia.""

In September, it was confirmed that the ACT government had thrown its support behind the trial, with pills that were brought to the testing service expected to be examined by emergency consultant Dr David Caldicott and a team of chemists from the Australian National University (ANU).

On Thursday night, a spokesperson for the ACT Government told HuffPost Australia in a statement the absence of pill testing at the festival is ""disappointing"".

""This is a disappointing decision. The ACT Government, through the risk assessment process we undertook, determined that pill testing was appropriate to reduce the harm of individuals engaging in recreational drug use,"" the spokesperson said.

""This was the opportunity to hold the safest festival in Australia. We will be looking into whether we can provide any further information before any final decisions are made.""

Pill testing at Spilt Milk festival wont go ahead. What devastating news for HR and saving lives. Keep at it @ShaneRattenbury @ReGenUC — FFDLR (@FFDLR) October 12, 2017

And while the trial was heralded as a win for harm reduction among festival patrons, Gino Vumbaca, the president and co-founder of Harm Reduction Australia -- the parent body behind STA-SAFE -- confirmed to HuffPost Australia that the advisory body had only been made aware by the NCA of additional documentation requirements on Wednesday, and then 24 hours later were told it had missed the deadline.

""We were asked for all that information yesterday. The promoter was asked to provide that to the NCA at short notice. We're still working on that documentation and still working on getting it altogether,"" Vumbaca said.

""We understand the pressures that are on the promoter to get approvals. We understand that the festival was in jeopardy without that documentation but the reality is that the NCA provided a very unrealistic time-frame for us to get that information to them.""

""The ACT government is committed to pill testing at the festival, we're committed to doing it and so we'll do it -- if not at this [year's festival], the next one. It will happen.""

Pill testing blocked at Spilt Milk. So now what happens if, say, someone gets a bad batch and dies? What's the government / media response? — brad esposito (@braddybb) October 12, 2017

Earlier on Thursday Ryan Phillips, the director of Kicks Entertainment, told Triple J's 'Hack' program that responsibility for the mix-up fell to STA-SAFE and that event organisers are still advocating for the trial to go ahead.

Despite this, comments from the ACT Shadow Minister for Health Vicki Dunne in August threw doubt over the future of the program after she said that she was uncertain on whether the Federal government would give its approval.

""There is serious doubt as to whether the government can or should be implementing pill testing,"" she told Parliament.

""The Spilt Milk festival is at Commonwealth Park, which is on Commonwealth land. Pill testing will need Commonwealth Government approval, and I doubt that they will give it.""

A celebration to commemorate India Post and honour its indefatigable postmen.
The postman came twice a day, at 8.30 am, and 2.30 pm.
So I wonder who uses India Post today.","ADVERTISEMENT

Today is World Post Day. Its purpose is to remind the world about the Post's role in the everyday lives of people and businesses and its contribution to global social and economic development. This was mooted by an Indian, Anand Mohan Narula, in 1969 at a Universal Postal Union Congress held in Tokyo. Since then, World Post Day has been celebrated on October 9.

I had never heard of it before, but I am all in favour of the day. A celebration to commemorate India Post and honour its indefatigable postmen. There was a time when the postman was my friend. I was in my teens and had 33 penpals from different parts of the country. The postman came twice a day, at 8.30 am, and 2.30 pm. I used to wait for the sound of the curtains rustling as he pushed the mail in through the letter slot of our door. The soft 'plop' it made as it fell onto the floor was the highlight of my day.

I would spend a few luxurious moments guessing where the letters were from. The beautiful Bengali girl studying in Santiniketan? Or the rugged Nepali from the old Ghoom Monastery in Darjeeling? Maybe it was from Madras, Raipur, Meerut, Jammu, Bhopal, or even Jhumri Telaiya that was originally in Bihar and is now in Jharkhand. I had pen pals my age, of both sexes, with whom I would shyly share the fantasies of youth, and boldly exchange black-and-white photos taken on Agfa and Kodak gravure cameras. The postman was the go-between. Our friendly neighbourhood messenger.

Nobody I knew, got packages in the mail, nor money. Telegrams, by some strange design, only arrived in the dead of night.

At Diwali and Christmas, the postman would knock on the door grinning in greeting. It was customary to give him what was known as baksheesh. He would be accompanied by the postmen who did the VVP (Value Payable Post) a.k.a the Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra and Snapdeal of those days, and do the Money Order rounds. The fellow who cycled up in a tearing hurry with telegrams that only carried news of death from faraway places also came along those days. We only saw these postmen on festive occasions.

Nobody I knew, got packages in the mail, nor money. Telegrams, by some strange design, only arrived in the dead of night. And nobody grudged these postmen their baksheesh.

Today's generation will not know the romance of receiving mail through the post.

That was then. I haven't seen the postman in ages. I understand he mainly delivers government documents such as passports, driving licenses and Aadhar cards now. Instead, the courier man comes at odd hours with mail. I wake up every morning to find my Gmail inbox flooded with correspondence. The ping on my cell phone announces the arrival of a message on SMS or Whatsapp that beats the Express Telegram. So I wonder who uses India Post today.

I still look for its familiar squat red post-box patiently standing on street corners. Its mouth yawning wide and waiting for mail to be fed in. And then I am dismayed to see its stomach hollow and gaping open because some vagrant or druggie has cruelly broken its door to sell as scrap metal. I feel a twinge of regret and sadness. Today's generation will not know the romance of receiving mail through the post. Or the nail-biting anxiety of the school exam results coming home at the end of the summer vacation.

Everything is done online or sent by email. But in cities like London and New York, I find post-boxes gaily painted in red and blue, which tells me the Post Office is active there. I take pictures with them like they are old friends. When I can, I buy attractive postcards and mail them to myself. Just for the thrill of hearing the curtains rustle again back home, as the postman drops the mail in through the letter-slot that will fall with a soft 'plop' on the floor.

For Kalmus, personal and global transformation are intertwined: As he writes in the intro to Being The Change:""Global warming touches every aspect of our lives.
Global warming is, perhaps first and foremost, a failure of humanity's collective imagination.""
And that plays into using less fossil fuels, which are kind of there to make us zoom around really fast.""
The problem is that by burning fossil fuels into the atmosphere we're causing the blanket to become warmer.","The addiction we never even think about.

We're helplessly, hopelessly hooked. Virtually all of us have an insatiable thirst for some of the most fantastically addictive products humanity has ever invented.

These are products we rarely think about in terms of being addicted, because everyone uses them, and we largely take them for granted. They are products which fuel our busy lifestyles, yet which ironically now threaten them.

The products are fossil fuels, and this is the story of one man doing his utmost to cut them from his life.

Peter Kalmus is a climate scientist with NASA's jet propulsion lab. We profiled him in our climate change podcast Breaking The Ice a little earlier this year. As we said then, despite his line of work, Kalmus is unlikely ever to take a jet anywhere ever again.

Kalmus started giving up fossil fuels a few years ago now. Through a mixture of dietary, transport and other lifestyle changes, he's cut down to about 10 percent of the fossil fuel he once consumed.

The really amazing thing about cutting back?

If Peter Kalmus is any guide, it might just make you a whole lot happier.

Kalmus is living a much more satisfying life without fossil fuels than he ever dreamed. He's incredibly upbeat in person, and that attitude shines through in his new book Being The Change: Live Well And Spark A Climate Revolution.

If you could stop global warming with a smile, Kalmus would have frozen years ago.

The book's title says it all. Peter Kalmus really is being the change. He's being the internal change, living his best life by farming bees in his backyard, cycling to work, and skipping exhausting work trips interstate and abroad. And he's living the external change, doing his bit for the climate system, and through it, the earth.

For Kalmus, personal and global transformation are intertwined: As he writes in the intro to Being The Change:

""Global warming touches every aspect of our lives. It connects gardening to population growth, bicycling to flying in a plane. Most of all, global warming challenges us to rethink humanity's place in the web of life on this beautiful planet -- to reimagine what it means to be human. Global warming is, perhaps first and foremost, a failure of humanity's collective imagination.""

And as he told us in the podcast:

""Increasingly I sense that people are gaining an awareness that the social media, the flying around and the career pressure, all the running around and the rat race and the speed that life has taken on, that somehow we've been misled, that something isn't quite right. ""We're consuming more than ever and yet life seems less satisfying than ever. So all I'm saying is if we look inside ourselves a little bit more instead of consuming, maybe slow down a little bit instead of speeding up. And that plays into using less fossil fuels, which are kind of there to make us zoom around really fast.""

This really is a book like no other.

Climate science literature is often too dense, difficult or depressing. As Kalmus points out, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report was a whopping 4,852 pages. Who's going to read that?

Kalmus makes it easy for us. He sums up the science in 34 pages. His stated goal is to ""give the context necessary for a basic understanding of the global warming that's happening at this moment, but not to overwhelm you with more than that"".

And he pulls it off. For example, his description of the greenhouse effect is simple enough for anyone to understand:

""Greenhouse gases like CO2 act like a blanket warming the planet. We need this blanket. Without it the Earth's average surface temperature would be −18°C (0°F) and there could be no life as we know it. So the greenhouse effect per se is not a bad thing. The problem is that by burning fossil fuels into the atmosphere we're causing the blanket to become warmer. By 2014 we'd already in creased the atmospheric CO2 fraction by 43% over pre-industrial levels, and this increase is accelerating exponentially.""

The climate section is about 10 percent of the book. The rest is mostly about Kalmus' personal transformation. It's often pretty funny stuff. Wait till you read about Kalmus family holidays with their beaten up old car which runs on veggie fuel. It's not quite the Griswolds, but it's close.

It's not preachy or narcissistic. Phew.

Personal transformation books are often trite exercises in ego-driven vanity. Being The Change is not that. It's one guy's journey, written honestly, openly, with gallons of facts underpinning it all.

Kalmus has an easy, optimistic style which makes you want to hang out with him.

Not all of us are going to give up flying overnight like he did. We'll likely still be racing around tomorrow living our fossil fuel-charged lives. But who knows? Maybe we'll be inspired to make a small change or two. And that, says Kalmus, is the thing he hopes for.

As he writes:

""I'm aware that the changes I'm making to my daily life will not solve global warming or stave off global economic collapse. How could they? We're rapidly approaching eight billion people on the planet, and I am only one of them. However, my actions do make me happier, and that's reason enough to do them. I also suspect that for most of us, individual and local-scale actions are the most skillful means to effect global-scale change. This is a paradox of scale. Our individual actions don't make much of an immediate difference in the global response to our predicament, but they are pieces in a vast puzzle. As more pieces get added, more people will get excited by the emerging picture and begin to add their own pieces. The prevailing mindset in our industrial society is to search for a silver bullet solution, some brilliant techno-fix that allows us to avoid personal change (which is assumed to be undesirable). After decades of searching by the world's brightest minds, however, it seems likely that there is no such silver bullet. Personal change will therefore likely be necessary.""

And as Kalmus has shown, personal change is so much more than ""necessary"". It can be enjoyable too.

Originaire du Canada, la jeune mère a vécu neuf ans au Japon, est mariée à un Japonais et a donné naissance à leur fille, à Naha, la capitale de l'île d'Okinawa. Au pays du Soleil levant, les femmes ont pour habitude de rester au minimum quatre nuits après l'accouchement.

L'assurance maladie japonaise prend totalement en charge les frais d'hospitalisation et grâce à une initiative du gouvernement visant à augmenter le nombre de naissances, le couple devrait recevoir près de 2000 euros par mois à partir de maintenant, a-t-elle précisé sur Reddit.

Les repas semblent un peu copieux parce qu'ils sont destinés à des femmes qui allaitent le plus souvent et dépensent donc 300 à 500 calories de plus par jour. Bon appétit!

Überall, selbst in entlegenen Bergdörfern, lächelt einem alle paar hundert Meter Sebastian Kurz (31) entgegen. Er ist bei den anstehenden Nationalratswahlen nicht nur das Gesicht seiner Partei ÖVP, er ist schlechthin das Gesicht Österreichs. Das Gesicht der Zukunft, glauben seine zahlreichen Anhänger, so einer täte auch Deutschland gut. Mehr geht eigentlich nicht.

Es ist kein Männergesicht, das von den Wahlplakaten lächelt. Seine Züge sind weich, fast kindlich. Das Kantige fehlt völlig, die Wangen glänzen stets rosig, auch in natura. Man mag sich gar nicht ausmalen, wie dieses Gesicht in 30, 40 Jahre aussehen könnte: Vielleicht - und davor möge ihn der Himmel oder sonst wer bewahren - wie ""Mörtel"", das zweitbekannteste Gesicht Österreichs: Richard Lugner, der seit 85 Jahren lächelt, dessen Wangen seit 85 Jahren rosig glänzen?

Hier bekommen Sie ""Das Politikbuch: Wichtige Theorien einfach erklärt""

Sebastian Kurz könnte dem ersten (täuschenden) Eindruck nach 20 sein. Er ist aber schon 31. Nun schickt er sich an, der jüngste Bundeskanzler in der Geschichte Österreichs, ach was: in der Geschichte Europas, zu werden.

Höchst auffällig

Bei allen Weichzeichnungen - Sebastian Kurz ""ist eine höchst auffällige Figur"", sagt der österreichische Karikaturist Gerhard Haderer, dessen bissige Bildgeschichten über 20 Jahre lang im ""Stern"" erschienen sind. Kurz sei ""ein sehr talentierter Redner, eine telegene Lichtgestalt. Er wird im Augenblick gefeiert wie ein Messias... Klugheit würde ich ihm unterstellen, Authentizität nicht. Das fehlt mir. Er ist eine Kunstfigur.""

Ist er wirklich ""so neu, so frisch, so aalglatt"", wie ihn bezeichnenderweise und seltsam sanft die kommunistische ""UZ"", das Organ der DKP bezeichnete? Nach einem der unzähligen TV-Duelle, die nur eines schlüssig bewiesen haben, dass nämlich der sprichwörtliche österreichische Charme auch in abstoßenden Schlammschlachten eine scharfe Waffe sein kann, urteilte die ""Welt"": ""Kurz scheint mit seinen 31 Jahren ohnehin nie etwas anderes als ,staatsmännisch' gewesen zu sein. Man kann ihn sich sogar vorstellen, wie er bereits in der Sandkiste mit vor der Brust verschränkten Armen dastand. Wo wenig Inhalt ist, da muss der Körper analysiert werden. Also sprach ein ,Experte': Sieger nach Punkten: Sebastian Kurz, weil er auch mal mit der Handkante vor dem Moderator auf den Tisch haute.""

""Feschak"" sagt man in Österreich zu attraktiven Typen wie ihm. Seit über einem Jahr führt er mit diesem Image die Rankings der beliebtesten Politiker an. Und im amerikanischen Nachrichtenmagazin ""Time"" wurde Kurz 2017 zu einem von zehn ""Next Generation Leaders"" gekürt. Ein Ausnahme-Talent im drögen, verlogenen Politikbetrieb, der den meisten jungen Leuten so überdrüssig ist?

Das Wunderkind

""Die äußere Geschichte des Aufstiegs von Sebastian Kurz ist leicht zu erzählen"", schreibt das Politmagazin ""Cicero"": ""Ein sehr junger Mann beschließt, Berufspolitiker zu werden. Er überlebt mühelos das innerparteiliche Geklüngel, wird mit 24 Jahren Abgeordneter, mit 25 Staatssekretär, mit 27 jüngster Außenminister der österreichischen Geschichte - ein politisches Wunderkind also. Mit sicherem Instinkt wählt er die brennendsten Gegenwartsfragen zu seiner Agenda: Migration, Integrationsprobleme, Kampf der Kulturen, Flüchtlingskrise.""

Manchmal wirkt Sebastian Kurz wie aus der Zeit gefallen: Chic, jung, dynamisch - die Attribute der Popper, einer Jugendkultur aus den 80ern, die er mühelos verkörpert. Wer ihn zum ersten Mal sieht, assoziiert einen plakativen Hedonismus mit Kaschmir-Pulli, Lacoste-Hemd und Porsche-Cabrio, rein äußerliche Merkmale eines jugendlichen Wertkonservativismus.

Doch diesem Bild und dem damit verbundenen Image des Schnösels aus reichem Elternhaus mit exklusiver Bildung entspricht Kurz' Vita mitnichten. Er stammt aus dem 12. Wiener Gemeindebezirk Meidling, einem Arbeiterviertel. Sein Vater ist Ingenieur, die Mutter Lehrerin. Seine aktuelle Wohnung befindet sich ebenfalls in Meidling, verkehrsgünstig zwischen zwei U-Bahn-Stationen, der berühmte Schlosspark von Schönbrunn ist nicht weit.

Er war früh interessiert

Als Schüler ist er nur aufgefallen, als die Gymnasiasten im Wahlfach Wirtschaftskunde eine Firma gründeten. Unter dem Namen ""Kids and the City"" betreuten sie Grundschulkinder gegen Honorar. Sebastian Kurz war Geschäftsführer und Marketingleiter.

Die Politik hat ihn früh interessiert, man darf vermuten, dass es weniger die Inhalte waren, sondern eher die Karrieremöglichkeiten, die sich einem gewitzten und charmanten jungen Mann wie ihm boten.

Heute beweist er seine umjubelten Fähigkeiten als politischer Entertainer, wenn er die Geschichte erzählt, wie er als 16-Jähriger in die ÖVP eintreten wollte: ""Als ich die Junge Volkspartei in Meidling angerufen habe, sagte mir jemand, ich sei zu jung. Das macht nichts, habe ich gesagt, mein Problem wird mit jedem Tag kleiner. Sie seien auch sehr wenige, hieß es dann. Macht nichts, habe ich geantwortet, ich bringe meine Freunde mit. Aber sie treffen sich eigentlich nie, weil es sich nicht auszahlt, hieß es. Dann habe ich es sein lassen und mich wieder auf Schule, Partys und Tennis konzentriert.""

Er hat natürlich nicht klein beigegeben. Nach dem Abitur und dem Beginn des Jurastudiums (abgebrochen) stand die Politik bei ihm an erster Stelle. Dabei ließ und lässt der ""Freund der Klarheit"", so die Selbstbeschreibung auf seiner Facebook-Seite (mehr als 700.000 Abonnenten), auch gern seine Fantasie schweifen.

""Schwarz macht geil""

Denkwürdig ist seine Kampagne als Chef der Jungen ÖVP im Wiener Kommunalwahlkampf 2010. In Anlehnung an die Parteifarbe Schwarz kreierte Kurz den Slogan ""Schwarz macht geil"". Er bretterte mit einem schwarzen ""Geil-o-Mobil"" vom Typ Hummer durch die Hauptstadt. Auf der Kühlerhaube des Luxusgeländewagens rekelten sich ein paar leicht bekleidete junge Frauen in Hot Pants, die ""Geilmacherinnen"", zur Kurz-Botschaft: ""Schwarz macht geile Politik. Schwarz macht geile Partys. Schwarz macht Wien geil.""

Ein weiterer Teil der Kurz-Kampagne war die Forderung nach einem durchgängigen Betrieb der Wiener U-Bahn in Wien. Auf Bildern war ein junges Paar zu sehen - mit dem Slogan: ""Wenn wir unseren Verkehr so planen, kommen wir nie in Fahrt."" Bei der Gelegenheit verriet Kurz auch, dass er im Alter von 15 Jahren erstmals Sex hatte.

Der Außenminister Sebastian Kurz gilt als nachtragend, Fehler verzeihe er nicht, heißt es. Ständig schaut er auf sein Smartphone, wischt und schaut wieder. Die typische Gestik seiner Generation, den ""Digital Natives"". Doch seine Reflexe als Politiker unterscheiden sich kaum von denen anderer Berufskollegen.

Er habe kein Interesse an ""medialer Präsenz"", wenn es ihm nicht in den Kram passt. Und sein Privatleben sollte - bittschön! - ""nicht medien-öffentlich sein"", falls es mal nicht von ihm gesteuert wird. Immerhin wurde bekannt (oder ließ er streuen), dass er 17.372,50 Euro im Monat verdient plus Sonderbezüge jedes Quartal, was einem 13. und 14. Monatsgehalt entspricht. Er esse leidenschaftlich gern Eiernockerl und gehe trotz seines Stressjobs fast täglich trainieren. Seine Körpergrößte betrage 1,86 Meter, die Jahresurlaube verbringe er meistens in Südtirol beziehungsweise am Gardasee.

Sie erdet ihn

Da fährt dann seine Freundin mit, mit der er auch die Wohnung im 12. Bezirk teilt. Die zierliche blonde Wirtschaftspädagogin Susanne Thier ist als Kommissärin im Finanzministerium tätig. Er ist mit ihr schon im 13. Jahr zusammen, mit 18 hat er sich in sie verliebt. Susanne erde ihn und sei neben seinen Eltern seine wichtigste Beraterin, verriet er dem Radiosender Ö3. Er mache ihr ""regelmäßig Liebeserklärungen.""

Auch über die Familienplanung habe man sich schon Gedanken gemacht. Dann sagt der Mann, der mit 31 Bundeskanzler werden und ein ganzes Land führen will, allen Ernstes, dass er sich eigentlich noch zu jung für Nachwuchs halte.

Diese derart unwiderstehliche Lichtgestalt hat den Satiriker Gerhard Haderer zu einer hübschen Zeichnung inspiriert. Man sieht Kurz als Messias, im Hintergrund lauern ÖVP-Politiker der alten Garde. Sie fordern ihn auf: ""Jetzt zeig mal, was du kannst. Erst gehst du übers Wasser, und dann darfst du noch ein paar Liter Wasser in Wein verwandeln, wir wollen ja auch Spaß haben.""","Sebastian Kurz: Messias, Kanzlerkandidat und Kunstfigur",http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/14/sebastian-kurz-messias-kanzlerkandidat-und-kunstfigur_n_18266820.html?utm_hp_ref=germany&amp;ir=Germany

DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS via Getty Images Jeremy Corbyn told the Co-Operative Party Conference the Tories were 'transparently failing' on Brexit

As Brexit negotiations continue, the prime minister has said that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.

But Corbyn warned in his speech that a no-deal Brexit could mean “economic disaster” in “sector after sector”.

“The risk would be that key manufacturers leave for the European mainland, taking skilled jobs with them,” he warned.

“Theresa May’s Cabinet of chaos is risking a jobs meltdown across Britain.

“A powerful faction of the Tories want a no-deal outcome because they think they can use it to turn our economy into a deregulated tax haven. We must not let them.”

Corbyn also mocked Chancellor Philip Hammond’s claim at Conservative Party Conference earlier this month that Labour represents “an existential challenge to our economic model”.

“Well Philip, yes we do,” Corbyn said, adding the party would not “sit back” while homelessness spiralled.

“Their economic model is broken,” he added of the Tories.

The Co-Operative Party does not field its own political candidates but 38 Labour MPs were elected on a joint ticket with the party.

Corbyn also hit out at Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, accusing both of them of “macho posturing” in the war of words between the two countries over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.

He said: “We live in a world riven by conflict, spurred on by ego and neo-imperial ambition.

Eine Kirche der Zukunft ist „Salz der Welt"" (Mt 5,13)

Die Gesellschaft und Welt von heute sehnt sich massiv nach gelebten, guten Werten sowie nach Menschen, die diese Werte aus ganzem Herzen leben und verkörpern.

Christsein ist in der Tat eine solche Bewegung, die sich auf den Weg gemacht, dem Auferstandenen nachzufolgen. „Die des Weges sind"" war denn auch der erste Nickname der Jesus-Nachfolger.

Statt irgendwelchen Moden und Hypes nachzueifern, ist für Christen zunächst klar: das Feuer des Geistes ist der Auslöser für alles, was die Dynamik des Lebens und christlicher Be-Geist-erung ausmacht und angeht.

„Die Gesellschaft hat uns eingeredet, wir sollten unser Leben lang wie ein 18-jähriges Modelaussehen. Aber ich denke, ich kann genauso gut auch das sein, was ich bin.""

Clint Eastwood

Vor Jahren erlebte ich Clint Eastwood bei der Eröffnung eines Celebrity Golf-Turniers in Pebble Beach (Kalifornien). Ich war angetan von seiner lässigen, individualistisch-fokussierten Art, die einfach nur „da war"", ohne Habitus und großes Gehabe. Ich empfand ihn als jemanden, der keinen Modetrends nachstrebt, sondern einfach „sein Ding"" macht, ohne Etikette-Floskeln. Einer, der sich nicht irritieren lässt von Fremderwartungen und falschen Vorgaben.

Christsein, das Salz der Erde, wie es Jesus in Matthäus 5 in der Bergpredigt formulierte, ist ein Leben, das sich aus der Gotteswahrheit, aus dem Willen Gottes speist und nicht nach den Modevorgaben aktueller It-Geister fragt.

Eine von Christus begeisterte Christenheit

Die leidenschaftliche, aber reflektiert-beherzte Gläubigkeit wäre ein Gegengift gegen eine schematisch- regelhaft und leblos-leer daherkommende Form von Christentum, das die Welt und die Menschen nicht mehr erreichen kann.

Hier kann man bei der Volksmusik eine Menge lernen: da flammt immer wieder echte Herzensbegeisterung auf; egal, und ob man nun auf einem Konzert von Helene Fischer, von Die Schäfer oder bei Hansi Hinterseer ist. Hier spürt man eine Vibration, die selten in christlichen Kontexten anzutreffen ist. Wobei etwa Gemeinden, die in der Hillsong-Tradition arbeiten - oder auch bei einem Blick über den Teich zu Joel Osteen und seiner Lakewood Church - sieht man, dass die Landeskirche deutscher Couleur nicht der Gral der Wahrheit (Weisheit) ist.

Das Christsein hat grundsätzlich mit Begeisterung für den Auferstandenen zu tun: sein Tod am Kreuz, seine Auferstehung bereiteten den Boden für eine von Schuld und Sünde befreite Existenz.

Den Ruf des Auferstandenen hören und ihm nachfolgen. Damit beginnt alles""

„Denn also hat Gott die Welt geliebt, dass er seinen eingeborenen Sohn gab, auf dass alle, die an ihn glauben, nicht verloren werden, sondern das ewige Leben haben.""

Den Blick auf Christus zu richten: darauf käme es in der Tat entscheidend an.

„Seid ihr nun mit Christus auferweckt, so sucht, was droben ist, wo Christus ist, sitzend zur Rechten Gottes."" (Kolosserbrief, Kap. 3, Vers 1)

Doch in Sachen Begeisterung ist basal zu bedenken, dass diese sehr langsam reifen kann und von einer schnell verpuffenden Erregung zu unterscheiden ist:

„Begeisterung ist immer ruhig, immer langsam und bleibt innig. Der plötzliche Ausbruch ist nicht Begeisterung und auch nicht aus ihr hervorgegangen, er kommt aus einem heftigen Zustand. Man soll auch die Begeisterung nicht mit dem Schwung verwechseln, der aufregt, während jene bewegt.""

Joseph Joubert

Wichtig ist, dass die Kirche, dass die aktiven Gemeinden auf die Welt, auf die Menschen zugehen. Dass sie sich nicht hinter herrlichen eigenen Gemäuern in ihrem eigenen Sumpf „verschanzen"" und einigeln. Das geht nur allzu schnell.

Dabei wären in Zeiten der multimedialen Einflussnahme, der Chat-„Boutiquen"", der Twitter-Präsidenten, der Instagram-Influencer und eines generell äußerst durchmediatisierten kontemporären Lifestyles die Formen, in denen wir das Evangelium verkörpern/präsentieren, alles andere als zu vernachlässigen.

Die „Denke"" der Menschen zu begreifen und ihnen auf ihrer Ebene begegnen: den Reichen in ihrer Sprache, den Armen, den Kranken, den Frustrierten, den Gelangweilten so begegnen, dass sie eine offene Tür zum Ergriffensein sehen können und Gottes Geist eine Brücke durch die Art unserer Vermittlung hat.

„Die Kirche, die zu den Menschen geht, kommt mit ihnen ins Gespräch. Jugendliche lassen sich begeistern. Gut inszenierte Projekte ziehen die Menschen an und bewegen sie zum Mitmachen. Glaubensinhalte lassen sich vermitteln, wenn die Darstellung stimmt."" (I. Schwaetzer)

Theologie kann Herz und Denken vereinen und Impulse setzen

Meine einjährige Studienzeit am London Bible College (heute: London School of Theology) hat mir zu Beginn meiner akademischen Vita beigebracht, dass lebendiger Gottesglaube und Begeisterung für Jesus bestens mit hoher Wissenschaftlichkeit einhergehen bzw. damit verbunden werden können.

„Das Herz macht den Theologen."" (August Tholuck)

Eine Theologie, die sich der Wahrheit und der Dynamik des Glaubens verschreibt, wäre heute mehr denn je dran. Eine Theologie, die sich einem geistfreien Denkkonzept und rationalistischen Deutekurven verschreibt und diesen frönt, sollte nicht mehr als eine zeitgemäße Form der Gotteskunst erachtet werden. Eine Hermeneutik, die von tiefem Glauben und großer Leidenschaft für Gott und sein Wort geprägt ist, könnte für Kirche und Gesellschaft Fulminantes leisten und neue Horizonte erschließen helfen.

Ich sehne mich nach Formen von Christsein, die einfach das „Dasein"" der bekehrten und zu Christus gewandten Menschen zur Geltung bringt.

Nach Lebens- und Denk-Foren, in denen sich das Evangelium natürlich erzeigt, ohne in subkulturell-seltsamen Gemeindekulturen geradezu zu verkommen, wo eine oft mobbinghafte Form interaktionaler Fehlhaltung die Szene und das Miteinander dominiert, ohne dass diese frommen Sub-Welten noch in irgendeiner Form als gesund oder gar „göttlich"" bezeichnet werden könnten.

Wir bräuchten ein exodushaftes Christsein, das wieder markante und ungespielte Impulse setzt. Das auf natürlich-herzliches Echtsein, auf klare Verkündigung und vorbehaltlosen Glauben sowie auf die Kraft der göttlichen Liebe (Agape) und der Auferstehungshoffnung setzt.

Martin Luther hat den Exodus-Modus echten Christseins einfach auf den Punkt gebracht:

„Wir sind immer auf dem Wege und müssen verlassen, was wir kennen und haben, und suchen, was wir noch nicht kennen und haben.""

Wobei wir dabei immer auf eine klare Form der Einkehr achten sollten, die uns guttut und unsere geistliche Gestaltungskraft aufrecht erhält:

„Merke auf den Sabbat deines Herzens, daß du ihn feierst, und wenn sie dich halten wollen, mache dich frei, oder gehe zugrunde.""

Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (1768 - 1834)

A 100-metre statue of Ram, worshipped as a god by many Hindus, might be installed on the banks of River Sarayu in Ayodhya, the 'birthplace' of the mythical king, by the government of Uttar Pradesh, as part of its proposal to give the city an image makeover.

Located in another part of the state, the Taj Mahal, Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan's tribute to his deceased wife Mumtaz Mahal, considered as one of the seven wonders of the world, has disappeared from the new brochures issued by the tourism department.

Luckily UP is prosperous enough that its ministers can keep dumping all over the state's biggest tourist draw https://t.co/bggkk90C0R — michael safi (@safimichael) October 10, 2017

The contrast between these two statements highlights the priorities of the ruling dispensation in the state. Of course, CM Adityanath, who, until recently, was the leader of a religious mutt in Gorakhpur, before his elevation to the seat of political power, is an unapologetic firebrand Hindutva leader. Shortly after he was appointed to office, a section of the media went on a spree to report examples of his religious generosity.

Adityanath, we were told, is exemplary for being an equal-opportunity employer, having given jobs to Muslims and lower-caste Hindus in a range of roles at his organisation, from being the handler of finances to the caretaker of the cows. His frugal lifestyle and faith in the best of Bharatiya sanskar exonerated his previous track record of being a rabble-rouser, who preyed on dividing communities along religious lines.

Sample some of his statements: ""If one Hindu girl is converted, we will convert 100 Muslim girls""; ""Mother Teresa was a part of a conspiracy to evangelise India""; or ""there is no difference in the language between Shah Rukh Khan and Hafiz Saeed"". This is the man who fought election after election, won several of them, and had his party give him the top job in the state one day.

So it seems like a corollary that the government under Adityanath's watch is planning to put up a massive statue of Ram in a historically communalised part of the state, while wiping out the existence of the most glorious example of Mughal architecture in India from a tourist pamphlet. Initially, facing intense criticism, officials said the booklet was not a brochure for all the tourist attractions in Uttar Pradesh — only a list of the government's ongoing and future projects in the tourism sector. Soon after, the officials dropped every pretence.

Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, a cabinet minister in Uttar Pradesh, said the Taj Mahal was ""rightly kept out"" of the tourism booklet because the Guru Gorakhnath peeth, presided over by Adityanath, was more deserving of being showcased as a religious symbol. His views were echoed in June this year by Adityanath. ""Foreign dignitaries visiting the country used to be gifted replicas of the Taj Mahal and other minarets which did not reflect Indian culture,"" he said.

The Taj Mahal, as Shoaib Daniyal recently wrote in Scroll.in, is so immensely valued the world over that it is one of the 115 images included in the Voyager spacecraft, launched into space in 1977. ""In case the ship was discovered by intelligent extraterrestrial life,"" he wrote, ""the scientists who launched Voyager wanted them to know that earthlings had built the Taj Mahal."" The fact of having a magnificent structure such as it in his state should inspire pride in Adityanath, not a crass competition exacerbated by a lingering sense of insecurity.

For it is insecurity that has pushed the Hindutva brigade into adopting risibly sinister strategies such as the whitewashing of the Taj Mahal and, in more extreme cases, the rewriting of history to assign the imagined victories on rulers of their choice. From Akbar losing the battle of Haldighati to the portrayal of Aurangzeb as a mindless tyrant, these revisions are meant to put the pride back in parochialism as well as establish a reign of untruths.

The nefarious agenda now extends to installing a statue of Lord Ram at a place which saw one of the worst communal riots in modern India, changing the political course of the country since then. The demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 — a section of the Hindus believe it was built by Muslim invaders over the original birthplace of Ram — and the resultant loss of life and damage to democracy should be warning enough for the state government to avoid any innovation that might destabilise harmony in the city of Ayodhya.

The only silver lining is that the Taj Mahal enjoys a pre-eminent place in the history of art and architecture across the world — and will continue to do so without a doubt

What's worse, for the integrated development of Ayodhya, the state government sent a detailed project report of ₹195.89 crore to the tourism ministry at the Centre, which has sanctioned ₹133.70 crore so far. Imagine the funds being diverted into improving the healthcare in the state instead, which was recently noted by global media for staggering number of deaths of children due to encephalitis — crossing 400 in one month alone.

The only silver lining is that the Taj Mahal enjoys a pre-eminent place in the history of art and architecture across the world — and will continue to do so without a doubt. A gigantic statue on the bank of a river may draw the attention of the public, but it's never going to obscure the appeal of one of the greatest creations of humanity for generations to come.

Mais que se passe-t-il quand vous devenez un participant indisposé d'une expérience de rencontre cruelle?

Cette semaine, Sophie Stevenson de Stoke-On-Trent en Angleterre a raconté qu'elle a été l'objet d'un tour élaboré de «pigging». En effet, elle a voyagé jusqu'en Hollande pour rencontrer son ancienne flamme de voyage, l'étudiant néerlandais Jesse Mateman, mais il ne s'est jamais présenté.

Même si Mateman réfute les accusations, Stevenson a dit à l'émission This Morning à ITV que la seule réponse qu'elle avait reçue pour le comportement de l'homme qu'elle devait rejoindre était un message texte qui disait «Tu as été «pigged»» avec deux émoticônes de cochons.

Ce comportement choquant n'est pas nouveau, et ce n'est pas une tendance récente. C'est plutôt une forme de comportement abusif qui a toujours été présent dans le milieu des rencontres occasionnelles.

Crying girl in bed texting on smartphone

Le «pigging» réfère à la pratique épouvantable (établie par de jeunes hommes) d'inviter quelqu'un à sortir en tant que blague ou pari. Le terme vient du fait que la femme en question est perçue comme peu attirante ou ronde (d'où la référence à l'animal de la ferme).

Si on parle de «pigging», ce n'est pas un phénomène officiellement reconnu — il n'y a pas de statistiques officielles de ce genre de comportement de rencontres.

Ceci dit, ce serait seulement une réincarnation d'une pratique de fréquentation qui a depuis longtemps assailli les femmes. Le terme a été défini sur l'Urban Dictionary depuis au moins 2004, ce qui souligne que ce n'est pas un phénomène récent.

Les médias ont parlé de cette présumée tendance, aussi appelée «fat girl rodeo», depuis 2013, mais en fait, cette pratique serait dans la culture populaire depuis des décennies.

Par exemple, on a vu Freddie Prinze Jr. faire une tactique similaire dans She's All That, une comédie romantique de 1999.

Les forums Reddit recèlent de cas où des gens demandent de l'aide pour savoir comment composer avec ce genre de comportement, même s'il n'est pas nécessairement appelé «pigging».

Sur Twitter, les gens n'étaient pas gênés de partager leurs expériences.

Für die meisten Menschen ist sie nur noch ein Sprichwort: die Krätze. Doch die Krankheit kommt auch in Deutschland immer wieder vor. Nun hat sich eine Familie in der Kölner Zeitung ""Express"" an die Öffentlichkeit gewandt. Denn: Ihre 10-Jährige Tochter hat sich – wahrscheinlich in der Schule – mit der Krätze angesteckt.

Krätze breitet sich in Deutschland aus. Kölnerin (10) hat Krankheit, die viele schon vergessen haben https://t.co/E37h4YVecw — Alina Schulz (@AlinaSchulz11) 12. Oktober 2017

Die Krankheit ist meist nicht gefährlich, dafür umso unangenehmer. Die Milbeninfektion sorgt für einen extremen Juckreiz, ein beißendes Gefühl auf der Haut. Die Schülerin klagt über Schlaflosigkeit.

""Es juckt fürchterlich im unteren Bereich des Rückens""

""Erst hat es meinen 16-jährigen Bruder erwischt, jetzt mich. Ich bin krankgeschrieben und es juckt fürchterlich an den Handgelenken und im unteren Bereich des Rückens“, zitiert der ""Express"" das Mädchen.

Bereits seit vergangenem Jahr beobachten Experten einen bundesweiten Anstieg der Krankheitsfälle. Seit Januar dieses Jahres seien der Behörde bereits 128 Fälle gemeldet worden. Im Vorjahr waren es 113 Fälle.

Milben übertragen die Hautkrankheit, legen ihre Eier unter die Haut des Menschen. Mehrere Wochen lang sorgen sie für teilweise heftige Juck-Attacken gegen die Ärzte vor allem Salben verschreiben. Übertragen wird die Krankheit für normal durch langen und intensiven Hautkontakt mit infizierten Menschen.

Appearing on the show alongside Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell and Matt Lucas, the ‘Breaking Bad’ actor explained that a travel agent recommended that Bryan and his wife, Robin Dearden, go through the Alps on a train as the couple’s trip was to be their honeymoon.

PA Wire/PA Images

He explained: “There’s a flatbed truck, it takes three cars bumper-to-bumper on a flatbed, and then you go through the Alps.

“‘By the way,’ he [the travel agent] says, wink wink, ‘There are three tunnels. The first tunnel, it is about five minutes, the second tunnel is about eight-to-ten minutes. The third tunnel is 50 minutes long, if you’re a honeymooner’.

“We’re on the train, there’s a van in front of us with a bunch of Italian families. Behind us… two Italian couples. We start going into the tunnels and it’s a massive experience, emotionally and physically.

“The wind is whipping through and it’s pitch dark. You cannot see anything. It’s fascinating. We come out of the tunnel and into the station, and I say to [my wife] Robin, that’s one.

“We go up, we start again. Pitch dark, can’t see. We come out of it, that’s two. She’s like, oh god! Start the third tunnel, wait until it’s absolutely pitch dark, here we go! It’s a small rental with the stick shift, and I’m like trying to get my trousers off.

PA Archive/PA Images Robin and Bryan in February 2016

“She’s trying to lower her chair. You cannot see anything, so it’s all by feel. One thing I learned is never be completely nude when transferring one seat over the stick shift.

“Keep your trousers on and do it afterwards… So we are inflagrante, as they say, I don’t know where to put my hands.

“Now what’s happening is that my eyes are adjusting. I can see her profile, she’s a beautiful woman. Love her with all my heart. I can see her, her pretty face, and it’s great. The eyes weren’t getting used to total pitch black. What happened is we were coming to a station! Boom! Sunlight!

“My wife says those three words to me that every husband wants to hear: ‘Get off me!’”

Bryan then pondered whether the travel agent had lied and played a joke on them - knowing the tunnel was really only 15 minutes long - and quite frankly, we’re surprised he didn’t ask him this question himself after returning to the US.

So far this series, the ‘Graham Norton Show’ has already played host to a number of unexpected moments and last month, we saw Margot Robbie tattoo a fan(!) when she stopped off for a chat.

Some scenes in 'The Narrow Road to the Deep South' are hard to read and impossible to forget. Based on real events, Richard Flanagan's award-winning novel tells of the experience of prisoners of war on the infamous Thai-Burma death railway, in raw and horrifying detail.

One of the passages that is particularly difficult to erase from my mind is when Flanagan wrote of live dissections (or 'vivisections') of prisoners, and the image of a still-beating heart placed on scales, making them tremble. This after the soldier has lain down before the barbaric surgeons who he believes will help him, as trusting as a child.

Then there were brutal bashings that lasted hours, skin flaking from faces, stinking ulcers that left bone gruesomely exposed, diarrhoea running down skeletal legs and a drowning too horrible to recount.

Similarly, while 'Regeneration' is a war book set away from the battlefield in a convalescent hospital, there were times when I was again moved and horrified by vivid descriptions of the wartime experience. In one particularly horrific scene, Pat Barker wrote of a soldier who fell, finding himself breathing the foul contents of a rotting stomach of another soldier. Afterwards, he could not keep food down, as it continued to remind him of the stench.

Both books made me wonder at what point the depiction of painful, terrible experiences becomes too graphic, or if that point even exists. Is there a higher reason for triggering the reader's emotions in such a way, or is recounting this kind of suffering merely war porn?

Of course, there is a level of privilege in even pondering the question, as the reader reclines with a novel in the comfort of their centrally heated homes, far from the trenches and artillery fire. On the front line, real people endured this very real pain and horror -- an experience that as a society we cannot forget.

And yet, last year there was a debate in the Australian media about whether school texts should include warnings. Like many, I scoffed. Books were meant to move readers, make them feel the despair, pain, longing and desolation of their characters. As Franz Kafka said:

""I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for?""

But, after reading 'The Narrow Road to the Deep South' -- while it was a wonderful, worthwhile and extremely moving novel by one of Australia's best writers -- I cannot escape the sense that some of the depictions of violence leaves too deep an imprint, such was their graphic nature.

This is not a question of whether we should read about the pain of others -- we have a duty to bear witness to the worst of human history to ensure that it doesn't happen again -- but of the degree of detail we need to read in descriptions of deaths, violence and horror.

It is a strange fact that humans are fascinated by the pain of others. We desire to know the worst, even though afterwards we sometimes wished we didn't.

It is not just books in which we can indulge in this curiosity. In many episodes, one of the most popular and highly rated series of our time, 'Game of Thrones', tends to finish with a shocking moment of violence. Was this the hook that kept viewers watching?

In other television shows, it tends to be the brutal murder at the beginning that draws the viewer in; a corpse splayed out on the road or in their living room.

More than once, I have heard someone who watched the movie 'Wolf Creek', based on serial killer Ivan Milat, say they wished they had never seen it, such was its frightening brutality. Yet, somehow, I am fascinated by and drawn to the movie. I have not seen it yet, and hope my curiosity doesn't win out.

Similarly, although at a very different level to war or murder, psychological pain or humiliation can attract our interest. What else could explain the popularity of 'The Bachelor' or 'The Bachelorette', in which contestants experience public rejection every week? Or the talent shows in which the less talented are ridiculed and insulted, accompanied by cheers, jeers and jaunty music?

According to psychiatry lecturer Dean Burnett, who writes for The Telegraph in the UK, a fascination with 'grisly details' is a symptom of the 'excitation-transfer theory'. He explains:

""Seeing or experiencing something so visceral, so brutal, is a powerful stimulation. It's not necessarily a good stimulation, but it is an effective one. This puts the person in a brief state of excitation, during which other stimulations can be more vivid or intense. A comparable example would be riding a roller-coaster; once you get off, you're in that giddy, excitable state that comes from an adrenalin rush, where you feel more ""alive""... It's possible that fascination with gore and brutal details is a darker, somewhat twisted variation on this.""

Alternatively, it might come down to curiosity about what can happen to the human body. Burnett said that this curiosity could serve an evolutionary purpose, providing an understanding of what can happen to the human body, and what dangers exist.

And so, what if this pain was removed from books? Would it make them less interesting or powerful? Perhaps it would. I fear that it would make them less memorable, as it is those deep feelings of unease, sadness or even horror that tend to stay with us.

It might be that this jolt of disgust or horror is what it takes to make us take notice, and ensure that such suffering does not happen again. Bored by accounts of wars that seem so familiar, but at the same time, so remote -- the detailed depictions of pain drag us out of our comfortable realities and into the darker places that the books' characters inhabit.

In a book titled 'The Civil Contract of Photography', Ariella Azoulay said that by observing images of horror, viewers ""can occasionally foresee or predict the future"", and warn others of ""dangers that lie ahead"".

In the same way, horrifying or distressing stories can impact on the way we behave and respond to suffering, preventing similar events in the future. This claim is compelling and in some way makes my unease seem petty. Perhaps there is no detail of real life suffering that should not be known.

Speaking at The Wheeler Centre last week, Richard Flanagan made clear his commitment to the truth.

""The novel is one of the great forms of truth we have,"" he said. ""No novels have answers, but they should frame the questions we have to ask ourselves.""

Perhaps the sheer brutality of war novels does exactly that -- taking us closer to the truth and framing the questions that we need to ask about how this came to be. They might include passages that I never want to read again, but they are also ones that I will not forget.

Tatsächlich sind Predictive Analytics nicht neu: Forecasting-Systeme im Vertrieb oder die Vorschläge, die Kunden in Webshops erhalten, arbeiten schon länger mit diesem Analysemodell. Doch erst in Verbindung mit Big Data und neuesten Technologien ist es zu einem wirklich einsetzbaren und aussagekräftigen Modell geworden. Wie eine Studie von EY und Forbes Insights zeigt, nutzen viele Unternehmen das enorme Potential noch nicht aus. Dabei ist nicht länger die Frage, ob Predictive Analytics wirklich Vorteile bringen - entscheidend ist, wie sie eingesetzt werden können, um Vorteile zu maximieren.

Im B2B-Bereich gibt es vor allem zwei Einsatzmöglichkeiten von Predictive Analytics:

Die Verbesserung der Unternehmensabläufe:

Heute schon wissen, was der Kunde nächste Woche brauchen wird? Die Abläufe in Unternehmen und auch im B2B-Marketing können enorm davon profitieren, zuverlässiges Wissen über zukünftige Bedürfnisse zu haben. Die Optimierung von Marketing-Kampagnen:

Vorher wissen, was funktioniert: Predictive Analytics können die Reaktion von Kunden und sogar Kaufentscheidungen vorhersagen. Auch den lohnenswerten Einsatz von Cross-Selling kann man so einschätzen. Wissen Sie, wer Ihre wichtigsten Kunden sind? Predictive Analytics helfen Ihnen dabei, Ihre Kunden in anzusprechen, zufriedenzustellen und zu binden.

Die Vorteile liegen auf der Hand - Predictive Analytics werden im B2B-Marketing und in allen Branchen viel verändern. Doch jedes Tool kann nur so gut sein, wie es eingesetzt wird. Was müssen Sie beachten, wenn Sie Big Data und Predictive Analytics in Ihren Arbeitsablauf einbinden wollen?

Mit anderen Worten: Wie gehen Sie am produktivsten an Predictive Analytics heran?

Klare Zielsetzung:

Machen Sie sich bewusst, was Sie anhand der Daten über die Zukunft wissen, verstehen und vorhersagen wollen. Auch Ihre Ressourcen müssen klar sein: Definieren Sie einen eindeutigen Return of Investment. Bereits am Anfang sollte außerdem überlegt werden, wie die Ergebnisse ein- und umgesetzt werden können: Welche Entscheidungen hängen davon ab? Aussagekräftige Daten sammeln:

Woher beziehen Sie Ihre Daten? Sammeln Sie selbst oder lassen Sie sammeln? Entscheidend ist, dass Sie klar definieren, welche Ziele Sie verfolgen. Verzichten Sie hier nicht auf Fachkräfte, nur aussagekräftige und gezielt analysierte Daten bringen Ergebnisse. Entwicklung von vorhersagenden Analysemodellen:

Daten zu sammeln reicht nicht - die wertvollen Ergebnisse erhalten Sie nur mit der richtigen Analyse. Hier ist Teamwork gefragt: Datenanalytiker, IT- und Marketing-Experten sollten zusammen einfache Software-Anwendungen zur Analyse und Bearbeitung der Daten entwickeln.

Predictive Analytics werden zunehmend eine wichtige Rolle im B2B-Marketing spielen. Bleiben Sie auf dem Stand der Technik!

Vergessen Sie bei allen Vorteilen jedoch eines nicht: Technische Möglichkeiten müssen umgesetzt werden, und Tools müssen zum Unternehmen passen.

The decision to announce polling dates for Himachal Pradesh, but not for Gujarat, has raised serious questions against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Former chief election commissioner SY Quraishi as well as the Opposition have alleged that this delay is to accommodate Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Gujarat next week. Once election dates are announced, the model code of conduct disallows the announcement of any new government projects or benefits.

""What were the compulsions of EC to announce the poll dates for Himachal and not Gujarat? They must have some good reasons to justify this,"" said Quraishi to journalists on Thursday. ""Mr. Modi's visit to Gujarat next week creates a ground of suspicion and it's unfortunate.""

The term for the present state governments in Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat ends in January 2018. While the election commission (EC) on Thursday announced the polling date for Himachal Pradesh--November 9--no date has been set for Gujarat yet, raising eyebrows.

Congress spokesperson Randeep S Surjewala alleged that the BJP government was putting pressure on the EC for the party's gain.

Cette rationalisation courante par les personnes lesbiennes et gay en France de leur ""discrétion"" auprès de leurs collègues est corrélée statistiquement à un contexte homophobe. Le Défenseur des Droits montre dans une étude récente que 51% des agents de la fonction publique et 46% des salariés du privé estiment que ""révéler son homosexualité à son entourage professionnel contribue à mettre mal à l'aise des collègues de travail"". Ce que les personnes LGBT perçoivent souvent comme un choix de leur part – celui de ne pas parler d'eux-mêmes - leur est en fait imposé par un environnement hostile.

Plusieurs études ont mis en évidence les difficultés et les discriminations persistantes auxquelles lesbiennes, bi, gay et trans (LGBT) continuent à être confrontées dans le monde du travail en France malgré les politiques anti-discrimination en place dans de plus en plus d'entreprises et un cadre légal favorable. En effet, si la France est passée de la 23e à la 5e place pour les droits LGBT en Europe, elle reste en retard dans le domaine de l'inclusion dans le monde du travail. Les personnes LGBT indiquent subir des discriminations indirectes, sous forme d'insultes ou de blagues. L'étude du défenseur des droits montre ainsi que 39% des personnes LGBT font part du fait de souffrir de commentaires ou d'attitudes négatives au travail. Les discriminations directes se manifestent quant à elles sous forme de mise en doute des compétences professionnelles ou de mise à l'écart de certains projets.

Mais au-delà même des discriminations, il existe un coût important à ne pas être soi-même au travail en termes de bien être mais aussi de succès professionnel. Dans une étude citée dans la Harvard Business Review, le concept d'authenticité s'est avéré avoir un effet positif sur la satisfaction au travail, la performance et l'engagement du travail. Il y a aussi un coût personnel à ne pas être authentique: il faut mettre en œuvre des efforts considérables pour dévier ou esquiver les questions personnelles.

Ce constat du retard de la France par rapport au monde du travail anglo-saxon soulève la question: existe-t-il des obstacles spécifiquement hexagonaux à une inclusion des personnes LGBT sur le lieu de travail ?

L'auteur Denis Provencher expliquait en 2008 que ""la citoyenneté française est liée à l'universalisme républicain, et le citoyen français homosexuel demande sa reconnaissance auprès de la famille et de l'état à travers la notion de ""francité"" et de sa similarité (banalité) non pas de sa différence"".

Le modèle anglo-saxon de promotion d'inclusion des personnes LGBT dans le monde du travail est souvent critiqué en France pour son particularisme et ce que certains perçoivent comme une tendance à promouvoir le communautarisme ghettoïsé.

Toutefois, la conséquence de ce rejet communautaire est que le monde du travail français reste très hétéronormé. On reste dans la négation des différences drastiques qui existent entre l'expérience des personnes LGBT au travail et celles des personnes hétérosexuelles. Les dirigeants LGBT restent invisibles, les groupes internes d'employés LGBT sont rares, et par exemple aucune entreprise ne participe directement aux marches des fiertés.

Le 16 octobre 2017 l'ONU, en partenariat avec l'Autre Cercle, la première association française d'inclusion LGBT dans le monde professionnel, lancera au siège du Conseil régional d'Île-de-France les cinq standards globaux pour le secteur privé afin de respecter et promouvoir les droits des personnes LGBTI. Le lancement sera suivi d'un débat avec des entreprises et des syndicats pour partager leurs démarches de responsabilité sociétale dans le domaine des droits des personnes LGBT.

Le troisième standard intitulé ""supporter les employés LGBT au travail"", requiert que les entreprises, en plus de leurs politiques antidiscriminatoires, prennent des mesures proactives pour assurer le bien-être et la dignité des personnes LGBT au travail. Les entreprises sont ainsi encouragées à soutenir les efforts des employés LGBTI pour créer leurs propres groupes de personnel, à promouvoir pro activement une culture d'inclusion et à s'assurer que les équipes dirigeantes se fassent le porte-parole de l'engagement de l'entreprise en faveur des droits des personnes LGBTI.

Depuis le premier lancement au siège des Nations Unies à New York le 26 septembre 2017, de nombreuses entreprises dans le monde ont exprimé leur appui à ces standards dont trois grandes entreprises françaises: BNP Paribas, EDF et Orange. L'Autre Cercle et l'ONU espèrent que d'autres entreprises exprimeront leur appui à ces principes directeurs afin que chacun-e sur le lieu de travail puisse se sentir apprécié-e et soutenu-e.

The former first lady appeared to take a swipe at the Trump administration, accusing political leaders of “stoking divisions” and saying that “anger and resentment” were underpinning the national conversation.

“The bonds of community that once united us are fraying. Too much of the current discourse on both sides of the Atlantic is dominated by a zero-sum view of life, which argues that if someone else is gaining, I must be losing,” she said.

“The measure of any society is how we treat the most vulnerable among us, especially our children. And when we lose empathy, when it does become everyone for themselves, children are the first to suffer.

“Just look at my own country where currents of anger and resentment are underpinning our national conversation.

“Americans are divided and less trusting of democratic institutions. But instead of bringing people together we have leaders who stoke our divisions, try to distract us with controversy, after controversy, and undermine free speech and the press.

And it is not coincidence that when politicians in Washington were arguing over protests at sporting events and cavalierly alluding to nuclear war, one of the first things to fall through the cracks was children’s healthcare.”

Clinton’s great-grandparents were from south Wales and emigrated to the US in search of a better life. Her ethnic breakdown has been calculated by genealogists as 31.2% Welsh in origin.

POLITIQUE - Un appel ""à la responsabilité collective."" Le 5 septembre 2017, Emmanuel Macron demandait à ""tous les propriétaires de baisser les loyers de 5 euros"" par mois. Le but? Compenser la baisse des APL décidée quelques semaines plus tôt par le gouvernement. Une mesure ""de rabot"" qui avait suscité l'indignation de nombreux responsables politiques et l'inquiétude d'une partie de l'opinion.

Alors que le gouvernement envisage de nouvelles coupes, plusieurs syndicats et collectifs appelaient au rassemblement samedi 14 octobre pour défendre les allocations logement. Priés de compenser cette première baisse à travers un petit effort financier, les propriétaires immobiliers ne semblent pas totalement concernés par l'appel d'Emmanuel Macron... voire pas du tout.

""Les propriétaires ont rigolé, et ils sont passés à autre chose""

Et si, à en croire Gérald Darmanin ""beaucoup de propriétaires ont décidé de baisser de cinq euros le montant du loyer"", la réalité semble quelque peu différente.

Pour le directeur du réseau ERA Immobilier Éric Allouche, l'appel d'Emmanuel Macron n'a ""rien provoqué."" ""Le gouvernement ne fait pas entrer cette mesure dans la loi, les propriétaires n'ont donc aucune obligation de le faire"", explique-t-il au HuffPost en affirmant qu'à sa connaissance, aucun client de son réseau n'avait demandé à baisser son loyer.

""Je ne comprends même pas cette méthode"", explique-t-il en pointant ""un coup de communication"" ressemblant à une ""brève de comptoir"". ""Les propriétaires ont rigolé et ils sont passés à autre chose"", argue-t-il. Pour lui, la seule conséquence de cet appel est l'instauration d'une ""ambiance tendue entre locataires et propriétaires"".

""Ils n'ont aucune raison de le faire""

Même son de cloche du côté de l'Union Nationale des Propriétaires Immobiliers. Le président de la chambre de Bordeaux indique au HuffPost qu'aucun propriétaire de son giron n'a répondu à cet appel en baissant son loyer de cinq euros. ""Ça m'aurait fait rire"", ajoute-t-il avant de préciser que ""les propriétaires n'ont aucune raison de faire cela. Ils sont engagés dans une logique d'investissement, il est donc impossible pour eux de baisser les loyers.""

Laurent Vimont, le président de la filiale française du groupe immobilier Century 21, confie au HuffPost ne pas avoir eu vent d'un quelconque changement d'habitude. Il estime en tout cas qu'il ""n'y a pas de phénomène de masse"" en faveur de la demande d'Emmanuel Macron.

Wyatt Lafrenière, from Canada, was with his mum Fauve Lafrenière, when he was pictured laying on a floor having his hair cut in a barber shop.

The touching story behind the snap was shared on the Love What Matters Facebook page on 10 October by the barber himself, Franz Jakob. He said Wyatt showed up at his shop in the first week he opened.

“He was my first child who had special needs and I figured out how to work with him by getting down to his level,” Jakob wrote on 10 October.

“These moments are very special for me. I’m taking great pride barbering here and my community is amazingly supportive towards my shop.”

Since the photo was taken, Jakob has continued to adapt his haircut experiences for children to suit their needs. He said many parents know to come to the shop near the end of the day, when it is quiet.

He said he usually starts by having sweets with the child and walks around the shop to look at everything on the walls.

“I’m never typically driving the haircut, I simply follow the lead of the child,” he explained. “It takes me more than an hour to finish with a special needs child. It is worth every minute.”

Wyatt’s mother, Fauve Lafrenière, said Jakob takes care of everything and she never has to get involved. They have continued to attend the same barbershop since the first haircut.

“It takes a load off my shoulders,” she told CBC Canada. “Usually hairdressers sort of panicked when they saw Wyatt arrive, so it was really exceptional to meet Mr Jakob.

“He welcomes him like his best friend. To see that he accepts these differences is just fantastic.”

In September 2015 there was a similar situation, where a barber travelled eight hours to cut the hair of a boy who had autism, because he wouldn’t let anyone else cut it.

Michael Flores, from the US, was consistently running away from the hairdressers until he found Freddy Tineo, who befriended the boy and cut his hair with no problem.

However the family, who were originally from New Jersey then moved to Virginia, which left Michael with no hairdresser.

Speaking to HuffPost UK, Michael’s mum Joan Flores, said: “Freddy has just made the trip here. It was his idea.

“He stayed for the day at our new house. We had a barbecue with family and friends. He traveled from New Jersey to Virginia. It is about an eight-hour drive. No words can properly express my gratitude.”

Will a ""down-payment"" be announced in terms of new spending for solutions addressing specifically targeted populations, such as those described in Poverty Trends 2017?","What does poverty look like in Canada in 2017?

Ask yourself what images immediately come to mind when you consider who is poor in Canada today. Perhaps for many of us, the urban poor, sleeping homeless on the streets of major cities, come immediately to mind. But if you take a few minutes to read the Poverty Trends 2017 report, you may find a few surprises.

One wonders if Canadians realize that most people living in poverty in Canada are working poor (70%). This year's Poverty Trends report notes that precarious employment, or employment that is insecure and lacking in benefits or other protections, leaves many working age people at risk of poverty, including those who work full-time at minimum wage.

And which group seems to be most poorly-served by the design of current government supports? Single, working-age adults, of whom 42.9 per cent live in poverty (a figure that has risen from 39.1 per cent in 2009.)

While Canadians rightfully prided themselves on the decision to accept 40,000 Syrian refugees in 2015-2016, we cannot be proud of a job half-done. Why is it acceptable that 34.2 per cent of new immigrants and refugees live in poverty here?

Poverty Trends 2017 features other statistics that should make most Canadians grimace: child poverty is still at 17.4 per cent, even after the 1989 unanimous resolution in Parliament to end child poverty by the year 2000. 43.4 per cent of kids living in single-parent families are poor; 23 per cent of persons aged 25 to 64 with disabilities live in poverty; 25.3 per cent of Indigenous people live in poverty, as do 13.9 per cent of the entire Canadian population, a total of 4.8 million people — or one in seven people in this country.

Would you have guessed that Canada's city with the highest poverty rate is now its largest city, or that some medium-sized cities have poverty rates almost double the levels of Toronto and Vancouver?

Describing poverty by the numbers is, of course, important. But working to end poverty is another matter altogether.

After the 2015 election, the newly elected Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, mandated Jean-Yves Duclos, his Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, to develop the first-ever federal strategy to reduce poverty. Two years later, we're still waiting to see what the Liberals mean to do.

M. Duclos, a Laval University economist, has researched these issues in his professional career. As Minister, he opened a public consultation process on poverty (from February to August of this year), appointed a group of advisors on poverty issues, and held meetings with interested stakeholders — yet the public is still awaiting a sense of how, and when, the government is prepared to act.

Will the eventual strategy include timelines and targets in order to measure progress? Will an independent body be appointed to measure and report on the various successes and or failures of the strategy? Will an institution like the National Council of Welfare (which ran from 1969 to 2012, when it was closed by the Harper government) be re-established with renewed mandates and competencies for research, reporting and public engagement?

October 17 is the UN's International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. In over 80 places across Canada, groups will be organizing around Chew On This! Activists are asking for concrete action to eliminate poverty in our wealthy and prosperous land.

In early 2018, Canadians will get a sense of how seriously the government plans to proceed, with the release of the Federal Budget. Will the promised federal poverty reduction plan be highlighted? Will a ""down-payment"" be announced in terms of new spending for solutions addressing specifically targeted populations, such as those described in Poverty Trends 2017? Or will the need for action be punted down the road to the next election year, 2019, and thus unnecessarily politicized? And will our neighbours, those now struggling to overcome poverty, be kept waiting even longer?

Remember LK Advani's famous assertion about the media on their passive obedience to the Indira Gandhi regime during emergency? ""You (journalists) were asked to bend, but you began to crawl!""

I was not born then, but I hear from my seniors in the profession that most mainstream journalists embarrassed their fraternity by displaying their unflinching loyalty to Indira Gandhi for fear of being arraigned by her. In 2017 there is no emergency — at least there has been no declaration to the effect — but many from my profession have chosen to prostrate before the powers before being asked to bend.

This Sunday, the independent news website The Wire published an investigative report by journalist Rohini Singh on the changing fortune of Jay Amit Shah, the son of BJP President Amit Shah. The report created ripples on social media within minutes of being published. Singh made damning allegations against the son of the president of a party that came to power in 2014 claiming to be the panacea to a ten-year-old corrupt Congress regime.

Before I proceed I must add that there have been similar allegations of corruption against Amit Shah made by officials in the Gujarat dispensation that had been reported by various publications. In fact in 2010 among many other publications, The Hindu carried a report titled 'Gujarat government buried CID report on Amit Shah'.

The BJP claimed these reports were politically motivated just like his arrest in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case in Gujarat in 2010. Shah was the first serving home minister of a state in India to face this ignominy. All was forgotten in 2014 as Modi rose to prominence as the man who wanted to rid the country of the malaise of corruption.

Indian politician and former Gujarat minister Amit Shah (L) and his son Jay celebrate on his arrival at his residence after his release from Sabarmati Central Jail in Ahmedabad late on October 29, 2010.

'Na Khaaonga, na khaane doonga', he roared in his speeches and the Indian voter accepted with great relief his war against graft. The ten-year-old Congress regime with its corruption-tainted ministers had exhausted the average Indian. It needed a change. The PM continued with his barbs against ex-PM Manmohan Singh stating that ""Manmohan Singh knew the art of bathing with a raincoat on"" — a reference to Singh's alleged silence over the corruption of his ministers.

But for a party which considered transparency on corruption and financial impropriety as sacrosanct, similar allegations made by The Wire on Sunday based on paperwork stung the BJP rank and file to such an extent that it got one of its most media-friendly political heavyweight Piyush Goyal to address a press conference not just to defend a non-political entity but also to proudly proclaim that Jay Amit Shah would slap a 100 crore defamation suit against the organization and its reporter.

The BJP, of all parties, should know this best as it has followed a similar protocol in the past not just with allegations against Robert Vadra.

This press conference was preceded by a similar one addressed by Congress leader Kapil Sibal seeking accountability from the BJP over the allegations. This was normal political outcome of an investigation.

The BJP, of all parties, should know this best as it has followed a similar protocol in the past not just with allegations against Robert Vadra, but post various other media investigations including the Coal scam and the 2G scam which led to the downfall of the UPA. But if you are a consumer of mainstream Indian television news, you were made to believe this Sunday that only one such presser took place, that in which the BJP lashed out at a leftist website for defaming its leader.

Blackout

There was an eerie silence on news channels, some focused on karva chauth, others on Muslim appeasement, the rest on pressing issues such as the Hrithik Roshan-Kangana Ranaut spat. With a few exceptions — yes those very exceptions which rescue the media each time — others made you believe that the last time you witnessed a big investigative story was the appearance of Honeypreet Insaan on their television channels.

Jay Amit Shah should not have bothered writing those words of caution because the present day media understands even the unsaid.

Some of the media houses, conspicuous in their silence, were last seen talking of the need to protect free speech post the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh.

In the concluding statement of his claim of defamation, Jay Amit Shah said, ""If anyone else republishes/re-broadcasts the imputations made in the said article, whether directly or indirectly, such person or entity will also be guilty of the very same criminal and/or civil liability.""

In an ideal world this intimidation should have led to an outrage in the media.

In an ideal world this intimidation should have led to an outrage in the media. An investigative report like any other report should have been the subject of discussion, criticism, arguments, debate — these being the fundamentals of journalism. Silence by intimidation being the last on the charter of a journalistic organization. But Jay Amit Shah should not have bothered writing those words of caution because the present day media understands even the unsaid. The media did not need a threat, it had already obliged, it had long memorized those unsaid rules of being in circulation in the present day dispensation.

Yes, there were a few journalists who stuck their neck out, for on them rests the onus of protecting free speech each time it is under threat. Those handful of journalists with a public voice defend the ethics of the profession and risk losing their job each day. These journalists have become the shoulders that bear the pretense of free speech in India while their colleagues read from the nationalist scripts dictated by the government.

And no, these journalists are doing no favour to us. This is basic, ethical journalism where a reporter needs to worry about the facts in her story and not the consequences of it, not the smear campaign, nor the character assassination.

I remember a senior editor telling me last year at my book event that I can afford to be critical of the government and publish a book because I speak from a position of privilege.

Since when did journalism become a profession to fulfill our financial and social obligations. I have more respect for my journalist friends who have crossed over to corporate communications and public relations to feed their needs and ambition.

At least they do not shape the opinion of a generation that looks up to them.

Do not hold The Wire and its reportage as the ultimate truth and the last word on the story. Question it, criticize it, debate it, hold its journalists accountable, laud them for their work if you so believe.

Symptoms of secondary breast cancer

If you’ve had primary breast cancer, it’s important to be vigilant of any symptoms that are either new, don’t have an obvious cause or don’t go away.

This is because they could signal that the cancer has returned and spread.

It’s difficult to list all of the signs of secondary breast cancer as there are many. However some of the more common symptoms include:

:: Pain in your bones (for example in the back, hips or ribs) that doesn’t improve with pain relief or lasts for more than one to two weeks

:: Unexplained weight loss and a loss of appetite

:: Constant nausea

:: Discomfort or swelling under the ribs or across the upper abdomen

:: Feeling constantly tired

:: A dry cough or a feeling of breathlessness

:: Severe or ongoing headaches

:: Altered vision or speech.

Green adds: “The symptoms of secondary breast cancer will depend on where in the body the cancer has spread to. For example, symptoms might include pain if the cancer has spread to the bones, or a cough or breathlessness if it has spread to the lungs.”

Treatment

When breast cancer spreads to the bone, it can make it difficult to treat, according to Dr Alan Worsley, Cancer Research UK’s science communications officer.

That said, there are treatment options available that can help slow the progress of the cancer and lower the chances of it spreading further.

“Specialist teams will help to work out the best treatment options for each patient depending on the characteristics of their breast cancer, where/how far it has spread, the treatment they’ve already had and their general health,” Breast Cancer Now’s Sally Greenbrook tells HuffPost UK.

“Treatments they might be offered include hormone therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and surgery.”

Here is a brief breakdown of each treatment option:

Hormone Therapy

Oestrogen and progesterone can make some breast cancers grow faster. In cases like this, hormone therapy tablets such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) may help slow the cancer’s growth or spread.

They work by blocking the production or action of these hormones on breast cancer cells.

In other cases, the ovaries can be treated to prevent them from producing hormones if you have not been through the menopause. This treatment type is called ovarian ablation.

Radiotherapy

This form of treatment can help slow the growth of secondary breast cancers and relieve symptoms.

Radiotherapy courses for secondary breast cancer are usually shorter than for primary breast cancer and some women experience milder side effects.

They are usually given at an outpatient clinic and require regular visits to hospital for a week or more, although they can sometimes be given as a single treatment.

Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy with one or more anti-cancer drugs may be used to treat secondary breast cancer, especially if hormone therapy is not working well or where tumours are in internal organs (such as the lung or liver).

Like radiotherapy, the treatment’s aim is to slow the growth of secondary tumours and to prevent them from spreading further.

Targeted Therapy

This form of therapy refers to drugs which attack breast cancer cells directly, helping to slow the growth and spread. Some targeted therapies can help relieve symptoms too.

One targeted therapy available on the NHS is called Herceptin. It works by attacking cancer cells that produce high levels of a protein called HER2 (known as HER2 positive breast cancers).

Surgery

This treatment type is not often used to treat secondary breast cancers. That said, it is sometimes possible for small tumours in operable areas to be removed.

Greenbrook concludes: “The aim of treatment is to minimise spread and give patients the best possible quality of life.

“Thanks to new treatments, some women can live relatively normal lives – including returning to work, spending time with their families and keeping active – and for some you wouldn’t necessarily be able to tell they are living with incurable cancer.”

The lack of awareness of this growing problem is a big issue. shutterstock.com

Breast cancer is a growing epidemic in India. It could kill 76,000 women a year by 2020, according to a recent study. It claimed more than 70,000 lives in 2012. At the heart of the issue is the country's rapid economic development, which has made Indian women more susceptible to the disease, without building the infrastructure to prevent and detect it. But the good news is that boosting breast cancer awareness and encouraging early detection could play a significant role in reducing it.

India's rapid economic expansion has it forecast to become the world's fourth largest economy by 2020 and set to surpass China as the world's fastest growing economy. This feat of development has lifted millions out of poverty. But economic growth has brought with it other challenges – including breast cancer.

Growing risk

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and represents 25% of all cancers in women. In fact, there appears to be a link between breast cancer and development. Developed economies in the West such as in North America and Oceania rank at the top of the rates of incidence.

So, India's development brings with it new health risks for women. In Western countries, breast cancer incidence increases with age, whereas in India, the rate of incidence seems to affect the urban working women demographic the most (China is experiencing a similar trend). The blame for this catastrophe seems to lie with India's economic development and rapid urbanisation.

Modern day India's booming economy has led to rapidly expanding numbers of women in education who go on to pursue careers. This has led to the Westernisation of Indian women in a way that increases their risk of developing breast cancer: urban Indian women who work start having sex later, have fewer children and breastfeed them less than their rural counterparts – all factors which increase the risk of developing the cancer, over a lifetime. These women also tend to have a more Western diet, which leads to obesity, another factor that increases the risk of breast cancer.

To make things worse, a recent study showed that these women seek medical care extremely late – despite the fact that they are better educated and, to a certain extent, have greater economic independence. The reasons for this appear to be poor awareness of the early indicators of breast cancer and a lack of knowledge about how to self-examine. They also have limited access to helpful information. Altogether this results in a delay in seeking care and diagnosis.

My research with colleagues Vijay Pereira and Munyaradzi Nyadzayo also suggests that cultural issues may be a factor in why women do not access health services. Some are reluctant to consult male doctors. Many women are also dependent on other family members to get the required medical help because breast care is still a culturally taboo subject and rarely discussed. This often results in delays in seeking help.

The way forward

There are both economic and moral reasons to address this issue. Urban, working women – the group that is most at risk of breast cancer – play a significant and growing role in India's burgeoning economy. Many are employed in new technology and telecomms industries that have sprung up as a result of foreign direct investment from Western firms.

India also has a larger economic value at stake from advancing gender equality than other emerging economies. A report by financial services firm McKinsey found that employing more women in the workforce would add US$2.9 trillion to the country's annual GDP by 2025. So if a healthy female Indian workforce is a strategic advantage in sustaining its thriving economy, the Indian government has another reason to take ownership of women's healthcare.

Legally the Indian Constitution guarantees everyone's ""right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health"". Further, an Indian citizen's right to health, is integral to the right to life, which is also enshrined in the constitution. So the government has a legal obligation to provide health facilities.

By changing the current health policy to include early planning of breast cancer awareness campaigns the Indian government could initiate an important strategy to reach women at risk. Our research into the issue shows the government should invest in community nurses because they are more effective than national advertising campaigns. Through their local community knowledge they gain the trust of husbands and fathers in overcoming cultural barriers to promote self-examination and encourage the women in their families to seek early diagnosis.

Given interest rates are already at a historical low, it seems hard to imagine that the 2017 first-home buyer could benefit like the 1989 first-home buyer from interest rate cuts.","A man's home is his castle, if he can bloody afford it.

I was at a presentation on Saturday where the issue of housing affordability came up. It started me thinking about how does buying your first home in Sydney today, compare to when my wife and I bought our first home in the western suburbs of Sydney nearly 30 years ago in 1989.

So I went through some of my old paperwork and did some research and this is what I found.

If you directly compare the circumstances around Sydney house prices and interest rates that existed in 1989 with those that exist in 2017, you could come to the conclusion that homes in Sydney today are more affordable for first-home buyers than when my wife and I purchased our first home in 1989.

But what this does not take into consideration is what happened with interest rates in the period subsequent to 1989. When you take these substantial reductions in interest rates into effect, it becomes clear that purchasing a first home in Sydney today is less affordable than it was in 1989 -- a period you could previously argue was one of the least affordable times to buy a home in Sydney.

What was happening in the Sydney property market in 1989?

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, between June 2012 and June 2017, house prices in Sydney increased by 74 percent.

Data compiled by Successful Ways shows that between:

June 2012 and June 2016, median house prices in Sydney grew by 75 percent; and,

June 1985 and June 1989, median house prices in Sydney grew by 127 percent.

Research published by Peter Abelson and Demi Chung, 'Housing Prices in Australia 1970 to 2003', shows that between June 1985 and June 1989, median house prices in Sydney grew by 93 percent.

It would be fair to say that the experience of first-home buyers in 1989 and 2017 are similar. They have both experienced significant increases in house prices in the years immediately prior to them wanting to buy their first home.

So, the circumstances that first-home buyers are facing in 2017 are not substantially different from what a first-home buyer (like myself and my wife) faced in 1989.

The other factor impacting on property was interest rates. In June 1985, interest rates for home loans were around 12 percent. By August 1989, they had climbed to 17 percent.

Contrast this with now where the RBA cash rate is 1.5 percent, as compared to June 2012 when it was 3.5 percent.

So the first-home buyer in 1989 had the double hit of significant house prices and interest rate increases. The first-home buyer of today has the hit of significant house price increases partially offset by the savings in interest costs.

Our first home purchase, and what it would cost today.

Back in 1989 we purchased our first home, a two-bedroom weatherboard home in the western suburbs of Sydney for $150,000. At 80 percent borrowing the loan was $120,000.

Roll forward to today -- I can't directly compare our old house, as after we sold it, it was knocked down and a child care centre built instead. But looking at similar two-bedroom homes in the area, it looks like they are selling today for around $700,000. At 80 percent borrowing the loan would be $560,000.

This is a 367 percent increase in the value of the house and required loan.

If we look at our incomes, from our 1990 tax returns (which I still have), our combined income before tax was $77,095. I was an audit manager and my wife was a bank teller. Our after tax income was $52,515.

Today, based on what I can see online, the 2017 annual incomes would be around $150,000 for these two same roles. This is an increase of only 95 percent. My estimate of an after tax income would be $114,536.

Incomes after tax have gone up more than incomes before tax because there are lower income tax rates in 2017/2018 than there were in 1899/1990.

Our first home loan.

Now, in 1989 we were paying 17 percent interest compared to today where you can get a home loan for under four percent.

So with a 17 percent interest rate on a $120,000 loan, we were paying $20,400 dollars per year in interest and our loan repayment over 25 years was $20,704.

With a four percent interest rate on a $560,000 loan, first-home buyers today would be paying $22,400 per year in interest. The loan repayment over 25 years would be $35,471, obviously higher as they have more principal to repay.

So, if we compare the circumstances that existed in 1989 with those that exist in 2017, we would see that on a like for like basis -- after tax incomes are up 118 percent, with loan repayments up 71 percent.

In 1989, our loan repayments were more than 39 percent of our after tax income whereas in 2017 the amount would be 31 percent.

The above table only looks at what would happen in the first year.

If we stay with the same interest rates and grow annual incomes from 1989 to today, in line with the change in average weekly earnings and beyond at 2.5 percent per annum, here is how much of post-tax income you would need to repay the 1989 loan and the 2017 loan over the term of the loan.

As you can see, the 1989 loan (at 17 percent interest rate) would require more of the post-tax income than the 2017 loan would.

Hence why, if we compare directly the circumstances that existed in 1989 with those that exist today, you could say that Sydney houses are more affordable for first-home buyers today.

But what has happened since 1989?

As we all know, interest rates have decreased substantially from 1989 and you can get a loan today at four percent or less.

So, like my wife and I, anyone who purchased their first home in Sydney in 1989, and initially suffered a substantial financial drain to make loan repayments back then, has benefited from the interest rate drops thereafter.

If we factor in some of these interest rate drops, you will see what really happened.

The 1989 first-home buyer was spending more of their post-tax income than the 2017 first-home buyer for a couple of years. But as the interest rate reductions took effect, then very quickly, the 1989 first-home buyer ends up paying less of their post-tax income than the 2017 first-home buyer.

So you would have to say that buying your first home in Sydney today is more unaffordable than in 1989 when we paid 17 percent interest rates and were heading for the recession we had to have.

Could the 2017 first-home buyer benefit like the 1989 first-home buyer?

Given interest rates are already at a historical low, it seems hard to imagine that the 2017 first-home buyer could benefit like the 1989 first-home buyer from interest rate cuts.

Even if we assume rates do drop and these first-home owners can get their loan down to two percent, as the chart below shows, they are still spending more of their post-tax income than the 1989 borrower did on their lower interest rates.

And the likelihood is that interest rates will go up and not down over the next 25 years, so the real result will probably be worse, as the following chart demonstrates.

If you directly compare the circumstances around Sydney house prices and interest rates that existed in 1989 with those that exist in 2017, you could come to the conclusion that homes in Sydney today are more affordable for first-home buyers than when my wife and I purchased our first home in 1989.

But, what this does not take into consideration is what happened with interest rates in the period subsequent to 1989.

Diana le dijo a El Universal que había llevado la denuncia a redes sociales y hacerla viral porque ""han pasado muchas cosas ultimamente con temas relacionados y las autoridades a veces no reaccionan a tiempo"".

He has also seen Theresa May’s Government adapt proposals Labour advocated under his leadership, such as the pledge to cap energy prices, which one senior Tory called “re-heated Milibandism” in reference to Miliband’s 2013 pledge to freeze them.

When the BBC’s Nick Robinson told Miliband he was a “minister in waiting”, the ex-leader said: “I don’t rule it out.”

With gentle encouragement from Robinson, he jokingly acknowledged Schwarzenegger’s famous line from The Terminator: “I’ll be back.”

“After the election... it was never really a serious thought in my mind ‘I’m going to give it all up, go and be a goat herder’,” Miliband said on Robinson’s podcast Political Thinking.

“No offence to any goat herders who are listening... I said when I resigned: I’m somebody believes you can play a role as a leader or not as a leader. I totally believe that.”

Miliband last year called on his successor Jeremy Corbyn to resign when it appeared the left-winger was leading the party to electoral oblivion.

Sebastian Kurz wurde von Politikberatern ein charismatisches Image gebaut. Er soll die alte Systempartei ÖVP ersetzen. Mit der Liste Kurz.

Liste Sebastian Kurz wird am Amtlichen Stimmzettel für die Nationalratswahl am 15. Oktober in der Republik Österreich stehen. Die Liste Sebastian Kurz steht an zweiter Stelle des Stimmzettels und soll die traditionelle ÖVP ersetzen, die bei den letzten Wahlen den zweiten Platz einnahm.

Die „Liste Sebastian Kurz"" ist die Parteibezeichnung am Stimmzettel. Sie definiert sich als die „neue ÖVP"". Damit ist das Ende der bisher bürgerlichen ÖVP im Prinzip schon eingetreten.

Offenbar denkt man in der ehemals bürgerlichen ÖVP, dass die alte Systempartei nicht mehr reüssieren kann. Es soll auf eine Zeitenwende reagiert werden, die nach neuen Parteien in Europa verlangt. „Liste Sebastian Kurz"" wird damit zum österreichischen Modell der „Alternative für Deutschland"" (AfD). Auch in den inhaltlichen Schwerpunkten sind Parallelen erkennbar.

Kritisierte Bundeskanzlerin Merkel

Da Sebastian Kurz sich mit dieser Ausrichtung von der alten Systempartei ÖVP schon trennte, kannte er auch keine Hemmungen die deutsche CDU-Bundeskanzlerin Merkel in die Kritik zu nehmen. Auch die CDU ist für Sebastian Kurz und seine Berater letztlich nicht mehr als eine Systempartei, die abgelöst werden sollte.

Die Kritik an Angela Merkel war inhaltlich aber nicht gerechtfertigt. Es ging um den Umgang mit Vertriebenen aus Kriegsregionen, insbesondere aus Syrien. Die Flüchtlingspolitik der deutschen Bundesregierung war dabei aber vorbildlich. Kurz wollte mit der Kritik sich bewusst profilieren, auf Kosten der deutschen Bundeskanzlerin.

Sensibles Thema

Die Flüchtlinge aus Syrien sind eigentlich Assyrer, die der christlichen Kultur angehören. Sie stammen aus den Ländern des alten Mesopotamiens und leben in der Diaspora in mehreren Ländern Europas und der USA, insbesondere seit 1915 ein Völkermord an den Assyrern begangen wurde. Der Umgang mit assyrischen Flüchtlingen erfordert deshalb besondere Sensibilität.

Rund 5.000 Mitglieder der syrisch-orthodoxen Kirche in Österreich lebten schon vor 20 Jahren in Wien. Sie lebten in Österreich unauffällig. Es gab nie die geringsten Probleme mit Assyrern in Österreich. Sie sind anerkannte Mitglieder der Bevölkerung in Wien.

Der Bischof der syrisch-orthodoxen Kirche ist in der Erzdiözese Wien integriert. Für seine Leistungen erhielt er in einer festlichen Zeremonie im Jahr 2004 den Titel „Professor"" verliehen. Vom damaligen Nationalratspräsidenten Andreas Khol (ÖVP), der eine Festrede hielt.

Weshalb jetzt assyrische Einwanderer ein Problem in Österreich darstellen sollen, das ist völlig unklar.

Syrien ist über die Mittelmeerregion, insbesondere über Zypern, aber auch über Griechenland bereits ein Nachbarland der Europäischen Union. Damit liegt Syrien in einer Region, die im Fokus der EU liegt. Ein Assoziationsabkommen mit Syrien wurde deshalb bereits 2009 vorbereitet. Die Bedingungen der Bevölkerung und die politische Situation in Syrien müssen deshalb von der EU ernst genommen und entsprechend reagiert werden.

Österreich verliert Reputation

Österreich und seine Bevölkerung wurden noch vor wenigen Jahren mit Attributen für Gastfreundschaft und Hilfsbereitschaft identifiziert. Auf Basis von Leistungen aus Krisenzeiten, die belegt sind.

1956 kamen rund 200.000 Ungarn nach Österreich, die in Folge des Volksaufstandes in Bedrängnis gerieten. Allen Menschen, die aus Ungarn flohen, wurde durch Ministerratsbeschluss Asyl gewährt. 1968 kamen nach dem Ende des Prager Frühlings in der CSSR rund 160.000 Tschechen und Slowaken nach Österreich. 1981 kamen nach der Verhängung des Kriegsrechts in Polen rund 150.000 Polen nach Österreich. Aufgrund des Balkankriegs Anfang der neunziger Jahre setzte Österreich die Initiative „Nachbarn helfen Nachbarn"". Es kamen rund 100.000 Flüchtlinge aus Bosnien-Herzegowina nach Österreich.

In all diesen Fällen bewährte sich Österreich und seine Bevölkerung und gewann dadurch international berechtigterweise an Reputation. Es ist keinesfalls im Interesse Österreichs, dass dieser gute Ruf jetzt durch die Politik des Außenministers Sebastian Kurz zertrümmert werden soll.

Plakative Reden

Forderungen von Sebastian Kurz sind meist oberflächlich und dreist. Dies gilt beispielsweise auch für seine Forderung:



„Mehr Deutsch in Moscheen. Davon bin ich heute noch überzeugt. Wo Deutsch gesprochen wird, wird Deutsch schneller erlernt, das hilft bei der Integration"".

Es gibt ausreichend Möglichkeiten, dass in Österreich die deutsche Sprache qualifiziert gelernt werden kann. Keinesfalls ist es erforderlich, dass die eigene Sprache und eigene Kultur von Immigranten ganz aufgegeben wird. Die Kulturzentren und dazu zählen auch die religiösen Orte der Moscheen sollen ihre Sprache erhalten und ihre Traditionen pflegen.

Sebastian Kurz war Staatssekretar für Integration vor seiner Bestellung zum Außenminister. In dieser Funktion muss er dafür sorgen, dass weitere Möglichkeiten für das Kommunizieren in deutscher Sprache geschaffen werden. Insbesondere durch interkulturelle Zentren, in denen Einwanderer mit der einheimischen österreichischen Bevölkerung zusammentreffen und in Dialog kommen können. Mit solchen Begegnungen werden auch Spannungen abgebaut.

Politik als Design

Sebastian Kurz ist der Einmarsch der Ästhetik des Fotomodells in die Politik. Betrachtet man Fotos von Sebastian Kurz erhält man den Eindruck, dass er zu viel Rouge an den Wangen aufgetragen erhielt. Kurz wird meist als Dressman präsentiert, der mit dicker Camouflage versehen wurde.

Auf manchen Bildern wird Kurz in einem utopischen Stil gezeichnet, der an Figuren wie im Film Matrix erinnert. Mit der Stimmung als wären die letzten Tage der Welt gekommen. Selbstverständlich schaffen professionelle Fotografen eine solche Bildgestaltung. Das ist aber kein politisches Programm.



Das kann noch gesteigert werden. Etwa auf einem Cover des profil, das Sebastian Kurz im heroischen Stil der Skulpturen eines Arno Breker aufgemalt zeigt, in einer Ästhetik, der man in der Epoche des Nationalsozialismus huldigte.

Noch vor wenigen Jahren hätte man das Auftreten eines Sebastian Kurz in Wien als „präpotent"" rasch abgetan. Plötzlich wurde Sebastian Kurz mit euphorischer Verherrlichung empfohlen.

Einige Medien forcierten Kurz stark. Insbesondere Christian Rainer, der Herausgeber des österreichischen Nachrichtenmagazins profil. Er schwärmt von Sebastian Kurz, den er in einem Kommentar als neuen Parteivorsitzenden der ÖVP und als nächsten Bundeskanzler der Republik Österreich empfahl. In einem Stil, der so wirkt als wäre er im Delirium:

„Dass die Volkspartei nun das einzig rational Fassbare tut: Sie muss Sebastian Kurz zum Parteiobmann machen, wenn nötig händeringend, wenn nötig auf den Knien flehend. Und die ÖVP muss das zu dessen Bedingungen tun: weil er sonst nicht zur Verfügung steht und weil weder Kurz noch die Partei ohne diese Bedingungen eine Lebenschance hat"".

In Österreich gibt es ernstzunehmende Verletzungen der Grundrechte. Das belegen die jährlichen Berichte der österreichischen Volksanwaltschaft. Hunderte Fälle von Angriffen auf das Eigentumsrecht. Die österreichische Bundesregierung setzt keine Maßnahmen. Das österreichische Nachrichtenmagazin profil will davon nicht berichten. Bevor Sebastian Kurz die deutsche Bundeskanzlerin kritisiert, sollte er als Parteivorsitzender der ÖVP dafür sorgen, dass die Grundrechte in Österreich eingehalten werden.

Sebastian Kurz wurde von Politikberatern und Medien ein charismatisches Image gebaut, das niemals halten kann. Sollte sich ein Wahlerfolg für die „Liste Kurz"" am 15. Oktober einstellen, so wird die Ernüchterung für Österreich zwangsläufig folgen.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN - Interné dans une clinique en Europe? Ou au beau milieu de l'Arizona? Selon les dernières photos parues sur le site TMZ, Harvey Weinstein, le producteur star d'Hollywood serait en passe de commencer une cure de désintoxication au sexe dans un établissement spécialisé du sud-ouest des États-Unis.

Jeudi 11 octobre, dans un communiqué officiel, le producteur annonçait travailler avec des thérapeutes et planifier un retrait de sa vie professionnelle. ""Mon objectif désormais est d'apprendre sur moi et de maîtriser mes démons"", écrit-il.

La nouvelle de son admission en établissement spécialisé a soulevé de nombreuses critiques. L'actrice anglaise Emma Thompson interrogée sur la BBC s'est ainsi insurgée: ""Je ne pense pas qu'on puisse le décrire comme un addict au sexe, c'est un prédateur. C'est différent. Il est au sommet d'un système d'harcèlement, de dépréciation, d'intimidation et d'interférence. Cela fait partie de notre monde, du monde des femmes, depuis des temps immémmoriels.""

""Les addicts au sexe ne sont pas des agresseurs""

Cette possible défense du producteur est en effet assez bancale, voire dangereuse car elle entretient l'idée que les personnes souffrant de cette addiction sont forcément des agresseurs et qu'ils pourraient être de par la reconnaissance et le traitement de cette addiction, moins responsables de leurs actions.

Une personne addict au sexe peut être l'auteur d'agression sexuelle, une personne sans addiction peut l'être aussi.

Laurent Karila, psychiatre spécialisé en addictologie et qui dirige une consultation spécialisée sur le sujet à l'hôpital Brousse à Paris interrogé par Le HuffPost réitère avec force la même distinction que l'actrice anglaise. ""Les addicts au sexe ne sont pas des agresseurs. Cette addiction peut entraîner des troubles du comportement mais elle ne rend pas de fait agressif.""

Christine Barois, médecin psychiatre à Paris, interrogée dans Sud Ouest offre une comparaison très parlante pour démentir ce raccourci: ""Il y a une recherche de plaisir compulsif dans l'addiction sexuelle. Bien évidemment, elle peut pousser le malade à dépasser des barrières morales dans le seul but de combler son désir. Mais pour prendre un exemple simple, un alcoolique ne va pas dévaliser un magasin d'alcool juste parce qu'il a besoin de boire. Un homme accusé par des douzaines de femmes belles et célèbres d'agressions sexuelles n'a pas le profil d'un addict, mais celui d'un pervers"".

L'addiction au sexe n'est pas reconnue dans le manuel des troubles psychiatriques de l'American Psychiatric Association ni dans les classifications internationales malgré plusieurs tentatives de définitions. Cependant son existence est attestée et des consultations spécialisées comme celle de Laurent Karila existent désormais. Ce type d'addiction touche plus souvent les hommes que les femmes.

""Dans ce type de violences sexuelles, il ne s'agit pas de sexe, mais de pouvoir""

""L'addiction au sexe, modère cependant Laurent Karila, n'est jamais un problème isolé, elle peut se doubler de troubles dépressifs ou anxieux par exemple."" L'addiction au sexe se définit selon ces quatre critères: la perte de temps, des envies irrésistibles, une perte de contrôle et des conséquences sociales.

Dans le dernier livre de Laurent Karila, ""Tous addicts et après?"" aux éditions Flammarion, qu'il cosigne avec William Lowenstein, médecin interniste spécialisé en addictologie, un questionnaire d'évaluation de l'addiction sexuelle établi en 2012 est disponible. Il ne vise pas à diagnostiquer cette addiction mais à encourager à consulter un spécialiste si un patient se reconnaît dans au moins trois des questionnements:

Evaluez-vous avec l'outil PEACCE (adaptation en langue française par Laurent Karila) Trouvez-vous que vous êtes souvent préoccupé par des pensées sexuelles? (Pensées) Cachez-vous certains de vos comportements sexuels à votre entourage (partenaire de vie, famille, ami(e)s proches...)? (Entourage) Avez-vous déjà recherché de l'aide pour un comportement sexuel que vous n'appréciez pas de faire? (Aide) Est-ce que quelqu'un a déjà été heurté émotionnellement à cause de votre comportement sexuel? (Conséquences) Vous sentez-vous contrôlé par votre désir sexuel? (Contrôle) Vous sentez-vous triste après être passé à l'acte sexuellement (rapports sexuels, internet, autres)? (Emotions)

Tout peut déclencher un besoin de consommation de sexe expliquent les auteurs de ""Tous addicts et après?"", ""avoir terminé une grosse journée de travail, avoir gagné beaucoup d'argent, être angoissé, triste, avoir reçu une bonne ou bien une mauvaise nouvelle... Tout est possible, tout est ""prétexte"""".

Ainsi donc l'addiction d'Harvey Weinstein est avérée, le problème réside ailleurs. Ce n'est pas la quantité de partenaires avec lesquelles il a eu des rapports sexuels, ni ses envies permanentes de sexe, ni le fait que comme il le dit dans son communiqué officiel il ait essayé de se contrôler depuis un an sans y parvenir. Il a abusé de sa position de pouvoir pour pouvoir forcer des femmes à se soumettre à ses appétits sexuels.

""Dans ce type de violences sexuelles, il ne s'agit pas de sexe, mais de pouvoir"", assure la sexologue américaine spécialisée dans les traumatismes sexuels Samantha Manewitz interrogée par Slate.

Pour ses victimes, pour les personnes addicts au sexe et pour toute la société, les actions d'Harvey Weinstein relèvent de la justice, qu'il soit ou non interné pour addiction. Ses ""démons"" ne peuvent l'innocenter.

Er erzählte Kaitlyn, dass er Aeric McCoy heiße und ihre Handtasche in einer Gasse gefunden habe. In der Handtasche war ein Zettel, auf dem ihre Adresse stand. Also beschloss er, sie ihr zurückzubringen. Ihm selbst sei vor kurzem der Schlafsack gestohlen worden - daher wisse er genau, wie frustrierend es ist, wenn man bestohlen wird.

Kaitlyn gab Aeric einen Schlafsack, eine Taschenlampe, Kleidung, einen neuen Rucksack und brachte ihn zurück nach Hause - denn Aeric war den ganzen, Kilometer weiten Weg durch die halbe Stadt zu ihr gelaufen. Auf dem Rückweg erzählte Aeric Kaitlyn, dass er heroinabhängig sei. Früher hatte er eine eigene Firma gehabt und als Landschaftsgärtner gearbeitet.

Seine ganze Geschichte seht ihr im Video oben.

Donald Trump hat einen Strategiewechsel zum Iran-Deal angekündigt

Der US-Präsident droht mit Sanktionen und will das Atomabkommen mit der Islamischen Republik nicht mehr zertifizieren

Die US-Medien üben wegen seiner brachialen Vorgehensweise nun heftige Kritik an Trump

""Die Geschichte hat gezeigt: Je länger wir eine Bedrohung ignorieren, umso größer wird diese Bedrohung.""

Dieses ominöse Zitat wurde nicht über, sondern von Donald Trump gesagt. Es war die Begründung des US-Präsidenten dafür, dem Iran mit neuen Sanktionen zu drohen und das Atomabkommen mit dem Land nicht mehr zertifizieren zu wollen.

Trump trat nicht aus dem Iran-Deal aus, wie es lange befürchtet worden war - aber er machte ihn aus US-Sicht wirkungslos. Und erntete dafür prompt Kritik.

Von verbündeten Nationen wie Deutschland, Frankreich und Großbritannien, aber auch von dem Großteil der US-Medien.

""Trump händigt dem Iran einen Sieg aus""



Gleich zwei Journalisten kommentierten so etwa in der ""New York Times"" Trumps Entscheidung, den Iran-Deal herabzustufen. Der Redakteur Antony J. Blinken glaubt, Trump ""vergrault die Verbündeten der USA und händigt dem Iran einen Sieg aus.""

Schon Trumps Analyse der Lage im Iran sei vollkommen falsch gewesen, schreibt Blinken. Wie viele Republikaner behauptet Trump, dass das Regime in Teheran längst kollabiert wäre, hätte sein Vorgänger Barack Obama den Iran-Deal nicht abgeschlossen - und so die Sanktionen gegen das Land aufgehoben.

Blinken meint: ""Eine Behauptung, die Tagträumer in Washington seit vier Jahrzehnten jedes Jahr machen."" Trumps harte Linie gegen die Islamische Republik helfe nur den Hardlinern in der iranischen Regierung. Tatsächlich gefährde sie außerdem sowohl die Glaubwürdigkeit als auch die Sicherheit der USA, schlussfolgert Blinken.

Sein Kollege Bret Stephens formuliert es drastischer: ""Donald Trump hat eine Geisel genommen."" Gemeint ist der Iran-Deal, dessen Scheitern der Präsident durch seine rabiate Vorgehensweise in Kauf nehme.

Stephens räumt ein, dass die US-Politik gegenüber dem Iran zu festgefahren sei und Trump durch seine Entscheidung Bewegung in die Beziehungen der beiden Länder gebracht habe. Gleichzeitig fürchtet er aber das Risiko eines ausbrechenden Krieges - und die Tatsache, dass es an einer instabilen Person wie Donald Trump ist, einen solchen zu verhindern.

""Trumps 'neue Strategie' zum Iran ist weder neu noch eine Strategie""

Das Nachrichtenportal ""Vox"" beurteilt Trumps Attacke auf den Iran-Deal noch kritischer als die ""New York Times"". Es bezeichnet die Vorstöße des US-Präsidenten gegen den Iran als ""Abrechnung des Grolls"". ""Trumps 'neue Strategie' zum Iran ist weder neu noch eine Strategie"", schreibt ""Vox"".

Weder die Sanktionen gegen die Nationalgarde des Irans, die Trump angekündigt hatte, noch die Blockade des Iran-Deals seien Schritte, die ein klares Ziel im Umgang mit der Islamischen Republik definieren würden. ""Vox"" zitiert hierzu den Iran-Experten Hussein Banai, einen Politikwissenschaftler von der University of Indiana: ""Das ist ein ausgestreckter Mittelfinger an den Anspruch der USA auf eine Führungsrolle in der Welt.""

Die ""Washington Post"" schreibt in dieser Hinsicht von einer ""Dummheit"" Trumps. Der US-Präsident habe sich mit Teheran auf ein gefährliches und sinnloses Spiel mit dem Feuer eingelassen. Jetzt sei es am US-Kongress, nicht die gleiche Dummheit wie Trump zu begehen, indem er dessen Politik mitträgt: ""Der Kongress sollte den Status Quo, so viele Fehler dieser auch hat, nicht verletzen - denn er verhindert eine weitere nukleare Krise.""

Trump bleibt sorglos

Vor dieser fürchtet sich auch die Londoner Zeitung ""The Guardian"". ""Die nun entstehende diplomatische Lage ist beispiellos"", schreibt die US-Redaktion des Blattes. ""Ein US-Präsident streitet sich nicht nur mit seinen eigenen engsten Beratern, sondern zugleich mit allen entscheidenden Akteuren einer ernsten Krise der internationalen Sicherheit - einschließlich sämtlicher europäischer Verbündeter.""

Aus ""Amerika zuerst"" würde derzeit ""Amerika allein"" - ""und das in einem Moment, in dem klar wird, dass die USA allein weit weniger Macht hat, als sie denkt.""

Donald Trump scheint dies noch nicht klar geworden zu sein. Er feiert seine harte Linie gegen den Iran als Erfolg und Korrektur der aus seiner Sicht laschen Politik seines Vorgängers Barack Obama. Bei einer Rede am Freitagabend ging Trump so weit, zu behaupten: ""Meine Präsidentschaft ist dem Zeitplan weit voraus.""

Angesichts der bisherigen katastrophalen Fehler Trumps in der Außenpolitik lässt sich sagen: Das hat etwas von Ignoranz.

The documentary-maker, a father-of-two who said he wanted to “die young as late as possible”, was in the last few weeks of his travels around the world with his wife Hilary.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are providing assistance to the family of a British man following his tragic death in India on October 13.

“Our thoughts are with the family at this sad time.”

Writing on their blog, ourmiddleagedgapyear.wordpress.com, the couple said they were renting out their home and trying to live on £100 a day.

They said: “We are Hilary and Roger a married couple from England/Scotland who are in their mid fifties.

“Hilary’s motto is ‘just do it’ whilst Roger’s is ‘to die young as late as possible’.

“We took the view that on your deathbed you never wish you’d spent more time in the office.

“We’ve seen our two kids off into the wider world and we have no more caring responsibilities for our parents.

“So we thought now is the time to take a gap year and travel whilst we still have the health and energy. After all you only live once.”

The couple started with a two-month tour of Italy before taking in south and north America, Australia, and several Asian countries. India was intended to be their final stop, according to the blog.

Describing their motivations for the project, they said: “Rather than drift into comfortable retirement we wanted to do something different.

“Also there are many parts of the world we want to see and we figured continual travel would be more of a switch off and better value for money.

“One aim is to experience countries as travellers rather than time-conscious tourists.

“We had kids soon after we married so hadn’t travelled much as a couple and wanted to experience living abroad for an extended time.”

Universal Credit is due to be rolled out more widely in the coming months, despite persistent reports of problems.","Universal Credit claimants languish on hold to a government helpline while racking up bills as high as £16, without the option of an immediate call back, contradicting claims made by Downing Street.

One call placed by HuffPost UK to the dedicated 0345 number on Wednesday afternoon took 12 and a half minutes to be answered in person, at which point an advisor refused to call back straight away due to data protection rules.

The call would have cost some Universal Credit claimants more than 11 percent of their weekly allowance, which is meant to “help with living costs”.

It came amid a growing row over the policy, as Theresa May was earlier forced to defend the up to 55p per minute call charges during Prime Minister’s Questions.

HuffPost UK Calls to the Universal Credit helpline are charged at up to 55p per minute from mobiles in England. Welsh language calls are free

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the PM to “show some humanity” and scrap the cost altogether.

The PM’s official spokesperson later suggested there was an immediate call back option, with advisors able to return calls at no cost to the claimant “straight away”.

But Downing Street’s claim prompted derision from Labour, with Corbyn’s spokesperson saying: “The No.10 line that you can ask for a ‘call back’ is a joke as they’ve cut so many staff you can’t get through and are held in a queue.”

And during HuffPost’s call, our reporter was asked to input information via an automated answering service, yet at no time did the service ask for a telephone number for a call back.

After three minutes and 11 seconds, the call was placed in a queue as ‘Spring’ from Vivaldi’s Four Seasons played on loop.

‘You can call back later’

Automatic messages heard in the queue also undermined Number 10′s defence.

“All our lines are still busy. Please hold and we will answer your call as soon as we can. Or if you prefer you can call back later,” a voice said at regular intervals.

After 12 minutes and 30 seconds, the call was eventually answered by an advisor who said they could not call the reporter back straight away due to data protection rules.

“Firstly, I need to know if you are registered with us and complete necessary security checks,” they said.

HuffPost’s call ended after 13 minutes and 40 seconds - a total cost to callers on some mobile phone networks of £7.51.

Universal Credit claimants without children and aged under 25 take home just £62.94 a week, according to the government’s website.

The helpline assists those who are confused by the new system or who need to register changes in circumstances.

Some 55,000 calls a week were made to the helpline during August, according to a freedom of information request (pdf).

The request revealed callers have experienced a “maximum” wait time of 29 minutes, costing £15.95 to those on mobiles.

‘Money I could be using for food’

‘Sue’, a 54-year-old claimant explained to Citizens Advice Bureau (pdf) that she phoned the helpline because she couldn’t use a computer.

“The process is complicated if you aren’t very good at using computers,” she said. “Going to the job centre and using wifi all costs money I could be using for food.”

Some 30 percent of respondents to a Citizens Advice survey of claimants reported calling the helpline more than 10 times.

An earlier call made by HuffPost dropped out unexpectedly after two minutes and 11 seconds, at a cost of £1.20 to those on a mobile.

It has also been revealed that calls to the Universal Credit helpline are free for Welsh language speakers.

Criticism has mounted of the new benefit system, which replaces Job Seeker’s Allowance and combines all welfare entitlements into one monthly payment.

Trials of the policy have seen many claimants fall into arrears with rent payments and face homelessness as delays in the first payments of Universal Credit force others to use loan sharks and food banks.

It has been widely condemned by politicians on both sides of the House of Commons, and the issue dominated Wednesday’s PMQs.

Universal Credit is due to be rolled out more widely in the coming months, despite persistent reports of problems.

FOOTBALL - Nasser Al-Khelaïfi, PDG de beIN Media et patron du PSG, se retrouve sous les feux croisés de la police italienne, pour une villa en Sardaigne -moyen de corrompre Jérôme Valcke, ex-N.2 de la Fifa- et de la Fifa elle même, qui a ouvert une enquête visant le Qatari.

Le développement de ce vendredi 13 octobre prend donc les contours d'une villa à Porto Cervo, marina de carte postale, dont la valeur est estimée à sept millions d'euros. Cette résidence ""constitue le 'moyen de corruption' utilisé par Nasser Al-Khelaïfi (...) à l'encontre (de Jérôme Valcke) pour acquérir les droits télévisés relatifs"" à plusieurs Coupes du monde, selon un communiqué de la police italienne.

Une grave accusation que les deux principaux protagonistes ont rejeté vendredi. ""Les droits télé en cause ne concernent que la zone Moyen-Orient/Maghreb, or dans ces pays là, beIN Media n'a aucune concurrence. Pourquoi Nasser Al-Khelaïfi aurait voulu corrompre certains protagonistes alors qu'il n'avait pas de concurrent?"", a expliqué l'entourage du dirigeant qatari à l'AFP. Sollicité, l'avocat de Nasser Al-Khelaïfi, Me Francis Szpiner, n'a lui pas souhaité réagir.

De son côté, l'avocat de Valcke a assuré auprès de l'AFP que l'ex-N2 de la Fifa ""a payé la location de la villa sarde"".

Une villa mise à la disposition de Valcke?

Selon la police italienne, la ""Villa Bianca"" appartient à une société immobilière établie à l'international, mais était en fait mise à la disposition de Valcke. L'opération policière de vendredi a par ailleurs été menée en présence d'un ""représentant du ministère public de la Confédération helvétique"".

La Suisse, de facto, est concernée, car cet épisode n'est que le prolongement spectaculaire de l'affaire qui a éclaté jeudi quand la justice suisse a révélé l'ouverture d'une enquête pour ""corruption privée"" présumée dans l'attribution des droits médias de plusieurs Coupes du monde, visant Al-Khelaïfi, boss de beIN Media, corrupteur présumé, et Valcke, corrompu présumé.

Le ministère public de la Confédération (MPC) a en réalité lancé sa procédure en toute discrétion le 20 mars, pour ""soupçon de corruption privée, d'escroquerie, de gestion déloyale et de faux dans les titres"". Dès jeudi, le MPC évoquait une opération ""coordonnée"", menée simultanément en France, en Grèce, en Espagne et en Italie.

La police italienne précise encore que plusieurs personnes, ""liées à divers titres à la société propriétaire de la villa"" ont été interrogées. Des documents et du matériel informatique ont également été saisis.

Une troisième personne visée par l'enquête suisse

Valcke, 57 ans, mis en examen, avait quitté libre jeudi soir les bureaux du MPC à Berne. Il déclare dans le quotidien français L'Équipe de vendredi n'avoir ""rien reçu de Nasser"": ""il n'y a jamais eu d'échange entre Nasser et moi. Jamais"".

L'épouse de Valcke, qui l'accompagnait en Suisse, ""a également été entendue par les enquêteurs mais à Lausanne"", avait-on appris d'une autre source judiciaire. Le couple Valcke devait ensuite rejoindre Barcelone dès jeudi soir où il est désormais domicilié, selon les conseils du couple.

Une troisième personne, active ""dans le domaine des droits sportifs"", est également visée mais le MPC n'a pas communiqué son identité. Selon Le Parisien il s'agit de l'homme d'affaires grec Konstantinos Nteris. La police grecque évoque juste des perquisitions jeudi, sans donner de nom.

Les ennuis s'accumulent pour Al-Khelaïfi, puisque le PSG, qu'il préside depuis le rachat du club par un fond souverain du Qatar en 2011, fait l'objet d'une enquête de l'UEFA. Le club est soupçonné d'avoir enfreint les règles du fair-play financier - ne pas dépenser plus qu'on ne gagne même en présence d'un actionnaire/mécène richissime - avec les acquisitions de Neymar (222 M EUR) et Mbappé (180 M EUR).

The town of Los Algodones in Mexico is nicknamed ""Molar City."" It has a population of just 6,000 people and, shockingly, it has more than 500 practising dentists. This has produced an intense clustering of dental clinics within a four-block radius.

Many of these dentists chose to work in this town because of the tourist traffic, given its proximity to the Mexico-United States border. Thousands of Canadian and American tourists park their cars and walk across the border into Los Algodones to spend the day souvenir shopping, eating and drinking in the local restaurants, and purchasing alcohol, prescription drugs and dental care at lower costs than available back home.

Less than a block after crossing into Mexico, U.S. tourists are bombarded with billboards touting the dental services in Los Algodones, Mexico, as pictured here March 2, 2009.

In 2015 and 2016, I spent four months living in Los Algodones conducting interviews and participating in local events for a doctoral research project in health sciences at Simon Fraser University. My work investigates dental travel as part of the wider phenomenon of ""medical tourism"" — an industry that is growing rapidly as more and more patients seek access to new or more affordable medical treatments outside of their countries of residence.

My research raises concerns about exploitative industry practices in Los Algodones, Mexico. These include poor working conditions and discriminatory practices for employees in dental clinics, harassment of Indigenous street vendors and lack of access to dental care for local residents.

Inside 'Molar City'

Most of the residents and employees I met during my research in Los Algdones were grateful for the much-needed economic benefits of the dental tourism industry. But I also heard concerns and frustrations from members of the local population. They felt that many of the industry activities were unfair and difficult to change.

One interviewee explained how dental tourists often come with prejudiced assumptions about Mexico, stating: ""We see a lot of racism [...] people trying to come here and saying, 'OK, it is Mexico. I can ask for anything and pay you less.'""

Local residents and industry employees felt that dental tourists' perceptions of Mexico as unsafe and underdeveloped are driving poor working conditions and discriminatory practices.

For example, employees work long hours to promote Los Algodones' reputation for their employers as an ideal site to purchase dental care. Some also said they had experienced harassment from dental tourists negotiating lower prices and faster care.

Harassment of Indigenous vendors

Clinic employees and local residents also experience stressful interactions in the industry to meet the expectations of clinic owners. Some owners encourage employees to minimize their Mexican accents. This is done to distance Los Algodones from prejudiced perceptions of Mexico as an underdeveloped place with inferior medical care.

One participant described how a dental clinic owner offered to pay him to dump buckets of water on the heads of Indigenous souvenir vendors working near his clinic. Along with harassment, clinic owners also encourage Indigenous vendors to ""stay cool, sell stuff cheap and smile to people."" Many owners worry that the presence of Indigenous vendors might deter tourists by representing the underdeveloped Mexico of tourists' imaginations.

Most local residents cannot afford this type of care.

Local residents struggle to access dental care

My research also revealed that dental clinic owners' concerns about reputation can decrease access to dental care for local residents. Clinic owners suggested they're too busy marketing their services and treating foreign patients to treat many locals. Some owners are using free X-rays to entice tourists, who shop around for their ideal care.

Most of the dental services in Los Algodones are also focused on the provision of major restorative treatment rather than preventative care, given the needs of dental tourists. Most local residents cannot afford this type of care. This is concerning as there are limited publicly funded dental care options available in this region of Mexico.

Overall, the ""dental Shangri-la of the Mexican desert"" is only an oasis for those able and willing to travel and pay for dental care. For many, the industry provides much-needed employment. But this might be stressful, unfair work for individuals unable to use the dental oasis for their own health needs.

The need for global regulation

Participation in the global medical tourism industry is increasing and research shows that this growth raises serious ethical challenges, at least in the industry's current form. Researchers have raised concerns about the negative impacts on the health of local people who live and work in these medical tourism destinations.

My in-depth investigation of industry practices in the town of Los Algodones provides more evidence to support these concerns. It suggests the need for better global regulation of dental tourism and medical tourism more widely.

This regulation is needed to avoid competition between industry sites driving down labour standards in the global industry and diverting health resources away from populations in need. This regulation could enforce acceptable work conditions to avoid a race-to-the-bottom effect as industry sites try to attract customers to lower-cost, desirable medical care.

More information about these concerns could also help individuals participating in the industry to avoid harmful practices. It could remind medical tourists that cost savings for care might come at a cost to fair labour standards — and that they should allow sufficient time for treatment and be prepared to pay fair prices.

« Pour une rare fois, nous avons dû faire face à une surabondance d'informations.

Je commence à peine à travailler sur la documentation », avertit José-Louis Bocquet sourire en coin.","Difficile de faire une biographie. Difficile, parce qu'on peut facilement tomber dans un collage d'anecdotes superficielles sans lien. Difficile, parce qu'on peut être tellement obsédé par la précision historique qu'on en vient à vider le «biographié» de ses émotions, de ses passions, de son humanité et à le transformer en témoin désincarné de sa propre vie. Alors quand on découvre une biographie qui conjugue rigueur historique, passion humaine et anecdotes significatives, on sait qu'on a entre les mains une œuvre aussi précieuse que rare. À l'occasion du dernier festival de BD de Montréal nous avons rencontré José-Louis Bocquet et Catel auteurs de l'exceptionnelle biographie dessinée Joséphine Baker symbole coruscant du Paris éternel. Discussion autour du difficile exercice de la biographie.

« Je pense que le plus difficile c'est de créer du sens. Les biographes doivent avoir un point de vue à défendre sur le personnage. Ils doivent accepter de sacrifier les éléments qui ne donnent aucun sens au récit, sinon ça ne devient qu'une succession de faits et je ne sais pas si une énumération de faits forme réellement un portrait », s'interroge José Louis Bocquet, dont la position pourrait frôler l'hérésie dans les officines guindées des biographes historiques proclamés.

« Je ne viens pas de l'école de l'histoire, je viens de celle du Journal de Spirou et des Belles histoires de l'Oncle Paul, de celle qui nous disait "" je vais vous raconter une histoire vraie qui va vous donner envie de tourner les pages "" et c'est toujours ça qui guide mon travail. Bon, il est vrai que je travaille longtemps sur la documentation et que j'essaie d'être le plus près possible de ce que je crois être la vérité des personnages, mais ce que je raconte c'est avant tout une histoire. »

Si le scénariste se réclame avec enthousiasme de l'héritage de l'oncle Paul, on ne peut pas dire toutefois qu'il en a totalement suivi les enseignements, tant ses biographies, avec l'aide du magnifique trait tout en mouvement de Catel, sont fascinantes, rythmées et pleine d'affection pour ses « biographiés.» Ce qui n'était pas l'apanage de tonton Paul.

« Vous savez, ça nous prend environ trois ans pour faire une biographie alors on ne pourrait pas travailler tout ce temps sur un projet si le personnage ne nous plaisait pas » précise la dessinatrice. Ce qui ne veut pas dire qu'ils tombent dans une hagiographie facile. Au contraire, jamais ils n'occultent leurs côtés les plus sombres. « C'est ce qui les rend plus humains, plus sympathiques. Pour Joséphine Baker, par exemple, nous avons travaillé avec un de ses fils adoptifs qui nous a raconté des anecdotes troublantes sur elle. » Un choix qui permet aux auteurs de redonner à la chanteuse une humanité que la mémoire collective, à force de l'enfermer dans une image de carte postale, a fini par lui confisquer.

« Quelle image de cartes postales? Celle des enseignes lumineuses des cabarets de Berlin? Celle du Casino de Paris? Ce sont des images fortes, je ne vois pas pourquoi on devrait s'en passer », s'empresse de renchérir José-Louis Bocquet qui a aussi rédigé des biographies écrites, dont une sur son parrain, le grand cinéaste Henri-Georges Clouzot, loin d'être traditionnelles. « Non ce qu'on veut éviter ce sont les clichés mille fois racontés » précise-t-il citant au passage l'exemple de la fameuse danse sauvage de la Revue nègre qui lui a permis de triompher dans la Ville Lumière. « On aurait pu se concentrer sur son numéro, mais on a préféré l'évoquer rapidement et insister sur ce qui a amené Joséphine à Paris. Ce qui nous permettait d'aborder sa jeunesse à Saint-Louis et ses premiers pas dans le show-business. » L'anecdote devient alors le prétexte pour explorer d'autres facettes de son excitante vie.

Excitant, le mot est juste d'autant plus que dans son cas, il est difficile de différencier le vrai du faux, tant la légende s'est substituée à la réalité. « Pour une rare fois, nous avons dû faire face à une surabondance d'informations. » Une situation parfaite pour Catel, qui avait ainsi accès à une documentation solide pour enrichir son dessin, mais plus problématique pour Bocquet qui a dû passer plusieurs mois à rechercher la vérité. « C'est incroyable le nombre de biographies qui ont été écrites sur elle, des excellentes bien sûr, mais aussi des épouvantables qui relèvent plus du règlement de compte » ou de la rumeur,

Si Bocquet et Catel réussissent si bien à faire le parfait dosage entre émotion, rythme et rigueur historique, c'est aussi parce qu'ils choisissent des personnages hors du commun, plus grands que nature, mais qui ne sont pas toujours reconnues par l'histoire officielle. « Quand on a décidé de faire des biographies dessinées nous avons choisi de nous consacrer à des femmes importantes qui ne sont pas dans les livres d'histoire» explique la dessinatrice qui avec passion raconte leur vie que notre imaginaire défaillant a fini par oublier ou réduire à une simple image unidimensionnelle, comme Kiki de Montparnasse, Olympe de Gouges auteur en pleine tourmente révolutionnaire de 1791 de la Déclaration des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne, Joséphine Baker et bientôt Simone de Beauvoir. « Pas de tout de suite! Je commence à peine à travailler sur la documentation », avertit José-Louis Bocquet sourire en coin.

En attendant qu'elle soit prête, on peut toujours relire avec enthousiasme les trois biographies qu'ils ont déjà écrit - ou celles que Catel a consacrées à Piaf à Benoite Groult et bientôt à René Goscinny - qui en font des incontournables du 9e art.

It was the fourth annual conference, having begun in 2014 as a response to the dire state of our ocean's health and the recognition of the importance of the seas and oceans in our lives.



With over three billion people directly depending on our oceans for their livelihoods the issue of ocean health cannot be ignored. Yet if you look around the world you cannot escape the fact that the state of our oceans has never been more precarious.



So at Malta, it was encouraging to hear from many people who wanted to take action; pledging a series of wide-ranging commitments to start reversing the damage done to our oceans.



HRH The Prince of Wales announced a bold blue economy initiative, with policies to support sustainable development. China committed to the creation of 66 'blue bays' around its coastline to protect marine life. And Carrefour announced that by 2020, half of all fish that it sells will come from sustainable sources.



The worrying truth is that the oceans face a range of issues, largely man made. One of those issues is ocean pollution and in particular the damage we are doing by the vast amounts of plastic washing up all over our shores. Our oceans are now drowning in plastic.



According to The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, without change, all the plastic in the ocean could weigh more than all the fish by 2050. The average UK household uses one rubbish truck's worth of single use plastics a year - contributing to the eight million tonnes of plastic that enters our oceans annually.



This is both dire and depressing, and the duty to act never so urgent.



At Sky we are determined to make a stand. Our Sky Ocean Rescue campaign will continue to shine a spotlight on the issues our oceans face, why they are happening and what can be done about it.



We have committed to transform our business and eradicate all single-use plastics from our operations, products and supply chains by 2020. As a start we have removed plastic bottles, cups, cutlery and straws from all our sites and replaced them with corn starch, or paper alternatives. Everyday stuff that soon adds up - we've already reduced our plastic bottle use by 300,000 in just nine months



We are also creating an Ocean Rescue Innovation Fund, anchored by our own capital to help spur innovation in this area. The fund will look for businesses and start-ups that are developing ideas and technology to eradicate single-use plastics from supply chains right across the globe and to stop plastic from ending up in the ocean.



We are inviting others to co-invest with us because we believe that by finding and funding the best ideas from around the world, we will discover new ways to help to solve this problem. By harnessing the capital, expertise and voice of the business community we can, together, accelerate innovation to reverse some of the damage already done.



The reality is not enough is being done by enough businesses. It needs us all to play our part. As an island nation, we are never more than 70 miles from the coast. This could not be more important. Three million people live on the coastline, hundreds of thousands more rely on the ocean for employment and almost every one of us for the food it provides.



This is a vast and complex issue, but what gives me hope is that there are some relatively easy, everyday things businesses can do. If you walked into a bathroom overflowing with water, what would you do? You wouldn't start mopping up the water... you would turn off the tap. So what can businesses do? Start by turning off the plastic tap. We have started. But we need more businesses to join us - now.",Why We Need To Turn Off The Plastic Tap,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jeremy-darroch/why-we-need-to-turn-off_b_18229486.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Este miércoles 11 escribió: ""No hay excusa para el acoso y el abuso sexual, sin importar quién eres ni qué profesión tienes.","Las réplicas del terremoto que sacudió Hollywood hace unos días no dejan de sentirse. El desencadenante fue un artículo de The New York Times que destapaba el supuesto acoso y abuso sexual por parte del poderoso productor Harvey Weinstein a distintas actrices a lo largo de dos décadas, al que rápidamente se sumó rápidamente otro reportaje de The New Yorker. Tras su publicación, más intérpretes de la talla de Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow o Cara Delevingne lo han señalado y la lista de mujeres que lo acusan supera la veintena.

Las reacciones en la meca del cine no han cesado y numerosas voces han asegurado que estos comportamientos no son infrecuentes. Personalidades que han trabajado con él, desde Penélope Cruz a Meryl Streep, hasta George Clooney o Ben Affleck, pasando por Hillary Clinton se han pronunciado al respecto. Además, han comenzado a salir a la luz no pocos guiños velados en distintas entrevistas y eventos de los últimos años que dan a entender que la industria conocía los rumores sobre el productor y su conducta.

Estas son las claves para entender el caso que a Weinstein, quien ha reconocido los hechos, le ha costado su trabajo y su matrimonio y que podría suponerle la expulsión de la Academia de Hollywood.

QUIÉN ES HARVEY WEINSTEIN

Quizá su cara no te suene demasiado, pero este productor cinematográfico de 65 años es una de las personas más poderosas de Hollywood. Junto a su hermano Bob fundó las productoras Miramax y The Weinstein Company.

Está detrás de películas tan conocidas como Pulp Fiction, Shakespeare in Love, El indomable Will Hunting, Chicago o las sagas Kill Bill, Scream y Scary Movie, entre muchas otras (en Imdb figuran 331 títulos de los que es productor).

POR QUÉ SE HABLA DE ÉL ESTOS DÍAS

Por un artículo publicado en The New York Times el jueves 5 de octubre titulado Harvey Weinstein pagó para poner fin a denuncias por acoso sexual durante décadas. En el texto se documentaban hasta ocho acuerdos extrajudiciales en demandas interpuestas por antiguas empleadas y asociadas, como las actrices Ashley Judd (Heat, Divergente) y Rose McGowan (Scream, Death Proof).

Judd relató al diario que hace 20 años Weinstein la invitó a lo que ella pensaba que era un desayuno de trabajo en un hotel en Beverly Hills, pero él la hizo subir a su habitación, donde apareció en albornoz y le preguntó si le podía dar un masaje o mirarlo mientras se duchaba.

El artículo también hablaba de un acuerdo alcanzado en 1997 entre Weinstein y Rose McGowan, cuando ésta tenía 23 años, tras un episodio en la habitación de un hotel durante el Festival de Sundance del que no se daban más detalles.

LA DISCULPA DE WEINSTEIN

El mismo 5 de octubre Harvey Weinstein envió un comunicado a The New York Times en respuesta al artículo. En él, señalaba que alcanzó ""la mayoría de edad en los 60 y los 70, cuando las normas de comportamiento en los lugares de trabajo eran diferentes"". ""Me doy cuenta de que el modo en el que me he comportado con mis colegas en el pasado ha causado mucho daño y me disculpo sinceramente por ello"", añadió.

Weistein también apuntó que se había puesto en manos de terapeutas y reiteró que ""respetaba a las mujeres y lamentaba lo que pasó"". También citó una letra de una canción del rapero Jay Z para pedir ""una segunda oportunidad"".

WEINSTEIN, DESPEDIDO

The Weinstein Company despidió a Harvey Weinstein el domingo 7 de octubre ""tras las informaciones acerca de su mala conducta"". La decisión la tomaron los cuatro miembros de la junta de la compañía (incluido Bob Weinstein, su hermano). Un quinto socio había dimitido el día anterior.

Según recoge The Independent, en las horas previas Weinstein se había dirigido por email a los grandes ejecutivos de Hollywood, suplicándoles que lo ayudaran porque su empresa lo iba a despedir: ""Permitidme resucitar con una segunda oportunidad [...] Si podéis, necesito que enviéis una carta a mi Gmail personal. La carta sería para la junta y no la vería nadie más. Lo que el consejo está tratando de hacer no sólo está mal, sino que podría ser ilegal y destruiría la empresa"".

LA REACCIÓN DE HOLLYWOOD

Tras las publicación del artículo se han sucedido multitud de reacciones en la industria. Muchos actores, algunos que habían trabajado codo con codo con Weinstein, otros que habían oído rumores sobre su comportamiento hace tiempo y algunas actrices que han vivido acoso en Hollywood, se han pronunciado sobre el caso. Aquí puedes repasar los principales testimonios de manera cronológica:

LENA DUNHAM

El lunes 9 de octubre la actriz y creadora de la serie Girls escribió una carta en The New York Times lamentándose del silencio de los hombres de la industria a la hora de condenar el acoso sexual en Hollywood. ""El abuso, las amenazas y la coerción han sido la norma para muchas mujeres que trataban de hacer negocio o de hacer arte [...] Hollywood tiene otra oportunidad de hacer una declaración ruidosa sobre lo que debemos y no debemos tolerar como sociedad"". Dunham también recordó que ella misma había vivido un episodio de acoso por parte de un director.

MERYL STREEP

La oscarizada Meryl Streep envió​​​ una declaración a la edición estadounidense del HuffPost el martes 10 de octubre. Streep, que había trabajado con él en películas como Agosto y La dama de hierro, aseguró que no estaba al tanto de su comportamiento: ""Yo no sabía nada de los mencionados agravios: no me constaban sus compensaciones económicas a otras actrices y compañeras, no sabía nada de sus reuniones en sus habitaciones de hotel, en su cuarto de baño ni tampoco de cualquier otro comportamiento inapropiado y coercitivo"". La actriz calificó de ""heroínas"" a las mujeres que habían dado su testimonio para destapar el caso.

JENNIFER LAWRENCE

La actriz consiguió el Oscar a Mejor actriz en 2013 por El lado bueno de las cosas, cinta producida por Weinstein. Después de que se destapara el escándalo, Lawrence ha asegurado en un comunicado emitido el 9 de octubre que no sabía nada: ""Trabajé con Weinstein hace cinco años y no experimenté ninguna forma de acoso [...] Mi corazón está con todas esas mujeres afectadas por esas desagradables acciones. Y quiero darles las gracias por haber dado un valiente paso adelante"".

KATE WINSLET

Winslet también consiguió el Oscar gracias a una producción de The Weinstein Company, El lector (2009). En un comunicado enviado a Variety el lunes 9, señaló: ""Esperaba que esas historias fueran rumores, tal vez hemos sido todos ingenuos. Eso me enfada mucho. No se debe tolerar este trato degradante y vil a las mujeres en ningún lugar de trabajo en ningún lugar del mundo"".

GLENN CLOSE

""Estoy aquí, profundamente molesta, reconociéndome a mí misma que sí, que durante muchos años he sido consciente de los vagos rumores de que Harvey Weinstein tenía un patrón de comportamiento inadecuado hacia las mujeres. Harvey siempre ha sido decente conmigo pero ahora que los rumores se corroboran me siento enojada y profundamente triste"", dijo Glenn Close a The New York Times el 9 de octubre.

JESSICA CHASTAIN

A través de un tuit, la actriz —que nunca ha trabajado con Weinstein— afirmó el lunes 9: ""Estaba avisada desde el principio. Las historias estaban por todas partes. Negarlo es crear el ambiente para que vuelva a ocurrir"".

I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an enviornment for it to happen again. — Jessica Chastain (@jes_chastain) 9 de octubre de 2017

Desde entonces no ha parado de tuitear acerca del caso, haciéndose eco de las críticas a Weinstein, y de mostrarse del lado de las víctimas.

DONNA KARAN

La diseñadora realizó unas polémicas declaraciones el domingo 8 de las que se retractó al día siguiente. La modista, amiga de la mujer de Weinstein —Georgina Chapman, también diseñadora—, afirmó en una alfombra roja: ""Mira cómo se han vestido las mujeres hoy y lo que están pidiendo con sólo presentarse de esa manera. ¿Qué están pidiendo? Problemas"". El día después matizó sus palabras y aseguró que sus palabras se habían sacado de contexto. ""Creo que el acoso sexual no es aceptable y este es un tema que debe ser abordado de una vez por todas, independientemente del individuo"", apuntó.

ASIA ARGENTO

El 10 de octubre The New Yorker publicó un amplio reportaje que incluía varios testimonios de mujeres que relataban los abusos recibidos por parte de Weinstein, entre ellas, la intérprete Mira Sorvino y la actriz y directora de origen italiano Asia Argento. Ésta acusa al productor de violación y asegura que la forzó a tener sexo oral. ""Sé que ha aplastado a mucha más gente antes"", asegura Argento.

En su cuenta de Twitter, Argento recuperó una escena que dirigió en 1999 inspirada en la historia de Rosanna Arquette, actriz a la que Weinstein también recibió en albornoz ""diciendo que le dolía el cuello y que necesitaba un masaje"".

En ese artículo también se cuentan los casos de otras actrices como Lucia Evans, que asegura que la forzó a tener sexo oral, y Louisette Geiss, que sostiene que Weinstein le dijo que la ayudaría en su carrera si le miraba masturbarse.

ANGELINA JOLIE Y GWYNETH PALTROW

Un reportaje de The New York Times publicado el día 10 recogía el testimonio de dos pesos pesados de la gran pantalla: las actrices Angelina Jolie y Gwyneth Paltrow.

Sobre esta última se cuenta que antes de empezar el rodaje de Emma, cuando Paltrow tenía 22 años, Weinstein la citó en un hotel. La reunión transcurrió con normalidad hasta que él intentó tocarla y le sugirió que debían darse unos masajes. La actriz rechazó las intentonas del productor y se lo contó a su pareja por aquel entonces, el actor Brad Pitt, que se peleó con el productor. ""Pensé que me iba a despedir"", cuenta. Ahora ha resurgido un vídeo de una entrevista de 1998 en la que lo llama coercer (quien ejerce coacción).

Por su parte, Angelina Jolie recuerda un episodio durante la promoción de Jugando con el corazón en 1998, cuando tenía 23 años: ""Tuve una mala experiencia con Harvey Weinstein en mi juventud y, como resultado, decidí no volver a trabajar con él nunca más y advertir a otros cuando así lo hicieran"".

GEORGE CLOONEY

El actor, que conoce a Harvey Weinstein desde hace 20 años, ha asegurado que ""es indefendible"". ""Me dio mi primer gran papel en películas como Abierto hasta el amanecer y mi primera oportunidad como director en Confesiones de una mente peligrosa. Hemos compartido cenas, hemos ido junto a localizaciones, hemos discutido pero puedo decir que nunca le he visto este tipo de comportamiento, nunca"", aseguró a Daily Beast el martes 10.

JEFF BRIDGES

El actor, que trabajó con Weinstein en 2014 en The Giver, señaló en Hollywood Reporter este martes que el productor ""se enfrenta ahora a sus demonios"". ""Espero que se apoye en esos demonios para pasar al otro lado siendo una persona mejor. Le deseo lo mejor"", prosiguió.

BEN AFFLECK

Facebook ha sido la vía elegida por Ben Affleck. ""Estoy triste y enfadado porque un hombre con el que he trabajado [produjo El indomable Will Hunting] usara su posición de poder para intimidar, acosar sexualmente y manipular a muchas mujeres durante décadas"", afirmó este martes. ""Necesitamos mejorar en la protección de nuestras hermanas, amigas, compañeras e hijas"", añadió.

Unas horas después Rose McGowan —una de las actrices que aparecían en el artículo que destapó el escándalo— le acusó de mentir. ""Le dije que dejara de hacerlo', me dijiste a la cara. La rueda de prensa a la que me hicieron ir después del asalto. Mientes"", afirmó en un tuit, sugiriendo que el actor tenía conocimiento del comportamiento de Weinstein. En un mensaje posterior la actriz escribió: ""Que te j****, Ben Affleck"".

CHARLIZE THERON

La actriz y Weinstein trabajaron juntos en varias películas, como Las normas de la casa de la sidra. En un comunicado enviado a BuzzFeed este martes, aseguró que ""desafortunadamente"" no podía decir que se sorprendiera. ""Esta cultura ha existido siempre, no sólo en Hollywood sino en todo el mundo. Y muchos hombres con puestos de poder han campado a sus anchas durante mucho tiempo. No podemos culpar a las víctimas"", apostilló.

JAMIE LEE CURTIS

La actriz escribió un artículo para el HuffPost el 10 de octubre en el que criticaba las palabras de la diseñadora Donna Karan y en el que aseguraba que había sufrido sus propias ""versiones, privadas y personales, de acoso sexual en el trabajo"". ""¿Lo pedí? No. Lo único que pedí fue un trabajo, y lo que vino con ese trabajo fue el acoso sexual"", reflexionaba.

LINDSAY LOHAN

La actriz y cantante ha sido una de las pocas defensoras del productor. ""Me siento muy mal por Harvey Weinstein"", aseguró a través de Instagram Stories. ""No creo que lo que está pasando esté bien"". En su publicación, que después borró pero circula por internet, escribió el nombre del productor junto a un emoji con halo de santo.

LEONARDO DICAPRIO

El actor, que ha participado en varias películas de Weinstein como Gangs of New York, El aviador y Django Desencadenado, también ha recurrido a Facebook para expresarse. Este miércoles 11 escribió: ""No hay excusa para el acoso y el abuso sexual, sin importar quién eres ni qué profesión tienes. Aplaudo la fuerza y el coraje de las mujeres que han dado un paso al frente y han hecho que su voz se escuche"".

TOM HANKS

El actor nunca ha trabajado con Weinstein pero no se ha cortado a la hora de opinar sobre su disculpa. ""Oh, bueno, crecí en los 60 y los 70 y por lo tanto...' Yo también. Creo que se trata de qué es lo que quieres desde esa posición de poder. Conozco a todo tipo de personas a las que les encanta machacar o hacerle la vida imposible a sus subalternos porque pueden hacerlo"", señaló en una entrevista en The New York Times el miércoles 11. ""No soy la primera persona que dice que Harvey es un poco cabrón"".

PENÉLOPE CRUZ

La actriz española —que ganó el Oscar a Mejor actriz de reparto por Vicky Cristina Barcelona, producida por The Weinstein Company— señaló este 12 de octubre que las informaciones sobre el productor aparecidas en los últimos días la habían dejado ""extremadamente triste y asombrada"".

""Hemos trabajado juntos en diferentes películas e, incluso si él ha sido respetuoso conmigo y personalmente nunca he sido testigo de ese tipo de actitudes, necesito expresar mi apoyo a las mujeres que han tenido esas horribles experiencias"", señaló. Cruz recalcó que ""ese tipo de abuso de poder es absolutamente inaceptable"".

RYAN GOSLING

El actor recurrió a Twitter este jueves, donde señaló que, como la mayor parte de Hollywood, había trabajado con el productor. ""Estoy profundamente decepcionado conmigo por estar tan ajeno a estas devastadoras experiencias de acoso sexual y abuso [...] Los hombres deben apoyar a las mujeres y trabajar juntos hasta que haya verdadera responsabilidad y cambio"", apuntó.

OLIVER STONE

El director de cine Oliver Stone aseguró el viernes 13 que ""no es fácil por lo que está pasando"" Harvey Weinstein. ""Creo que un hombre no debería ser condenado por un sistema de justicieros [...] He oído historias de terror sobre casi todo el mundo en este negocio, así que no voy a comentar sobre chismorreos"", añadió.

QUENTIN TARANTINO

Había expectación por conocer la reacción del director, cuya filmografía ha sido producida por Weinstein. No ha hablado directamente, sino que se ha expresado a través de la actriz Amber Tamblyn. ""Anoche cené con mi amigo Quentin Tarantino. Me ha pedido que comparta con vosotros una declaración respecto a Harvey Weinstein"", publicó ésta en Twitter el 13 de octubre. ""En la última semana he asistido conmocionado y descorazonado a las revelaciones que han salido a la luz sobre mi amigo desde hace 25 años, Harvey Weinstein. Necesito unos cuantos días más para procesar el dolor, las emociones, la rabia y los recuerdos y, entonces, hablaré públicamente sobre ello"".

EMMA THOMPSON

En una entrevista en BBC2 este viernes, la actriz llamó a Weinstein ""depredador"". ""Uno de los grandes problemas del sistema que tenemos es que hay demasiados ojos ciegos y no podemos seguir haciendo responsables a las mujeres a las que les pasa esto"", añadió. ""Pasé mi veintena tratando de sacar la lengua de los viejos de mi boca porque pensaban: 'Bueno, ella está dispuesta'. Así que imagino que eso ocurre muy frecuentemente y quizá éste es un momento en el que podemos decir a hombres y mujeres: '¡Abrid vuestros ojos y vuestras bocas y decid algo!"".

REACCIONES POLÍTICAS

El escándalo ha sobrepasado Hollywood y ha entrado en la esfera política. Hillary Clinton y su partido recibieron dinero del productor para su campaña electoral. Clinton envió un comunicado a la CNN este miércoles 11 en el que asegura estar ""impactada y paralizada"". ""El comportamiento descrito por las mujeres que le han denunciado no puede ser tolerado. Su valentía y el apoyo de los demás es fundamental para ayudar a frenar este tipo de actitudes"", añadió.

El expresidente Barack Obama y su mujer, Michelle, han afirmado, también a través de un comunicado, que se declaran ""disgustados"". ""Cualquier hombre que degrada a las mujeres de tal manera debe ser condenado y responsabilizado, independientemente de su riqueza o estatus"", añaden.

¿Y LA MUJER DE WEINSTEIN?

El escándalo también ha tenido consecuencias en la vida personal de Weinstein. Su mujer, Georgina Chapman —de 41 años y diseñadora y fundadora de la firma Marchesa— lo ha dejado. ""Mi corazón se rompe por todas las mujeres que han sufrido un daño terrible por sus imperdonables acciones. He decidido dejar a mi marido. Cuidar de mis hijos pequeños es mi prioridad"", apuntó en un comunicado publicado en People este martes 10.

On World Mental Health Day, We Must Commit To Fair Funding For Mental Health Care Mental health is on the TV. On the radio. In the tabloids, in the broadsheets, in the magazines. Online. Mental health is on everyone's lips; Prime Ministers and future kings. Mental health is what everyone seems to be talking about. It's time to talk. It's good to talk. That really is something to celebrate. We are all talking about mental health - and yet ... and yet the talk is increasingly of crisis. We must ring-fence mental health spending to close the gap between the rhetoric of parity and the reality of cuts on the front-line. We must keep talking. But if we want to see real equality for mental health now is the time for action. Labour and Co-operative MP for Liverpool Wavertree, President of Labour’s Campaign for Mental Health

No Hope For Young People From Hapless Hammond The reality is that young people in this country have felt the brunt of seven years of Tory austerity. Rising house prices, slow economic growth, and a lack of stable employment have entrenched huge economic inequality between the younger and older generations. Under the Conservatives, the levels of debt young people find themselves in has risen dramatically. The decision to triple tuition fees and end grants for students attending university now means that young people are leaving university with on average £40,000 worth of debt. Labour MP for Bootle and Shadow Chief Sec to the Treasury

Only Labour Can Deliver The Transport Investment Britain Needs The Conservatives are refusing to say precisely where the £400 million of transport investment will be spent.

Help To Buy Will Help To Bury Home Ownership, And The Tories' Hopes For A Political Resurgence With It Tackling the housing crisis will take time, reform won't deliver immediate benefits and will need longer than one parliamentary term to make a real difference. Yet instead of offering the bold reform needed the Conservatives have gone for the easy option. But Help to Buy is not the answer, instead it will help to bury the next generation's aspirations for home ownership and the Tories' hopes for a political resurgence with it.

The Conservatives Have Run Out Of Ideas Of How To Repair Our Broken Justice System Crisis after crisis rocked the justice system this summer.

The Road To Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions On the face of it, Universal Credit is a good idea. The benefits system is ridiculously complex, simplifying it is common sense. Except people are not simple, they don't fit into boxes. My sister-in-law and my brother could not have more different needs, experiences and circumstances. The idea that one (fairly inflexible) thing could simply suit them both is a system designed by someone who has not met a very broad range of people.

The Roaring Lion And The Dutiful Public Servant: Johnson And May's Wildly Different Views Of Brexit Britain In her speech, Theresa May said that ""the Tories must win the battle of ideas again."" But perhaps it is not only the Tories that must win the battle of ideas within the nation, but within their own party. For in this moment, these two competing ideas of post-Brexit Britain, the lion and the servant cannot sustain the standoff.

Sure, tampons and menstrual cups exist, but some women either can't or don't feel comfortable using them.

Aussie underwear label Modibodi has identified this issue and created a collection of period swimwear to solve this issue.

The brand is well known for its leak-free absorbent knickers used in place of other menstruation products and the same theory applies to the new swim range. Their knickers work by absorbing menstrual flow, with different styles holding either one or two tampons worth of fluid. The clever fabric used absorbs fluid and locks it away so you don't feel damp and the moisture-wicking layer draws sweat and discharge away from the source and fights bacteria.

The swimwear works similarly, like this: the outer fabric has a special treatment that means it is water repellent, this means water is prevented from coming through the swimsuit. The water beads off the fabric and practically dries instantly as you get out of the water, meaning no leaks coming through. Clever, right?!

Inside the garment is the gusset that features the patent-pending technology, 'Modifier Swim Technology'. The top layer of the gusset absorbs fluid (holding up to 10ml or one tampon of fluid) from the body and locks it into the inner layer, the inner layer locks fluid and the next layer stops the leak through the garment. The garments are perfect for pelvic floor issues too and are also great for light periods and spotting.

""We are very excited to be launching a revolutionary swimwear range, Kristy Chong, Modibodi Founder said in a brand statement.

""Having launched a line of fashionable, hi-tech underwear successfully into the market, our customers started to ask us for a solution for swimming as 1 in 2 young girls will not swim on her period for fear of a leak. So we did some category research and it became very clear the swimwear industry lacked innovation and there were no other swimsuit brands on the market that could provide protection fused with fashion, so we decided to change that.""

Calls to the dedicated phone number for Universal Credit cost up to 55p per minute from some mobiles, while calls to an HMRC number for self-described tax avoiders cost up to 40p per minute.

Labour’s shadow treasury chief secretary Peter Dowd accused the government of being “on the side of tax dodgers and not hard working families”.

HuffPost UK Calls to the Universal Credit helpline cost claimants up to 55p per minute, more than tax avoiders calling HMRC

It comes as the government on Thursday was forced into an embarrassing backtrack after admitting Universal Credit claimants did need to call a costly helpline to receive welfare payments.

That admission followed just a day after the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said claimants could manage accounts entirely online, and only after HuffPost UK confronted officials with detailed accounts of hardship caused by phone fees.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged Theresa May at Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions to “show humanity” and scrap the call fees, a move Downing Street has thus far resisted.

But now HuffPost has found those who describe themselves as tax avoiders and wish to discuss their tax status with HMRC are asked to call a special 0300 helpline.

0300 numbers count towards inclusive minutes on phone contracts, and cost up to 40p per minute for pay as you go users, according to a government call charge list.

HM Government 'Phone HMRC if you're in a tax avoidance scheme and want to leave,' the government's website advises

As an 0345 number, the Universal Credit helpline can count as inclusive minutes for phone contracts, and costs up to 55p per minute for pay as you go users.

Universal Credit claimants who contacted HuffPost this week said they couldn’t afford a monthly phone contract with inclusive minutes, or didn’t have good enough credit to apply for one.

Dowd, MP for Bootle, said: “The stark contrast between the amount HMRC charges for tax avoiders calling for advice and families who are struggling to access Universal Credit is sadly indicative of this out of touch Conservative Government, who find themselves once again on the side of tax dodgers and not hard working families.”

In an earlier defence of the call fees, a spokesperson for the prime minister said there was an option for a callback “straight away” for those Universal Credit claimants concerned about costs.

But HuffPost revealed on Wednesday how the request of a call back “straight away” was refused after a reporter who tested the helpline spent 12 and a half minutes of waiting on hold.

After eventually reaching an advisor, the reporter was told an immediate call back was not possible due to data protection rules.

In the end, the 12-and-a-half minute call would have cost as much as £7.51 to someone calling from a mobile.

That’s more than 11 percent of the weekly allowance of someone aged under 25 without children.

And claimants have said they are forced to rely on the helpline to set up accounts and make simple changes to appointments.

Donna Plant, 33, from Walsall told HuffPost: “To do anything, to set up, to make an appointment you have to ring the Universal Credit line.

“If you can’t attend an appointment you have to ring the helpline.

“The job centre don’t really do anything any more. There is no other option.”

Letters sent to people requesting them to call the helpline and seen by HuffPost do not outline alternative options to manage Universal Credit accounts.

Many said they had got rid of landline phones, which provide cheaper call rates but often require line rental, in a bid to cut costs.

And the head of the Public and Commerical Services Union Mark Serwotka told BBC Radio 4′s World at One that job centre closures were making matters worse.

“What I am absolutely against is that you make assumptions that everybody can use the technology, or use the telephone lines, often where there are huge delays aside from the cost,” Serwotka said.

A spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said: “Most people claim Universal Credit online, but for those who want to call us, they are charged at local rates which are free for many people as part of their call package. People can request a call back at no charge.”",Universal Credit Claimants Charged More Than Tax Avoiders To Call Government,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/universal-credit-claimants-charged-more-for-helpline-than-tax-avoiders_n_18260316.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&amp;ir=UK

As a general principle, I don't like bans.

I don't like diktats, whether from courts or governments banning what I can eat, what I can drink or what books I can read or what I do in my bedroom.

In that vein, I don't like the Supreme Court telling me I can't buy fireworks for my Diwali even if it's only in Delhi NCR.

But what I like even less is twisting that story into being one of Hindu victimhood in their own country.

If there's a victim during Diwali, it's those with pulmonary diseases, it's those children with asthma, it's the elderly, it's street dogs and house pets. Actually it's everyone breathing in the smoky air heavy with particulate matter.

Now thanks to the noxious Diwali debate spurred by the Supreme Court argument, particulate matter has acquired a religion.

Writer Chetan Bhagat has fanned the flames.

Can I just ask on cracker ban. Why only guts to do this for Hindu festivals? Banning goat sacrifice and Muharram bloodshed soon too? — Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) October 9, 2017

Banning crackers on Diwali is like banning Christmas trees on Christmas and goats on Bakr-Eid. Regulate. Don't ban. Respect traditions. — Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) October 9, 2017

First off, it's not true that only Hindus burst firecrackers during Diwali. This is not a ban on Diwali, not even a sideways ban and to present it as such is plain mischief-mongering.

Secondly, there's a ban on sales, not on bursting crackers.

Third, the court has made it clear it's a one-time experiment for now to see if the ban has any impact on the air pollution. It said, ""We are of the view that the (November 2016) order suspending the licences should be given one chance... to find out whether there would be (a) positive effect of this suspension, particularly during (the) Diwali period.""

One could have legitimately raised many extremely valid concerns about this ruling without a knee-jerk communal bonfire.

Is this a case of judicial overreach, the nanny state trying to dictate everything we do, on par with the mandatory national anthem in movie theatres?

Why have a ban instead of enforcing stronger regulation?

Can such a ban be really effective since there's no ban on bursting fireworks?

Will this encourage a blackmarket in fireworks?

All perfectly valid arguments and not unlike the debate about the efficacy of the Delhi government's famous odd-even scheme to combat vehicular pollution.

If we had the sense to self-regulate, to understand the importance of common sense moderation it would not come to this pass.

Instead it's boiled down to this.

Bloody hell, how dare the court say Hindus don't have a right to be choked and deafened?

No one is arguing about the pollution spike post Diwali. No one is really contesting the particulate matters numbers. No one is denying that it affects children and elderly and the asthmatic. That would be hard to do in a city already gasping with air purifiers.

Instead the argument that Bhagat makes is that this is for one day only. So just choke and bear it, whiny asthmatics?

Actually before Bhagat went down the Bakr-Id whataboutery route, he raised a perfectly valid point. ""Come up with innovations not bans,"" tweeted Bhagat. Could there not be innovative steps to combat pollution instead of banning sale of fireworks? All bans, even with the best of intentions, set problematic precedents, a sledgehammer approach to a complicated issue. But that's exactly the problem. If we had the sense to self-regulate, to understand the importance of common sense moderation it would not come to this pass. But instead we think bigger, louder, flashier is always better, PM levels be damned. When we communalise the issue we make even less room for moderation. Thus when the court feels compelled to step in, it does so with a measure like this.

It's an open question whether this firework sale ban can be more than symbolic. But Jyoti Pande Lavakare, co-founder of Care for Air writes in Hindustan Times, that it is a ""tiny step"" but a great place to begin because ""it is a low-hanging fruit and relatively easier to enforce and control"" unlike burning of crop stubble, garbage or biomass.

Indeed one could also ask what's Diwali for everyone without a spike in asthma attacks?

The Bakhr-Eid whataboutery is an apples and oranges comparison. First off why assume that those who are troubled about firecracker pollution necessarily support wholescale animal slaughter? But the animal cruelty argument is different from particulate matter levels affecting the health of all strata of society. In that sense firecrackers are different from the Christmas trees of Christmas or the goats of Eid. If firecrackers were being burst all over the city at Diwali levels for Eid and the court refused to regulate it, that would be a valid point. But like all whataboutery it misses the larger point. Even if Eid rituals were problematic, is that any reason to persist in masochistically choking our lungs evermore each Diwali?

And speaking of whataboutery, it's ironic that those who insisted that the cattle market rules were all about environment and animal welfare and had nothing whatsoever to do with Muslims and eating beef, are now hellbent on insisting that the fireworks sales rules are all about Hindu festivals rather than particulate matter and environment.

""Ich war immer so gereizt, wenn das Meth alle war"", sagt mein Freund Jeremy.

""Wenn du es hast, musst du es weiter nehmen. Wenn du keins mehr hast, ist das wie ‚Okay, ich kann jetzt in mein Leben zurück'. Ich hab das ganze Wochenende nicht geschlafen und bin zu diesen Sexpartys und habe mich anschließend bis Mittwoch beschissen gefühlt. Vor ungefähr zwei Jahren bin ich auf Kokain umgestiegen, weil ich dann am nächsten Tag arbeiten konnte.""

Jeremy liegt im Krankenhaus, als er mir das erzählt. Er sagt nicht, wie es genau zu der Überdosis gekommen ist, nur dass ein Unbekannter den Krankenwagen gerufen hat und er hier aufgewacht ist.

""Die Drogen waren eine Kombination aus Langeweile und Einsamkeit""

Ich hätte nicht gedacht, dass ich mit meinem Freund Jeremy mal ein solches Gespräch führen würde. Bis vor ein paar Wochen hatte ich keine Ahnung, dass er härtere Drogen konsumiert als Martinis.

Er ist sportlich, intelligent, glutenfrei und trägt an jedem x-beliebigen Wochentag ein sauberes Hemd. Als ich ihn vor drei Jahren kennenlernte, wollte er wissen, wo man gut Crossfit machen kann.

""Die Drogen waren eine Kombination aus Langeweile und Einsamkeit"", sagt er. ""Freitagabend kam ich nach Hause, völlig k.o. von der Arbeit, und fragte mich: ‚Was jetzt?' Also hab ich rumtelefoniert, um mir Meth liefern zu lassen und im Internet Partys zu checken. Entweder das oder allein einen Film angucken.""

Jeremy ist nicht mein einziger schwuler Freund, der Probleme hat. Malcolm geht kaum aus dem Haus, weil er unter schweren Angstzuständen leidet. Wegen Jareds Depressionen beschränken sich seine sozialen Kontakte inzwischen auf mich, das Fitnessstudio und das Internet. Und da war Christian, der zweite Mann, den ich je geküsst habe und der sich mit 32 Jahren umbrachte, zwei Wochen nachdem sein Freund ihn verlassen hatte.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir sind das erste schwule Ehepaar, das in Deutschland ein Kind adoptiert hat: Hier ist unsere Botschaft an alle, die es uns nicht gönnen

Schon seit Jahren sehe ich, wie das Leben meiner heterosexuellen und meiner schwulen Freunde auseinanderdriftet. Die eine Hälfte meines sozialen Netzwerks hat sich in Familien und Vororte verabschiedet, die andere kämpft sich durch Isolation und Angstzustände, harte Drogen und riskanten Sex.

Depression, Einsamkeit und Drogen in der schwulen Gemeinde noch genauso verbreitet wie vor Jahrzehnten

Nichts davon passt zu dem, was ich mir vorgestellt hatte unter dem Leben eines schwulen Mannes. Genauso wenig wie ich wurde Jeremy von Gleichaltrigen gemobbt oder von seiner Familie abgelehnt. Er kann sich nicht mal daran erinnern, dass er je Schwuchtel genannt wurde.

Seine lesbische Mutter erzog ihn in einem Vorort an der Westküste. ""Sie outete sich mir gegenüber, als ich zwölf war"", sagt er. ""Und im nächsten Satz sagte sie, dass ich schwul bin. Mir war das damals selbst noch kaum klar.""

Jeremy und ich sind 34. In unserem Leben haben die Schwulen größere gesellschaftliche und rechtliche Akzeptanz erreicht als je zuvor. In meiner eigenen Teenagerzeit war die Homo-Ehe ein ferner Traum, von den Zeitungen in Gänsefüßchen gesetzt. Heute ist sie höchstrichterlich abgesegnet.

Die gesellschaftliche Zustimmung zur Homo-Ehe ist von 27 Prozent im Jahr 1996 auf 61 Prozent im Jahr 2016 gestiegen. In der Popkultur sind schwule Figuren so alltäglich, dass sie sogar Fehler haben dürfen.

Trotzdem - während wir Ausmaß und Tempo dieses Wandels feiern, sind Depression, Einsamkeit und Drogen in der schwulen Gemeinde noch genauso verbreitet wie vor Jahrzehnten. Je nach Studie ist die Suizidrate bei Schwulen zwei- bis zehnmal so hoch wie bei Heteros. Depressive Phasen gibt es bei uns doppelt so häufig.

Laut einer Untersuchung unter schwulen Männern, die erst seit kurzem in New York wohnen, litten drei Viertel von ihnen unter Angstattacken oder Depressionen, nahmen Drogen oder Alkohol oder praktizierten ungeschützten Sex. Auch wenn wir dauernd von ""Wahlfamilien"" sprechen, haben schwule Männer nicht so viele enge Freunde wie Heteros oder lesbische Frauen.

In den Niederlanden leiden Homosexuelle dreimal so oft an affektiven Störungen wie Heterosexuelle

Ich will nicht so tun, als sei ich objektiv. Ich bin ein zeitweise allein lebender Schwuler, in einer normalen Kleinstadt von Eltern erzogen, die in einem Verein von Angehörigen Homosexueller organisiert waren.

Niemand in meiner Bekanntschaft starb an Aids. Ich bin nie direkt diskriminiert worden und habe mich in einer Welt geoutet, in der Heirat, Jägerzaun und ein Golden Retriever für einen homosexuellen Mann nicht nur erreichbare Ziele waren, sondern geradezu von ihm erwartet wurden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir haben überprüft, was das AfD-Wahlprogramm Homosexuellen zu bieten hat - das Ergebnis war sogar schlimmer als erwartet

""Für manche Schwule waren die Homo-Ehe und die Gesetzesänderungen eine Verbesserung"", befindet Christopher Stults. Er untersucht an der New York University die Unterschiede in der seelischen Gesundheit von Schwulen und Heterosexuellen. ""Viele andere aber waren enttäuscht. Jetzt haben wir diesen rechtlichen Status erreicht, und doch haben sich nicht alle Erwartungen erfüllt.""

Nicht nur Amerikaner kennen dieses Gefühl der Leere. In den Niederlanden existiert die Homo-Ehe seit 2001, und trotzdem leiden Homosexuelle dreimal so oft an affektiven Störungen wie Heterosexuelle, und ""Selbstverletzungen in suizidaler Absicht"" treten bei ihnen zehnmal so häufig auf.

In Schweden gibt es eingetragene Partnerschaften seit 1995 und die gleichberechtigte Ehe seit 2009, aber bei Männern, die mit Männern verheiratet sind, ist die Suizidrate dreimal so hoch wie bei Männern, die mit Frauen verheiratet sind.

All diese schwer erträglichen Statistiken führen zur selben Schlussfolgerung: Wenn man sich als Mann zu anderen Männern hingezogen fühlt, riskiert man auch heute noch eine gefährliche Entfremdung. Die gute Nachricht: Epidemiologen und Sozialwissenschaftler verstehen die Gründe mittlerweile besser denn je.

Travis Salway, Forscher am Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, befasst sich seit fünf Jahren mit der Frage, warum schwule Männer sich immer noch umbringen.

""Früher waren schwule Männer einsam, weil sie sich nicht outen konnten"", sagt er. ""Aber heute haben sich Millionen Schwule geoutet, und sie fühlen sich noch genauso isoliert.""

Schwule Männer wurden aus ihren Familien verstoßen, ihr Liebesleben war verboten

Wir treffen uns zum Mittagessen in einer winzigen Nudelbar. Es ist November, und er trägt Jeans, Überschuhe und einen Ehering. ""Schwule Ehe?"", frage ich.

""Sogar monogam"", sagt er.

Salway wuchs in Celina, Ohio, auf, einer abgetakelten Industriestadt mit etwa 10.000 Einwohnern, in der bei den 21-Jährigen die Ehe mit dem College konkurrierte. Er wurde schon als schwul beschimpft, bevor es ihm selbst klar war.

""Ich war feminin und sang im Chor"", sagt er. ""Das genügte."" Die meiste Zeit in der Highschool hatte er eine Freundin und vermied Beziehungen mit Jungen, bis er weggehen konnte.

Gegen Ende der Nullerjahre war er Sozialarbeiter und Epidemiologe, und der zunehmende Abstand zwischen heterosexuellen und schwulen Freunden irritierte ihn ebenso wie mich. Gab es vielleicht noch mehr als das, was man über schwule Männer und seelische Gesundheit bis dahin angenommen hatte?

In den 50er- und 60er-Jahren trat die Disparität erstmals zutage, und die Ärzte hielten sie für ein Symptom der Homosexualität an sich, für eine von vielen Erscheinungsformen des damals als ""sexuelle Inversion"" bekannten Phänomens. Als die Schwulenbewegung Fahrt aufnahm, wurde die Homosexualität aus der Liste der psychischen Defekte gestrichen und das Problem mit einem Trauma erklärt. Schwule Männer wurden aus ihren Familien verstoßen, ihr Liebesleben war verboten. Selbstverständlich erreichten ihre Depressionen und Suizidraten beunruhigende Level.

""So schätzte ich das auch ein"", sagt Salway, ""dass der schwule Suizid Produkt einer früheren Zeit war oder vor allem bei Jugendlichen auftrat, die keinen anderen Ausweg sahen.""

Dann nahm er sich die Daten vor. Das Problem war nicht nur die Selbsttötung, und sie trat nicht nur bei Teenagern auf, nicht nur in Gegenden mit grassierender Homophobie.

Er stellte fest, dass Schwule überall und in jedem Alter häufiger an Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen, Krebs, Sexsucht, Erektionsstörungen, Allergien, Asthma und vielen anderen Erkrankungen leiden. In Kanada sterben seit Jahren mehr Schwule an Suizid als an Aids.

Vom Stress, ständig darauf gefasst zu sein, diskriminiert zu werden

""Es gibt schwule Männer, die nie sexuell oder physisch angegriffen worden sind und an ähnlichen posttraumatischen Belastungsstörungen leiden wie Menschen, die Kampfsituationen oder Vergewaltigungen erlebt haben"", sagt Alex Keuroghlian, Psychiater am Fenway Institute's Center for Population Research in LGBT Health.

Schwule Männer sind darauf ""geeicht, Diskriminierung zu erwarten"", glaubt Keuroghlian. Ununterbrochen scannen wir unser Umfeld, ob wir vielleicht herausfallen. Wir kämpfen um Selbstbehauptung. Wir spielen uns unsere sozialen Fehlschläge in einer Endlosschleife vor.

Am meisten aber erstaunt bei diesen Symptomen die Tatsache, dass wir sie im Allgemeinen nicht einmal als Symptome wahrnehmen. Seit er sich mit diesen Daten befasst, interviewt Salway schwule Männer, die einen Suizidversuch überlebt haben.

""Wenn man sie fragt, warum sie sich das Leben nehmen wollten, erwähnen die meisten ihre Homosexualität gar nicht."" Stattdessen erzählen sie ihm von Beziehungsproblemen, beruflichen Problemen, finanziellen Problemen. ""Sie nehmen ihre Sexualität nicht als entscheidenden Faktor in ihrem Leben wahr. Und doch ist ihre Suizidrate zehnmal so hoch.""

Dieses Phänomen wird in der Wissenschaft mit dem ""Minderheitenstressmodell"" beschrieben. In seiner direktesten Form ist es ziemlich einfach: Die Zugehörigkeit zu einer Randgruppe bringt zusätzliche Anstrengungen mit sich.

Als einzige Frau in einem geschäftlichen Meeting oder als einziger Schwarzer im Studentenwohnheim muss man sich viel mehr Gedanken machen als die Angehörigen der Mehrheit. Wenn man sich gegen den Chef wehrt oder aber es nicht tut, entspricht man dann den Klischees über Frauen am Arbeitsplatz?

Wenn man einen Test verhaut, denken die Leute dann, dass es an der Rasse liegt? Selbst wenn man nicht offen stigmatisiert wird, hinterlassen diese fortwährenden Grübeleien auf die Dauer ihre Spuren.

Die ganze Ablehnung spielte sich nur in meinem Kopf ab

John Pachankis forscht in Yale über Stress. Seiner Ansicht nach entsteht die Störung in den etwa fünf Jahren zwischen der Entdeckung der eigenen Sexualität und dem Zeitpunkt, wenn wir mit anderen darüber sprechen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Der Schein trügt: Hasskriminalität gegen Lesben und Schwule nimmt stetig zu

In dieser Zeit wirken sich sogar relativ unbedeutende Stresssituationen unverhältnismäßig stark aus - nicht weil sie traumatisch wären, sondern weil wir uns darauf einstellen, dass sie passieren. ""Du musst nicht mal schwul genannt werden, damit du dein Verhalten so anpasst, dass dir das nicht passiert"", sagt Salway.

So war es auch in meiner Teenie-Zeit: immer auf der Hut, bloß nichts Falsches sagen, immer im Stress, immer überkompensieren. Als ich in einem Erlebnisbad mit einem Schulfreund an der Wasserrutsche wartete, erwischte er mich, wie ich ihn anstarrte.

""Alter, was glotzt du mich an?"" Ich konnte gerade noch ablenken, so was wie ""Sorry, du bist nicht mein Typ"", aber in den Wochen danach quälte mich der Gedanke, was er wohl über mich dachte. Dabei kam er nie darauf zurück. Die ganze Ablehnung spielte sich nur in meinem Kopf ab.

Das Heranwachsen als Schwuler ist ähnlich belastend wie das Heranwachsen in extremer Armut

""Das eigentliche Trauma für Schwule ist die lange Zeitdauer"", sagt William Elder, Traumaforscher und Psychologe. ""Bei einem einzelnen Trauma erleidet man eine posttraumatische Belastungsstörung, die in einem halben Jahr Therapie geheilt werden kann.

Aber wenn man jahrelang immer wieder kleine stressige Situationen erlebt und sich dann jedes Mal fragt: War das jetzt wegen meiner Sexualität?, kann das den Effekt sogar noch intensivieren."" Wer seine Homosexualität versteckt, ist laut Elder in der Lage eines Menschen, dem immer wieder leicht auf den Arm geschlagen wird.

Am Anfang ist er genervt. Nach einiger Zeit ist er wütend. Schließlich kann er an nichts anderes mehr denken.

Und dann baut sich der Stress im Körper auf, weil man sich Tag für Tag damit beschäftigt.

Anscheinend ist das Heranwachsen als Schwuler ähnlich belastend wie das Heranwachsen in extremer Armut.

Nach einer Untersuchung von 2015 produzieren Schwule weniger von dem stressregulierenden Hormon Cortisol. Ihr Organismus war in ihrer Adoleszenz ständig so aktiv, dass sie als Erwachsene träge werden, sagt Katie McLaughlin, eine der Autorinnen der Studie.

Unter Männern herrscht ein rauer Ton, das ist bei Schwulen nicht anders

2014 wurden die kardiovaskulären Risikofaktoren von hetero- und homosexuellen Jugendlichen verglichen. Dabei stellte sich heraus, dass die schwulen Kids nicht mehr Stresssituationen ausgesetzt waren - dass also auch heterosexuelle Jugendliche Probleme haben -, dass diese ihr Nervensystem aber stärker schädigten.

Sogar Salway, der sich gründlich mit dem Minderheitenstress befasst, fühlt sich manchmal unwohl, wenn er mit seinem Partner durch Vancouver schlendert.

Noch nie ist er angegriffen worden, aber irgendwelche Idioten haben ihn in der Öffentlichkeit mal beschimpft. So etwas muss nur ein paar Mal passieren, und schon wartet man darauf und schlägt das Herz etwas schneller, sobald sich ein Auto nähert.

Unter Männern herrscht ein rauer Ton, das ist bei Schwulen nicht anders. Im Gegenteil.

Mit Minderheitenstress allein lassen die vielfältigen Gesundheitsprobleme schwuler Männer sich jedoch nicht erklären. Tatsächlich kommt es zur ersten Schädigung, während sie sich verstecken, die zweite und vielleicht gravierendere kommt aber erst danach.

Auch in der schwulen Community lauern Diskriminierungen

Jahrzehnte hindurch nahmen Psychologen an, dass die entscheidenden Phasen in der Bildung der schwulen Identität zum Coming-out führen und dass wir, wenn wir uns in unserer Haut endlich wohlfühlen, unser Leben aufbauen können, gemeinsam mit Menschen, die die gleichen Erfahrungen gemacht haben.

Die Forschung der letzten zehn Jahre zeigt jedoch, dass der Kampf um Anpassung sogar noch heftiger wird. Nach einer Untersuchung von 2015 leiden Männer, die sich kurz vorher geoutet hatten, stärker an Ängsten und Depressionen als solche, die ihre Homosexualität noch verstecken. Denn auch in der schwulen Community lauern Diskriminierungen.

Jeder Schwule, den ich kenne, trägt ein Päckchen mit all den Fiesheiten, die andere Schwule ihm gesagt oder angetan haben. Als ich mal zu einem Date kam, stand der Typ sofort auf, als er mich sah, warf mir vor, dass ich kleiner sei als auf meinen Fotos, und ging. Alex, Fitnesstrainer in Seattle, bekam von einem Mitglied seines Schwimmteams zu hören:

""Ich bin bereit, über dein Gesicht hinwegzusehen, wenn du mich ohne Kondom fickst."" Martin, ein Brite in Portland, hat etwa fünf Kilo zugenommen, seit er da wohnt, und - an Weihnachten - bekam er über Grindr diese Nachricht: ""Du warst immer so sexy. Schade, dass du das versaut hast.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Du bist eine Schande und deine Freundin ein Dämon"" - was ich erlebte, als ich auf Instagram zeigte, dass ich eine Frau liebe

In anderen Minderheiten werden Ängste und Depressionen durch die Unterstützung der Community weniger. Die Nähe zu Menschen, von denen man sich instinktiv verstanden weiß, ist hilfreich. Bei uns dagegen ist das Gegenteil der Fall.

Mehrere Studien haben gezeigt, dass die Tendenz zu ungeschütztem Sex und Meth steigt, das Engagement für Ehrenämter oder Sport dagegen sinkt, wenn man in einem schwulen Viertel wohnt. Aus einer Untersuchung von 2009 geht hervor, dass Schwule, die eng mit ihrer schwulen Community verbunden sind, mit ihren eigenen Liebesbeziehungen weniger zufrieden sind.

Schwule Männer behandeln sich gegenseitig mies, weil wir Männer sind

""Schwule und bisexuelle Männer bezeichnen die schwule Community als großen Stressfaktor"", sagt John Pachankis, der in Yale zu genderbezogenen Krankheiten forscht. Der Hauptgrund sei, dass die Diskriminierung innerhalb der Gruppe die Psyche stärker schädige als die Zurückweisung durch Angehörige der Mehrheit.

Wenn man von Heterosexuellen zurückgewiesen wird, kann man leicht darüber hinwegsehen, man kann mit den Augen rollen oder ihnen den Mittelfinger zeigen - man braucht ihre Anerkennung ja nicht. Die Ablehnung durch andere Schwule tut mehr weh, weil man diese Leute stärker braucht.

Die Forscher, mit denen ich gesprochen habe, gehen davon aus, dass Schwule sich aus zwei Gründen häufig verletzen. Der Hauptgrund, der auch am häufigsten genannt wird, ist, dass schwule Männer sich gegenseitig mies behandeln, weil wir Männer sind.

""In einer Gemeinschaft von Männern wird Männlichkeit besonders herausgefordert"", sagt Pachankis. ""Männlichkeit ist ein flüchtiges Gut. Sie muss ständig inszeniert oder verteidigt oder eingefordert werden. Wenn die Männlichkeit infrage gestellt wird, kann man sehen, wie dumm Männer darauf reagieren. Sie nehmen aggressive Posen ein, stürzen sich in finanzielle Risiken, wollen Sachen zerschlagen.""

Bei femininen Schwulen sind Suizid, Einsamkeit und psychische Krankheiten noch weiter verbreitet

So lässt sich auch die allgegenwärtige Stigmatisierung femininer Männer in der schwulen Community besser verstehen. Dane Whicker, klinischer Psychologe und Forscher an der Duke University, hat herausgefunden, dass sich die meisten schwulen Männer für maskuline Männer interessieren und selbst möglichst maskulin auftreten möchten.

Das könnte daran liegen, dass maskuline Männer historisch in der heterosexuellen Gesellschaft geringere Probleme hatten. Vielleicht haben wir es aber auch mit verinnerlichter Homophobie zu tun: Feminine Schwule werden stereotyp immer noch als Bottom, als rezeptiver Partner beim Analverkehr, gesehen.

Bei femininen Schwulen sind Suizid, Einsamkeit und psychische Krankheiten denn auch weiter verbreitet. Maskuline Schwule wiederum leiden mehr unter Ängsten, neigen zu ungeschütztem Sex und greifen öfter zu Drogen und Tabak.

Während die Schwulenbars verschwinden, treffen sich auf Grindr immer mehr

Der zweite Grund, warum die schwule Gemeinde ihre Mitglieder so sehr stresst, hat nicht mit dem Warum unserer wechselseitigen Ablehnung zu tun, sondern mit dem Wie. In den letzten zehn Jahren sind die traditionellen schwulen Treffpunkte - Bars, Nachtclubs, Saunen - nach und nach verschwunden, an ihre Stelle sind die sozialen Medien getreten.

Mindestens 70 Prozent der homosexuellen Männer nutzen heute Dating-Apps wie Grindr oder Scruff. Im Jahr 2000 lernten sich etwa 20 Prozent der schwulen Paare online kennen. 2010 waren es bis zu 70 Prozent. Die Zahl der schwulen Paare, die sich durch Freunde gefunden haben, ist von 30 auf 12 Prozent gesunken.

Öfter liest man über die App Grindr, deren Nutzer sie durchschnittlich 90 Minuten am Tag verwenden, irgendwelche Horrorstorys in den Medien: über Mörder oder Homophobe, die hier ihre Opfer abschleppen.

Oder es geht um die beunruhigenden ""Chemsex-Partys"", die sich in Berlin, London und New York ausbreiten. Und ja, das sind Probleme. Die eigentliche Wirkung der Apps aber ist stiller, unauffälliger, und sie geht in mancher Hinsicht auch tiefer: Viele von uns kommunizieren hauptsächlich auf diesem Weg mit anderen Schwulen.

Diese Apps vermitteln uns nachdrücklich das Gefühl, hässlich zu sein

Das Schlimmste an den Apps jedoch und der Grund, warum sie sich so unterschiedlich auf die Gesundheit von schwulen bzw. heterosexuellen Männern auswirken, ist nicht nur, dass wir sie so intensiv nutzen. Vielmehr eignen sie sich fast perfekt dazu, unsere negative Selbstwahrnehmung noch zu verschärfen.

Der Traumaforscher Elder führte im Jahr 2015 Interviews mit Schwulen und fand heraus, dass 90 Prozent seiner Probanden einen Partner wollten, der groß, jung, weiß, muskulös und maskulin sein sollte. Die meisten von uns entsprechen kaum einem dieser Kriterien, geschweige denn allen fünf, und so vermitteln diese Apps uns nachdrücklich das Gefühl, hässlich zu sein.

Das alles ist natürlich nicht neu. Der seit den Achtzigern mit gesellschaftlicher Isolation befasste Psychologe Walt Odets erklärt, schwule Männer hätten an den Saunen genauso gelitten wie heute an Grindr. Doch bei seinen jüngeren Patienten sieht er diesen Unterschied:

""Wenn man in der Sauna von jemandem abgelehnt wurde, konnte man anschließend immer noch mit ihm darüber reden. Vielleicht konnte daraus eine Freundschaft werden oder wenigstens eine positive soziale Erfahrung. Bei den Apps wird man einfach weggedrückt, wenn man nicht als sexuell oder romantisch interessant wahrgenommen wird.""

Die Apps verstärken oder beschleunigen vielleicht auch nur die erwachsene Version der Hypothese, die Pachankis als ""Der beste kleine Junge auf der Welt"" bezeichnet. Wenn wir als Jugendliche unsere Sexualität verstecken, konzentrieren wir unser Selbstwertgefühl auf das, was die Außenwelt von uns will: gut sein im Sport, in der Schule etc.

Als Erwachsene drängen die sozialen Normen unserer eigenen Community uns, unser Selbstwertgefühl noch weiter zu konzentrieren: auf unser Aussehen, unsere Männlichkeit, unsere sexuellen Leistungen.

Aber selbst wenn wir hier wettbewerbsfähig sind, selbst wenn wir unser Ideal vom maskulinen dominanten Top erreichen - selbst dann haben wir uns in Wirklichkeit darauf konditioniert, dass wir am Boden zerstört sind, wenn wir ihm nicht mehr entsprechen, was unvermeidlich der Fall sein wird.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN - Interné dans une clinique en Europe? Ou au beau milieu de l'Arizona? Selon les dernières photos parues sur le site TMZ, Harvey Weinstein, le producteur star d'Hollywood serait en passe de commencer une cure de désintoxication au sexe dans un établissement spécialisé du sud-ouest des États-Unis.

Jeudi 11 octobre, dans un communiqué officiel, le producteur annonçait travailler avec des thérapeutes et planifier un retrait de sa vie professionnelle. ""Mon objectif désormais est d'apprendre sur moi et de maîtriser mes démons"", écrit-il.

La nouvelle de son admission en établissement spécialisé a soulevé de nombreuses critiques. L'actrice anglaise Emma Thompson interrogée sur la BBC s'est ainsi insurgée: ""Je ne pense pas qu'on puisse le décrire comme un addict au sexe, c'est un prédateur. C'est différent. Il est au sommet d'un système d'harcèlement, de dépréciation, d'intimidation et d'interférence. Cela fait partie de notre monde, du monde des femmes, depuis des temps immémmoriels.""

""Les addicts au sexe ne sont pas des agresseurs""

Cette possible défense du producteur est en effet assez bancale, voire dangereuse car elle entretient l'idée que les personnes souffrant de cette addiction sont forcément des agresseurs et qu'ils pourraient être de par la reconnaissance et le traitement de cette addiction, moins responsables de leurs actions.

Une personne addict au sexe peut être l'auteur d'agression sexuelle, une personne sans addiction peut l'être aussi.

Laurent Karila, psychiatre spécialisé en addictologie et qui dirige une consultation spécialisée sur le sujet à l'hôpital Brousse à Paris interrogé par Le HuffPost réitère avec force la même distinction que l'actrice anglaise. ""Les addicts au sexe ne sont pas des agresseurs. Cette addiction peut entraîner des troubles du comportement mais elle ne rend pas de fait agressif.""

Christine Barois, médecin psychiatre à Paris, interrogée dans Sud Ouest offre une comparaison très parlante pour démentir ce raccourci: ""Il y a une recherche de plaisir compulsif dans l'addiction sexuelle. Bien évidemment, elle peut pousser le malade à dépasser des barrières morales dans le seul but de combler son désir. Mais pour prendre un exemple simple, un alcoolique ne va pas dévaliser un magasin d'alcool juste parce qu'il a besoin de boire. Un homme accusé par des douzaines de femmes belles et célèbres d'agressions sexuelles n'a pas le profil d'un addict, mais celui d'un pervers"".

L'addiction au sexe n'est pas reconnue dans le manuel des troubles psychiatriques de l'American Psychiatric Association ni dans les classifications internationales malgré plusieurs tentatives de définitions. Cependant son existence est attestée et des consultations spécialisées comme celle de Laurent Karila existent désormais. Ce type d'addiction touche plus souvent les hommes que les femmes.

""Dans ce type de violences sexuelles, il ne s'agit pas de sexe, mais de pouvoir""

""L'addiction au sexe, modère cependant Laurent Karila, n'est jamais un problème isolé, elle peut se doubler de troubles dépressifs ou anxieux par exemple."" L'addiction au sexe se définit selon ces quatre critères: la perte de temps, des envies irrésistibles, une perte de contrôle et des conséquences sociales.

Dans le dernier livre de Laurent Karila, ""Tous addicts et après?"" aux éditions Flammarion, qu'il cosigne avec William Lowenstein, médecin interniste spécialisé en addictologie, un questionnaire d'évaluation de l'addiction sexuelle établi en 2012 est disponible. Il ne vise pas à diagnostiquer cette addiction mais à encourager à consulter un spécialiste si un patient se reconnaît dans au moins trois des questionnements:

Evaluez-vous avec l'outil PEACCE (adaptation en langue française par Laurent Karila) Trouvez-vous que vous êtes souvent préoccupé par des pensées sexuelles? (Pensées) Cachez-vous certains de vos comportements sexuels à votre entourage (partenaire de vie, famille, ami(e)s proches...)? (Entourage) Avez-vous déjà recherché de l'aide pour un comportement sexuel que vous n'appréciez pas de faire? (Aide) Est-ce que quelqu'un a déjà été heurté émotionnellement à cause de votre comportement sexuel? (Conséquences) Vous sentez-vous contrôlé par votre désir sexuel? (Contrôle) Vous sentez-vous triste après être passé à l'acte sexuellement (rapports sexuels, internet, autres)? (Emotions)

Tout peut déclencher un besoin de consommation de sexe expliquent les auteurs de ""Tous addicts et après?"", ""avoir terminé une grosse journée de travail, avoir gagné beaucoup d'argent, être angoissé, triste, avoir reçu une bonne ou bien une mauvaise nouvelle... Tout est possible, tout est ""prétexte"""".

Ainsi donc l'addiction d'Harvey Weinstein est avérée, le problème réside ailleurs. Ce n'est pas la quantité de partenaires avec lesquelles il a eu des rapports sexuels, ni ses envies permanentes de sexe, ni le fait que comme il le dit dans son communiqué officiel il ait essayé de se contrôler depuis un an sans y parvenir. Il a abusé de sa position de pouvoir pour pouvoir forcer des femmes à se soumettre à ses appétits sexuels.

""Dans ce type de violences sexuelles, il ne s'agit pas de sexe, mais de pouvoir"", assure la sexologue américaine spécialisée dans les traumatismes sexuels Samantha Manewitz interrogée par Slate.

Pour ses victimes, pour les personnes addicts au sexe et pour toute la société, les actions d'Harvey Weinstein relèvent de la justice, qu'il soit ou non interné pour addiction. Ses ""démons"" ne peuvent l'innocenter.

Barring the usual crop of ministerial statements and urgent questions, the only event which might set many sparks flying is Labour's Opposition day attack on the rollout of Universal Credit.

Frodeno den Hattrick perfekt machen, womöglich sogar in unter acht Stunden, was noch keinen auf Hawaii bisher gelang

Das Video oben zeigt, wie ihr das ZDF-Programm im Internet sehen könnt

Ironman-WM im Live-Stream: Auf Hawaii stellen sich Sportler aus den unterschiedlichsten Ländern dem härtesten Triathlon. Acht Stunden, vielleicht sogar weniger, vielleicht ein bisschen mehr. Immer am Limit und darüber.

Jan Frodeno ist bereit für ein epochales Rennen. Selbst eine Entscheidung auf den letzten Metern nach 3,8 Kilometern Schwimmen, 180,2 Kilometern Radfahren und 42,195 Kilometern Laufen könnte den Weltmeister von 2015 und 2016 nicht überraschen. 2017 will Frodeno den Hattrick perfekt machen, womöglich sogar in unter acht Stunden, was noch keinen auf Hawaii bisher gelang.

Sein erster Widersacher ist Sebastian Kienle, WM-Zweiter vor einem Jahr und Weltmeister 2014. Da gibt es aber auch einen Patrick Lange, den WM-Dritten von 2016 mit der Marathon-Rekordzeit von 2:39,45 Stunden.

Deutsche unter sich? Keineswegs. Frodeno und alle anderen rechnen auch mit Lionel Sanders. Kanadier und so extrem wie ein brutal schwerer Ironman mit Schwimmen im Pazifik, Radfahren und Laufen entlang von Lavafeldern mit dem gefürchteten Mumuku (heftige böige Winde) bei glühender Hitze in Romantik-Paradies Hawaii.

Drogen, Alkohol, kurz vorm Suizidversuch. Der 29-Jährige hat all das hinter sich gelassen, nun zählt er auch dank eigenwilliger Indoor-Trainingsmethoden zu einem der großen Herausforderer Frodenos.

Gewinnen wird keiner den Ironman auf Hawaii auf den ersten 3,8 Kilometern, vorentscheiden kann sich ein Rennen aber schon dort. Denn danach werden die starken Radfahrer, aber eher schwächeren Schwimmer wie Kienle oder Sanders, versuchen, davonzufahren oder das Tempo so hoch zu halten, dass der Konkurrenz beim Laufen die Kraft ausgeht. Vor einem Jahr fuhr keiner schneller als Boris Stein, am Ende landete der 32-Jährige auf Platz sieben.

Ces mesures adouciraient le quotidien d'un grand nombre de femmes, puisqu'elles occupent encore la majorité des emplois payés au salaire minimum.

La hausse d'Est en Ouest

Le premier ministre semble insensible au sort des travailleuses du Québec. Sa voisine l'Ontario, avec laquelle il fait front commun sur plusieurs dossiers comme la lutte aux changements climatiques ou les transferts en santé, a annoncé qu'elle irait de l'avant avec le salaire minimum à 15 $ en 2019. L'Alberta, elle, l'adoptera dès 2018. Le fait que des femmes dirigent ces provinces n'a sûrement pas nui à l'adoption de ces mesures; le Québec peut d'ailleurs faire beaucoup mieux en matière d'accessibilité des femmes à ce type de fonctions. Mais la question « femme-homme » ne constitue pas le seul facteur susceptible d'inciter les provinces à se doter de telles mesures progressistes. La Colombie-Britannique, dirigée par le néodémocrate John Horgan, a d'ailleurs emboîté le pas à l'Ontario et à l'Alberta par l'annonce, en août, d'une hausse similaire pour 2021. Le Québec, lui, reste fixé à 12,45 $ l'heure en 2020. Rien pour écrire à sa mère. Encore une fois, la rhétorique de l'Institut économique de Montréal et du Conseil du patronat a trouvé un bon écho auprès des têtes dirigeantes du parti libéral. Mais n'en déplaise à Philippe Couillard et à ses joyeux comparses qui viennent d'être reconduits dans leurs fonctions, augmenter le salaire minimum à 15 $ l'heure ne nuira pas au marché de l'emploi ; qu'on cesse donc de nous brandir cet épouvantail. Une telle mesure aura plutôt comme effet de stimuler l'économie, comme ce fut le cas en Colombie-Britannique où une augmentation de 28 % du salaire minimum a produit en 2010, selon l'Institut de recherche socio-économique (IRIS), un effet positif direct sur la consommation. De plus, contrairement aux prétentions des ténors néo-libéraux, aucune perte nette d'emploi n'a été constatée à la suite de cette hausse. On sait que le sujet est chaud aux États-Unis et c'est aussi à cette conclusion que sont arrivés, en 2014, plus de 600 économistes américains de l'Economic Policy Institute, qui compte dans ses rangs plusieurs prix Nobel.

En ce mois de l'histoire des femmes où on met de l'avant leur contribution exceptionnelle aux enjeux de société, ne conviendrait-il pas que les libéraux s'engagent résolument en faveur des moins nantis du Québec? Avec les surplus de 12 milliards engrangés par leur saccage en santé et services sociaux, il serait de bon aloi qu'ils accèdent aux demandes légitimes de celles et ceux qui envahiront les rues de Montréal demain.

Breast cancer has become so common that we are almost immune to hearing about it, until it strikes us. Being diagnosed with breast cancer is a shock, yet many women have successfully overcome early breast cancer and resumed healthy lives, despite the predictable ordeal of chemo, surgery and radiation, a.k.a 'poison, slice and burn'.

A lesser known fact is that for some women (25-30 percent) breast cancer returns at a later point in life -- even after 25 years or more. Even without breasts. The original breast cancer spreads (or metastasises) to another part of the body -- usually the bones, liver, lungs or brain.

However, some women are thrown in the deep end without any warning. Up to 10 percent of women are diagnosed upfront with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This was my fate two weeks after returning from taking my two children (then 10 and eight) to learn to ski in Canada.

No symptoms except for a slightly dimpled right breast. There was widespread distribution of (breast) cancer in my bones -- my skull, vertebrae, clavicle, ribs, spine, hips, femur and humerus -- not much left unscathed.

I had invasive lobular carcinoma. This kind of cancer is typically slow-growing and often goes under the radar, hence the importance of ultrasounds. I was totally shell shocked. I vividly recall trying to process the enormity of the diagnosis and the implications.

The prognosis flipped. Chemo or surgery were no longer viable options.

Death remains a taboo word. If cancer remains a stigma, death is even more so.

Unlike early breast cancer where the goal is to excavate and get rid of the cancer, treatment is lifelong. The aim is to contain it as best as possible, slow down the progression (to or in the other organs) and keep it stable.

Three days later I had my ovaries out -- this was the easiest decision of all -- one where I had some control. This cut off the fuel supply. I was screened for a clinical trial with all hopes pinned on this, but then failed the eligibility criteria.

The vulnerability experienced in the initial months was excruciating -- total loss of control and overwhelming fear. Scans are intimidating. A robotic voice commands, ""breathe in now"", ""hold"", ""breath out now"". No pleases or thank you's just commands which you unwittingly obey. Whilst not so daunting they still conjure up a total sense of helplessness as you await the next set of results -- to see if the cancer has spread further.

Fortunately, I started another clinical trial four months later after meeting my wonderful oncologist -- who will manage my cancer until we exhaust treatment options. I will never forget the words from another oncologist when first diagnosed:

""We can put out the flames but it will always smoulder... You will learn to live with cancer and... you will have to overcome the stigma of cancer.""

Simple as that. However, there is no choice. Death remains a taboo word. If cancer remains a stigma, death is even more so.

In some ways it is just oh-so liberating, but in other ways just so terrifying. What if I'm not here to see my children finish Year 12? Or Uni? To see them get married and have children. Worse still, who will look after them? Everyone says you must live in the present -- this is what cancer forces you to do. Again, there is no choice -- accept it and embrace life today.

The Pink campaign has been extremely successful in raising awareness about early breast cancer. Yet mention 'met-a-static' and the average person struggles to pronounce the word let alone understand what it means.

The bewildered look of confusion on the recipient's face normally says it all. ""But you look so good and so healthy"" people exclaim -- offering words of encouragement for something that most of us just don't confront -- and that is our imminent mortality.

It is so incredibly frustrating that many of us believe breast cancer is curable, and wait; if you are strong, determined and positive, then you can beat, fight and overcome the cancer. This is unfounded. True, a positive mindset helps maintain resilience but this does not prevent the cancer from killing you.

I was flooded and overwhelmed with suggestions, and like being pregnant was inundated with so much unsolicited advice. ""Do this"", ""do that"", ""have you thought of this?"" or ""tried that?"" -- became the mantra wherever I went. The only difference between pregnancy and metastatic breast cancer is that with pregnancy you end up with a new life in your hands, but with MBC you end up fighting for one.

The other confusion lies within the breast community itself -- the terms have become somewhat blurred: what exactly defines a survivor and what does advanced breast cancer mean? So is there beginner's or intermediate breast cancer? No there is not.

There are Stages 1 through to 4. Advanced or metastatic breast cancer is also known as Stage 4 and is considered incurable. However, women diagnosed with Stage 1, 2 or 3 can often be 'cured' from their cancer and survive.

Since 25-30 percent of women will have their breast cancer reappear, irrespective of their earlier treatments/intervention, it's extremely important we raise awareness around this form of cancer. Today is officially Metastatic Breast Cancer Day, do your part and let's spread the word about this disease.

U.S. State Department officials accompanied the Boyle family on the flight home.
The Canadian government said in a statement that it joined the Boyle family ""in rejoicing over the long-awaited return to Canada of their loved ones.""","TORONTO — Former Canadian hostage Joshua Boyle has demanded that the Afghanistan government bring his kidnappers to justice for the ""murder"" of his infant daughter and the rape of his wife while they were in captivity.

A tired-looking Boyle read a brief statement to the media late Friday after arriving in Toronto with his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, and their three young children. The family was freed by Pakistani commandos on Wednesday after they and their captors crossed the border from Afghanistan.

Boyle and Coleman had been kidnapped in Afghanistan in October 2012 while on a backpacking trip. Coleman was pregnant at the time and had four children in captivity. The birth of the fourth child had not been publicly known before Boyle appeared before journalists in Toronto.

With hands trembling as he read his statement, Boyle lambasted the ""stupidity and the evil"" of his kidnappers, who he said were members of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network, for abducting both him and his pregnant wife during a trip to help villagers in Afghanistan's Taliban-controlled areas.

Joshua Boyle leaves after speaking to the media at Pearson International Airport in Toronto. Boyle and his family were rescued earlier this week.

He said the Haqqani leadership authorized the murder of his infant daughter in retaliation for his refusal to accept an offer from the kidnappers, but did not elaborate on the offer. He also condemned his kidnappers for engaging in the brutal rape of his wife.

""Not as a lone action by one guard, but assisted by the captain of the guard and supervised by the commandant ... of the Haqqani network."" Boyle said.

""God willing, this litany of stupidity will be the epitaph of the Haqqani network.""

Boyle said the Afghan government should provide his family the justice that they are owed.

""I certainly do not intend to allow a brutal and sacrilegious gang of criminal miscreants to... weaken my family's commitment to do the right thing no matter the cost.""

Boyle said he and his wife now want to focus on building a new life.

""Obviously it will be of incredible importance to my family that we are able to build a secure sanctuary for our three surviving children, to call a home, to focus on edification and to try to regain some portion of the childhood that they have lost.""

God willing, this litany of stupidity will be the epitaph of the Haqqani network. Joshua Boyle, former hostage

The final leg of the family's journey to freedom was an Air Canada flight from London to Toronto.

U.S. State Department officials accompanied the Boyle family on the flight home.

Boyle gave The Associated Press a handwritten statement expressing disagreement with U.S. foreign policy.

""God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination, and to allow that to stagnate, to pursue personal pleasure or comfort while there is still deliberate and organized injustice in the world would be a betrayal of all I believe, and tantamount to sacrilege,"" he wrote.

He nodded to one of the State Department officials and said, ""Their interests are not my interests.""

He added that one of his children was in poor health and had to be force-fed by their Pakistani rescuers.

Joshua Boyle and his family were held by Afghan militants for five years.

Coleman, who is from Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, sat in the aisle of the business-class cabin wearing a tan-coloured headscarf.

She nodded wordlessly when she confirmed her identity to a reporter on board the flight. In the two seats next to her were her two elder children. In the seat beyond that was Boyle, with their youngest child in his lap.

The family was escorted off the plane five-to-10 minutes before the other passengers on the flight.

The Canadian government said in a statement that it joined the Boyle family ""in rejoicing over the long-awaited return to Canada of their loved ones.""

On Thursday, officials in Pakistan said the family had been rescued in ""an intelligence-based operation"" after their captors moved them across the border from Afghanistan.

The couple had set off in the summer 2012 on a journey that took them to Russia, the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and then to Afghanistan.

Their release came nearly five years to the day after Boyle and Coleman lost touch with their families while travelling in a mountainous region near the Afghan capital, Kabul.

Joshua Boyle stands next to his father Patrick Doyle after arriving with his wife and three children at Toronto Pearson International Airport.

Coleman's parents last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8, 2012, from an Internet cafe in what Boyle described as an ""unsafe"" part of Afghanistan.

Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nafees Zakaria, said the Pakistani raid that led to the family's rescue was based on a tip from U.S. intelligence and shows that Pakistan will act against a ""common enemy"" when Washington shares information.

U.S. officials have long accused Pakistan of ignoring groups like the Haqqani network. The Americans consider it a terrorist organization and have targeted its leaders with drone strikes.

But the Haqqani group also operates like a criminal network. Unlike the Islamic State group, it does not typically execute Western hostages, preferring to ransom them for cash.

A U.S. national security official, who was not authorized to discuss operational details of the release and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. obtained actionable information, passed it to Pakistani government officials, asked them to interdict and recover the hostages — and they did.

Boyle was once married to Zaynab Khadr, the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a senior al-Qaida financier. Her father, the late Ahmed Said Khadr, and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy.

The Canadian-born Omar Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a firefight and was taken to the U.S. detention centre at Guantanamo Bay. Officials had discounted any link between that background and Boyle's capture, with one official describing it in 2014 as a ""horrible coincidence.""

The U.S. Justice Department said neither Boyle nor Coleman is wanted for any federal crime.

Der Pflegenotstand in Deutschland ist gravierend - und die Politik versäumt es, notwendige Reformen zu verabschieden

Dabei bieten sich gerade skandinavische Modelle als Vorbild für politische Veränderungen an

Und: Schon die Änderung eines einzigen Satzes im Pflegegesetz könnte große Fortschritte bewirken

Deutschland ist ein altes, pflegebedürftiges Land. Und weil die Bevölkerung immer älter wird, wird Deutschland auch immer pflegebedürftiger.

Die Politik weiß um das Problem. Doch in den vergangenen vier Jahren hat die Bundesregierung wenig getan, um den Herausforderungen in der Pflege zu begegnen. Der Notstand wird ausgesessen - zum Leidtragen der Pflegebedürftigen und auch der Menschen, die sich um deren Versorgung kümmern.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 21-jähriger Pfleger klagt an: ""Die, die unseren Wohlstand erwirtschaftet haben, liegen jetzt in der Scheiße""

Auch im Bundestagswahlkampf und den Koalitionsverhandlungen über eine Jamaika-Koalition spielt das Thema Pflege bisher kaum eine Rolle. Eine nachhaltige Pflegereform ist in Deutschland also nicht in Sicht.

Und das, obwohl es in Skandinavien genug Vorbilder für funktionierende Pflegesysteme gäbe - und schon die Änderung eines einzigen Satzes im deutschen Pflegegesetz drastische Verbesserungen bewirken könnte.

Der Pflegebedarf wurde grob unterschätzt

Klar ist: Das deutsche Pflegesystem gilt schon lange als gescheitert.

Schon 2012 prognostizierte die Bertelsmann-Stiftung in einem Pflegereport, dass die Zahl der Pflegebedürftigen in Deutschland bis 2030 auf 3,4 Millionen Menschen steigen werde. Gleichzeitig werde die Zahl der Beschäftigten im Pflegesektor dramatisch abnehmen. ""Insgesamt werden 500.000 Vollzeitkräfte fehlen, wenn nicht gegengesteuert wird"", schrieben die Bertelsmann-Autoren damals.

Ihre Berechnungen basierten auf der Pflegestatistik 2009 - und wurden Anfang dieses Jahres als noch zurückhaltend entlarvt. Da erschien die aktuelle Pflegestatistik mit den Zahlen von 2015. Die Statistik offenbart: Vor zwei Jahren gab es in Deutschland bereits 2,9 Millionen Pflegebedürftige, die genannte Zahl von 3,4 Millionen bis 2030 wird wohl überschritten werden.

Der Pflegebedarf in Deutschland wurde also grob unterschätzt. Die Folgen: Überlastete Angehörige, unterversorgte Patienten und vollkommen überarbeitete Ärzte und Pflegekräfte.

""Im deutschen System wird erst agiert, wenn der Schaden eingetreten ist""

Dass es anders funktionieren kann, zeigen die skandinavischen Länder. Während Deutschland laut OECD-Statistiken nur knapp 1 Prozent seines Bruttoinlandsprodukts für die Pflege ausgibt, sind es in Norwegen, Schweden, Island, Finnland und Dänemark 2 bis 3,5 Prozent.

Das macht sich bemerkbar: Im Gegensatz zu Deutschland ist Skandinavien von einem Pflegenotstand weit entfernt. Die Politologin Cornelia Heintze vergleicht in ihrer Forschung seit Jahren die Pflegesysteme in den skandinavischen Ländern mit dem Modell in Deutschland.

Anders als in Deutschland werde in Skandinavien die Pflege als kommunale Aufgabe verstanden und deshalb vornehmlich aus Steueraufkommen finanziert, erklärt Heintze der HuffPost. Sie sagt: ""Im deutschen System wird erst agiert, wenn der Schaden eingetreten ist.""

Der Staat lasse die Menschen bei der Pflege im Stich. ""Da wird gesagt: 'Wir als Staat wollen damit nichts zu tun haben - wir haben ja den Markt, auf dem kann sich jeder selbst kümmern'"", erklärt Heintze. Das deutsche Pflegesystem funktioniere letztendlich wie eine Teilkasko-Versicherung, bei der hohe Ziele ausgegeben würden, ohne dafür das nötige Geld und die nötigen Strukturen zu haben.

Während also in Skandinavien der öffentliche Sektor Marktführer im Bereich Pflege sei, wären dies in Deutschland die privaten Anbieter. Diese sind laut Heintze maßgeblich mitverantwortlich für den aktuellen Notstand - weil sie ihre Mitarbeiter schlecht bezahlen und das Wohl der Patienten dem Profitgedanken unterordnen würden.

Wie skandinavische Ideen Deutschlands Pflegesystem reformieren könnten

Heintze hat deshalb gleich mehrere konkrete Vorschläge, wie Pflege in Deutschland neu organisiert werden müsste, um die steigende Zahl an Pflegebedürftigen versorgen zu können.

► Zunächst werde Deutschland nicht anders können, als mehr Geld für die Pflege in die Hand zu nehmen. ""Der Staat kann sich nicht darauf verlassen, dass sich Arbeitgeber und Gewerkschaften verständigen"", sagt Heintze.

Bei den privaten Heimbetreibern, die 40 Prozent des Marktes für sich beanspruchen würden, gäbe es keinerlei tarifliche Bestimmungen. Eine bessere öffentliche Gegenfinanzierung und eine Tarifeinheit könnten staatliche Einrichtungen wieder konkurrenzfähiger machen und somit für mehr Wettbewerb und Qualität in der Pflege sorgen.

► Für einen Pflegeplatz fallen in Deutschland laut Heintze monatlich durchschnittlich 1500 Euro private Zuzahlungen an. ""Es gibt nur einen kleinen Bevölkerungssatz, der sich diese privaten Zuzahlungen leisten kann"", sagt die Politologin.

Die Lösung: Den vom Staat getragenen Anteil am Pflegesatz ausweiten - so, wie in Skandinavien.

► Heintze empfiehlt zudem, den privaten Pflegebetreibern eine Gewinnbegrenzung von drei bis vier Prozent Rendite aufzuerlegen. So würden ausländische Investoren abgeschreckt, die das deutsche Pflegesystem für Profite anzapfen wollten.

""Die Haie abhalten"", nennt Heintze das.

► Die schwarz-gelbe Bundesregierung hat 2013 die Pflegegesetze zugunsten von privaten Anbietern reformiert. Private und freigemeinnützige Betreiber wurden gleichgestellt. Das Gesetz sieht laut Heintze seitdem sogar vor, dass private Pflegeleistungen ""der öffentlichen Leistungserbringung vorgehen"".

Heintze fordert: Es müsste genau umgekehrt sein, Non-Profits und öffentliche Geschäftsmodelle müssten den kommerziellen vorgehen. ""Das ist ein Satz, der geändert werden müsste"", sagt die Forscherin. Ein Satz, dessen Umformulierung den Weg hin zu einem staatlich gegenfinanziertem Pflegesystem kommunaler Verantwortung in Deutschland frei machen würde.

Deutschland wird nie Skandinavien sein - aber es kann ihm nacheifern

Das Deutschland das skandinavische Pflegemodell komplett adaptieren könnte, das glaubt auch Heintze nicht.

Die von ihr angesprochenen Reformen brächten in Deutschland noch lange kein solches System hervor, ""aber eines, dass der Würde des älteren Menschen mehr verpflichtet ist, Angehörige besser unterstützt und Pflege als gesellschaftliche Aufgabe annimmt.""

Ohnehin: Politische Mehrheiten für skandinavische Ideen in der Pflege sieht die Wissenschaftlerin nicht in Deutschland. Gerade auch, weil bald womöglich die FDP mitregieren würde, die die Privatisierung des Pflegesektors überhaupt erst vorangetrieben habe.

""Ich bin nicht optimistisch"", sagt Heintze deshalb. Die Politik verspräche zwar, sie würde sich der Realität stellen - ""aber ich sehe nicht, dass sie das tut.""

Getötet wurde er ausgerechnet - oder: gerechterweise - durch Sansa Stark, eigentlich Ramsays Ehefrau, die er so lange drangsaliert und missbraucht hatte. Nicht nur Sansa, sondern auch alle Zuschauer und ich haben gelächelt, als Ramsay endlich sein verdientes Ende fand. Darf man das?

Anonymes et personnalités ont assisté en nombre, ce vendredi 13 octobre, aux obsèques de l'acteur Jean Rochefort, célébrées en l'église Saint-Thomas d'Aquin à Paris.

Dans l'église bondée ouverte au public, la cérémonie a débuté à 14h30 par quelques mots prononcés par une des filles de Jean Rochefort, Clémence, avant qu'Édouard Baer ne lui succède pour raconter quelques anecdotes, selon les souhaits du défunt.

Le comédien trublion, qui s'était lié d'amitié avec son aîné et l'avait fait tourner dans sa réalisation ""Akoibon"" en 2005, a réussi a arracher quelques rires à l'assistance, confiant notamment: ""Je restais un piéton quand vous me parliez cheval"".

Dans son homélie, le Père Guy Poisley a souligné à propos de Jean Rochefort, mort dans la nuit de dimanche à lundi à 87 ans, ""son élégance empreinte d'une simplicité qui fit du bien"", sous les yeux de ses cinq enfants et de sa compagne Françoise au premier rang.

Parmi les personnalités présentes lors de cette cérémonie émouvante et sobre à l'image de l'artiste disparu, figurait notamment le comédien Guy Bedos. Ce dernier forma avec Claude Brasseur, Victor Lanoux, décédé en mai dernier, et Rochefort le quatuor du populaire diptyque au cinéma ""Un éléphant ça trompe énormément"" et ""Nous irons tous au paradis"".

Le bruit sourd et régulier des lames qui se plantent dans le bois, des cris de joie et le tintement d'une cloche sonnée quand le coeur de la cible est touché, l'atmosphère est chaude, ce vendredi soir, au Stumpy's Hatchet House, non loin de la côte nord-est du New Jersey.

Ses quatre fondateurs assurent que le lieu, ouvert il y a 18 mois, a été le premier du genre aux Etats-Unis, même si le Canada est souvent considéré comme le berceau de ce loisir d'un genre nouveau. On en trouve maintenant à Chicago, Washington, Nashville ou Denver, entre autres.

Les propriétaires du Stumpy's parlent déjà d'en ouvrir un autre dans le nord du New Jersey et se sont même lancés dans la franchise, tablant sur un réseau de 15 de ces bars à hache dans un an.

Une demie-heure pour manier la hache de jet comme un viking

""C'est le nouveau bowling"", s'enthousiasme Kelly Josberger, une ancienne directrice d'école primaire de 51 ans qui a décidé de changer de carrière, comme ses trois partenaires, dont aucun n'avait jamais eu sa propre affaire auparavant.

""C'est mieux"", abonde Joseph Cavanagh (27 ans), qui est venu fêter son anniversaire chez Stumpy's avec amis et collègues, parce que ""même si vous êtes nul, vous vous marrez quand même. Le bowling, si vous n'êtes pas bon, ce n'est pas aussi sympa.""

De l'avis général, il faut environ une demi-heure pour maîtriser la savante rotation de la hache et parvenir à la planter dans la cible en bois, changée plusieurs fois par jour.

""C'est différent et vous êtes actifs"", estime Jessica Hill, pharmacienne de 34 ans et collègue de Joseph. ""Et puis, c'est plus branché que le bowling."" Décor tout en bois, pas de télévision ou de néon, tout est dans l'épure, signe d'une certaine sophistication.

Le public de Stumpy's ce vendredi soir est essentiellement composé de jeunes, hommes et femmes en nombre quasiment équivalent, mais beaucoup disent avoir déjà croisé des quinquas, voire des sexagénaires, venus se faire un frisson pour quarante dollars par personne la session de deux heures.

C'est ce côté dangereux qui plaît à Tim Foley, quadra ravi de sa soirée. ""Cela rend le truc plus intéressant"", glisse-t-il, malicieux.

Alcool, haches, et sécurité

Certains s'inquiètent, à l'inverse, des risques associés à cette pratique combinée à la consommation d'alcool. Stumpy's ne possède pas de licence pour en servir mais autorise les clients à amener leurs propres bouteilles de bière ou de vin.

La première fois qu'on lui a parlé du concept, Alyssa Tabernise se souvient d'avoir pensé que ""ce (n'était) pas vraiment sûr de boire et de lancer, mais que (ça devait) vraiment être marrant"".

Pour tordre le cou à cette perception, les propriétaires de Stumpy's imposent une formation de quelques minutes ainsi que des règles draconiennes: pas de mineur (21 ans au moins), une seule personne dans l'espace délimité au lancement et pas de passage de hache, qui sont remises dans une boîte après chaque utilisation.

Au Valhalla, le premier bar à haches français, qui a ouvert ses portes début octobre près de Caen, on fait souffler dans un éthylomètre avant de lancer. À Paris, un vieil entrepôt du 18e arrondissement a tout récemment été transformé en ""spot"" de lancer de haches: Les Cognées. Là-bas aussi les instructeurs sont en charge d'apprendre aux participants les règles de sécurité avant de passer aux meilleures techniques de lancer.

Chez Stumpy's, les employés du lieu sillonnent en permanence les allées pour s'assurer du respect des consignes sur chaque pas de tir, tous grillagés et dotés d'une seule hache, qui mesure environ 35 cm et pèse un peu moins de 600 grammes.

Quand elle voit des clients à la mine inquiète à la réception, Kelly Josberger, qui affirme que Stumpy's n'a connu aucun accident en près de deux ans d'existence, sort sa phrase favorite: ""Est-ce que j'ai l'air d'une personne dangereuse?""

During the 5Live interview on Friday, Robert Goodwill did not give a straight answer when Barnett asked what percentage of social worker posts for children were vacant across the country.

Goodwill first said it was difficult to know because some councils report vacancies but employ agency staff to fill them, before he conceded, under dogged questioning from Barnett, that “we don’t actually have that data”.

“You’ve just said to me you’ve basically got no idea. That’s what you’ve just said to me as the Children’s Minister,” Barnett said during their exchange.

“The reality is the minister in charge of this, which is you Robert Goodwill, is woefully ignorant about the state of those vacancies.”

Goodwill went on the programme to defend the Government’s investment in children’s care.

When Barnett first asked the question about the number of vacancies, Goodwill said: “I can’t give you that figure now... I know there are shortages.”

Barnett asked for a “rough idea” but when Goodwill still wouldn’t give figures, she cited a BBC report from April 2016 that found nearly 20% of children’s social work jobs in England were vacant and asked him directly: “Is it more or less than that?”

Goodwill did not give a direct answer and tried to emphasise again how the agency staff issue made it hard to be sure what the figure was.

Barnett told him: “You can do some maths. You’re very fond of saying Labour benches are filled with politicians who don’t know their maths or do their sums.

“But you actually need to solve the problem and you can’t solve the problem without data. You’ve passed the buck on pretty much every question I’ve asked to local authorities but you as the minister could pull rank and find out.”

PA Archive/PA Images Emma Barnett told Goodwill: 'You’ve basically got no idea'

“As I was saying,” Goodwill said, trying again to return to the subject of agencies’ impact on council staffing.

“You don’t have to explain how agencies work, with all due respect,” Barnett hit back. “Give me a picture of the scale of the problem.”

Goodwill returned to the theme of differences between local councils, saying the shortage “varies” between different areas.

“I’m asking for a national picture, which I don’t think is an unfair question,” Barnett said.

She again accused him of having “no idea”, Goodwill said: “It’s not that we don’t have any idea, we don’t have data.”

He added that, because agency staff may be filling temporary vacancies, a council’s report of gaps “doesn’t mean that social work isn’t being delivered”.

“You don’t seem to able to have any way of quantifying how large those vacancies are, which I think many of those listening would find troubling,” Barnett said.

On Twitter, Barnett was praised for “handing Robert Goodwill his arse” and “savaging” him.

One person thanked Barnett, saying it was “not good enough” to suggest vacancies were an issue for local councils rather than national government and added it was a “sad indictment” of social work that it did not know how big the shortage was.

It Takes A 'Village' To Raise Breastfeeding Rates Just as the saying goes: 'it takes a village to raise a child,' it takes a community to support mothers to breastfeed.

How We're Turning Grenfell Donations Into Cash For Victims In the immediate aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, dozens of people started to arrive at the local rest centres with bottles of water, bags of bedding, clothing, children's toys, anything they could muster to help those who had lost everything. Very quickly, those dozens of people turned into a community, then a city, and before the day was out the whole country was donating items to the fire victims. Everyone wanted to do something to help. It was a huge spontaneous response to what has been one of the UK's worst peacetime disasters. Chief Executive at the British Red Cross

Eine Studie der Kultusministerkonferenz hat sich die Leistungen in den Fächern Deutsch und Mathematik angeschaut

Grundschüler in Deutschland haben mit immer größeren Lernschwierigkeiten zu kämpfen.

An diesem Freitag stellt die Kultusministerkonferenz (KMK) in Berlin eine Studie über das Niveau in den Fächern Deutsch und Mathematik vor. Die Präsidentin der KMK Susanne Eisenmann sprach von einer wichtigen Standortbestimmung.

Die Studie, die am Nachmittag präsentiert wird, zeigt laut baden-württembergischen Medienberichten, dass das Bildungsniveau vom Jahr 2011 auf 2016 in ganz Deutschland massiv gesunken ist - vor allem in zwei Bundesländern: Bremen und Baden-Württemberg.

Das berichteten die ""Heilbronner Stimme"" und der ""Mannheimer Morgen"" am Donnerstag unter Berufung auf Südwest-Regierungskreise. Die ""Südwest Presse"" berichtete von einem drohenden ""Desaster"". In Stuttgart verlangten die oppositionellen SPD und FDP bereits nachdrücklich Maßnahmen zur Stärkung der Grundschulen.

Mehr Lehrer sollen das Problem lösen

Unmittelbar vor der Präsentation der großen Schulstudie wird besonders der Ruf nach mehr Lehrern für Deutschlands Schulen lauter. ""Ohne ausreichend Lehrer kann es keinen Bildungserfolg geben"", sagte Hamburgs Schulsenator Ties Rabe (SPD) der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Berlin.

Rabe sagte, gegen den Lehrermangel seien kurzfristige Schritte und längerfristige Konzepte nötig. ""Es ist ein Zukunftsthema, dessen Brisanz sich immer schärfer abzeichnet."" Bestimmte Länder hätten erhebliche Probleme, ausreichend Nachwuchs zu finden.

Rabe zeigte sich offen dafür, verstärkt Uniabsolventen ohne Lehramtsstudium einzustellen. Geklärt werden müsse: ""Was lassen wir zu?"" Um die Situation dauerhaft zu entschärfen, müssten die Ausbildungskapazitäten erhöht werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: In den Schulen unterrichten immer mehr unqualifizierte Lehrer - Experten warnen vor den Folgen

Rabe sagte, bei Schultests dürften die Veränderungen in der Schülerschaft als Grund für durchschnittliche Änderungen der Schülerkompetenz nicht außer Acht gelassen werden. So seien weit mehr Kinder von nach Deutschland Geflüchteten in den Schulen, als noch vor wenigen Jahren.

Problemfall Sonderpädagogik

Die Kultusministerkonferenz hatte festgestellt, dass insbesondere die Grundschulen, die Sonderpädagogik und die beruflichen Schulen von Lehrermangel betroffen seien.

In den ostdeutschen Ländern herrsche noch deutlich mehr Bedarf als in westdeutschen Ländern. Nun solle unter anderem eine Stärkung der Berufs- und Studienorientierung geprüft werden - mit dem Ziel, dass mehr junge Menschen ein Lehramtsstudium aufnehmen.

Dozens of women have come forward making accusations of sexual assault and harassment against film producer Weinstein, triggering a conversation about the scale of both that women face.

Oscar-winning actor Emma Thompson labelled Weinstein a “predator” who is just the tip of an “iceberg”, adding his alleged behaviour was “endemic” in Hollywood.

#WomenBoycottTwitter trended on Friday as people pledged to quit the site in solidarity with McGowan.

After her Twitter account was restored, McGowan encouraged the boycott. Journalist Lauren Duca and model Chrissy Teigen are among those taking part, while a host of celebrities have also pledged their support.

McGowan’s suspension was due to the fact she tweeted a personal phone number in a series of tweets to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, in which she alleged the head of Amazon Studios knew about her allegations about Weinstein and ignored them.

Southend West MP Sir David Amess was forced to issue a bizarre clarification, saying the comments were in a press release from his office “which I had not seen or authorised.”

The original press release, quoted in Amess’ name by local paper The Southend Echo, said: “The recent revelations that countless starlets have apparently been assaulted by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein are dubious to say the least.

“Whilst it has no doubt always been the case that some individuals have achieved their big break via the casting couch, this sudden flurry of alleged inappropriate advances beggars belief.

“Just as with the claims against Jimmy Saville here in the UK, why did no one say anything until now?”

But, when his office was contacted by HuffPost on Friday, Amess issued a statement insisting he had not said those words.

He said: “Unfortunately, a press release was issued in my name from my office this morning which I had not seen or authorised.

“I was horrified when I read its contents, so I have sought to clarify the issue as soon as possible.

“I wish to make it perfectly plain I abhor what Harvey Weinstein has been accused of and furthermore I think the way that he has allegedly treated some women is disgusting.

“I apologise for any upset that the original press release may have caused and I have now put instructions in place to prevent this happening again.”

A spokesman for Amess declined to comment on who had sent the first press release or how it came to be issued in the MP’s name.

However, a source present at the inaugural Anti Coagulation Achievement Awards on Tuesday told HuffPost UK that Amess made a “joke” before he handed out an honour.

At the awards, held in the House of Commons to recognise the work of NHS and other staff specialising in thrombosis, he said: “At least we know everyone here didn’t have to do anything on the casting couch to get an award.”

The “dubious” comments caused a wave of anger on social media.

The Women’s Equality Party called it “the most offensive Weinstein reaction in a crowded field of victim blaming”.

Weinstein has been accused by sexual assault and harassment by dozens of women, much of it centring on the casting couch process of auditioning for films he was involved in.

Amess is well known for being duped by satirist Chris Morris in 1997 for his series Brass Eye, in which public figures were tricked into endorsing warnings about various fictional dangers.

Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said in a statement on Thursday that the reforms will make private health insurance ""simpler and more affordable"" for Australians and encouraged young people to consider looking into private cover.

""We know that every dollar matters to Australian families and these reforms will get better value for families and make policies easier to understand,"" he said.

""We are encouraging younger Australians to take up private health insurance by allowing insurers to discount hospital insurance premiums for 18- to 29-year-olds by up to 10 per cent.

When it comes to mental health, the changes will also see the removal of ""Benefit Limitation Periods"", which currently see Australians only entitled to restricted benefits for a particular condition or treatment for a set period of time.

Additionally, the shake-up will prevent insurance companies applying limits for patients on the number of mental health treatments that they can access.

Plan seems to be 'how can we sucker young people who don't need private health insurance into buying private health insurance'. https://t.co/zYJe4xQHTz — Andrew Sykes (@Interlime) October 12, 2017

The major reforms come as part of a package of 14 measures all designed at enhancing Australia's private health insurance standards, which also includes the categorisation of different cover types, increases to maximum excess levels and the removal of natural therapy coverage.

""The Turnbull Government is committed to private health insurance and we're committed to supporting the 13 million Australians that have taken out cover,"" Hunt said in the statement.

""We know that many people would like to be able to select a higher excess in exchange for lower premiums. That's why we will increase the maximum excess consumers can choose under their health insurance policies for the first time since 2001.

""And we know that many people find private health insurance confusing.

Der renommierte Paarforscher John Gottman hat eine Formel entwickelt, mit der er erkennt, ob eine Beziehung zum Scheitern verurteilt ist

Anhand von vier Anzeichen kann er in nur wenigen Minuten den Fortgang einer Beziehung fast zu 100 Prozent genau vorhersagen

Wenn Paare beschließen zu heiraten, tun sie das meistens mit der Überzeugung, dass die Liebe bis an ihr Lebensende halten wird. Doch bei einem erheblichen Teil von ihnen trennen sich die Wege, lange bevor der Tod sie scheidet.

In Deutschland etwa werden 35 Prozent der Ehen in den ersten 25 Jahren geschieden.

Was aber machen Paare richtig, deren Vorstellung einer glücklichen, andauernden Ehe Realität wird? Gibt es so etwas wie eine geheime Liebesformel?

Der Psychologe und Paarforscher John Gottman geht diesen Fragen bereits seit Jahrzehnten nach - und sagt: Ja, eine solche Formel gibt es. Mit der Zeit hat er ein Muster erkannt, nach dem Beziehungen funktionieren.

Jahrzehntelange Paarforschung

Weltweit bekannt wurde Gottman durch die Erwähnung in Malcolm Gladwells 2006 erschienenen Bestseller ""Blink”. Das Buch behandelt die Frage, wie Bauchgefühl das menschliche Handeln bestimmt.

Der Autor und Journalist beschreibt Gottmans Vorgehensweise am Beispiel des jungen Paares Susan und Bill.

Für die Versuchsanordnung werden die Beiden an einen Tisch gesetzt. Dann sollen sie ein belangloses Gespräch beginnen und unterhalten sich über ihren gemeinsamen Hund. Nach 15 Minuten wird das Gespräch gestoppt.

Gottman saß währenddessen hinter einer Scheibe und hat die beiden beobachtet. “Die Beiden werden sich trennen”, urteilt Gottman, ohne lange zu überlegen.

Eine ziemlich gewagte Aussage nach gerade mal 15 Minuten Gespräch, werden die meisten jetzt sagen. Doch der Psychologe liegt mit seinen Schätzungen zum Fortgang von Liebesbeziehungen mit durchschnittlich 94 Prozent so gut wie immer richtig.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 29 intime Fotos zeigen, wie wahre Leidenschaft zwischen zwei Menschen aussieht

In seinem Forschungsinstitut The Gottman Relationship Institute an der University of Wahington in Seattle, das er selbst “das Liebeslabor” nennt, analysiert er seit den 70er Jahren mit Video und Mikrosensoren Gespräche zwischen Paaren.

Anhand der Analyse von Mimik und Gestik, dem Verhalten in Konfliksituationen und Blutdruckwerten entwickelte er über die Jahrzehnte ein Muster für die Interaktion von Paaren. Er ist überzeugt, sichere Anzeichen dafür identifiziert zu haben, dass eine Beziehung scheitern wird.

Das sind Gottmans vier ""apokalyptische Reiter"":

1. Verallgemeinernde Kritik: Der Partner richtet häufig Sätze an den anderen, die “immer” oder “nie” beinhalten. (“Nie hörst du mir zu” oder “Ich muss immer alles alleine machen.”)

2. Verachtung: Das beginnt mit abwertenden Kommentaren zur Meinung des Partners, und reicht über Sarkasmus, Spott, Abfälligkeit bis hin zu Beschimpfungen. Verachtung ist laut Gottman die schädlichste Kommunikationsform für eine Beziehung.

3. Rechtfertigung: Aussagen wie: “Ja, aber…” deuten auf ein defensives Verhalten hin und zeigen, dass jemand keine Verantwortung übernehmen möchte.

4. Rückzug: Bei Konflikten, aber auch in Alltagssituationen gehen die Partner nicht aufeinander ein und scheuen sich, die Sicht des anderen einzunehmen und wertzuschätzen.

Anhand dieser Erkenntnisse urteilte Gottman auch bei Susan und Bill, dass das Ende der Beziehung bevorstand.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese 4 Dinge zerstören nicht nur eure Beziehung, sondern schaden auch der Karriere

An dem 15 minütigen Gespräch erkannte der Psychologe: Offensichtlich spürte Susan eine tiefere Verbundenheit zu ihrem Hund als zu ihrem Mann. Er wiederum hatte das Gefühl, das Tier beeinträchtige das Sozialleben des Paares.

Indizien, die ihn laut Gladwells Buch zu diesem Ergebnis kommen ließen, waren: Susan reagierte mit kaum merklichen Augenrollen, einer verachtenden Geste, woraufhin Bill in den Verteidigungsmodus ging.

Aussagen von ihm wie ""Ich verstehe dich, aber..."" führten dazu, dass ihr Ärger größer wurde - und das verstärkte seine wiederum seine abwehrende Haltung mehr und mehr.

Obwohl die beiden bestimmt nicht der Ansicht waren, dass es sich um einen richtigen Streit handelte, stand für Gottman die Sache fest. Für ihn war die Beziehung am Ende, lange, bevor die Beiden selbst sich dessen bewusst waren.

Ob die Liebe zwischen Susan und Bill tatsächlich zerbrach oder nicht, geht aus “Blink” leider nicht hervor.

Communication with family members plays a key role in cancer patients' health.

Wayne Beach, a communications professor, studied cancer patients and their families for a decade, and found that people who suffer from cancer benefit from continuous positive dialogue with their loved ones.

""Cancer patients do cope and heal better depending on their communication within their families,"" Beach said in a news release. ""Without this proper communication, these patients don't heal as well or as long. Having a dysfunctional environment around you is not good — it's stressful.""

When cancer patients and family members share stories, reminisce, and talk about their hopes and concerns, they can cope with the disease better.

""How family members communicate when coping [with a diagnosis] is important,"" Beach said, adding that patients have reported feeling empowered when there is constant, comprehensive communication around them.

Having a dysfunctional environment around you is not good — it's stressful.

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, cancer is the leading cause of death in the country and is responsible for 30 per cent of all deaths.

It's estimated that 206,200 new cases of cancer and 80,800 deaths of cancer will occur in Canada in 2017 — lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer are the most common types of cancer in Canada (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer).

Based on this data, chances are you, or someone you know, has been affected by cancer at some point in your lifetime. And because of this, it's important we know how to interact with people who are affected by it.

""If you hear someone has been diagnosed with cancer, our natural inclination tends to be to think of it as a death sentence,"" Beach said. But during his observations, he found that much of the communication between family members and cancer patients ""focused on life, rather than death.""

If you hear someone has been diagnosed with cancer, our natural inclination tends to be to think of it as a death sentence.

""It is so much more about hope than despair. I really didn't expect that going in,"" he noted.

""So we're looking at how good and bad news relating to cancer gets delivered and responded to,"" he added.

When interacting with a person who has cancer, Beach recommends you offer encouragement, stay positive, talk with them frequently, be open about how you're feeling, listen to what the patient is saying, and allow them to vent to you about their fears.

What you shouldn't do? Don't be silent around them, avoid talking about cancer or their diagnosis, and focus on the negatives.

According to the American Cancer Society, studies have shown that ""cancer survivors with strong emotional support tend to better adjust to the changes cancer brings to their lives, have a more positive outlook, and often report a better quality of life.""

What you shouldn't do? Don't be silent around them, avoid talking about cancer or their diagnosis, and focus on the negatives.

They also note that people who have cancer do better if they have supportive friends.

""Make sure your friend knows that they're important to you. Show that you still care for your friend despite changes in what they can do or how they look,"" the American Cancer Society says.

On a person-to-person level, addressing loneliness can mean paying attention to people who might be lonely and reaching out to them, even if it’s just an informal conversation that’s not about work.","During his tenure as surgeon general, Vivek Murthy was known for his work battling the nation’s opioid crisis, including issuing a 400-page report on addiction and mailing letters to doctors imploring them to join him in fighting the opioid epidemic. After President Donald Trump fired Murthy in April, however, he has focused on a different national crisis: loneliness.

“As prevalent as loneliness is, many people don’t recognize that people that they know may very well be suffering from loneliness,” Murthy told HuffPost. “It’s important for many reasons, one of which is that it has a profound impact on health.”

And while it might seem like a departure, Murthy sees a number of connections between fighting the opioid epidemic and addressing loneliness in the United States.

In September, Murthy wrote a cover story about workplace loneliness for the Harvard Business Review and pointed to the connection between loneliness and poor health. In the article, Murthy noted that loneliness and weak social connections are associated with reduced lifespan and a greater risk for illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression and anxiety.

Indeed, one meta-analysis, published in PLOS Medicine in 2010, examined 148 studies and found that participants were 50 percent more likely to avoid an early death if they had strong social relationships.

“Physicians, health professionals, educators, and the media should now acknowledge that social relationships influence the health outcomes of adults and should take social relationships as seriously as other risk factors that affect mortality, the researchers conclude,” the PLOS editors wrote.

Another meta-analysis, published in Perspectives on Psychological Science in 2015, examined 70 studies on social connection shortfalls, such as social isolation, loneliness and living alone, and found that the mortality risk from social disconnection was greater than the mortality risk associated with obesity.

A growing number of people feel ‘profoundly alone’

When Murthy was traveling the country as surgeon general, he asked communities nationwide about the issues that were most important to them and how he could help address them.

“What I heard time and time again was that people were in fact dealing with an epidemic of stress and loneliness,” Murthy said. “In times of stress, you hope that people will come together and support each other, but I found that there were a growing number of people who were saying that they felt profoundly alone.”

As it stands, more than one-third of Americans say they are lonely, according to a 2010 AARP survey of more than 3,000 adults 45 and older.

Lonely individuals were more likely to be middle-aged, have never married and have lower incomes. Loneliness was also associated with poor health in the survey, with only 25 percent of people who rated their health as “excellent” saying they were lonely, compared with 55 percent who described their health as “poor.”

There’s also evidence that Americans are getting lonelier.

The average size of Americans’ social networks has decreased by a third since 1985, with 12 percent of Americans now saying they have no one with whom they can discuss important matters, according to a Pew Research Center survey from 2009.

And since loneliness tends to increase with age as friendship networks tend to shrink, the United States’ aging population appears poised to get even lonelier and less healthy in coming years.

Nobody wants to talk about being lonely

Similar to the silence surrounding the opioid crisis and addiction, many people are hesitant to talk about feeling isolated.

“Part of the reason people don’t talk about their loneliness is that they feel they will be judged for it,” Murthy said.

“This is something that we’ve seen as being really important in addressing the addiction crisis, an area which is similarly burdened with this unfortunate stigma. But there it’s been very important for people to step forward and talk about their struggles with addiction, to talk about their families’ experiences with addiction, and to support and offer help to those who are struggling.”

The individuals Murthy met who were in recovery for opioid addiction stressed that without support, either from an individual or a group, their recovery wouldn’t have been possible. Murthy sees that support as an integral part of addressing the loneliness epidemic.

In a workplace setting, addressing loneliness could mean employers checking in to see if their employees feel valued and supported by their colleagues and encouraging high-quality relationships between employees that extend beyond working on projects or attending office happy-hours together. On a person-to-person level, addressing loneliness can mean paying attention to people who might be lonely and reaching out to them, even if it’s just an informal conversation that’s not about work.

And while it might seem counterintuitive, it can be valuable for people who feel isolated to help others. “When you help someone else, not only do they benefit, but you reaffirm to yourself that you have something of value to give them, and you help to strengthen and nurture a bond with an individual that you’re helping,” Murthy said.

The former surgeon general stressed that the interventions he had in mind went deeper than policy or program changes.

Nachhaltiges Wirtschaften braucht Kurskorrekturen

Das Leitbild des Ehrbaren Kaufmanns gibt es in Deutschland bereits seit dem Mittelalter. Neu ist allerdings, dass eine Vielzahl von Finanzinvestoren diese zeitlosen Gedanken aufnehmen und ihre Investitionen zuweilen sogar als Druckmittel verwenden, um einen nachhaltigen Richtungswechsel in Unternehmen zu bewirken. Dabei handeln sie nicht losgelöst von gesellschaftlichen Entwicklungen, denn die Nachfrage nach ethisch sauberen Investitionen und Anlagemöglichkeiten ist seit der Finanzkrise erheblich angestiegen.

Ökonomische, ökologische und soziale Aspekte werden zunehmend auch in Hauptversammlungen thematisiert. Hintergrund ist eine Veränderung der Regulierung in Europa. Eine Überarbeitung der Aktionärsrechte-Richtlinie hat beispielsweise zum Ziel, die Anteilseigner aus der Anonymität des Aktienbesitzes herauszuführen und von ihnen aktive Mitsprache einzufordern. Anonyme Inhaberaktien sollen durch Namensaktien ersetzt werden, um eine höhere Beteiligung bei den Hauptversammlungen zu erreichen.

Aktien sollen nicht nur als Investition verstanden werden, sondern auch als greifbares Dokument der Unternehmensverantwortung durch Privatanleger. Darin zeigt sich auch eine (Kurs-)Korrektur des lange einseitig auf kurzfristige Gewinne ausgerichteten wirtschaftlichen Denkens.

Um nachhaltiges Wirtschaften zu gewährleisten, braucht es ehrbare Aufsichtsräte. Der Wirtschaftswissenschaftler, Autor, Steuerberater und Wirtschaftsprüfer Rudolf X. Ruter widmete ihnen 2016 ein ganzes Buch, in dem er dafür plädiert, dass Nachhaltigkeit auch immer ein persönliches Anliegen eines ehrbaren Aufsichtsrats sein sollte. Zudem formuliert er eine Vielzahl von Fragen, die zeigen, worauf es ankommt:

Enthält die Corporate Governance eine Nachhaltigkeitsorientierung? Wie lautet das unternehmerische Verständnis der Nachhaltigkeit? Wie sieht das unternehmerische Nachhaltigkeitsmanagement konkret aus? Was sind die Ziele, wo sind sie verankert, und wo werden sie gemessen? Woran ist erkennbar, dass Nachhaltigkeit ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Unternehmensstrategie ist? Wer ist wofür verantwortlich?

Der ehrbare Aufsichtsrat hat „den Vorstand zu bestellen, zu überwachen und zu beraten und gegebenenfalls in dessen Entscheidungen einzugreifen, indem er zum Wohle der Gesellschaft seine Zustimmung zu Geschäften auch verweigert."" Er lehnt allerdings auch gegebenenfalls eine Berufung in ein Gremium ab und bewertet die Zugehörigkeit zu einer vermeintlich anzustrebenden Gruppe nicht über. „Er folgt lieber seinem eigenen Werte-Kanon"", so Ruter.

Was ihn ausmacht, ist die Fähigkeit zur inneren Reflexion, des Überdenkens und Unterbrechens, „weil er emotional, materiell und persönlich unabhängig ist."" Es geht ihm nicht um das maximale betriebswirtschaftliche Optimum, sondern um das abwägende Innehalten eines rechten Maßes, einer richtigen Urteilsfindung und Entscheidung.

Ruters inhaltlicher Ansatz hängt auch mit der vorgenommenen Änderung innerhalb der Präambel des Deutschen Corporate Governance Index zum Verhalten von Vorständen und Aufsichtsräten zusammen. Hier werden Wirtschaftslenker daran erinnert, dass ihr Verhalten nicht nur legal sein, sondern auch ethisch fundiert und verantwortlich sein sollte. Das sollte zwar selbstverständlich sein, doch wie Ereignisse auch der jüngsten Vergangenheit zeigen, ist es das leider nicht immer. Fairness und eine Haltung der Verantwortlichkeit kann zwar nicht durch Gesetze verordnet werden, aber eine nachhaltige, leistungsfähige und wettbewerbsfähige Wirtschaft braucht Recht und Ethik, die (festgeschriebene) Verpflichtung auf Legalität und auf ethisch fundiertes, verantwortliches Verhalten.

Bereits 1999 stellte der Bundesgerichtshof fest, dass Aufsichtsräte haften, wenn sie Vorstände, die Schaden verursacht haben, dafür nicht in Anspruch nehmen.

Können statt Quote - was einen guten Aufsichtsrat ausmacht

Es geht heute um Können und Kompetenzen statt Quote. Das zeigt sich am Beispiel einer der besten Spitzeningenieurinnen Deutschlands: Univ.-Prof. Dr. Marion A. Weissenberger-Eibl leitet das Fraunhofer-Institut für System- und Innovationsforschung ISI und ist Inhaberin des Lehrstuhls Innovations- und TechnologieManagement am Institut für Entrepreneurship, Technologie-Management und Innovation (ENTECHNON) am Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT).

Seit Juli 2012 ist sie Mitglied im Aufsichtsrat der HeidelbergCement AG. Zuvor konnte der Baustofflieferant keine einzige Frau in Vorstand und Aufsichtsrat vorweisen. Sie bildet mit ihrer Erfahrung und Kompetenz in den Bereichen Innovationsforschung, Foresight, Roadmapping und Szenarienentwicklung, demografische Entwicklung, Nachhaltigkeit und Wissensmanagement eine Ergänzung für das Unternehmen. Außerdem wurde sie im Mai 2013 in den Aufsichtsrat der MTU Aero Engines AG gewählt. Seit Mai 2016 ist sie Mitglied im Aufsichtsrat der Rheinmetall AG.

Das Thema Innovation wird für Unternehmen auch künftig immer essentiell sein - deshalb möchte sie sich auch in Zukunft intensiv damit auseinandersetzen. Ihre Erfahrung ist, dass Entscheider aus allen gesellschaftlichen Teilbereichen, insbesondere aber der Politik, Wirtschaft und Wissenschaft, die Impulse aus der angewandten Innovationsforschung interessiert aufgreifen, um Deutschland auf allen Ebenen voranzubringen.

Neugierde ist für sie eine sehr nützliche Eigenschaft, da sie einen immer aufs Neue motiviert, den Dingen nachzuspüren und die Hintergründe auch komplexester Sachverhalte aufzudecken, die sich nicht auf den ersten Blick erschließen. Sie ist es, die herausragenden Leistungen vorausgeht. Auch in ihrer Arbeit als Aufsichtsrätin profitiert sie von dieser Eigenschaft, denn nachhaltiges Handeln braucht einen ganzheitlichen Blick.

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke of the national vision to double farmers' income, laying it out as a challenge last year, many have partaken in suggesting strategies, programmes, and resources to achieve this objective. These include policymakers, ex-policymakers, industry councils, students, well-wishers, and most importantly, farmers.

A certain consistency is evident among the recommendations that are put forth. The uninitiated profess that a quick and straightforward solution is possible to the complexities of agriculture. Those more rooted in ground level realities, including farmers themselves, will seek coherent tackling of the wide variety of concerns.

Usually, the novice will suggest raising subsidies on agricultural inputs, a-la the Chinese model, and raising the government administered support price for certain crops. In effect, they wish that the government subsidise the production, and thereafter purchase the output at a raised cost. This essentially means that agriculture be addressed as a public sector project, and worse, with logic that advocates to further expand the inbuilt inefficiencies.

It is ingenuous minds who raise imagery of a perpetual cycle of under-priced inputs and artificially priced outputs; a cycle of fabricated demand and magical reality.

Sadly, such naiveté is not unique to novices but has also been the approach of a few 'experts', who tend to pursue answers to sequential equations, seemingly unaware of the magnitude and diversity of variables that agriculturists have always sought to balance.

A wider market offers optimal price, the common citizen being the largest source of revenue for farmers.

There are some who also profess that this vision is a pipe dream and needs divine intervention. India has passed the age of 'bearded babas waving magic wands', is increasingly grounded in reality, and seeks sustainable answers with long-term solutions.

These kind of suggestions are from those who remain unable to perceive the farmer as an enterprising business person, one who seeks to expand and grow, rightfully. Instead they, consciously or subconsciously, accede farming to be a failed venture, whose growth cannot be linked to its markets. Lacking capacity, such proposals are stop-gap answers and inadequate in vision and understanding.

Agriculture is not bound by the few crops that have administered or minimum support prices (MSP). Farmers output a large bouquet of produce, in multiples of the MSP rated crops. The MSP mechanism benefits very few farmers who grow wheat, paddy, sugarcane and cotton, and only in regions where it is honoured through linked procurement.

Physical access to a one-India market, one of the largest in the world, is what the farmers really strive for.

The government's own procurement is limited in range and coverage (for building strategic buffers mainly), and the administered price system is a minimum cost-plus model to offer margin support. Whereas a wider market offers optimal price, the common citizen being the largest source of revenue for farmers. Ineffectual linkage with this larger market disallows farmers from connecting with the best value, leaving them no recourse but to settle for minimum returns.

Farmers today, need to monetise their produce for optimal value. Not just the reprieve at any nearby market, but at markets further afield where they feed real and ready demand. Physical access to a one-India market, one of the largest in the world, is what the farmers really strive for. They are not ones who pursue gratuity in perpetuity but seek equal opportunity and scope to grow. Growth that will come when agriculture is developed as any business enterprise should be driven by a value that is market-led. Anything less means being sated with cost-plus models or waivers, and thereby missing the bigger agenda.

The Prime Minister's challenge was not a loosely cast gauntlet, asking for quick-fix reactions. His dare positions a short-term objective and lays the ground for a changed approach in thought and action: on how we treat farmers. It directs towards a very long-term progressive phase in India's future. This is not a matter to be scoffed or one that invites counter challenges, it is actually a notion towards greater national prosperity, inspiring and one that must be worked and advanced upon.

A committee for doubling farmers' income, constituted by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare, has introduced what is probably the most extensive and comprehensive series, of both the strategies and the tactics, of implementable actions that will lead to sustained income growth for farmers.

Also known as the DFI Committee, its draft reports are available on the Ministry's website, inviting public comments. All concerned should review the documents with a holistic perspective, and suggest how various proposals by the committee can be strengthened for a more constructive and coherent phase in India's nation-building.

It is time to redefine agriculture, with a vision that is not constrained by past insecurities

Primarily, future strategies must aim to ensure that farmers are empowered with a choice of market. Farmers need not monetise their produce only through near-farm transactions, but be facilitated with agri-logistics to connect with the pan-India market, so as to supply at the best price possible.

The consumers' changing preferences and associated demand cannot be de-linked from farmers' income growth. Market-led agriculture must replace blind drives to increase production. Higher output does not add to income unless connected with markets. The marketing system itself needs to be opened up, disabling the rules that discourage wider participation from entrepreneurs.

It is time to break the shackles that weigh down agriculture, the very restraints that were released off industry in the liberalisation years. It is time to redefine agriculture, with a vision that is not constrained by past insecurities, and revamp the heartland of India. There is no India, no city, no society, without agriculture and this reality is slowly sinking in.

Agriculture will, and slowly is, recovering its rightful place in our socio-economic matrix; we just need to accelerate this momentum sensibly. Not for now, or for tomorrow, but for many coming decades.

Jetzt ist diese Form des Protests auch in Deutschland angekommen. Die Fußballer des Hauptstadtklubs Hertha BSC sind im Heimspiel gegen den FC Schalke 04 in die Knie gegangen. Auch Trainer Pal Dardai und Manager Michael Preetz nahmen vor der Ersatzbank an der Aktion teil.

Kniefall aus Protest gegen rassistische Gewalt

Geprägt hat den Kniefall Colin Kapernick, ehemaliger Football-Quarterback der San Francisco 49ers. Kapernick will mit dem Kniefall gegen rassistische Gewalt, vor allem von Polizisten, demonstrieren. Mittlerweile ist aus dem Hymnen-Boykott in den USA eine wahre Protestwelle geworden – auch wegen US-Präsident Donald Trump.

Trump wütete mehrfach gegen die Geste und provozierte so sehr, dass noch mehr Sportler vor dem Spiel in die Knie gingen, um gegen Rassismus zu demonstrieren.

Auch die Berliner erklärten via Twitter: ""Hertha BSC steht für Vielfalt, Toleranz und Verantwortung! Für ein Berlin, dass auch in Zukunft weltoffen ist!""

Viele Internetnutzer sympathisierten mit der Aktion. Doch gerade aus der rechten Szene gab es wütende Kommentare.

""Wie peinlich ist das denn"", schrieb ein Nutzer bei Twitter. ""Systemtreue Gutmenschen"" seien die Fußballer. ""Wie kann man nur Sport für Politisches missbrauchen"", kommentierte ein anderer Nutzer, der den Spielern ""scheinheiliges Getue"" vorwarf.

Temperatures as high as 25c are predicted to hit isolated parts of east and south east England on Monday, while western and northern parts and Northern Ireland are subject to alerts over strong wind.

The average October temperature is a mild 15c, meaning Monday’s predicted highs would be unusual.

“In readiness, we have already issued Yellow wind warnings for Northern Ireland and parts of western and northern Britain for Monday and Tuesday, suggesting wind gusts possibly reaching up to 80mph in places.

“Although parts of the UK may experience severe conditions, it’s important to realise that not all areas will be affected by this ex-hurricane.

“For example, much of eastern England will be unusually warm for the time of year but quite breezy on Monday and Tuesday.”

The runways this September were the most “diverse” since, well, ever, according to The Fashion Spot’s Diversity Report, which was released on Thursday 12 October.

Whilst this is a step in the right direction, the catwalk representation still leaves much to be desired - as across London, New York, Milan and Paris, 69.8% of castings were white models and just 30.2% were women of colour.

Though The Fashion Spot does not get into the details about the backgrounds which make up the non-white models, with less than a third of models being non-white it’s clear that there was not room for fair representation of people of different ethnic origins.

New York has led the cities in embracing diversity for a few seasons now, Jennifer Davidson, editor-in-chief of The Fashion Spot, told HuffPost UK that there increase in diversity cannot be seen as a reaction to Trump.

“There are many factors at play here, including societal changes, vocal cries for diversity, more diverse casting options than ever before, and designers that consistently embrace diversity in many forms,” she said.

A post shared by BySymphony.com (@bysymphony) on Oct 4, 2017 at 9:42am PDT

However, when the words diversity is used - it seems as though there is still a narrow and non-inclusive thinking on what that really means.

For example, across all fashion weeks, South Asian and Indigenous models were a rare sight and the hunger for these faces was made apparent when a South Asian model was put in the limelight.

Supriya Lele, an emerging fashion designer who is part of the Fashion East initiative, held one of the only shows to open with a South Asian model: Chawntell Kulkarni.

London’s Teatum Jones’ show also included plus-size and disabled models.

Similarly for gender, 2017 showcased a rise in transgender and non-binary appearances occurring in New York, as well as 10 trans and non-binary castings in Paris, seven in Milan and one in London.

So what can we expect from next season?

Davidson states: “I think size diversity is the next frontier: curve models walking alongside straight-size models on the runway. A few designers (Christian Siriano, Michael Kors, Prabal Gurung, for example) have shown that this can be done successfully and organically.”

Sie behaupten, Bass habe der Türkei mit Angriffen des sogenannten Islamischen Staates gedroht

Es ist ein historischer Tiefpunkt in den Beziehungen zwischen der Türkei und den USA. In der Visa-Krise hat der türkische Staatspräsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan die Amerikaner erneut scharf angegriffen.

Im Mittelpunkt des Konfliktes steht ein Mann: John Bass, scheidender US-Botschafter in Ankara.

Erdogan warf der US-Regierung am Donnerstag in einer Rede vor Gouverneuren vor, die strategische Partnerschaft mit der Türkei für einen ""frechen Botschafter"" zu opfern.

Auch die türkische Presse schoss sich am Donnerstag auf Bass ein, den die Führung der AKP für die Eskalation verantwortlich macht.

► Der Hintergrund: Die USA hatten am Sonntag die Vergabe von Visa in ihren Vertretungen in der Türkei auf unbestimmte Zeit ausgesetzt. Hintergrund ist die Inhaftierung eines türkischen Mitarbeiters des US-Konsulats in Istanbul in der vergangenen Woche.

Die Medienkampagne, die die regierungsnahen Medien in der Türkei jetzt gegen die USA lostraten, ging jedoch noch viel weiter als die bisherigen gegenseitigen Vorwürfen.

""Die USA kontrollieren den IS""

Die konservative Zeitung ""Takvim"" warf Bass vor, der Türkei mit Angriffen des IS gedroht zu haben. Bass habe vor Journalisten erklärt, das Land habe den USA zu danken, dass die Terrormiliz dort in den vergangenen neuneinhalb Monaten keine Anschläge verübt habe.

""Das ist kein Beweis, dass der IS aufgegeben hat, sondern Resultat unserer Kooperation"", hatte Bass gesagt. Was er wohl meinte: Die Unterstützung der USA für die Regierung in Ankara habe den IS bislang abgeschreckt.

Die AKP-nahe Zeitung ""Aksam"" behauptete darauf, Bass habe zugegeben, die USA würden den IS kontrollieren: ""Der IS hat unter der Führung der Vereinigten Staaten gehandelt."" Bass drohe zwischen den Zeilen mit neuen Terroranschlägen in der Türkei.

Der Botschafter, der gerade vom US-Senat als neuer US-Vertreter im Afghanistan bestätigt wurde, habe während seiner Zeit in der Türkei enge Kontakte mit Gülenisten unterhalten, behauptete die ""Takvim"" – also mit Unterstützern des islamischen Predigers Fethullah Gülen, den die türkische Regierung als Terroristen einstuft.

Bedrängen die USA die Türkei von Bulgarien aus?

Die kleinere Zeitung ""Aydınlık"" berichtete indes gar von einem US-amerikanischen Plan, die Türkei militärisch von Norden unter Druck zu setzen.

Die USA hätten demnach amerikanische Soldaten von Rumänien über Bulgarien Richtung türkische Grenze geschickt. 2500 Soldaten seien demnach in Bulgarien stationiert, einige nur 60 Kilometer von der türkischen Grenze entfernt.

""Es geht darum, die Türkei zu umzingeln"", schreibt die Zeitung.

In anderen türkischen Medien ist die Rede von einem kurdischen Korridor gegen die Türkei, den die USA errichte. Gemeint sind die kurdisch kontrollierten Gebiete im Norden des Iraks und Syriens, wo die USA verschiedene Kurden-Gruppierungen unterstützt.

Auch Erdogan bediente am Donnerstag Verschwörungstheorien gegen die USA.

Es gebe ""eine Fraktion der alten Regierung, die versucht unsere Beziehung zu torpedieren"", sagte der türkische Präsident. Für die Eskalation sei also die Obama-Führung verantwortlich.

Al inicio de la semana, unos días antes de que comenzara la cuarta ronda de negociaciones del TLCAN, empresarios estadounidenses de 314 cámaras de comercio, estatales y locales en 50 estados, enviaron una carta a Trump para convencerlo de que ese país debe permanecer en el Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte.

""Apoyamos sus esfuerzos para modernizar el TLCAN.

Alerta Roja

El martes 10 de octubre, un día antes de que los equipos negociadores comenzaran los diálogos en EU, los líderes de las principales cámaras de comercio en Estados Unidos y México expusieron que el fin del TLCAN era una posibilidad real.

""Hemos alcanzado un momento crítico y la Cámara no tiene más opción que hacer sonar las campanas de alarma"" dijo Thomas J. Donohue, presidente y CEO de la U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Los líderes empresariales a lo largo de EU saben de primera mano que el comercio con Canadá y México ha creado empleos para estadounidenses Extracto de una carta de empresarios a Trump

Estos principios elementales del TLCAN para los empresarios son, precisamente, los que Trump quiere revertir: menos apertura comercial, con reglas de origen más estrictas; aranceles específicos para ciertos productos; y , de forma indirecta, menos competitividad con la eliminación de los mecanismos para resolver disputas comerciales contenidos en el Capítulo 19.

Decir adiós a tener mal acuerdo

En un encuentro de los CEO de ambos países el miércoles, los empresarios mexicanos dijeron que prefieren que se acabe con el TLCAN a tener un acuerdo perjudicial.

""Estamos mucho peor con un mal acuerdo que sin un acuerdo"", dijo Guillermo Vogel, vicepresidente de la siderúrgica Tenaris.

Advirtió que con el fin del acuerdo comercial ""todas las partes perderían"", pero que el intercambio entre Estados Unidos y México sin TLCAN podría llevar a un déficit comercial estadounidense mayor a los 64 mil millones de dólares.

Trudeau hablará con Trump para desviar la ""mala vibra"" hacia México en TLCAN

""El enfoque claro fue: tenemos que mandar la señal, los mensajes a todas las diferentes contrapartes del error que sería cancelar el TLCAN o hacer un mal TLCAN"", dijo Vogel en una entrevista con Reuters.

Estas muestras de preocupación en el sector empresarial se dieron ante los síntomas innegables de que las negociaciones para modernizar el TLCAN avanzan muy lentamente y la postura del presidente Trump se ha radicalizado.

Trump siendo Trump y TLCAN en lento

Con la mitad de las rondas de negociación concluidas, los equipos negociadores del México, Estados Unidos y Canadá apenas habían logrado cerrar un capítulo sobre las pequeñas y medianas empresas, pero nada sobre los temas más espinosos: reglas de origen, déficit comercial, capítulo 19.

Que dice Trump que con Canadá sí hace negocios, pero con México no

Por esta razón, los expertos predecían que la cuarta ronda, que inició ayer en Washington, sería la primera de las arduas rondas a las que se enfrentarán los equipos negociadores. Al inicio de la ronda, un capítulo más se cerró: competitividad. Pero aún con ello el avance es lentísimo, considerando la ambiciosa meta de concluir la negociación en 2017, antes de las elecciones presidenciales en México.

Ese mismo día por la tarde, el presidente Trump se reunió con el Primer Ministro de Canadá, Justin Trudeau, y el resultado no fue nada favorable para México.

¡Albricias! Negociadores del TLCAN pactan nuevo capítulo en EU

El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, dijo el miércoles que está abierto a un acuerdo bilateral con Canadá pero sin México si las conversaciones del Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte (TLCAN) entre los tres países no prosperan.

The Indian Express reported today that a Muslim man was dragged out of a hotel in Rajasthan and beaten for being with a Hindu woman.

According to the news report, shortly after they had checked into the Mansarover Hotel located in Barmer district, the relatives of the Rajput woman arrived at the location and assaulted the Muslim man.

In addition to the woman's family members, hotel owner Multan Parihar said that men from the Shiva Sena, a Hindu fundamentalist party headquartered in Maharashtra, were part of the mob that assaulted the Muslim man. They insisted it was a case of ""Love Jihad.""

Parihar told IE, ""Padu Khan, about 25, had checked in our hotel along with a middle-aged woman around 10 am. The woman was wearing a traditional Rajasthani attire. About half-an -hour later, the woman's relatives somehow came to know that she was here and five persons reached the hotel.""

""I then went out, but soon afterwards, my staff informed me about a mob. Men from Shiv Sena had gathered outside and dragged Khan out of the hotel,"" he said. ""They were chanting 'Jai Sri Ram' and brutally assaulting him. Had police delayed any more, he could have been lynched.""

Khan has been admitted to hospital.

The revelations are distressing enough for most readers, but particularly survivors of rape, sexual assault and abuse for whom the reports may be triggering.

Meena Kumari, National Lead for Domestic Violence and Abuse at independent charity Victim Support said the trauma may be “exacerbated when the event or a similar incident are elaborately reported in the media, forcing survivors to relive that experience and past trauma”.

“Sexual violence is a traumatic experience and those who are subjected to it can experience post-traumatic stress symptoms in the same way that those who’ve survived other kinds of trauma might,” a spokesperson for Rape Crisis told HuffPost UK.

Approximately 85,000 women and 12,000 men are raped in England and Wales alone every year, and nearly half a million adults are sexually assaulted.

Not only could certain details cause flashbacks for these individuals, but he manner of reporting can have a lasting impact.

The Rape Crisis spokesperson said: “The way stories like this are reported can sometimes implicitly or less so imply that the victim or survivor was someone partly responsible for the violence perpetrated against them.

“This victim-blaming can add to their own sense of self-blame, shame or guilt, for not being able to prevent or fend off the attack or abuse, for example.”

Caitlin Roper, founder of Collective Shout, a grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification and sexualisation of women, said that revelations such as this can be “devastating” for onlookers with histories of rape and sexual assault.

“It is a painful reminder of how our society regards women who come forward and speak honestly about what has been done to them, and a preview of the treatment they can expect should they speak out themselves.”

However, she believes that the impact of seeing so many women having the bravery to come forward and tell their stories can have a positive impact.

“It can be very validating for survivors to know that other women, perhaps even women they respect, have been through similar experiences and found the strength to overcome them,” she said. “It can be healing to see this abusive treatment of women being widely condemned as wrong and unacceptable.”

It’s important for survivors to safeguard themselves by regularly checking in with how they’re feeling.

Kumari said: “Our advice to anyone who has experienced a sexual assault or for anyone supporting someone through this would be to seek help early on. Early intervention to treat initial signs of stress and trauma can prevent the onset of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).”

Victim Support provided a list of the many potential symptoms associated with trauma:

· Emotional experiences such as shock and numbness, fear and anxiety, helplessness, irritability, lack of confidence, low self-esteem, fear of a similar incident occurring again and also guilt

· Some symptoms may affect people socially such as becoming withdrawn, conflict within relationships and avoidance

· Psychological experiences such as distressing thoughts and images, impaired memory and concentration, disorientation and hypervigilance are common

· There are also physical effects which can range from poor sleep, headaches, insomnia, a lack of appetite and low energy levels

It isn’t just survivors who might be able to spot they aren’t coping with the news cycle, friends and family can also play a crucial role.

Rape Crisis spokesperson advised: “The most important thing is to listen and be patient, allowing them to talk in their own time and not pressuring them into one course of action or another, even if you think something, like therapy or reporting to the police for example, is for their own good or is what you would do in their situation.”

Nos explicó que un perro que se fatiga de un modo excesivo durante el ejercicio, los juegos o los paseos al aire libre puede padecer un problema cardiaco. Frida y el resto de perritos de la unidad canina de Sumar reciben un arduo entrenamiento para cumplir con sus funciones. Y aunque la exposición mediática que les exige estar en más de dos sitios el mismo día, por varios días, no se compara con la exigencia física que demanda cumplir con su deber (y para lo que fueron amaestrados).

Una carga excesiva de labores puede derivar en letargo agotamiento para los perros, que a su vez, es un síntoma no específico que podría señalar una variedad de potenciales desórdenes subyacentes, entre los cuales se encuentran algunos que son graves o hasta mortales.

""Un colapso o un desmayo son situaciones de emergencia, incluso si el perro se recupera rápidamente y parece estar normal en poco tiempo"", señaló.

""Todas las causas del desmayo o colapso son graves y podrían desembocar en un problema potencial del sistema nervioso (cerebro, médula espinal o nervios), del sistema músculo esquelético (huesos, articulaciones y músculos), del sistema circulatorio (corazón, vasos sanguíneos, sangre), o del sistema respiratorio (boca, nariz, garganta, pulmones) y esto se puede prevenir con debidos y oportunos periodos de descanso"".

Specifically, the Donald Trump-impersonating “Saturday Night Live” star is annoyed that Fox News is attacking Harvey Weinstein over sexual harassment allegations after the conservative network covered up harassment within its own ranks by former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes and former host Bill O’Reilly.

“Fox commentators think the worst should come down on Weinstein and his company,” Baldwin tweeted on Saturday. “Ailes is dead. But O’Reilly’s alive. So...?”

Shortly before that tweet, Baldwin retweeted Think Progress reporter Judd Legum’s message calling out a particular statement by Fox News analyst Gregg Jarrett.

“The Weinstein Company should shut its doors,” Jarrett had said on Fox News.

“Oh, so companies with pervasive sexual harassment issues at the leadership level should shut down?” Legum said in the tweet shared by Baldwin. “Interesting idea.”

Fox News and O’Reilly paid $13 million to five women to try to cover up the sexual harassment allegations made against the former host of “The O’Reilly Factor.” The network fired O’Reilly earlier this year and chose Tucker Carlson to replace him.

In 2006, Carlson said that Democrats made up the idea of sexual harassment: “This is a group that made up the concept of sexual harassment. ‘You look great today.’ ‘Boom, I‘m charging you with a crime.’”

21st Century Fox has had to pay over $50 million to settle harassment claims against the network.

Baldwin, of course, doesn’t have a sterling reputation when it comes to his treatment of women either, although not in the same way. His divorce from Kim Basinger was particularly acrimonious, but Basinger says the two are “cool now.” In 2007, he infamously left a voicemail to his 11-year-old daughter, Ireland, calling her a “rude little pig.” Baldwin has expressed much regret about that voicemail over the last decade, and his daughter now publicly jokes about it with him.

“It’s a scab that never heals, ’cause it’s being picked at all the time by other people,” Baldwin said on “Good Morning America” earlier this year. “My daughter, that’s hurt her in a permanent way.”

Her most recent trip was pretty different because she brought along her 12-week-old baby Lexi. She met with several people -- none of whom had any issue with her bringing her baby with her.

Murphy, an expert in influencer marketing, told HuffPost Australia she set about booking in meetings with her existing UK contacts. She also reached out to some new people. She let everybody know that little Lexi would be coming too.

""One acquaintance replied to my LinkedIn Inmail saying she'd be very keen to meet, at which point we switched to email. We arranged a lunch date for the following week, and I let her know that I'd have my teeny sidekick with me. A few hours later, I received an email that was clearly destined for her assistant,"" Murphy said.

""Reading the email, I felt like I'd been kicked in the guts. I was deeply hurt. I was outraged on behalf of our little daughter.""

""And then I got angry. Really f***ing angry. I fired off an email response and ate some cake (a citron tart if you'd like specifics).""

Murphy then shared the exchange on her social channels, where she had hundreds of comments, shares and then 57,000 people saw her LinkedIn post.

""Of course, that would be a complete waste of their time, and, quite frankly, mine as well. But I don't believe that this should be a 'women's problem'. More and more parents are starting their own businesses, a life choice that I know from more than five years of experience places demands on every aspect of our lives,"" Murphy said.

After the tragedy two months ago where more than 60 children had died in Gorakhpur's BRD medical college, reports suggest that another such disaster has unfolded in the hospital in Uttar Pradesh with the death of 69 children since October 7.

Indian Express reports that 12 children died on October 7, 20 on October 8, 18 died on October 9 and 19 died on October.

The report says that of the 19 deaths yesterday, 13 were newborns. All of them have reportedly died of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome.

This disaster should, perhaps, serve as a wake up call for Yogi Adityanath who had bragged about UP's health care at a rally in Kerala. He had even said that Kerala should learn how to run hospitals from UP.

Adityanath's statements ring hollow at a time when, clearly, the health care system is consistently failing to cope up with an encephalitis epidemic.

This comes even has the Uttar Pradesh government had faced severe criticism for the deaths of 60 children, allegedly because of lack of oxygen, which the government had vehemently denied.

The National Human Rights Commission had issued a notice to the Government of Uttar Pradesh saying it ""has observed that reported deaths, in such a large number in a government run hospital, amount to serious violation of Right to Life and Health of the innocent victims. This indicates towards gross callousness on part of the hospital administration and the Medical Education and Health Department of the Government of Uttar Pradesh. Earlier also, it has come across several instances of deaths in the hospitals due to Japanese Encephalitis.""

The chief of the hospital, who was suspended after the incident two months ago, had also blamed the government of apathy.

""The delay (in payments) happened because the funds hadn't come in,"" Dr Misra had said at a press conference after his suspension.

He said that he had written three letters to the government flagging the issue. The first letter, he said, was sent to the government on 3 July.

The government, meanwhile, had said that deaths of children in the hospital this year was much lower than previous years due to steps taken by the administration.","69 Children Have Died in Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College In the Last 4 Days, Says Report",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/12/69-children-have-died-in-gorakhpurs-brd-medical-college-in-the-last-4-days-says-report_a_23240862/

Let's face it: what do you look for when you're in the market for a new smartphone? Sure, you may consider the storage space or the speed but when it comes down to it, the first question most people ask is 'how good is the camera?'.

It was the first question we asked when the iPhone 8 Plus was released a few weeks back and so we've been having a play to fill you in.

Portrait Mode was introduced with the 7 Plus but what's new is the introduction of Portrait Lighting. It pimps out the feature even further, but as a recap, Portrait Mode essentially lets you take cool portraits (hence the name) of a subject.

What it does is makes the the person or thing is in focus and the background or non important matter is out of focus. The result is a pic that looks super professional, like it was taken on a DSLR.

Now with the addition of Portrait Lighting you can play around with the brightness and shade even further to get a really good shot.

There are five lighting modes:

Natural Light . Your subject's face in sharp focus against a blurred background;

. Your subject's face in sharp focus against a blurred background; Studio Light . A clean look with your subject's face brightly lit;

. A clean look with your subject's face brightly lit; Contour Light . Dramatic shadows with highlights and lowlights;

. Dramatic shadows with highlights and lowlights; Stage Light . Your subject's face spotlit against a deep black background;

. Your subject's face spotlit against a deep black background; Stage Light Mono. Like Stage, but in classic black-and-white.

I snapped this pic of my friend Deni really quickly while walking down the street.

The one tricky thing to get used to with Portrait Mode is that it's a lot more 'zoomed in'. This is because the subject is meant to be a certain distance from you (fairly close but not too much), and then the background a certain distance from the subject, for the best result. This takes a little getting used to but definitely produces the best images.

Apple suggests shooting against a non-solid background to get the most out of the depth effect, so try to position your subject against a busy background or a colourful setting. It's also suggested that when using Stage Lighting, try shooting a photo slightly below your subject's face level.

These extra effects make this smartphone the ideal camera for parents, proud pet owners or anyone who enjoys taking photos, really.

It also has a really impressive video offering. It suggested you take video in landscape to get the full effect and there's a whole bunch of new features when it comes to filming, too. They welcome 4k video (which means it's faster and better quality) and they have improved on the slo-mo feature as well as the optical zoom -- the dual-lens camera means you can now get videos with optical zoom at 2x, so zooming in isn't totally grainy.

Otro exministro del Interior socialista, José Antonio Alonso, decía: ""El día en el que los guardias civiles acabaron el los etarras"".
Era suficientemente sólido como pata que el que tenía que tomar la decisión la tomase.","""ETA está ya fuera del mundo"", dice el exministro del Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba. Casi sin darnos cuenta -porque pronto se acostumbra el hombre a lo bueno- España ha salido de las tinieblas del terror etarra, que deja tras de sí 829 muertos y miles de heridos, secuestrados, extorsionados y amenazados. Pero para que hoy las nuevas generaciones casi tengan que buscar en la Wikipedia quiénes eran estos encapuchados sanguinarios, antes ha habido que trabajar mucho y sufrir más. Decir que la Guardia Civil lo ha hecho como nadie -lo uno y lo otro- es sencillamente verdad, aunque este país desmemoriado se lo ha aplaudido poco.

Para poner en valor esa labor y completar, a la vez, la derrota literaria de ETA que defiende Fernando Aramburu, autor de Patria, acaba de salir a la luz Sangre, sudor y paz. La Guardia Civil contra ETA (Península), una obra hecha con información y testimonios de primera mano, a medio camino entre el atestado policial, la crónica periodística y, por momentos, la novela negra. La escriben a tres manos el periodista de El Español Gonzalo Araluce (nieto de un asesinado de la banda, Juan María Araluce, presidente de la Diputación de Guipúzcoa), el coronel Manuel Sánchez (hoy al mando de la Unidad Central Operativa de la Guardia Civil, hijo y nieto de guardias destinados en el norte y con 25 años dedicados a la lucha antiterrorista) y el escritor Lorenzo Silva (que también lleva unos trienios como guardia honorario y ha creado la pareja más conocida del Cuerpo: la de Rubén Bevilacqua y Virginia Chamorro).

Con los dos últimos conversamos en El HuffPost sobre este libro que narra los orígenes, el auge y la caída de la mayor amenaza para la reciente democracia española.

- ¿Están de acuerdo con el exministro Rubalcaba? ¿De verdad que sí podemos hablar de ETA en pasado, como algo acabado, sólo con su entrega de armas, sin un acta de defunción en forma de disolución?

MS- Sí, absolutamente. En 2009 se produjo el último asesinato, han pasado ya ocho años y hoy no existen. No hay gente en la banda, no hay miembros no ya activos, sino ni siquiera pensando en hacer cosas. Aunque quisieran no tienen ninguna capacidad ni ningún apoyo social en el País Vasco. Armas... alguna pistola quedará, sí, y matar es fácil, los islamistas lo hacen con un cuchillo, pero con todo creo que han interiorizado absolutamente que han perdido y eso es lo principal. Aunque alguno tenga aún alguna idea peregrina, han encajado -ellos y toda la sociedad vasca- que han sido derrotados.

- ¿Qué porcentaje de culpa tiene la Guardia Civil en esa derrota? En en libro relatan cómo se fueron sumando a la pelea los jueces, los fiscales y los políticos, pero eso vino con el tiempo. Cuerpos como la Europol dicen que no hay operación comparable en el mundo.

MS - Yo creo que se nos valora, de verdad, y en el tema de ETA creo que ya es asumido por todo el mundo que el esfuerzo principal, aunque no me atrevería a dar porcentajes, lo hemos llevado nosotros, porque hemos sido también el colectivo más atacado, el que más esfuerzo ha puesto en que no nos siguieran atacando más. Había que acabar con el problema porque, aparte de ser una obligación legal porque somos agentes de la autoridad, éramos su principal objetivo. Eso nos hizo convertirnos también a nosotros en el principal enemigo para ellos. Mucha gente ha colaborado, sería injusto no citarlos: jueces, fiscales, periodistas, la sociedad, el servicio exterior, el servicio de inteligencia... Muchos, pero ETA nos ha hecho a nosotros ser su principal enemigo y tener el sitio que hemos tenido en esta historia.

ETA ha interiorizado absolutamente que ha perdido

- ¿Se ha sido justo en el tratamiento de la Guardia Civil como víctima? ¿No ha pesado la losa del supuesto lazo con el franquismo, esa falta de empatía con el Cuerpo? Porque suma más de 200 muertos, desde el primero de la banda, Pardines, a los últimos en suelo español, Saénz de Tejada y Salvá...

LS: - Creo que al principio se fue -y no es una creencia caprichosa- muy injusto con la Guardia Civil. La sociedad española fue muy ingrata con quienes asumían el sacrificio de ir tras ETA, los guardias civiles estaban en la primera línea de la primera línea, porque estaban desplegados en el País Vasco y eran desde el inicio objetivo preferente, pero no se tuvo ni siquiera consideración ni delicadeza ni con viudas ni con huérfanos... Contamos algún caso de cómo después de perder al marido y al padre lo que venía era el desahucio, porque perdías la casa, es decir, había una falta de consideración realmente flagrante, que probablemente tenía que ver con esa visión de la Guardia Civil como un cuerpo aún identificado con el régimen anterior.

- Que no comparte...

LS: -No, no, es que no es correcta. Esa es una visión contra la que yo me sublevo siempre. Me gusta recordar que cuando la Guardia Civil tenía 50 años, Francisco Franco llevaba pañales, que ponerle a la Guardia Civil el sambenito de institución franquista no sólo es una inexactitud histórica flagrante sino una injusticia. Dicho esto, a medida que fueron avanzando los años y que se fue viendo y percibiendo por parte de la sociedad española no sólo el papel que jugaba el cuerpo sino que probablemente frente a esa amenaza no había una defensa mejor que los guardias, afortunadamente eso fue cambiando y creo que al final sí que se tuvo esa consideración. Hay un contraste muy fuerte y duro entre esos primeros asesinados del País Vasco y el atentado ya en las postrimerías en Mallorca, el tratamiento que tuvieron esas familias, el funeral... Claramente había cambiado todo y la sociedad española empezó a tenerles un cierto reconocimiento y en este momento, salvo personas muy recalcitrantes que siguen ancladas en estereotipos y en imágenes del pasado, que tienen un interés muy intenso en perpetuar y mantener ciertas ideas, la percepción del conjunto de la ciudadanía española es mucho más justa, es agradecida, y no lo digo yo, lo dicen las encuestas.

(Puedes seguir leyendo tras la foto...).

- ¿Cómo se ha acabado realmente con ETA?

MS: - Con mucho esfuerzo, mucho trabajo, yendo paso a paso. Al principio no, la pelea hasta casi el año 89 era de pura subsistencia, pero de ese año para acá ya se empezó a trabajar con la finalidad no sólo de que no nos mataran, que también, sino de acabar con ETA definitivamente. Llega un momento donde uno ya se quita de encima la caraja y la torpeza y la incapacidad y ya toca enfrentarse y decir: ""Vamos a ver cómo acabamos con estos"". Es verdad que luego, hasta 2009, pasaron 20 años, pero ya los pasos iban encaminados a eso, a que ETA dejase de existir, no sólo a detener a los comandos...

LS: -Y como no lo va a decir Manuel lo digo yo. La clave del cómo está en la segunda palabra del título de este libro. Hace un buen resumen de la historia porque la clave está en el sudor, en el esfuerzo para reunir la información suficiente, para poder combatir y contrarrestar a un grupo terrorista profundamente enraizado en una sociedad que le prestaba un intenso apoyo. El sudor y el esfuerzo no sólo para obtener esa información sino para procesarla, construirla, desarrollarla y explotarla debidamente, no a las primeras de cambio, sino a veces tardando muchos meses para que los resultados fueran realmente efectivos. La clave es desde luego la inteligencia, que era muy difícil de recabar y requería de muchas horas de trabajo de muchos cientos de personas que las echaron. Si no las hubieran echado... no se hubiera sacado información de un papel garrapateado intervenido a un etarra en Francia la clave para encontrar un almacén de explosivos en el País Vasco.

La clave dela derrota de la banda está en el sudor, en el esfuerzo para reunir la información suficiente, para poder combatir y contrarrestar a un grupo terrorista profundamente enraizado en una sociedad que le prestaba un intenso apoyo

- Relatan en paralelo la historia de dos evoluciones, la de la banda y la de la Guardia Civil. El cuerpo venía de tener pocos medios, poca formación y herramientas contra una amenaza así. ¿Cuándo cambió y dio el giro definitivo hasta conocer a ETA mejor que los etarras, como dicen ustedes?

MS: - La evolución de ETA y la de la Guardia Civil van de la mano, la fuerza de uno era la debilidad del otro y viceversa. El primer salto cualitativo se produce cuando el PSOE gana las elecciones por primera vez en 1982 y en el 83 implanta el Plan ZEN, Zona Especial Norte. Fue la primera vez que se puso dinero y medios y se empieza a pensar que la lucha contra el terrorismo es una lucha de información. Se compran coches, chalecos, se amplía personal... Ese es el primer salto institucional, en el que el estado pone medios. Luego el siguiente salto, interno, lo damos a partir de los años 87-88-89, ya entendemos que hay que trabajar con inteligencia. Y luego hay un salto cualitativo en el 1999-2000, en el que el estado va contra las organizaciones del entorno de ETA, evita que actúen y asume lo que todo el mundo sabía en España: que el entorno de ETA era ETA. Nos quitamos los complejos. Han tenido que pasar muchos años de democracia, los países evolucionan y al fin hay un pacto PP-PSOE por las libertades y la justicia empieza a ilegalizar organizaciones. A partir de aquí el final ya era un devenir lógico.

- Costaba mucho decir públicamente que Batasuna era ETA, por ejemplo, pero en el libro no cuesta trabajo, lo dicen muy claro...

LS: - Con tanta claridad se vio que cuando salió la ley de partidos políticos, que fue impugnada como era de esperar, todo el mundo decía que en Estrasburgo, en el Tribunal Europeo de Derechos Humanos, lo acabarían tumbando. Pero lo que hizo no fue sólo certificar que la ley era perfectamente válida, sino que además es una norma que debía haberse aprobado antes. Ese fue también un revés muy grande para en entorno de ETA, ver que una instancia exterior no sólo bendecía la acción del Gobierno, el estado español y sus leyes, sino que lo retrataba como lo que realmente era: un entramado de apoyo a una organización terrorista que ningún estado de derecho podía dejar de neutralizar.

- ¿Qué errores se han cometido en esta lucha? A todos se les viene a la cabeza la guerra sucia.

MS: -Errores ha habido, sí. Aparte de los individuales, que alguno ha habido pero tampoco han sido tantos y no son significativos, hay que decir que el GAL no fue claramente una buena idea. Es verdad, lo digo y lo repito, que es muy fácil hablar ahora de lo del año 82 y 83. Había que estar allí. En el 79 y el 80 ETA dejó cien muertos por año, el estado tenía una construcción aún muy endeble, la democracia peligraba, en el 81 ocurre el 23-F... Los gobernantes de entonces recurrieron a algo que luego el tiempo ha demostrado que fue un error táctico y estratégico, un error se mire por donde se mire, pero insisto, ahora es fácil decirlo. Incluso hay periodistas que lo critican que en su día lo aplaudieron. Y luego el error grande en estos años fue el de no haber procedido antes a la ilegalización de todas esas organizaciones del entorno etarra, que alargaron la vida de la banda. Y luego un error que no forma parte del estado, y que no sé si era un error o una táctica, es que el PNV nunca definió claramente en qué lado estaba, es más, cambió varias veces de bando, y eso también contribuyó, creo yo, a prolongar el proceso.

El error grande, aparte del GAL, fue el de no haber procedido antes a la ilegalización de todas esas organizaciones del entorno etarra, que alargaron la vida de la banda

- Hablan de la ambigüedad y hasta el abandono de los políticos vascos, pero también son muy claros a la hora de criticar a la sociedad vasca, algo que no se suele ver tan a las claras. Estaban los amenazados por ir manifestaciones o llevar un lazo y los que ayudaban al entorno o se callaban.

MS: - Yo lo veo desde un punto de vista particular, el de quien vio directamente el absoluto desprecio que sentíamos. Cuando ETA sale se viste de antifranquista, con lo cual a la gente le cae simpática, pues porque Franco era Franco. Pero claro, en el 77 y 78 ETA mata muchísimo, con lo cual la sociedad evoluciona: hay una parte que le sigue teniendo simpatía y otra que le tiene miedo, mucho. Esos años en que mata tanto hacen que durante mucho tiempo la sociedad esté anestesiada y yo la crítica que le hago es ese silencio. No sé sé si lo podían haber hecho de otra forma, porque una sociedad que no está organizada es muy impasible, pero yo como víctima directa, esa frialdad, esa inhumanidad, ese abandono, creo que no se lo podemos perdonar. Yo lo veo así porque me crié ahí arriba y había amigos de toda la vida, de tu pueblo, que no te saludaban, que te abandonaban; el ""algo habrá hecho"", el ""eso va en el sueldo"" y cosas que eran absolutamente inhumanas.

LS: - Y yendo un poco más allá y huyendo de los razonamientos abstractos, en el libro se relata una escena, que es absolutamente cierta y contada de primera mano, del asesinato de un guardia civil que en ese momento llevaba a su hijo pequeño junto a él en un coche, un niño que vio agonizar a su padre durante unos minutos interminables, después de que Juan Carlos Iglesias Chouzas, alias Gadafi, le metiera cuatro o cinco tiros. Y el niño no sólo estuvo viéndolo morir sino que cuando reunió la fuerza física, aún en estado de shock, para salir del coche, se sentó en un banco y al niño ni mientras estaba agonizando su padre ni mientras estaba en el banco se le acercó absolutamente nadie para ofrecerle consuelo. Cuando la indiferencia de una sociedad se traduce en un acto de crueldad hacia un niño que acaba de perder a su padre y que está sumido en el desamparo más absoluto... Yo me quedo incluso sin adjetivos. Lo puedo entender hasta cierto punto, pero tú tienes un niño con ese grado de desamparo y que ni te acerques, y había gente alrededor... No sé muy bien cómo se califica.

Como víctima directa, esa frialdad, esa inhumanidad, ese abandono (por parte de la sociedad vasca) creo que no se lo podemos perdonar

- ¿Cuál fue el punto de no retorno, cuándo vieron en ETA que no podían seguir más?

MS: -Yo creo que eso es un proceso, que ya habían pasado muchos años, que ya habían ido perdiendo mucha fuerza, ya no tenían la de los 80. En el 92 tuvimos unos eventos importantes en España como los Juegos de Barcelona y la Expo de Sevilla, más la capitalidad cultural de Madrid, y ellos ahí habían hecho mucho esfuerzo, pero el Gobierno reaccionó porque no se podía llegar a esas fechas con la amenaza del terrorismo. Ellos pusieron mucha carne en el asador para que el estado tuviera por narices que hacer lo que fuera para no llegar así al 92, que era un escaparate al mundo de la nueva democracia, que todavía era muy reciente, y ahí es cuando detenemos a la cúpula de ETA. Y los dejamos absolutamente KO, porque no se lo esperaban, que en su propia casa, en Francia, nos metiéramos hasta la cocina y los detuviéramos. Ahí ellos ya dijeron: ""Uy, esto pinta mal"". Todavía del 92 al 2009 pasaron 17 años de muerte, pero ellos con ese golpe ya lo vieron venir en Bidart. Sobre todo porque tuvieron mucha fuerza en los años 80 y la perdieron, por el esfuerzo policial. Y si encima nos llevamos puestos a los tres jefes... Fue la primera puñalada con la que ellos ya sintieron que no tendrían futuro y a partir de ahí buscan a la desesperada, con más violencia, matando a concejales y jueces, para ver de qué manera pueden lograr un empate, pero como siguen siendo muy fanáticos eso se alarga hasta el 2006 y entonces, cuando rompe la negociación con Rodríguez Zapatero, le viene todo junto.

- Así hasta la Operación Santuario, en 2004. Otro exministro del Interior socialista, José Antonio Alonso, decía: ""El día en el que los guardias civiles acabaron el los etarras"".

MS - Sí, el propio título lo dice, la idea era acabar con el santuario de ETA. Más allá de la gente que en ese año estaba ya dispersa por Europa y Latinoamérica, su santuario, lo que no se podían llevar a ningún sitio, eran los grandes zulos estratégicos, de 50 metros cuadrados debajo de una casa. Eso era lo valioso, todas las reservas estratégicas que tenían, miles de armas, misiles, granadas... Esa operación, aparte de que cogimos a sus dos grandes dirigentes, fue donde a ellos les quitamos en alma. Con el trabajo de la Guardia Civil, en todos estos años, es lo que hemos hecho: quitarles el alma. Y más con aquella operación. Sin reservas estratégicas de armamento, no había nada. Acabamos con el santuario y, a partir de ahí, fue coser y cantar.

- Ustedes han planteado el libro además como una memoria de vida, con testimonios de víctimas del cuerpo, no sólo guardias, sino familiares. ¿Cómo han vivido la posibilidad de escuchar a unos afectados que, con frecuencia, tenían que escuchar que los atentados le iban en el sueldo?

MS: - Eso es una cosa con la que no contábamos. Queríamos escribir un libro, queríamos que fuera bonito, pero no contábamos con que además íbamos a hacer mucho bien a las víctimas. Hemos conocido a muchas pero tampoco teníamos experiencia en tratar con ellas y sobre todo en hacerlo muchos años después de que hubieran ocurrido las desgracias. Al principio nos acogieron con cierta frialdad, con recelo, porque están muy manoseadas por todo el mundo. Muchos nos decían: ""Si es un libro de la Guardia Civil accedo; si es un libro en el que los políticos van a meter mano, no queremos saber nada"". Al final todos nos recibieron con ese reparo y todos han salido encantados y a todos les ha hecho mucho bien, no ya sólo verse en los libros sino confesarse, explayarse, volver a sacar recuerdos, buenos o malos. No contábamos con que a nivel humano esta obra tuviera una labor tan terapéutica con la gente que merece todo el reconocimiento. Nosotros al fin y al cabo estamos aquí, lo contamos, somos famosos, pero ellos son los desgraciados de esta película.

- Y uno de los principales atractivos de Sangre, sudor y paz es la novedosa documentación policial que aporta, por la luz que arroja. Es especialmente significativo en el caso del 11-M, cuando dan una versión no muy parecida a la que dieron los políticos en aquel momento, ¿no? Literalmente, explican que la cúpula de ETA, al enterarse del ataque yihadista esa misma mañana, dijo: ""Esto han tenido que ser los moros"".

LS: -Creo que esa es una de las grandes revelaciones del libro, porque todos tenemos memoria sobrada de hasta qué punto el 11-M, que fue un ataque terrible a la convivencia y a la moral de la sociedad española, alguien cometió el error de intentar desviarlo en una dirección particular. Ofrecemos información de hasta qué punto alguien cometió un error muy grave. Podemos hablar de la información de la que disponemos, pero a partir de ahí alguien tendrá que rastrear en qué eslabón de la cadena se rompió esa información o se decidió romper esa información. A primera hora de la mañana había una conjetura clara de que era muy difícil que eso fuera obra de ETA y a media mañana había ya una certidumbre, porque había una persona que era responsable del aparato logístico de ETA -Félix Ignacio Esparza Luri-, el responsable de poner los explosivos a quien hubiera cometido el atentado, literalmente decía en la intimidad: ""Tienen que haberlo hecho los moros"". Estamos hablando de media mañana del 11-M. Todos tenemos memoria de lo que pasó después. Pues esa información en algún momento y en algún lugar quedó embalsada. No sabemos muy bien en qué lugar fue, en qué momento ni quién la embalsó, pero se produjo ese embalsamiento, y eso es un hecho muy relevante del que alguien tendrá que rendir cuentas en su momento ante la historia y ante la ciudadanía española.

MS: - Esa mañana -porque por la tarde ya es evidente lo que ha pasado cuando se coge la furgoneta de los yihadistas-, se difunden muchos indicios. Primero, que el único que mataba en España era ETA, y hasta el propio lehendakari vasco hablaba de ETA. Pero luego llega el indicio que nosotros damos, que yo no lo califico de prueba pero sí de indicio, y era suficientemente sólido como para que esa balanza que estaba en un bando se fuera desnivelando para el otro. Y creo que se tenía que haber desnivelado antes. Es verdad que en la conversación que aportamos incluso el etarra dice: ""A ver si algún loco..."", pero no, el indicio, cuando uno valora en su conjunto, debería haber desnivelado, las cosas. Era suficientemente sólido como pata que el que tenía que tomar la decisión la tomase.

El responsable logístico de ETA decía en la mañana del 11-M: ""Tienen que haberlo hecho los moros""

LS: -Yo me enteré del atentado en Valencia y por muy poco no tomé un tren en Atocha esa mañana, había decidido irme la noche antes, y cuando vi aquello, con mi conocimiento de ciudadano medianamente interesado en esto, dije: ""Es difícil que lo haya hecho ETA"". Eso olía más a eso otro que ya sabíamos que estaba ahí y además estábamos en primera línea, se nos había puesto muy en relieve en ese mundo y yo había estado casualmente tanto en Nueva York como en Londres en las semanas previas y había visto una seguridad extrema y pensaba: ""Allí, en España, no veo yo esta seguridad"". Si han buscado el punto flaco, el punto flaco éramos nosotros. Y luego cuando vi salir al Gobierno español pensé también: ""¿No sería más juicioso ser prudente y decirle a la población que nos han atacado de una forma terrible, que no tenemos pruebas para asignar la autoría pero reclamamos que todos estemos juntos para hacer frente a quienes sean? ¿No se habría producido incluso una victoria electoral absolutamente incontestable de Rajoy? No sé quién decidió desnivelar la balanza en el sentido equivocado y el precio carísimo que se pagó.

- La actualidad manda y, mientras hablamos, el presidente Rajoy le está preguntando al presidente Puigdemont si ha declarado o no la independencia de Cataluña y puede estar en marcha la aplicación del artículo 155 de la Constitución. ¿Cómo creen que va a actuar la Guardia Civil ante este desafío en las próximas semanas? Hay asociaciones profesionales que comparan lo que están sufriendo allí los guardias con la Euskadi del año 81...

MS: -Es un tema preocupante, hasta cierto punto, eh, porque en España hemos pasado por muchas etapas difíciles y desde luego ETA fue mucho más duro en aquellos años que lo de Cataluña de ahora, con diferencia. No es equiparable una cosa con la otra. Allí se mataba y aquí no se mata. Aquí ha habido una presión de unos cuantos días, de una población muy manipulada, muy dirigida. No creo que sea el día a día. Las cosas se van a recomponer, la ley no sé si alguna vez se perdió pero se va a instaurar otra vez, soy optimista. A la Guardia Civil... no sé si será más incómodo o menos, creo que seguiremos igual. Una gran parte de la población catalana nos aplaudirá, otra parte seguirá igual de indiferente, alguna otra igual da un pasito más a ponérnoslo difícil, pero creo que no va a cambiar nada en gran medida y que esto se recompondrá. El Gobierno ya está dando pasos en la línea de que no dure más. Ahora bien, hay una parte de la población que piensa como piensa. Bueno, pues para eso está la democracia. Que hagan el juego democrático, pero no saltándose la ley.

No es equiparable la situación de Cataluña con los años duros de ETA

LS: - Yo creo que alguien está cantando victoria demasiado rápido y cree que con fotos de media docena de cargas convenientemente amplificadas por Twitter se puede desbaratar el trabajo de 173 años que lleva la Guardia Civil en Cataluña, prestando muchos servicios de los que la sociedad catalana a lo mejor no es consciente, porque desde luego sus autoridades no tienden a recordarlos. Estos días a sí sí me gusta recordar que el 19 de julio de 1936 la Generalitat estuvo a punto de desaparecer porque los seis regimientos que estaban en Barcelona se sublevaron prácticamente enteros para acabar con ella y quien impidió que eso sucediera fue un general de la Guardia Civil [José Aranguren, a cuya figura Silva ha dedicado su última obra, Recordaré tu nombre], que lo pagó muy caro con su fusilamiento al final de la guerra. Pero también recuerdo que en 1844, cuando casi nadie sabía lo que era la Guardia Civil porque se acababa de inventar, en Barcelona lo descubrieron cuando se desbordaron los ríos Besós y Llobregat a la vez y en lugares donde no se atrevía a meterse nadie aparecieron por primera vez unos tipos con un uniforme raro que eran los guardias civiles que sacaron a barceloneses que estaban en peligro de muerte. Y destruir todo eso con ocho cargas retransmitidas por las redes con adjetivos que subrayan y exageran y siempre magnifican... No digo que no haya habido errores puntuales, no digo que no haya habido excesos puntuales, y ya hay investigaciones judiciales en curso y los corregirán, pero hablar de ""masacre"" y de ""brutalidad"" y de ""aplastamiento policial"" claramente es un exceso retórico que busca un fin. Yo estaría más preocupado en este momento por la erosión que ha sufrido un cuerpo policial centenario como el de los Mossos, con una tradición honrosa, uno de los pioneros en la labor de policía judicial en España ya en los siglos XVIII y XIX, y que estos días por la gestión de sus jefes políticos se ha visto en entredicho y se les ha visto hacer cosas que a mí me consta que a muchos de sus miembros les duele y no les enorgullecen precisamente, cosas que han menoscabado la confianza que en ellos tienen los jueces y los fiscales, como no puede ser menos, y han perdido una buena parte de su autoridad y de su prestigio ante por lo menos la mitad de la población de Cataluña.

I know the vice president.
I served with him in Congress, and he is a vocal, committed believer of Jesus Christ himself.
We don’t want anyone, especially a president, to think they are a man under their own authority.","At the annual Values Voter Summit (VVS) in Washington this weekend, former congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who serves on Donald Trump’s evangelical advisory board, said in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress that Donald Trump is now a “committed believer” of Jesus Christ and “man of faith” who has “asked God for help and wisdom.”

Bachmann’s assessment mostly comes from a discussion she and other social conservatives had with Vice President Mike Pence.

″[We know] because of the what the vice president told us,” she said.

We were in a meeting with the vice president and the president, about 25 of us. I know the vice president. I served with him in Congress, and he is a vocal, committed believer of Jesus Christ himself. And he said, ‘I want all of you to know that the president is a committed believer. He is a man of faith.’

“I think that should give us a lot of hope,” Bachmann went on to say, explaining that it means Trump is acting without his own authority.

“There’s nothing better than a man under authority,” she explained.

We don’t want anyone, especially a president, to think they are a man under their own authority. They need to be under authority. Whether it’s the authority of the Constitution and the laws of the land but even more importantly under the authority of faith. And I think that helps to regulate our behavior, when we know that we’re accountable to something.

Bachmann also said that Trump “understands who put him into the White House, and that is people of faith,” and that “he’s asked God for help and for wisdom” and wants prayer.

“He knows that he needs prayer,” she said. “We’ve been in the Oval Office with him. We asked him if he wants prayer and he said, ‘Sure.’ We put our hands around him respectfully and we prayed for him.”

Bachmann’s sentiments were echoed by many attendees who gathered at VVS, hosted annually by the Family Research Council, which has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Attendee Joel Brind of New Hamburg, New York, a college biology professor, explained that Jesus would have tweeted like Trump.

“If there were twitter then, [Jesus] would have used it in a similar way, I think,” Brind said.

I wouldn’t restrict it to just [Trump’s] tweets. His communications in general are tactically [emulating Christ]. I don’t want to be misinterpreted to say that everything he says is equivalent to gospel. I mean, he’s on the right side, and his tactics are more reminiscent of Christ, of the tactics that Christ used when he walked the earth and which he admonished his followers to use also.

Trump was the first sitting president to speak at the anti-LGBTQ Values Voter Summit, where a pamphlet titled, “The Hazards of Homosexuality,” was included in promotional materials given to all attendees.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has made a name for herself by coming to the help of Indians trapped in difficult situations in a foreign country, and foreigners with a similar plight in India. People have taken to tweeting at her, knowing that there's a good chance she will spot their appeal and direct her ministry to take action.

The latest beneficiary of this is a 24-year-old Russian who was forced to beg outside a temple in Kanchipuram, Tami Nadu, due to an unfortunate banking incident. According to a report in The Hindu, A. Evangelin has been travelling through India since 24 September. On Tuesday, 10 October, he arrived in Kanchipuram in Chennai. When he tried withdrawing some money from an ATM, somehow, his card got blocked, leaving Evangelin with no money to fend for himself.

Left with no option, Evangelin decided to join the beggars outside a temple so he could raise some money. The incident was reported to the local police, who promptly arrived at the temple to investigate.

On seeing his travel documents and a valid visa, a sub-inspector gave him Rs 500 to help him go back to Chennai and contact the Russian Consulate for help, reported India Today. On learning of Evangelin's plight through the papers, Swaraj quickly tweeted, ""Evangelin - Your country Russia is our time-tested friend. My officials in Chennai will provide you all help.""

Evangelin - Your country Russia is our time tested friend. My officials in Chennai will provide you all help. https://t.co/6bPv7MFomI — Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) October 10, 2017

However, yesterday, on 11 October, a Russian Consulate official told PTI that Evangelin had not contacted them, nor had he answered their calls to his mobile phone when they tried to contact him. If he gets in touch, ""We will assist him in a proper way,"" PTI quoted Yury S Belov, Vice-Consul (press and public relations) of the Russian Consulate as saying.

In another incident, yesterday, Swaraj directed the Indian Embassy in Riyadh to reach out to an Indian woman who claims to be in danger in Saudi Arabia at the earliest after a video of her begging for help from Bhagwant Mann, the Aam Aadmi Party's MP from Sangrur district in Punjab, started circulating online.

In the video, the woman cries uncontrollably as she details her torture at the hands of her employers for the past one year. She claims that she has been living in Dawadmi, located about 200km from the capital city of Riyadh, as a slave and is ill-treated and fears for her life. She also alleges that when she managed to escape and went to the police for help, they too beat her up and took her back to her employers. She pleads with Mann to rescue her, the way he had helped other Indians trapped in a similar situation.

Earlier this year, in June, Mann had, with the ministry of external affairs, helped rescue and bring back 20 Indian youths stuck in Saudi Arabia in deplorable conditions after receiving an SOS video from them on Facebook.

Mann is aware of the woman's call for help — he retweeted an Aaj Tak news report about the video — but as of now, there has been no statement on the matter from him.",Sushma Swaraj Comes To The Aid Of Russian Man Spotted Begging Outside Kanchipuram Temple,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/12/sushma-swaraj-comes-to-the-aid-of-russian-man-spotted-begging-outside-kanchipuram-temple_a_23240835/

The event is held each year by the Family Research Council (FRC), an evangelical Christian group whose website states:

Family Research Council believes that homosexual conduct is harmful to the persons who engage in it and to society at large, and can never be affirmed. It is by definition unnatural, and as such is associated with negative physical and psychological health effects. While the origins of same-sex attractions may be complex, there is no convincing evidence that a homosexual identity is ever something genetic or inborn.

Yuri Gripas / Reuters Trump addresses the 2017 Values Voter Summit in Washington

FRC believes the context for the full expression of human sexuality is within the bonds of marriage between one man and one woman. Upholding this standard of sexual behavior would help to reverse many of the destructive aspects of the sexual revolution, including sexually transmitted disease rates of epidemic proportion, high out-of-wedlock birth rates, adultery, and homosexuality.

Family Research Council believes that abortion, far from empowering women, is a destructive force in women’s lives.

Despite this, the current President of the United States basked in the group’s applause and called them “incredible people”.

He specifically thanked the FRC’s President, Tony Perkins, a man who has said pedophilia is a “homosexual problem” and said the the gay community is “intolerant, they’re hateful, vile, they’re spiteful”.

Perkins is also the man who said natural disasters are sent by God to punish gays and was then left rather miffed after a flood destroyed his home last year (see video top).

The FRC’s Executive Vice President, “Jerry” Boykin, Jr, has described Islam as “an evil concept”.

Addressing such esteemed company, Trump said little of actual substance but pledged that America was a “Judeo-Christian country” and, without any hint of irony, said no religious minority would be persecuted under his administration.

This statement is contradicted by his actions as President so far, which include:

In America, we don't worship government - we worship God. #ValuesVotersSummit pic.twitter.com/YQ3iDlWylK — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2017

Trump also reiterated support for the Jewish state of Israel which was met with a huge cheer from the audience.

While this might appear unusual for a devoutly Christian crowd, it’s worth taking a moment to explain what happens in the evangelical version of the “End Times”.

There are around 50 million Evangelicals in the US who believe in the

literal truth of Bible prophecy and the return of Jesus.

There are a number of conditions that must be met first, one of which is that the Jews must maintain control of Israel and Jerusalem, and retake the Al-Aqsa

Mosque from the Palestinians, which is why this group are such ardent supporters of the Israeli state.

On a more practical note, Trump repeated his false claim that his administration was “ahead of schedule” and claimed:

""When America is unified, no force on earth can break us apart."" -- Trump

Es gibt keine Obergrenze für Wölfe, sagte Hendricks und der Wolf wird auch nicht in das Jagdrecht aufgenommen. Wo ist denn dann eigentlich das Problem?

Zu hohe Schäden?

Seit 2008 sind Wölfe in Niedersachsen wieder heimisch. Die ersten Rudel haben sich in der Nähe von Lüneburg angesiedelt und sorgen seitdem für Probleme. Insgesamt haben die Wölfe seit 2008 knapp 700 Nutztiere gerissen und damit einen Schaden von 70.000 Euro angerichtet. Das ist kein sonderlich hoher Schaden, im Vergleich dazu, was andere Wildtiere anrichten. Mittlerweile gibt es elf Rudel in Niedersachsen, in denen nach Meinung des Naturschutzbundes nicht mehr als 140 Tiere leben.

Die Problemtiere loswerden

Anders als seine Kollegin Barbara Hendricks hat der Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister Christian Schmidt (CSU) kein Problem damit, Wölfe einfach abzuschießen. Nach Ansicht von Schmidt ist die Zeit des Redens vorbei, die Bestände müssen so reguliert werden, dass weder für Nutztiere noch für Menschen eine Gefahr besteht. Der Bundesminister fordert ein „Wolfsmanagement"" vonseiten der Interessenvertretung der Landwirtschaft. Schmidt hat sich nicht zum ersten Mal zum Thema Wölfe in Deutschland geäußert. Er macht sich schon seit längerer Zeit für die Eindämmung der Wolfspopulation stark. Der Minister begründet das mit dem Argument, dass der Wolf das größte in Deutschland lebende Landraubtier ist, das außer dem Menschen keine Feinde hat.

Wölfe gelten als ausgesprochen scheue Tiere, die sich dem Menschen nur sehr selten nähern. Trotzdem ist es in einigen Bundesländern schon zu Begegnungen gekommen, die für den Menschen jedoch keine Gefahr darstellten.",Hat Niedersachsen Angst vorm bösen Wolf?,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/tommy-weber/hat-niedersachsen-angst-vorm-boesen-wolf_b_18254490.html

Gov. Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 485 into law Friday, The Orange County Register reported. It takes effect in January 2019, and pet store owners who violate it will face a $500 fine.

The Democratic governor’s signature was celebrated by animal welfare groups, including Social Compassion in Legislation, the bill’s sponsor.

“We are overjoyed with the Governor’s signature and broad support from the entire animal-loving community for this groundbreaking legislation,” the group’s founder and CEO, Judie Mancuso, said in a statement. “In banning the sale of mill-bred animals, California took a bold step forward. The deplorable conditions that animals suffer in these high-volume breeding facilities are not a secret and now they have a champion in California.”

Patrick T. Fallon/The Washington Post via Getty Images One of the law's aims is to promote adoption from shelters and reduce animals killed. Orphaned, unweaned kittens are frequently killed in shelters without sufficient resources to care for them. This kitten is safe and in the care of the no-kill Best Friends Animal Society in Mission Hills, California.

In a statement sent to HuffPost, Matt Bershadker, president and CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, praised the law for breaking “the puppy mill supply chain that pushes puppies into California pet stores and has allowed unscrupulous breeders to profit from abusive practices.”

Pet industry representatives criticized the bill as being bad for business. It “strips consumers of many pet store protections, risks hundreds of jobs, and reduces pet choice,” Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council President Mike Bober said in a joint statement with the American Kennel Club, a registry of purebred dog breeds in the U.S.

In the statement, Sheila Goffe, the AKC’s vice president of government relations, criticized the legislation as blocking “all of California’s pet lovers from having access to professional, licensed, and ethical commercial breeders.”

The law will not prevent breeders from selling animals directly to customers, meaning that people who want to buy an animal from a breeder still can, but they won’t be able to do it through a retail pet store.

More than 230 cities, towns and counties across the U.S. have similar laws, but California’s is the first statewide law.

The law has two primary goals. One is to cut down on financial support of large-scale breeding facilities, some of which keep animals in deplorable conditions. Those so-called “puppy mills” (though they also exist for other species) often supply pet stores. The Humane Society of the United States notes that responsible breeders who care about their animals want to make sure they go to good homes, meaning they typically won’t sell them through a store that wouldn’t allow them to meet potential owners.","California Bans Pet Shop Sales Of Non-Rescue Cats, Dogs And Rabbits",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-pet-store-ban-puppies-kittens-cats-dogs-rabbits_us_59e216b2e4b0a52aca183fa3?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

Und sie leiden öfter an psychischen Problemen. Michael Hobbes über das Drama des schwulen Mannes

""Ich war immer so gereizt, wenn das Meth alle war"", sagt mein Freund Jeremy.

""Wenn du es hast, musst du es weiter nehmen. Wenn du keins mehr hast, ist das wie ‚Okay, ich kann jetzt in mein Leben zurück'. Ich hab das ganze Wochenende nicht geschlafen und bin zu diesen Sexpartys und habe mich anschließend bis Mittwoch beschissen gefühlt. Vor ungefähr zwei Jahren bin ich auf Kokain umgestiegen, weil ich dann am nächsten Tag arbeiten konnte.""

Jeremy liegt im Krankenhaus, als er mir das erzählt. Er sagt nicht, wie es genau zu der Überdosis gekommen ist, nur dass ein Unbekannter den Krankenwagen gerufen hat und er hier aufgewacht ist.

""Die Drogen waren eine Kombination aus Langeweile und Einsamkeit""

Ich hätte nicht gedacht, dass ich mit meinem Freund Jeremy mal ein solches Gespräch führen würde. Bis vor ein paar Wochen hatte ich keine Ahnung, dass er härtere Drogen konsumiert als Martinis.

Er ist sportlich, intelligent, glutenfrei und trägt an jedem x-beliebigen Wochentag ein sauberes Hemd. Als ich ihn vor drei Jahren kennenlernte, wollte er wissen, wo man gut Crossfit machen kann.

""Die Drogen waren eine Kombination aus Langeweile und Einsamkeit"", sagt er. ""Freitagabend kam ich nach Hause, völlig k.o. von der Arbeit, und fragte mich: ‚Was jetzt?' Also hab ich rumtelefoniert, um mir Meth liefern zu lassen und im Internet Partys zu checken. Entweder das oder allein einen Film angucken.""

Jeremy ist nicht mein einziger schwuler Freund, der Probleme hat. Malcolm geht kaum aus dem Haus, weil er unter schweren Angstzuständen leidet. Wegen Jareds Depressionen beschränken sich seine sozialen Kontakte inzwischen auf mich, das Fitnessstudio und das Internet. Und da war Christian, der zweite Mann, den ich je geküsst habe und der sich mit 32 Jahren umbrachte, zwei Wochen nachdem sein Freund ihn verlassen hatte.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir sind das erste schwule Ehepaar, das in Deutschland ein Kind adoptiert hat: Hier ist unsere Botschaft an alle, die es uns nicht gönnen

Schon seit Jahren sehe ich, wie das Leben meiner heterosexuellen und meiner schwulen Freunde auseinanderdriftet. Die eine Hälfte meines sozialen Netzwerks hat sich in Familien und Vororte verabschiedet, die andere kämpft sich durch Isolation und Angstzustände, harte Drogen und riskanten Sex.

Depression, Einsamkeit und Drogen in der schwulen Gemeinde noch genauso verbreitet wie vor Jahrzehnten

Nichts davon passt zu dem, was ich mir vorgestellt hatte unter dem Leben eines schwulen Mannes. Genauso wenig wie ich wurde Jeremy von Gleichaltrigen gemobbt oder von seiner Familie abgelehnt. Er kann sich nicht mal daran erinnern, dass er je Schwuchtel genannt wurde.

Seine lesbische Mutter erzog ihn in einem Vorort an der Westküste. ""Sie outete sich mir gegenüber, als ich zwölf war"", sagt er. ""Und im nächsten Satz sagte sie, dass ich schwul bin. Mir war das damals selbst noch kaum klar.""

Jeremy und ich sind 34. In unserem Leben haben die Schwulen größere gesellschaftliche und rechtliche Akzeptanz erreicht als je zuvor. In meiner eigenen Teenagerzeit war die Homo-Ehe ein ferner Traum, von den Zeitungen in Gänsefüßchen gesetzt. Heute ist sie höchstrichterlich abgesegnet.

Die gesellschaftliche Zustimmung zur Homo-Ehe ist von 27 Prozent im Jahr 1996 auf 61 Prozent im Jahr 2016 gestiegen. In der Popkultur sind schwule Figuren so alltäglich, dass sie sogar Fehler haben dürfen.

Trotzdem - während wir Ausmaß und Tempo dieses Wandels feiern, sind Depression, Einsamkeit und Drogen in der schwulen Gemeinde noch genauso verbreitet wie vor Jahrzehnten. Je nach Studie ist die Suizidrate bei Schwulen zwei- bis zehnmal so hoch wie bei Heteros. Depressive Phasen gibt es bei uns doppelt so häufig.

Laut einer Untersuchung unter schwulen Männern, die erst seit kurzem in New York wohnen, litten drei Viertel von ihnen unter Angstattacken oder Depressionen, nahmen Drogen oder Alkohol oder praktizierten ungeschützten Sex. Auch wenn wir dauernd von ""Wahlfamilien"" sprechen, haben schwule Männer nicht so viele enge Freunde wie Heteros oder lesbische Frauen.

In den Niederlanden leiden Homosexuelle dreimal so oft an affektiven Störungen wie Heterosexuelle

Ich will nicht so tun, als sei ich objektiv. Ich bin ein zeitweise allein lebender Schwuler, in einer normalen Kleinstadt von Eltern erzogen, die in einem Verein von Angehörigen Homosexueller organisiert waren.

Niemand in meiner Bekanntschaft starb an Aids. Ich bin nie direkt diskriminiert worden und habe mich in einer Welt geoutet, in der Heirat, Jägerzaun und ein Golden Retriever für einen homosexuellen Mann nicht nur erreichbare Ziele waren, sondern geradezu von ihm erwartet wurden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir haben überprüft, was das AfD-Wahlprogramm Homosexuellen zu bieten hat - das Ergebnis war sogar schlimmer als erwartet

""Für manche Schwule waren die Homo-Ehe und die Gesetzesänderungen eine Verbesserung"", befindet Christopher Stults. Er untersucht an der New York University die Unterschiede in der seelischen Gesundheit von Schwulen und Heterosexuellen. ""Viele andere aber waren enttäuscht. Jetzt haben wir diesen rechtlichen Status erreicht, und doch haben sich nicht alle Erwartungen erfüllt.""

Nicht nur Amerikaner kennen dieses Gefühl der Leere. In den Niederlanden existiert die Homo-Ehe seit 2001, und trotzdem leiden Homosexuelle dreimal so oft an affektiven Störungen wie Heterosexuelle, und ""Selbstverletzungen in suizidaler Absicht"" treten bei ihnen zehnmal so häufig auf.

In Schweden gibt es eingetragene Partnerschaften seit 1995 und die gleichberechtigte Ehe seit 2009, aber bei Männern, die mit Männern verheiratet sind, ist die Suizidrate dreimal so hoch wie bei Männern, die mit Frauen verheiratet sind.

All diese schwer erträglichen Statistiken führen zur selben Schlussfolgerung: Wenn man sich als Mann zu anderen Männern hingezogen fühlt, riskiert man auch heute noch eine gefährliche Entfremdung. Die gute Nachricht: Epidemiologen und Sozialwissenschaftler verstehen die Gründe mittlerweile besser denn je.

Travis Salway, Forscher am Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, befasst sich seit fünf Jahren mit der Frage, warum schwule Männer sich immer noch umbringen.

""Früher waren schwule Männer einsam, weil sie sich nicht outen konnten"", sagt er. ""Aber heute haben sich Millionen Schwule geoutet, und sie fühlen sich noch genauso isoliert.""

Schwule Männer wurden aus ihren Familien verstoßen, ihr Liebesleben war verboten

Wir treffen uns zum Mittagessen in einer winzigen Nudelbar. Es ist November, und er trägt Jeans, Überschuhe und einen Ehering. ""Schwule Ehe?"", frage ich.

""Sogar monogam"", sagt er.

Salway wuchs in Celina, Ohio, auf, einer abgetakelten Industriestadt mit etwa 10.000 Einwohnern, in der bei den 21-Jährigen die Ehe mit dem College konkurrierte. Er wurde schon als schwul beschimpft, bevor es ihm selbst klar war.

""Ich war feminin und sang im Chor"", sagt er. ""Das genügte."" Die meiste Zeit in der Highschool hatte er eine Freundin und vermied Beziehungen mit Jungen, bis er weggehen konnte.

Gegen Ende der Nullerjahre war er Sozialarbeiter und Epidemiologe, und der zunehmende Abstand zwischen heterosexuellen und schwulen Freunden irritierte ihn ebenso wie mich. Gab es vielleicht noch mehr als das, was man über schwule Männer und seelische Gesundheit bis dahin angenommen hatte?

In den 50er- und 60er-Jahren trat die Disparität erstmals zutage, und die Ärzte hielten sie für ein Symptom der Homosexualität an sich, für eine von vielen Erscheinungsformen des damals als ""sexuelle Inversion"" bekannten Phänomens. Als die Schwulenbewegung Fahrt aufnahm, wurde die Homosexualität aus der Liste der psychischen Defekte gestrichen und das Problem mit einem Trauma erklärt. Schwule Männer wurden aus ihren Familien verstoßen, ihr Liebesleben war verboten. Selbstverständlich erreichten ihre Depressionen und Suizidraten beunruhigende Level.

""So schätzte ich das auch ein"", sagt Salway, ""dass der schwule Suizid Produkt einer früheren Zeit war oder vor allem bei Jugendlichen auftrat, die keinen anderen Ausweg sahen.""

Dann nahm er sich die Daten vor. Das Problem war nicht nur die Selbsttötung, und sie trat nicht nur bei Teenagern auf, nicht nur in Gegenden mit grassierender Homophobie.

Er stellte fest, dass Schwule überall und in jedem Alter häufiger an Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen, Krebs, Sexsucht, Erektionsstörungen, Allergien, Asthma und vielen anderen Erkrankungen leiden. In Kanada sterben seit Jahren mehr Schwule an Suizid als an Aids.

Vom Stress, ständig darauf gefasst zu sein, diskriminiert zu werden

""Es gibt schwule Männer, die nie sexuell oder physisch angegriffen worden sind und an ähnlichen posttraumatischen Belastungsstörungen leiden wie Menschen, die Kampfsituationen oder Vergewaltigungen erlebt haben"", sagt Alex Keuroghlian, Psychiater am Fenway Institute's Center for Population Research in LGBT Health.

Schwule Männer sind darauf ""geeicht, Diskriminierung zu erwarten"", glaubt Keuroghlian. Ununterbrochen scannen wir unser Umfeld, ob wir vielleicht herausfallen. Wir kämpfen um Selbstbehauptung. Wir spielen uns unsere sozialen Fehlschläge in einer Endlosschleife vor.

Am meisten aber erstaunt bei diesen Symptomen die Tatsache, dass wir sie im Allgemeinen nicht einmal als Symptome wahrnehmen. Seit er sich mit diesen Daten befasst, interviewt Salway schwule Männer, die einen Suizidversuch überlebt haben.

""Wenn man sie fragt, warum sie sich das Leben nehmen wollten, erwähnen die meisten ihre Homosexualität gar nicht."" Stattdessen erzählen sie ihm von Beziehungsproblemen, beruflichen Problemen, finanziellen Problemen. ""Sie nehmen ihre Sexualität nicht als entscheidenden Faktor in ihrem Leben wahr. Und doch ist ihre Suizidrate zehnmal so hoch.""

Dieses Phänomen wird in der Wissenschaft mit dem ""Minderheitenstressmodell"" beschrieben. In seiner direktesten Form ist es ziemlich einfach: Die Zugehörigkeit zu einer Randgruppe bringt zusätzliche Anstrengungen mit sich.

Als einzige Frau in einem geschäftlichen Meeting oder als einziger Schwarzer im Studentenwohnheim muss man sich viel mehr Gedanken machen als die Angehörigen der Mehrheit. Wenn man sich gegen den Chef wehrt oder aber es nicht tut, entspricht man dann den Klischees über Frauen am Arbeitsplatz?

Wenn man einen Test verhaut, denken die Leute dann, dass es an der Rasse liegt? Selbst wenn man nicht offen stigmatisiert wird, hinterlassen diese fortwährenden Grübeleien auf die Dauer ihre Spuren.

Die ganze Ablehnung spielte sich nur in meinem Kopf ab

John Pachankis forscht in Yale über Stress. Seiner Ansicht nach entsteht die Störung in den etwa fünf Jahren zwischen der Entdeckung der eigenen Sexualität und dem Zeitpunkt, wenn wir mit anderen darüber sprechen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Der Schein trügt: Hasskriminalität gegen Lesben und Schwule nimmt stetig zu

In dieser Zeit wirken sich sogar relativ unbedeutende Stresssituationen unverhältnismäßig stark aus - nicht weil sie traumatisch wären, sondern weil wir uns darauf einstellen, dass sie passieren. ""Du musst nicht mal schwul genannt werden, damit du dein Verhalten so anpasst, dass dir das nicht passiert"", sagt Salway.

So war es auch in meiner Teenie-Zeit: immer auf der Hut, bloß nichts Falsches sagen, immer im Stress, immer überkompensieren. Als ich in einem Erlebnisbad mit einem Schulfreund an der Wasserrutsche wartete, erwischte er mich, wie ich ihn anstarrte.

""Alter, was glotzt du mich an?"" Ich konnte gerade noch ablenken, so was wie ""Sorry, du bist nicht mein Typ"", aber in den Wochen danach quälte mich der Gedanke, was er wohl über mich dachte. Dabei kam er nie darauf zurück. Die ganze Ablehnung spielte sich nur in meinem Kopf ab.

Das Heranwachsen als Schwuler ist ähnlich belastend wie das Heranwachsen in extremer Armut

""Das eigentliche Trauma für Schwule ist die lange Zeitdauer"", sagt William Elder, Traumaforscher und Psychologe. ""Bei einem einzelnen Trauma erleidet man eine posttraumatische Belastungsstörung, die in einem halben Jahr Therapie geheilt werden kann.

Aber wenn man jahrelang immer wieder kleine stressige Situationen erlebt und sich dann jedes Mal fragt: War das jetzt wegen meiner Sexualität?, kann das den Effekt sogar noch intensivieren."" Wer seine Homosexualität versteckt, ist laut Elder in der Lage eines Menschen, dem immer wieder leicht auf den Arm geschlagen wird.

Am Anfang ist er genervt. Nach einiger Zeit ist er wütend. Schließlich kann er an nichts anderes mehr denken.

Und dann baut sich der Stress im Körper auf, weil man sich Tag für Tag damit beschäftigt.

Anscheinend ist das Heranwachsen als Schwuler ähnlich belastend wie das Heranwachsen in extremer Armut.

Nach einer Untersuchung von 2015 produzieren Schwule weniger von dem stressregulierenden Hormon Cortisol. Ihr Organismus war in ihrer Adoleszenz ständig so aktiv, dass sie als Erwachsene träge werden, sagt Katie McLaughlin, eine der Autorinnen der Studie.

Unter Männern herrscht ein rauer Ton, das ist bei Schwulen nicht anders

2014 wurden die kardiovaskulären Risikofaktoren von hetero- und homosexuellen Jugendlichen verglichen. Dabei stellte sich heraus, dass die schwulen Kids nicht mehr Stresssituationen ausgesetzt waren - dass also auch heterosexuelle Jugendliche Probleme haben -, dass diese ihr Nervensystem aber stärker schädigten.

Sogar Salway, der sich gründlich mit dem Minderheitenstress befasst, fühlt sich manchmal unwohl, wenn er mit seinem Partner durch Vancouver schlendert.

Noch nie ist er angegriffen worden, aber irgendwelche Idioten haben ihn in der Öffentlichkeit mal beschimpft. So etwas muss nur ein paar Mal passieren, und schon wartet man darauf und schlägt das Herz etwas schneller, sobald sich ein Auto nähert.

Unter Männern herrscht ein rauer Ton, das ist bei Schwulen nicht anders. Im Gegenteil.

Mit Minderheitenstress allein lassen die vielfältigen Gesundheitsprobleme schwuler Männer sich jedoch nicht erklären. Tatsächlich kommt es zur ersten Schädigung, während sie sich verstecken, die zweite und vielleicht gravierendere kommt aber erst danach.

Auch in der schwulen Community lauern Diskriminierungen

Jahrzehnte hindurch nahmen Psychologen an, dass die entscheidenden Phasen in der Bildung der schwulen Identität zum Coming-out führen und dass wir, wenn wir uns in unserer Haut endlich wohlfühlen, unser Leben aufbauen können, gemeinsam mit Menschen, die die gleichen Erfahrungen gemacht haben.

Die Forschung der letzten zehn Jahre zeigt jedoch, dass der Kampf um Anpassung sogar noch heftiger wird. Nach einer Untersuchung von 2015 leiden Männer, die sich kurz vorher geoutet hatten, stärker an Ängsten und Depressionen als solche, die ihre Homosexualität noch verstecken. Denn auch in der schwulen Community lauern Diskriminierungen.

Jeder Schwule, den ich kenne, trägt ein Päckchen mit all den Fiesheiten, die andere Schwule ihm gesagt oder angetan haben. Als ich mal zu einem Date kam, stand der Typ sofort auf, als er mich sah, warf mir vor, dass ich kleiner sei als auf meinen Fotos, und ging. Alex, Fitnesstrainer in Seattle, bekam von einem Mitglied seines Schwimmteams zu hören:

""Ich bin bereit, über dein Gesicht hinwegzusehen, wenn du mich ohne Kondom fickst."" Martin, ein Brite in Portland, hat etwa fünf Kilo zugenommen, seit er da wohnt, und - an Weihnachten - bekam er über Grindr diese Nachricht: ""Du warst immer so sexy. Schade, dass du das versaut hast.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Du bist eine Schande und deine Freundin ein Dämon"" - was ich erlebte, als ich auf Instagram zeigte, dass ich eine Frau liebe

In anderen Minderheiten werden Ängste und Depressionen durch die Unterstützung der Community weniger. Die Nähe zu Menschen, von denen man sich instinktiv verstanden weiß, ist hilfreich. Bei uns dagegen ist das Gegenteil der Fall.

Mehrere Studien haben gezeigt, dass die Tendenz zu ungeschütztem Sex und Meth steigt, das Engagement für Ehrenämter oder Sport dagegen sinkt, wenn man in einem schwulen Viertel wohnt. Aus einer Untersuchung von 2009 geht hervor, dass Schwule, die eng mit ihrer schwulen Community verbunden sind, mit ihren eigenen Liebesbeziehungen weniger zufrieden sind.

Schwule Männer behandeln sich gegenseitig mies, weil wir Männer sind

""Schwule und bisexuelle Männer bezeichnen die schwule Community als großen Stressfaktor"", sagt John Pachankis, der in Yale zu genderbezogenen Krankheiten forscht. Der Hauptgrund sei, dass die Diskriminierung innerhalb der Gruppe die Psyche stärker schädige als die Zurückweisung durch Angehörige der Mehrheit.

Wenn man von Heterosexuellen zurückgewiesen wird, kann man leicht darüber hinwegsehen, man kann mit den Augen rollen oder ihnen den Mittelfinger zeigen - man braucht ihre Anerkennung ja nicht. Die Ablehnung durch andere Schwule tut mehr weh, weil man diese Leute stärker braucht.

Die Forscher, mit denen ich gesprochen habe, gehen davon aus, dass Schwule sich aus zwei Gründen häufig verletzen. Der Hauptgrund, der auch am häufigsten genannt wird, ist, dass schwule Männer sich gegenseitig mies behandeln, weil wir Männer sind.

""In einer Gemeinschaft von Männern wird Männlichkeit besonders herausgefordert"", sagt Pachankis. ""Männlichkeit ist ein flüchtiges Gut. Sie muss ständig inszeniert oder verteidigt oder eingefordert werden. Wenn die Männlichkeit infrage gestellt wird, kann man sehen, wie dumm Männer darauf reagieren. Sie nehmen aggressive Posen ein, stürzen sich in finanzielle Risiken, wollen Sachen zerschlagen.""

Bei femininen Schwulen sind Suizid, Einsamkeit und psychische Krankheiten noch weiter verbreitet

So lässt sich auch die allgegenwärtige Stigmatisierung femininer Männer in der schwulen Community besser verstehen. Dane Whicker, klinischer Psychologe und Forscher an der Duke University, hat herausgefunden, dass sich die meisten schwulen Männer für maskuline Männer interessieren und selbst möglichst maskulin auftreten möchten.

Das könnte daran liegen, dass maskuline Männer historisch in der heterosexuellen Gesellschaft geringere Probleme hatten. Vielleicht haben wir es aber auch mit verinnerlichter Homophobie zu tun: Feminine Schwule werden stereotyp immer noch als Bottom, als rezeptiver Partner beim Analverkehr, gesehen.

Bei femininen Schwulen sind Suizid, Einsamkeit und psychische Krankheiten denn auch weiter verbreitet. Maskuline Schwule wiederum leiden mehr unter Ängsten, neigen zu ungeschütztem Sex und greifen öfter zu Drogen und Tabak.

Während die Schwulenbars verschwinden, treffen sich auf Grindr immer mehr

Der zweite Grund, warum die schwule Gemeinde ihre Mitglieder so sehr stresst, hat nicht mit dem Warum unserer wechselseitigen Ablehnung zu tun, sondern mit dem Wie. In den letzten zehn Jahren sind die traditionellen schwulen Treffpunkte - Bars, Nachtclubs, Saunen - nach und nach verschwunden, an ihre Stelle sind die sozialen Medien getreten.

Mindestens 70 Prozent der homosexuellen Männer nutzen heute Dating-Apps wie Grindr oder Scruff. Im Jahr 2000 lernten sich etwa 20 Prozent der schwulen Paare online kennen. 2010 waren es bis zu 70 Prozent. Die Zahl der schwulen Paare, die sich durch Freunde gefunden haben, ist von 30 auf 12 Prozent gesunken.

Öfter liest man über die App Grindr, deren Nutzer sie durchschnittlich 90 Minuten am Tag verwenden, irgendwelche Horrorstorys in den Medien: über Mörder oder Homophobe, die hier ihre Opfer abschleppen.

Oder es geht um die beunruhigenden ""Chemsex-Partys"", die sich in Berlin, London und New York ausbreiten. Und ja, das sind Probleme. Die eigentliche Wirkung der Apps aber ist stiller, unauffälliger, und sie geht in mancher Hinsicht auch tiefer: Viele von uns kommunizieren hauptsächlich auf diesem Weg mit anderen Schwulen.

Diese Apps vermitteln uns nachdrücklich das Gefühl, hässlich zu sein

Das Schlimmste an den Apps jedoch und der Grund, warum sie sich so unterschiedlich auf die Gesundheit von schwulen bzw. heterosexuellen Männern auswirken, ist nicht nur, dass wir sie so intensiv nutzen. Vielmehr eignen sie sich fast perfekt dazu, unsere negative Selbstwahrnehmung noch zu verschärfen.

Der Traumaforscher Elder führte im Jahr 2015 Interviews mit Schwulen und fand heraus, dass 90 Prozent seiner Probanden einen Partner wollten, der groß, jung, weiß, muskulös und maskulin sein sollte. Die meisten von uns entsprechen kaum einem dieser Kriterien, geschweige denn allen fünf, und so vermitteln diese Apps uns nachdrücklich das Gefühl, hässlich zu sein.

Das alles ist natürlich nicht neu. Der seit den Achtzigern mit gesellschaftlicher Isolation befasste Psychologe Walt Odets erklärt, schwule Männer hätten an den Saunen genauso gelitten wie heute an Grindr. Doch bei seinen jüngeren Patienten sieht er diesen Unterschied:

""Wenn man in der Sauna von jemandem abgelehnt wurde, konnte man anschließend immer noch mit ihm darüber reden. Vielleicht konnte daraus eine Freundschaft werden oder wenigstens eine positive soziale Erfahrung. Bei den Apps wird man einfach weggedrückt, wenn man nicht als sexuell oder romantisch interessant wahrgenommen wird.""

Die Apps verstärken oder beschleunigen vielleicht auch nur die erwachsene Version der Hypothese, die Pachankis als ""Der beste kleine Junge auf der Welt"" bezeichnet. Wenn wir als Jugendliche unsere Sexualität verstecken, konzentrieren wir unser Selbstwertgefühl auf das, was die Außenwelt von uns will: gut sein im Sport, in der Schule etc.

Als Erwachsene drängen die sozialen Normen unserer eigenen Community uns, unser Selbstwertgefühl noch weiter zu konzentrieren: auf unser Aussehen, unsere Männlichkeit, unsere sexuellen Leistungen.

Aber selbst wenn wir hier wettbewerbsfähig sind, selbst wenn wir unser Ideal vom maskulinen dominanten Top erreichen - selbst dann haben wir uns in Wirklichkeit darauf konditioniert, dass wir am Boden zerstört sind, wenn wir ihm nicht mehr entsprechen, was unvermeidlich der Fall sein wird.

""Frappe-toi le cœur"", le dernier roman d'Amélie Nothomb.

Un titre, issu d'un poème d'Alfred de Musset, et cet autre alexandrin:

""C'est là qu'est la pitié, la souffrance et l'amour""...

La souffrance et l'amour: deux thèmes qui ressortent fort de ce récit remarquable et très bien écrit comme toujours par son auteur.

Mais surtout, la jalousie, ou plutôt l'envie, sont les thèmes dominants de ce roman.

Mais, Amélie ou es-tu allée chercher cette histoire?

D'accord, tu avais eu dans ta classe une camarade qui était mal aimée par sa mère... et de là comme tu le dis: ""tu as enfanté"" ce roman poignant...

Je ne souhaite pas faire ici un résumé du livre mais plutôt m'attarder sur ce qui m'a le plus touché, à savoir l'indifférence totale d'une mère pour son enfant et en même temps l'inégalité d'amour dans une fratrie.

C'est l'histoire de Diane, fille de Marie et Olivier, qu'ils auront alors qu'ils sont encore très jeunes.

Diane deviendra une enfant très sensible, très intelligente, et l'aînée d'une fratrie de trois.

Dès sa naissance, sa mère lui vouera une jalousie proche de la haine, qu'elle percevra très tôt.

Dès le début on ressent cette indifférence pour ce bébé à venir:

""Pendant neuf mois, elle n'eut pas une pensée pour le bébé""

""Elle vécu l'accouchement comme un retour brusque et désagréable dans le réel. Quand elle entendit les vagissement du nouveau-né, elle fut stupéfaite: ainsi donc, pendant tout ce temps, elle avait contenu quelqu'un"".

""C'est une petite fille, madame, lui annonça la sage-femme"".

Marie n'éprouva rien, ni déception, ni contentement. Elle aurait aimé qu'on lui explique quoi éprouver.

Au fil des jours et des mois ce rejet et cette indifférence se confirmaient.

""Quand Marie se retrouvait seule avec sa fille, elle ressentait un malaise auquel elle ne comprenait rien. Elle s'efforçait de la regarder le moins possible. Elle lui faisait prendre son biberon en détournant les yeux...""

Cette petite Diane grandit, recherchant désespérément un signe de reconnaissance ou d'amour de sa maman.

Sa mère était tellement dure envers la petite que ""l'enfant eu le cœur comprimé de souffrance"".

Deux ans plus tard, elle accouchera d'un second enfant, un petit Nicolas. La relation avec ce nouveau bébé sera totalement différente.

""Est-ce parce-que c'était un garçon?"" se dit la petite Diane?

Ce qui la frappa ""fut l'évidente adoration de sa mère pour Nicolas. ""Elle n'est pas jalouse de lui"" pensa-t- elle?""

""Cette fois, Marie n'eut pas l'ombre d'une dépression. Quand elle allait chercher ses enfants le soir chez mamie, elle se jetait sur le bébé pour l'embrasser"".

Un peu plus loin dans le récit, la grand-mère s'adressera à sa fille Marie: ""tu as le droit de préférer l'un de tes enfants, mais ne le montre pas à ce point. C'est dur pour la petite"".

""Penses-tu? elle ne remarque rien!""

Puis viendra un troisième bébé, une petite sœur, et là:

""Maman n'était pas rose de bonheur mais extatique, telle la vierge brandissant Jésus, elle leur présenta le bébé joufflu et dit: voici Célia"".

Diane vit quelque chose qui clochait. ""A la naissance de Nicolas, maman était heureuse et aimait son bébé; cette fois, maman délirait de joie et débordait d'amour pour Célia. Elle l'embrassait comme si elle allait la manger. Elle répétait, possédée, des comme je t'aime, mon bébé d'amour. C'était obscène"".

""A 5 ans, Diane cessa d'être une enfant. Elle se transforma en une créature désenchantée dont l'obsession fut de ne pas sombrer dans le gouffre que cette situation avait creusé en elle"".

J'imagine que vous pouvez ressentir comme moi une profonde tristesse envers cette petite Diane qui devait se sentir si seule, une envie de la serrer fort dans les bras malgré l'amour que pouvaient lui porter heureusement son père et ses grands-parents dans le roman.

Ce livre réveille en moi, en nous, des tas de questions autour de l'amour maternel, l'amour filial.

En tant que mère:

L'amour maternel est-il inné?

L'amour que l'on porte à ses enfants est-il identique? (consciemment ou même inconsciemment)

Ai-je le droit d'aimer un de mes enfant plus qu'un autre?

Pourquoi suis-je si jalouse?

Qu'est-ce que j'envie chez elle?

A quoi me renvoie mon enfant, et pourquoi je n'arrive pas à l'aimer?

En tant qu'enfant:

Un enfant doit-il aimer sa mère alors qu'elle ne lui témoigne aucune affection?

Comment peut-on se construire sans l'amour de sa propre mère?

Comment combler ce manque?

Comment trouver des personnes ressources?

Une fois adulte, sera-t-il possible de ne pas reproduire le même schéma?

Je vous laisse réfléchir à toutes ces questions que parfois on ne se pose pas, car pour certaines d'entre vous c'est une certitude qu'on aime tous ses enfants de la même façon, ou peut-être a-t-on peur de s'avouer la vérité.

N'est-il pas non plus essentiel de prendre conscience que l'enfant, aussi petit soit-il, ressent parfaitement les émotions éprouvées par son parent, qu'elles soient positives ou négatives, conscientes ou inconscientes, et l'impact d'un manque quel qu'il soit le poursuivra toute son existence.

It's Never Too Late To Start Strength Training: Anti-Ageing Benefits From Exercise The majority of the population believes that their ageing process is inevitable. Piling on the fat, losing muscle mass, developing weaker bones and joints are almost now accepted by the mainstream as part of life.

I Quit I'd always promised myself that one day I would complete a half marathon. It's never been the right time, never had enough time and never quite wanted the time until this year.
