The brain-teasing post features a series of black and white lines hiding a secret message. McDonald’s shared the picture with the caption, “Tag a mate who should read between the lines.”

Spoiler alert: If you squint really hard, you’ll see the phrase “Bring McNuggets” appear in the background … that is, if you don’t give yourself a migraine first.

People commented that the image was causing them serious eye problems, but the fast-food chain doesn’t seem too concerned: After one user on Facebook wrote “[that] just messed up my eyes, thanks mcdonalds,” the restaurant cheekily responded with “#sorrynotsorry.”

Others seemed to love the tricky imagery, with a few people even noting that they planned to use this on their wedding invitations.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., wants to wrap up tax reform before Christmas.
Senate Republicans can’t overcome a filibuster on tax reform.
People may grouse that the devil may be in the details on tax reform and that could slow matters.","The only certainty about tax reform is uncertainty. That’s the recipe for the next few weeks on Capitol Hill.

Congress is entering a sprint to finish tax reform -- and it’s barely started. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., wants to wrap up tax reform before Christmas. But House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. , has another idea:

“Vote on this before Thanksgiving,” Meadows, the leader of the conservative caucus, said during a recent Fox News interview.

Trade in tinsel and wrapping paper for cornbread and stuffing.

Maybe had members of Congress really stepped on the gas, they could have had it done before Canadian Thanksgiving. But that came two weeks ago.

The reason for the sprint? Several wild cards could upend tax reform if congressional Republicans don’t move expeditiously. That’s where uncertainty enters the picture.

Consider the Senate vote Thursday night to adopt a budget framework for tax reform. That budget blueprint wasn’t so much about spending priorities as it was about granting the chamber a special parliamentary tool known as “budget reconciliation” with which to tackle tax reform.

Senate Republicans can’t overcome a filibuster on tax reform. But budget reconciliation eliminates filibusters and requires only a simple majority of senators to clear the final hurdle. (That’s 51 yeas if all 100 senators vote.) But the roll call tally on the budget framework plan was tight: 51-49.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the lone GOP nay. Lose another Republican and it’s 50-50. That would require Vice President Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. However, tax reform is dead if another Republican drops off.

So here are three variables that could imperil tax reform:

The health of GOP Sens. Thad Cochran, Mississippi, and John McCain, Arizona, and the special election in Alabama on Dec. 12 to succeed Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala. Conservative Roy Moore defeated Strange in the GOP primary. Moore will touch gloves with Democrat Doug Jones for the right to come to Washington.

Let’s start with Cochran.

Cochran had been absent from Washington for weeks suffering from health issues. His office declared Cochran would be back after treatment for a urinary tract infection.

Then Cochran’s staff announced early he wouldn’t return. That put adoption of the budget on a tightrope. A day later, Cochran’s team backtracked and said the senator would be in Washington to vote.

Cochran has appeared increasingly feeble of late. He’s chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and rarely provides reporters with in-depth answers when asked questions in the hall -- a stark contrast to how Cochran formerly engaged scribes.

Cochran returned Tuesday, guided by an aide, to the Senate chamber. I asked Cochran if congressional leaders rousted him from his sickbed because his vote was crucial to approve the budget.

“It’s a beautiful day outside,” he replied.

The non sequitur reply may have been a precursor as the senator sat quietly at his desk in the chamber, rarely engaging fellow senators.

During one roll call, the aide nudged Cochran to vote as he had apparently forgotten to do so. Cochran appeared to struggle to raise his left arm in the air to signal either thumbs up or thumbs down -- the Senate custom to record one’s vote.

On the next vote, the clerk read the Senate roll in alphabetical order. Cochran’s name falls between Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Susan Collin, R-Maine. When the clerk hit Cochran’s name, the senator immediately raised his hand and hollered “aye.” The aide then elbowed Cochran and could audibly be heard in the chamber saying “no. no.”

At the behest of his aide, Cochran then switched his vote to nay. There was a brief pause in the calling of the roll as the clerk corrected Cochran’s ballot on the tally sheet.

It’s not uncommon for senators to vote “incorrectly,” then switch their vote. That’s especially true during the Senate’s “vote-a-rama.” That’s when senators take vote after vote -- sometimes for hours on end -- trying to finish the budget. It’s also routine for senators to rely on aides to follow proceedings and “coach” them on how to vote.

But Cochran’s performance provoked lots of murmuring in the Capitol and raised questions as to who was calling the shots.

Cochran disappeared for a couple of hours and missed a few votes during the vote-a-rama. Had Cochran been absent, the Senate would have adopted the budget framework for tax reform 50-49. That’s pretty close. It shows there’s no margin for error for Republicans on tax reform.

McCain’s been back in Washington for weeks now, after missing time for brain cancer treatment. He’s appeared vigorous, tangling with reporters in the hallways and even threatening the Pentagon with subpoenas following the ambush of U.S. forces in Niger. But his health issues forced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to postpone work on an effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare for a period in July.

That was the case until McCain returned to work -- and promptly voted to torpedo the measure.

The Alabama special election also bears watching. The campaign of GOPer Moore indicated to Fox on Friday that it had no guidance on how the nominee would vote on tax reform should he win in December. But later, Moore spokesman Drew Messer told the cable news network that “Moore is all in on working with President Trump on tax reform.”

That said, some GOP Senate sources fear Moore may be too conservative to vote for the final tax reform product, if he win a ticket to Washington. By the same token, other sources told Fox that Democrat Doug Jones may even be in play should he emerge victorious.

The theory is that a moderate Democrat like Jones may have to work exhaustively across the aisle if he is representing a red state like Alabama. What better way to do that than on tax reform.

A Fox News poll last week showed the race in a dead heat between Moore and Jones.

But wait. There’s more.

What happens if Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., is convicted in his corruption trial and is forced to resign? There is a narrow window under which New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, could appoint a fellow GOPer to the Senate if Menendez leave office prior to the end of Christie’s term next year.

Another Republican in the Senate could help the GOP on tax reform. But what if a potential Republican senator from New Jersey opposes the package because it kills deductions for state and local taxes, a big issue in a tax-burdened place like New Jersey.

So, the race is on for Republicans to knock out tax reform as quickly as possible before they face other quandaries.

That’s why House Republicans are aiming to vote this week to align themselves with the Senate budget. That paves the way for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, to post prospective bill text around the first of November.

Brady would then hold a “markup” session in which lawmakers retrench the bill in committee. Some House Republicans would then like to race the plan to the floor before Thanksgiving.

Of course, who knows what would happen in the Senate. And it’s unclear if the House and Senate could ever match up their own tax bills -- provided that both chambers can approve something expeditiously.

People may grouse that the devil may be in the details on tax reform and that could slow matters. True. But Republicans may be so desperate to pass anything that in a strange way, the details may not matter. That could be especially true if Congress is under the gun to wrap up by Christmas.

The conundrums Republicans could face aren’t new when it comes to dealing with major legislation.

Democrats had 60 votes to overcome all sorts of Senate filibusters when they prepared to advance ObamaCare in 2009. Then-Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., passed away. In 2004, the Massachusetts legislature changed the rules to prevent then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, from appointing a Republican to the Senate should then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., win the presidency.

But the Massachusetts legislature reversed course after Kennedy’s death so then-Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, could quickly appoint a fellow party member. Patrick tapped Sen. Paul Kirk, D-Mass., to serve as a caretaker senator until there was a special election in January 2010.

Kirk’s appointment helped Democrats preserve operational control of the Senate to pass the first version of ObamaCare. Democrats beat back repeated Republican efforts to filibuster, holding their 60-vote Senate supermajority.

But things changed in January, 2010. That’s when then-Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., upset Democratic nominee Martha Coakley in the special election. Democrats suddenly held only 59 Senate seats and could no longer quash Republican filibusters with the necessary 60 yeas.

As a result, Democrats employed some parliamentary wizardry and finished ObamaCare in March 2010. They did so using the special budget reconciliation process that sidesteps filibusters.

This is why Senate Republicans needed to approve a budget so badly. No budget? Then no budget reconciliation process for tax reform. Tax reform would be stuck.

The budget vote-a-rama last week was tame compared to other voting fests that drag on for 12 to 15 hours. The Senate chopped up this vote-a-rama into short tranches. The best way to gauge the intensity of such a vote? Pizza.

This was only a “four pizza” night. Reporters observed aides wheeling only four Ledo’s pizzas into McConnell’s office vote session, which wrapped up just before 9:40 p.m. Other vote-a-ramas may require as many as 15 or 20 pizzas. The roll call votes may not wrap until 3 or 4 in the morning.

McConnell spokesman Don Stewart contested the four pizza observation. He declared it to be “fake news” and tweeted out a picture of 18 Ledo’s pizza boxes stacked up in the leadership suite.

Four pizzas or 18 pizzas? Perhaps that reflects “dynamic scoring.” Dynamic scoring is the controversial actuarial method Republicans are using for tax reform to demonstrate it won’t explode the deficit.

Just one more variable to consider as congressional Republicans try to rush through tax reform before the end of the year.","Capitol Hill uncertainty on tax reform includes senators' health, legal woes",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/22/capitol-hill-uncertainty-on-tax-reform-includes-senators-health-legal-woes.html

But it turns out the joke’s on everyone who made one — including me — because it’s been the brand’s best-seller ever since.

Cut us some slack, though. Back then, there weren’t many subcompact crossovers on the road, so it did seem a little odd. But as the segment filled out over the years, it’s become clear that quirky styling is the norm, and no one does quirky like Mini. It really was a perfect fit.

Now there’s an all new one, and guess what. It’s even bigger! (A little.) It’s also much better.

The original had good looks, but economy class accommodations. The 2017 version is built on the same bones as the BMW X1, and the quality shows.

Prices start at $27,450 for a front-wheel-drive Cooper with a 139 hp three-cylinder turbocharged engine and run up to $38,650 for an all-wheel-drive John Cooper Works powered by the X1’s 228 hp four-cylinder turbo. A plug-in hybrid version is also available, but the right one — as with all Minis — is the Cooper S, which costs $32,550 with all-wheel-drive before you start getting frisky with the extensive options sheet.

That price spread puts the Countryman in a crowd that includes the Buick Encore, Mercedes GLA and Audi Q3. It deserves to be among them.

My tester rang up at $35,400 with a six-speed manual transmission and a technology package that includes a head-up display projected onto a small screen that rises from the dashboard. Radar cruise control with automatic emergency braking and an eight-speed automatic are some of the other features on offer.

The interior of the Countryman is classic Mini, with floating round gauges on the steering column, a circular housing for the infotainment system and toggle switches all over the place. Everything feels as good as it looks.

There’s an abundance of room for both passengers and stuff. The cabin easily passes the four 6-foot passenger test, and the cargo area is a very decent size that can be expanded further by flipping up the floor or sliding the rear seats forward … a feature all small crossovers should offer.

Few offer this much driving enjoyment. The Countryman is at once solid, nimble and limber. I wouldn’t take it too far off-road, but the pseudo-SUV is in its element on a twisty, bumpy, paved one. There’s even a computer game built into it that encourages this behavior by giving you points for driving on rough stuff. Meanwhile, its German roots show through as it drills down the highway with the smoothness and stability of a small freight train.

The Countryman may be quirky, but it’s no joke.

(Denny Hamlin) ""They're risking their life each and every weekend, and they're on the road just, you know, just like everyone else is each and every weekend.""

Hamlin speaking with Sirius XM NASCAR Radio there, calling for more revenue from NASCAR's TV deal to be shared with teams.

This as NASCAR unveiled rule changes for 2018 to cars that will see the addition of radiators and common flat splitters for all races, and efforts to increase down-force and horsepower for competitors.

Senate Republicans narrowly passed a $4 trillion budget plan Thursday, taking their first big step toward a tax reform package promised by President Donald Trump.

Approval of the nonbinding plan allows the Senate to use a special process known as ""budget reconciliation"" that would forestall a Democratic filibuster.

""Tonight we completed the first step towards replacing our broken tax code by passing a comprehensive, fiscally responsible budget that will help put the federal government on a path to balance,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace a failing tax code that holds Americans back with one that works for them.""



The Senate plan, approved on a 51-49 vote, calls for $473 billion in cuts from Medicare over 10 years and more than $1 trillion from Medicaid.

If fully implemented, the plan would cut spending by more than $5 trillion over the next 10 years, with an average of approximately $540 billion per year over the life of the plan, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.

She told the paper she spent most of her childhood and early 20s in York County and was homeschooled.","Caitlan Coleman says fond memories of her Pennsylvania childhood helped sustain her during her time in brutal captivity as a Taliban hostage.

Her memories included begging her father to take her to the local firemen’s carnivals, ice cream and hiking, according to a report Sunday in her hometown newspaper, the York Daily Record.

“So much of my childhood and even 20s were spent in York County; it has shaped me, and my fond memories helped to brighten some of the dark days,” Coleman, 31, wrote in an email Saturday, according to the paper.

Her husband says she was rushed to a hospital Monday but she told the paper she wasn’t ready to talk about her hospitalization, noting only that she hoped to be discharged soon and that the Canadian medical system was ""doing a pretty good job"" treating her.

She also said she wasn’t ready to talk about what she, her husband and their children went through during their captivity.

The paper reported that Coleman likened some of her interactions with the media to prison. She said the attention has led to scrutiny, negativity and pressure to speak before she was comfortable.

“Why don’t I have the right to just be myself and be with my husband and children?” she wrote, according to the paper.

""Everybody says 'No, you have to come out and talk about it', but no, no I don't and everybody nice has said it's my choice and I can talk when I want, and to whom I want,"" Coleman wrote.

The paper reported that her husband Joseph Boyle initiated the exchange.

Coleman, her Canadian husband and their three children were rescued Oct. 11 by Pakistani troops, five years after the couple was abducted in Afghanistan on a backpacking trip. The children were born in captivity.

Boyle said after landing at Toronto's airport that the Taliban-linked Haqqani network killed an infant daughter and raped his wife during the years they were held.

In prior email exchange with The Associated Press, Boyle did not respond to a question about the fourth child, but later told Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that it was a forced abortion. The Taliban said in a statement it was a miscarriage.

Boyle told the Daily Record that he believed his wife would enjoy speaking about her memories of home.

She told the paper she spent most of her childhood and early 20s in York County and was homeschooled.

“Good times and great timesare not forgotten, even now,” Coleman said in the emails.

Her father told the paper his daughter’s rescue was a “blessing.”

Jim Coleman gave credit to President Trump for his daughter's release, as well as to the Obama administration for aiding and working on getting his daughter and her family freed over the last several years, the paper reported.

He recalled how his daughter always wanted him to take her to the local carnivals.

""She always wanted me to win a bear,"" he said.

As my own children reach adulthood, I listen to their conversations about how they “should” exercise, if only they had the time.
The team was bigger than the perfect, and the fun of training together was its own reward.
I wonder if more people would overlook the fact that they are “exercising” if they could remember that it used to be fun outside.
Take a page from your 5-year-old self and have a moment of fun where the sun is shining, and don’t let the fact that some will label your activity “exercise” ruin it.","So Americans are fat. At least that’s the running monologue playing out in more media outlets than we can completely ignore. But somewhere along the journey from childhood to retirement the solution to that problem has become the New Year’s Resolution that almost everyone makes and almost everyone hates: exercise more.

As children, playing outside was the reward, not the punishment … so much so that a ridiculous trend in too many elementary schools today is for children to be deprived of outside play time in a stationary timeout at recess as punishment (because we all know that the one-thing that helps discipline a hyperactive child to be calm is enforced stillness. Or not.)

Yet, trudging through the institutional world of education, exercise became the thing that the quintessential, sadistic gym teacher enforced, complete with tests, metrics and goals for the unattainable. The joy of movement dimmed as the realization that perfection was just not on the menu for most of us. And there was math to prove it. Charts, indexes, measurements, graphs – all calculated to show the weary where they fall short.

Exercise stopped being many people’s entertainment, when it stopped being fun.

I can’t be the only person who finds modern-day conversations about exercise about as compelling as a marketing report, full of deliverables and metrics. Or like a performance evaluation by a cranky boss who won’t notice the 10 things you did right, but only the one thing you did wrong.

I already live in a world of deadlines and demands. Whether at home or at work, I must comply with so many requirements that I cannot bear to take up an activity that has a to- do list.

In fact, a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that even when people were paid to go to the gym, most were not motivated to do it. Money could not camouflage the reality that many have lost that loving feeling for organized pain. And when the sales pitch is “no pain, no gain,” how surprising is it that many people just say no?

As my own children reach adulthood, I listen to their conversations about how they “should” exercise, if only they had the time. “Should” stands doomed in the English language, a verbal storeroom for closets we don’t want to clean or vegetables we don’t want to eat. As soon as you “should” do something, you don’t want to do it.

In today’s competitive school environments, the emphasis can be so much on winning that coaches don’t want to spend time with kids in general, but rather a specific few, so they cull every team to the top players.

Forgotten is the beautiful model of days past (called my childhood) in which every kid could come out to practice and to participate with the team, while only a deserving and talented few suited up on game day. The team was bigger than the perfect, and the fun of training together was its own reward. If you need a reminder of that, watch the movie “Rudy” with a box of tissues.

I am a proud member of the Track B team … and will probably live longer for it. The A Team intensified their performances and ran until they were sick in the grass, striving for excellence. Admirable to be sure.

On the B team, we jogged on the track, rarely so intensely that we couldn’t keep the conversation running, and got out of school on the day of the meets to run a few races and cheer on the winners. Staying in shape in the context of community was the draw.

Recently, I’ve rediscovered “running,” which for me means faster than walking at a pace most likely to be the worst in any timed race. I don’t want to train for anything, achieve anything or set a record. What I like best about running is that I’m not working.

I wonder if more people would overlook the fact that they are “exercising” if they could remember that it used to be fun outside. It feels a bit un-American to tell people don’t go for the gold, but I suspect that more people would try getting active if it sounded less like work and lot more like a reward.

Outside, you get a break from work, chores, family, computers and responsibilities.

Hill told TMZ Sports in an impromptu interview at Los Angeles International Airport that she put “ESPN in a bad spot.”

“ESPN acted what they felt was right. I don’t have any argument,” Hill told TMZ Sports. ""After my Donald Trump tweets, I deserved a suspension.”

She said, ""I violated the policy. Going forward we'll be in a good, healthy place.""

Hill is set to return to work after she was suspended for two weeks when she violated the network’s social media guidelines for the second time, ESPN announced on Oct. 9.

“Jemele Hill has been suspended for two weeks for a second violation of our social media guidelines. She previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet. In the aftermath, all employees were reminded of how much individual tweets may reflect negatively on ESPN and that such action would have consequences. Hence this decision,” a network spokesman said in a statement.

“ESPN acted what they felt was right. I don’t have any argument."" - Jemele Hill

Hill bashed Trump on Twitter on Sept. 11, calling him a “white supremacist who has surrounded himself with other white supremacists. She continued her rant by saying Trump was “the most ignorant, offensive president of [her] lifetime,” a “bigot” and “unqualified and unfit to be president.”

She added, “If he were not white, he never would have been elected.”

Her tweets caught the attention of Trump and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who said the rhetoric was a “fireable offense” and demanded an apology. Hill issued an apology and said her tweets were her “personable beliefs” that “painted ESPN in an unfair light.”

But the outspoken liberal anchor continued her controversial comments on the social media site on Oct. 8 when she said Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones “created a problem for his players, specifically the black ones” in the NFL kneeling controversy. Jones said the NFL and the Cowboys were “going to stand up for the flag” after Vice President Mike Pence left an Indianapolis Colts game when several players kneeled during the national anthem.

“If they don't kneel, some will see them as sellouts,” Hill said.

“By drawing a line in the sand, Jerry put his players under more scrutiny and threw them under the bus... If the rationale behind JJ's stance is keeping the fan base happy, make him see that he is underestimated how all of his fan base feels,” Hill wrote on Twitter, adding that “paying customers” should “boycott” Jones’ advertisers.

Hill told TMZ Sports on Saturday that the time off was “reflective” and she was “grateful” for her supporters, including Al Sharpton and Rosie O’Donnell, who based the network for suspending her.

“I’m thankful for them but I’m happy to be back,” Hill said.

“Me and ESPN are fine…We are fine. We are in a good place. I’m happy to be back on the network,” she added.

This is one hot World Series — the Houston Astros, fresh off a Game 7 victory over the Yankees, taking on the narrowly favored Los Angeles Dodgers, well rested after a postseason romp.

Could be real steamy, too. It's supposed to be almost 100 degrees at Dodger Stadium for the opener Tuesday night, maybe the hottest temperature ever at a World Series game.

""Now we chase the ultimate prize,"" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. ""There's two teams standing. It's a race to four wins now. At the start there's a race to 11, we've got seven of them down.""

At least the familiar October chill that makes players and fans shiver shouldn't be an issue outdoors in sun-baked California or under the retractable roof at Minute Maid Park.

Not that young stars Cody Bellinger and Carlos Correa would mind, nor would old pros Carlos Beltran and Chase Utley, nor top starters Dallas Keuchel and Yu Darvish.

Because a chance to win a ring doesn't come very often — these teams that have already played more than 700 games against each other over the years already know that.

The Astros have never won the crown. They're playing for a whole region, with the Houston Strong patches on their uniforms representing an area hit hard by Hurricane Harvey.

""There's a lot of people that are really hurting right now in this city,"" said Verlander, the ALCS MVP. ""And it gives the city something to rally around and gives people something to cheer for that otherwise may not have a lot to be hopeful for.""

The Dodgers haven't been in the World Series since 1988, when Kirk Gibson's bat, Orel Hershiser's arm and Tommy Lasorda's moves outdid Oakland for the crown.

Now with Lakers great Magic Johnson as a part-owner, this LA team that led the majors with 104 wins is hoping to bring back the glory days that began in Brooklyn.

""I just want to win a World Series,"" Kershaw said after the Dodgers dethroned the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of the NL Championship Series. ""I know more than anybody how hard it is to get there. So, I'm definitely not taking this one for granted.""

Said mercurial outfielder Yasiel Puig: ""The trophy's coming soon.""

The Astros, the major leagues' highest-scoring team this year, have never even won a World Series game. They only time they made it this far was 2005, when a club that included Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte got swept by the White Sox.

In fact, a World Series prize is the one piece of hardware missing from the trophy case from the Lone Star State. Texas teams have won the Super Bowl and championships in the NBA, NHL, college football and men's and women's basketball, but never in baseball.

Under the leadership of executive Nolan Ryan, the Texas Rangers came within one strike in 2011 before losing to St. Louis. The Ryan Express, who once pitched a no-hitter for Houston against the Dodgers, is currently an Astros exec.

The Astros posted 101 wins this year — not since Baltimore (108) and Cincinnati (102) in 1970 has the World Series matched teams who reached triple-digits.

These teams last met in 2015, when the Astros swept a three-game series at home. But they'd seen a lot of each other in the past.

Overall, the Dodgers are 388-323 vs. the Astros. Houston debuted as the Colt .45s as a National League expansion team in 1962, beat the Dodgers in a one-game playoff for the NL West championship in 1980 and eventually moved to the AL in 2013.

That first year in the AL, the young Astros got pounded and lost 111 times. But with smart drafts and player development, Houston emerged as a power. Hinch's club capped its rise by beating Boston in the AL Division Series, then stopping the Yankees 4-0 Saturday night in Game 7 of the ALCS.

The Dodgers, with a major league-high $226 million payroll, won their fifth straight NL West title this year, then 7-1 in the playoffs against the Diamondbacks and Cubs under manager Dave Roberts.

In making the announcement, Jay Wallace said, “Throughout his 50-plus years in broadcast journalism, Chris has established himself as one of the most esteemed journalists of our time. We are delighted to have him continue informing our viewers with his hard-hitting interviews and tough-minded reporting for years to come.”

Chris Wallace added, “After almost 14 years as the anchor of Fox News Sunday, I think I am starting to get the hang of it. Rupert Murdoch has asked me to stay on the beat well past the 2020 election. I am honored by his confidence, and excited to keep reporting as part of the FOX News team.”

Wallace currently serves as the anchor of FOX News Sunday, a one-hour live broadcast airing Sunday mornings across the nation on FOX Broadcasting Company and on later in the day on FNC.

Additionally, in August 2015, Wallace co-moderated the first GOP presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle, which delivered a record breaking 24 million viewers and is the most-watched non-sports cable telecast of all time. He also co-moderated the network’s second and third debates of the 2016 cycle, held on January 28th in Des Moines, IA and March 3rd in Detroit, MI.

Throughout his 50-plus years of broadcast experience, Wallace has won every major broadcast news award for his reporting, including three Emmy Awards, the Dupont-Columbia Silver Baton, a Peabody Award, the Radio Television Digital News Association’s Paul White Award and the Sol Taishoff Award for Broadcast Journalism, which was bestowed on him by the National Press Foundation.

“Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems.

“I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party!” Trump tweeted Saturday.","President Trump on Sunday slammed Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson for disclosing his phone conversation with an Army widow, again calling her “wacky” and a “disaster” for Democrats.

Trump has pummeled Wilson, of Florida, on social media since Tuesday, the day after Wilson listened to his call to the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, then told the public that Trump said, “He knew what he signed up for.”

Johnson was one of four American servicemen killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger.

“Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action & vote R!,” Trump tweeted Sunday.

The tweet was similar to one Saturday in which he first called Wilson “wacky,” though this time Trump seemed to suggest voters should consider her actions when they vote next year on whether to re-elect every House member seeking another term.

Wilson is expected to seek a fifth term in 2018.

“I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party!” Trump tweeted Saturday.

White House Chief of Staff retired Gen. John Kelly tried Thursday to explain how personal and difficult condolence calls are for military families and leaders who make them.

Kelly, whose military son was killed in Afghanistan, said he became “broken-hearted” upon learning the call to Johnson’s family was made public, and he criticized Wilson for apparently trying to politicize the matter.

Wilson later suggested in newspaper interviews that some in the White House are racist, though she didn’t single out Kelly. And she suggested that Kelly was forced to make public statements on the call to save his job, amid speculation that Trump is unhappy with his performance.

“He will say anything,” she told Politico.","Trump slams 'wacky' Rep. Wilson, says she's 'disaster for the Dems'",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/22/trump-slams-wacky-rep-wilson-says-shes-disaster-for-dems.html

The civil complaint filed on Monday accused the NFL of hiding the dangers of football and also named Riddell, the company that previously manufactured the league’s helmets that Hernandez wore when he was playing for the New England Patriots.

“Aaron experienced a chaotic and horrendous existence in many respects, due to his undiagnosed brain injury,” according to the complaint obtained by People Magazine.

The Hernandez estate also said CTE caused “aggression, explosive behavior, loss of concentration, mood swings, depression, apathy, and cognitive impairment.”

Riddell, an Illinois-based manufacturer, said it intends to vigorously defend its products and its reputation against concussion-related lawsuits

Hernandez hanged himself in his Massachusetts prison cell in April, five days after he was acquitted of the 2012 double murder of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. He was serving life in prison for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd.

Boston University’s CTE Center announced in September that experts found the former football player suffered from stage three CTE. The disease has been shown to cause depression, violent mood swings and other cognitive problems in people.

“Hernandez had early brain atrophy and large perforations in the septum pellucidum, a central membrane,” the university’s center said in a statement.

The lawyers are seeking the damages on behalf of Hernandez’s 4-year-old daughter. The case was refiled in state court after the federal case was dismissed last Friday. The initial federal lawsuit claimed the NFL and the Patriots failed to ""disclose, treat or protect"" Hernandez from so-called ""repetitive impact injuries."" The Patriots have since been dropped from the lawsuit.

During his early high school years, Hernandez was known as a gifted athlete, but was also seen with a “rough-and-tumble” crowd, the New York Times reported. His father, Dennis Hernandez, kept him grounded until his death in 2006. His mother told reporters that she was worried the death would derail her son’s life.

Over the past nine months, Donald Trump’s cage match with the Washington press corps has turned into an unedifying national spectacle. Too often, the serious business of the nation has been pushed aside so that the press and Mr. Trump could go tit for tat, like children on a schoolyard. On Thursday, an adult finally stepped into the room.

John Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff and a retired four-star general, addressed White House reporters on this week’s dispute between the press and the President. That is the controversy around Mr. Trump’s call to the mother of a U.S. soldier who was killed during an ambush in Niger recently.

As anyone who follows media reports knows, the President’s call to this mother grew into a personal feud between Mr. Trump and a Democratic Congresswoman who disclosed what the President said. It then produced long newspaper reports examining the President’s relationship with every identifiable Gold Star family during his term.

It took awhile for Mr. Kelly to get around to talking about that phone call. Instead, he spent some time offering what we in journalism—or anyone purporting to be engaged in a serious line of work—would call context. Mr. Kelly described what happens when a U.S. soldier or Marine—“the best 1% this country produces”—gets killed in action. What he described was a military process that is graphic, emotionally intense and, most of all, untouchable.

Untouchable, as Mr. Kelly made clear, in the sense that what has happened is so grave, so personal and so difficult that the reality of pushing through it comes down to an encounter between the fallen soldier’s family, the officer who informs them and, in time, support from those who served alongside their son or daughter.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

prev

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy left the nation breathless when he announced the steps he wants to use to crush the separatist movement in the prosperous Catalonia region.

Rajoy called on Spain's Senate to trigger a previously untapped section of the Spain Constitution that allows the central government to temporarily intervene in the running of a region if its leaders have broken the law.

Activating the constitutional authority granted by Article 155 is Madrid's boldest response so far to avowals from Catalonia's leaders to declare independence based on an Oct. 1 referendum that a court has judged as illegal.

There are some of the regional powers Rajoy is seeking by triggering Article 155:

DEPOSE LEADERS

First and foremost, Rajoy wants to remove the members of Catalonia's pro-independence regional government. Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, vice president Oriol Junqueras, and the 12 regional ministers claim Catalonia is sovereign and not subject to Spanish law.

IMPOSE CONTROL

Catalonia has secured the ability to govern itself in many areas since democracy returned to Spain following the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975. Education, health and policing are areas in which the region enjoys self-rule.

Rajoy proposes taking over the vast regional administration and its roughly 200,000 civil servants after the top officials are removed. How Madrid's management would work is unclear. One option would be for Spanish ministries to assume direct control of their regional counterparts.

Rajoy said interim authorities would have the power to fire public employees and that all decisions by regional administrators would need the central government's approval.

TIMETABLE FOR TAKEOVER

A special commission of 27 senators will assess Rajoy's request on Tuesday. Regional president Puigdemont will have the chance to argue his case before the Senate on Thursday before it holds a vote expected Friday.

DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE

Political observers across the ideological spectrum agree Rajoy and his government may have to resort to using force if Catalonia's leaders disobey orders to step down. Calls for resistance and disobedience have become standard in the secessionist camp.

Hardcore separatists will put intense pressure on Puigdemont and his government to stay in office. There are fears such a standoff could lead to violent police raids like those that marred the referendum.

""I don't think that Puigdemont will just walk away because he receives notification that he has been removed in a letter,"" political analyst Josep Ramoneda said. ""I think Rajoy is going to find that this will be very hard to enforce.""

SNAP ELECTIONS

In all 17 of Spain's regions, the right to call early regional elections belongs exclusively to regional leaders. Rajoy wants that right passed to him temporarily in Catalonia. His request includes a commitment to call for regional elections within six months.

Catalan separatists, who won 48 percent of the vote in a 2015 election, currently hold 72 of the 135-seat regional parliament. Rajoy will be hoping a new election would tip the balance in favor of lawmakers opposed to secession, especially those worried about the hundreds of businesses who already relocated their headquarters, fearing they would be out of the European Union if Catalonia secedes.

LIMITS ON LEGISLATION

While the prime minister isn't asking to dissolve the Catalan Parliament, Rajoy wants to what it can do. Specifically, the parliament would not be able to designate a new regional president until after Rajoy calls for new elections.

Nor would it be able to quiz the region's interim authorities, power that would temporarily go to Spain's Senate. Catalonia's Parliament also would not be allowed to pass laws countering the Article 155 measures and the central government would assume the right to veto bills.

POLICE

Catalonia and the Basque Country are Spain's only regions with their own fully deployed police forces. Spain wants to take direct control of Catalonia's police, the Mossos d'Esquadra, and warns it will consider increasing the presence of the National Police and Civil Guard. Mossos chief Josep Trapero is already under investigation for sedition by a Spanish judge.

FINANCES

Spain will increase its supervision of the region's finances, specifically to ensure that no public funds or revenues are used to promote a campaign for secession. Madrid put a large portion of Catalonia's budget under its direct supervision in the run-up to the Oct. 1 referendum in an attempt to stop the vote from occurring.

PUBLIC MEDIA

Under Rajoy's plan, Spanish authorities will also oversee the running of Catalonia's public television and radio stations, which have been major proponents of secession. His government will ""guarantee the transmission of information that is true, objective and balanced"" and that is ""respectful of the values and principles of the Spanish Constitution and charter law for Catalonia,"" Rajoy said.

The Catalan Audiovisual Media Corporation said Sunday it ""stands firm by its mission to offer all the citizens of Catalonia .... a public service of the highest quality, committed to ethical, democratic and pluralistic principles.""",Spain: Taking control of Catalonia means big power transfer,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/22/spain-taking-control-catalonia-means-big-power-transfer.html

Carrey’s team filed a new motion on Friday against White, who killed herself in September 2015 by overdosing on prescription drugs, People magazine reported. White’s mother, Brigid Sweetman, and her estranged husband, Mark Burton, filed a wrongful death case against the actor, claiming he utilized his “wealth, influence and celebrity status” to supply her the drugs she overdosed on.

Carrey claimed White changed her friend’s Planned Parenthood records to trick him on her STD results when they began dating. She allegedly back-dated the form from 2013 to 2011, court documents obtained by People magazine stated. He added that White’s mother and her previous attorney, Filippo Marchino, were conspiring in 2013 to extort the 55-year-old actor through “smears and threats of public degradation via false allegations.”

""White's intent in obtaining these records was clear — she cooked the records, creating forgeries with altered information, phony tests and fictitious dates,"" the documents stated.

Carrey’s attorneys alleged that text messages between White and her friend proved the former girlfriend worked to forge the Planned Parenthood medical records before handing them to Carrey.

“On April 2, 2013, [White’s friend] had a routine appointment at Planned Parenthood to re-fill her birth control contraceptive. During her appointment, she gave a urine and blood sample for a routine HIV test and STD screening and was tested for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. The results were all negative,” according to the documents, adding that a week later White asked for a copy of the records.

The court documents added, “Though [her friend] never knew what White intended to do with her medical records or what she ultimately did with them, we now know that White, using a legitimate and official copy of her friend’s Planned Parenthood records, forged test results to ‘prove’ the lie that she had tested negative for sexually transmitted diseases just prior to her relationship with Carrey and to support her attempt to extort millions of dollars from her famous ex-boyfriend.”

Sweetman and Burton slammed Carey, saying in a statement to People magazine that his new court filing was a “desperate attempt to save himself.”

“Carrey has now resorted to outright falsehoods. Let’s see if his story holds up once he is under oath. It won’t,” the statement said.

Carrey’s lawyers are asking for the case against him to be dismissed if the medical records are fabricated. The new filing comes weeks after the attorney for White’s estate released a note allegedly written by White in 2013 that accused Carrey of giving her STDs and exposing her to drugs and mental abuse.

""Before you I might not have had very much, but I had respect, I was a happy person, I loved life, I was confident and I felt good in my own skin and was proud of most decisions I made,"" reads the note, which was dated April 8, 2013. ""I met you, you introduced me to cocaine, prostitutes, mental abuse and disease,” the note allegedly written by White stated.

Twitter users were quick to refute the study’s findings, however, arguing that the results don’t actually reflect what people in any given state prefer, and calling the study “nonsense.”

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

In a January interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Pierre said Trump herself contributed to the design of the white, off-the-shoulder dress, picking out a “beautiful six-ply silk” for the construction and specifying the shape of the neckline.



""The lines are as sleek as a paper cut; the curves of the skirt are fluid, yet the overall shape is sharp and intense,” he told the magazine. “For me it reflects her personality.”

According to the Smithsonian, the tradition of first ladies giving over their gowns began in 1912 with Helen Taft, who donated the white silk chiffon dress she wore to her husband’s 1909 inauguration.

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

The spotlight should be on the fallen soldiers who gave their lives for this country.

Instead, we’ve all been plunged into another anguished round of finger-pointing, blame-shifting and all-around nastiness that is nothing short of sad. Everyone is caught in the media crossfire and the deaths of brave Americans have become politicized.

Now there’s no denying that President Trump opened the door at his Monday news conference when he was asked why he hasn’t spoken publicly about the four soldiers killed in Niger. He turned that into a suggestion that Barack Obama and other presidents rarely or never called the families of the fallen, triggering vehement denials from former Obama aides.

The president may not have intended to pick this fight, but the next day he questioned whether Obama had called John Kelly, now his chief of staff, after he lost a son in Afghanistan in 2010. (Obama had not, but invited Kelly, who became a Marine general, to a breakfast for Gold Star families.)

“Vote on this before Thanksgiving,” Meadows, the leader of the conservative caucus, said during a recent Fox News interview.

Trade in tinsel and wrapping paper for cornbread and stuffing.

Maybe had members of Congress really stepped on the gas, they could have had it done before Canadian Thanksgiving. But that came two weeks ago.

The reason for the sprint? Several wild cards could upend tax reform if congressional Republicans don’t move expeditiously. That’s where uncertainty enters the picture.

Consider the Senate vote Thursday night to adopt a budget framework for tax reform. That budget blueprint wasn’t so much about spending priorities as it was about granting the chamber a special parliamentary tool known as “budget reconciliation” with which to tackle tax reform.

Senate Republicans can’t overcome a filibuster on tax reform. But budget reconciliation eliminates filibusters and requires only a simple majority of senators to clear the final hurdle. (That’s 51 yeas if all 100 senators vote.) But the roll call tally on the budget framework plan was tight: 51-49.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the lone GOP nay. Lose another Republican and it’s 50-50. That would require Vice President Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. However, tax reform is dead if another Republican drops off.

So here are three variables that could imperil tax reform:

The health of GOP Sens. Thad Cochran, Mississippi, and John McCain, Arizona, and the special election in Alabama on Dec. 12 to succeed Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala. Conservative Roy Moore defeated Strange in the GOP primary. Moore will touch gloves with Democrat Doug Jones for the right to come to Washington.

Let’s start with Cochran.

Cochran had been absent from Washington for weeks suffering from health issues. His office declared Cochran would be back after treatment for a urinary tract infection.

Then Cochran’s staff announced early he wouldn’t return. That put adoption of the budget on a tightrope. A day later, Cochran’s team backtracked and said the senator would be in Washington to vote.

Cochran has appeared increasingly feeble of late. He’s chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and rarely provides reporters with in-depth answers when asked questions in the hall -- a stark contrast to how Cochran formerly engaged scribes.

Cochran returned Tuesday, guided by an aide, to the Senate chamber. I asked Cochran if congressional leaders rousted him from his sickbed because his vote was crucial to approve the budget.

“It’s a beautiful day outside,” he replied.

The non sequitur reply may have been a precursor as the senator sat quietly at his desk in the chamber, rarely engaging fellow senators.

During one roll call, the aide nudged Cochran to vote as he had apparently forgotten to do so. Cochran appeared to struggle to raise his left arm in the air to signal either thumbs up or thumbs down -- the Senate custom to record one’s vote.

On the next vote, the clerk read the Senate roll in alphabetical order. Cochran’s name falls between Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Susan Collin, R-Maine. When the clerk hit Cochran’s name, the senator immediately raised his hand and hollered “aye.” The aide then elbowed Cochran and could audibly be heard in the chamber saying “no. no.”

At the behest of his aide, Cochran then switched his vote to nay. There was a brief pause in the calling of the roll as the clerk corrected Cochran’s ballot on the tally sheet.

It’s not uncommon for senators to vote “incorrectly,” then switch their vote. That’s especially true during the Senate’s “vote-a-rama.” That’s when senators take vote after vote -- sometimes for hours on end -- trying to finish the budget. It’s also routine for senators to rely on aides to follow proceedings and “coach” them on how to vote.

But Cochran’s performance provoked lots of murmuring in the Capitol and raised questions as to who was calling the shots.

Cochran disappeared for a couple of hours and missed a few votes during the vote-a-rama. Had Cochran been absent, the Senate would have adopted the budget framework for tax reform 50-49. That’s pretty close. It shows there’s no margin for error for Republicans on tax reform.

McCain’s been back in Washington for weeks now, after missing time for brain cancer treatment. He’s appeared vigorous, tangling with reporters in the hallways and even threatening the Pentagon with subpoenas following the ambush of U.S. forces in Niger. But his health issues forced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to postpone work on an effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare for a period in July.

That was the case until McCain returned to work -- and promptly voted to torpedo the measure.

The Alabama special election also bears watching. The campaign of GOPer Moore indicated to Fox on Friday that it had no guidance on how the nominee would vote on tax reform should he win in December. But later, Moore spokesman Drew Messer told the cable news network that “Moore is all in on working with President Trump on tax reform.”

That said, some GOP Senate sources fear Moore may be too conservative to vote for the final tax reform product, if he win a ticket to Washington. By the same token, other sources told Fox that Democrat Doug Jones may even be in play should he emerge victorious.

The theory is that a moderate Democrat like Jones may have to work exhaustively across the aisle if he is representing a red state like Alabama. What better way to do that than on tax reform.

A Fox News poll last week showed the race in a dead heat between Moore and Jones.

But wait. There’s more.

What happens if Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., is convicted in his corruption trial and is forced to resign? There is a narrow window under which New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, could appoint a fellow GOPer to the Senate if Menendez leave office prior to the end of Christie’s term next year.

Another Republican in the Senate could help the GOP on tax reform. But what if a potential Republican senator from New Jersey opposes the package because it kills deductions for state and local taxes, a big issue in a tax-burdened place like New Jersey.

So, the race is on for Republicans to knock out tax reform as quickly as possible before they face other quandaries.

That’s why House Republicans are aiming to vote this week to align themselves with the Senate budget. That paves the way for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, to post prospective bill text around the first of November.

Brady would then hold a “markup” session in which lawmakers retrench the bill in committee. Some House Republicans would then like to race the plan to the floor before Thanksgiving.

Of course, who knows what would happen in the Senate. And it’s unclear if the House and Senate could ever match up their own tax bills -- provided that both chambers can approve something expeditiously.

People may grouse that the devil may be in the details on tax reform and that could slow matters. True. But Republicans may be so desperate to pass anything that in a strange way, the details may not matter. That could be especially true if Congress is under the gun to wrap up by Christmas.

The conundrums Republicans could face aren’t new when it comes to dealing with major legislation.

Democrats had 60 votes to overcome all sorts of Senate filibusters when they prepared to advance ObamaCare in 2009. Then-Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., passed away. In 2004, the Massachusetts legislature changed the rules to prevent then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, from appointing a Republican to the Senate should then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., win the presidency.

But the Massachusetts legislature reversed course after Kennedy’s death so then-Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, could quickly appoint a fellow party member. Patrick tapped Sen. Paul Kirk, D-Mass., to serve as a caretaker senator until there was a special election in January 2010.

Kirk’s appointment helped Democrats preserve operational control of the Senate to pass the first version of ObamaCare. Democrats beat back repeated Republican efforts to filibuster, holding their 60-vote Senate supermajority.

But things changed in January, 2010. That’s when then-Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., upset Democratic nominee Martha Coakley in the special election. Democrats suddenly held only 59 Senate seats and could no longer quash Republican filibusters with the necessary 60 yeas.

As a result, Democrats employed some parliamentary wizardry and finished ObamaCare in March 2010. They did so using the special budget reconciliation process that sidesteps filibusters.

This is why Senate Republicans needed to approve a budget so badly. No budget? Then no budget reconciliation process for tax reform. Tax reform would be stuck.

The budget vote-a-rama last week was tame compared to other voting fests that drag on for 12 to 15 hours. The Senate chopped up this vote-a-rama into short tranches. The best way to gauge the intensity of such a vote? Pizza.

This was only a “four pizza” night. Reporters observed aides wheeling only four Ledo’s pizzas into McConnell’s office vote session, which wrapped up just before 9:40 p.m. Other vote-a-ramas may require as many as 15 or 20 pizzas. The roll call votes may not wrap until 3 or 4 in the morning.

McConnell spokesman Don Stewart contested the four pizza observation. He declared it to be “fake news” and tweeted out a picture of 18 Ledo’s pizza boxes stacked up in the leadership suite.

Four pizzas or 18 pizzas? Perhaps that reflects “dynamic scoring.” Dynamic scoring is the controversial actuarial method Republicans are using for tax reform to demonstrate it won’t explode the deficit.

Just one more variable to consider as congressional Republicans try to rush through tax reform before the end of the year.","Capitol Hill uncertainty on tax reform includes senators' health, legal woes",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/22/capitol-hill-uncertainty-on-tax-reform-includes-senators-health-legal-woes.html

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

First and foremost, Rajoy wants to remove the members of Catalonia's pro-independence regional government. Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, vice president Oriol Junqueras, and the 12 regional ministers claim Catalonia is sovereign and not subject to Spanish law.

IMPOSE CONTROL

Catalonia has secured the ability to govern itself in many areas since democracy returned to Spain following the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975. Education, health and policing are areas in which the region enjoys self-rule.

Rajoy proposes taking over the vast regional administration and its roughly 200,000 civil servants after the top officials are removed. How Madrid's management would work is unclear. One option would be for Spanish ministries to assume direct control of their regional counterparts.

Rajoy said interim authorities would have the power to fire public employees and that all decisions by regional administrators would need the central government's approval.

TIMETABLE FOR TAKEOVER

A special commission of 27 senators will assess Rajoy's request on Tuesday. Regional president Puigdemont will have the chance to argue his case before the Senate on Thursday before it holds a vote expected Friday.

DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE

Political observers across the ideological spectrum agree Rajoy and his government may have to resort to using force if Catalonia's leaders disobey orders to step down. Calls for resistance and disobedience have become standard in the secessionist camp.

Hardcore separatists will put intense pressure on Puigdemont and his government to stay in office. There are fears such a standoff could lead to violent police raids like those that marred the referendum.

""I don't think that Puigdemont will just walk away because he receives notification that he has been removed in a letter,"" political analyst Josep Ramoneda said. ""I think Rajoy is going to find that this will be very hard to enforce.""

SNAP ELECTIONS

In all 17 of Spain's regions, the right to call early regional elections belongs exclusively to regional leaders. Rajoy wants that right passed to him temporarily in Catalonia. His request includes a commitment to call for regional elections within six months.

Catalan separatists, who won 48 percent of the vote in a 2015 election, currently hold 72 of the 135-seat regional parliament. Rajoy will be hoping a new election would tip the balance in favor of lawmakers opposed to secession, especially those worried about the hundreds of businesses who already relocated their headquarters, fearing they would be out of the European Union if Catalonia secedes.

LIMITS ON LEGISLATION

While the prime minister isn't asking to dissolve the Catalan Parliament, Rajoy wants to what it can do. Specifically, the parliament would not be able to designate a new regional president until after Rajoy calls for new elections.

Nor would it be able to quiz the region's interim authorities, power that would temporarily go to Spain's Senate. Catalonia's Parliament also would not be allowed to pass laws countering the Article 155 measures and the central government would assume the right to veto bills.

POLICE

Catalonia and the Basque Country are Spain's only regions with their own fully deployed police forces. Spain wants to take direct control of Catalonia's police, the Mossos d'Esquadra, and warns it will consider increasing the presence of the National Police and Civil Guard. Mossos chief Josep Trapero is already under investigation for sedition by a Spanish judge.

FINANCES

Spain will increase its supervision of the region's finances, specifically to ensure that no public funds or revenues are used to promote a campaign for secession. Madrid put a large portion of Catalonia's budget under its direct supervision in the run-up to the Oct. 1 referendum in an attempt to stop the vote from occurring.

PUBLIC MEDIA

Under Rajoy's plan, Spanish authorities will also oversee the running of Catalonia's public television and radio stations, which have been major proponents of secession. His government will ""guarantee the transmission of information that is true, objective and balanced"" and that is ""respectful of the values and principles of the Spanish Constitution and charter law for Catalonia,"" Rajoy said.

The Catalan Audiovisual Media Corporation said Sunday it ""stands firm by its mission to offer all the citizens of Catalonia .... a public service of the highest quality, committed to ethical, democratic and pluralistic principles.""",Spain: Taking control of Catalonia means big power transfer,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/22/spain-taking-control-catalonia-means-big-power-transfer.html

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

“The volcanic eruptions didn’t cause these (social) upheavals on their own,” Ludlow said.","Sun-choking debris cast off by volcanoes more than 2,000 years ago starved headwaters feeding the Nile river and hastened the downfall of ancient Egypt’s last kingdom, researchers claim.

Eruptions in the 3rd and 1st century B.C. — including one of the biggest blasts in the past 2,500 years — coincided with crop failures, large-scale revolts and the withdrawal of Egyptian armies from the battlefield, they reported in the journal Nature Communications.

Up to now, researchers had struggled to find an explanation for these events.

“Volcanic eruptions may have had a central role in the eventual collapse of the Ptolemaic dynasty,” the journal noted in a summary.

The findings, the authors said, also highlight the risk today of climate engineering schemes that would combat global warming by injecting billions of tiny particles into the stratosphere — just like a volcano — to block some of the sun’s rays.

Even if so-called solar radiation management lowers the planet’s temperature a notch or two, it could inadvertently cause major disruptions in rainfall patterns.

“Ptolemaic vulnerability to volcanic eruptions offers a caution for all monsoon-dependent agriculture regions,” which today include 70 percent of the world’s population, the authors wrote.

The Ptolemaic empire began in 305 B.C., shortly after the death of Alexander the Great, and ended in 30 B.C. with the suicide of Cleopatra. After that, the region became a Roman province.

The kingdom mostly thrived, nourished by the silt-rich Nile overflowing its banks in summer across a far-flung network of grain fields. An ingenious system of channels and dams stored water after the river receded in September.

VIOLENT UPRISINGS

“When the flood was good, the Nile Valley was one of the most agriculturally productive places in the ancient world,” said Francis Ludlow, a climate historian at Trinity College Dublin and co-author of the study.

But in some years, the river failed to rise, and trouble followed. Why this happened was not known.

Drawing from climate models, Greenland ice cores, and ancient Egyptian writings, researchers led by Joseph Manning of Yale University pieced together a narrative that showed an unmistakeable link with major volcanic eruptions around the world.

In 245 B.C., for example, the ruler Ptolemy III suddenly, and inexplicably, abandoned a successful military campaign against his arch nemesis, the Seleucid Empire, centred in present-day Syria and Iraq.

“This about-face changed everything about Near East history,” Manning said.

Historical records also pointed to simultaneous food shortages due to insufficient flooding of the Nile, as well as violent uprisings in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, which stretched across northeast Africa and parts of the Middle East.

A similar confluence of social upheaval, disease and starvation struck the empire in its final two decades.

Both periods of turmoil, the researchers found, coincided with major volcanic eruptions.

From more recent records, scientists know that the tens of millions of tons of sulphur dioxide particles ejected into the upper atmosphere by a major eruption can prevent monsoon weather from moving far enough north of the equator to thoroughly soak the Ethiopian highlands, the headwaters of the Nile.

This happened in 939 when Eldgja, in Iceland, blew its top, and again in 1783-84, when Iceland’s Laki erupted.

The Islamic Nilometer, a log of Nile water levels since 622, showed a corresponding impact on the river.

“The volcanic eruptions didn’t cause these (social) upheavals on their own,” Ludlow said.

“But they likely added fuel to existing economic, political and ethnic tensions.”

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

President Obama had all of this information at his disposal before he made a deal releasing Bergdahl.
With this exchange and the elevation of Bergdahl’s rank, the president compromised national security knowingly and willfully.
This, of course, wasn’t the first time President Obama allowed politics to determine a course of ethical behavior, but it may be among the most egregious examples.
One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or Obama.","The admission is in; the sentence awaits us. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl admitted deserting his Afghan post and endangering fellow troops. By all accounts this is the most serious betrayal of presidential authority in my life time.

In 2014 President Obama attempted to cover Bergdahl with the achievement of a war hero, even inviting his Idaho based parents to the Rose Garden to celebrate news of his release. President Obama pointed out at the time that five Taliban leaders were freed from Guantanamo so that Bergdahl could be released from captivity. To gild the lily, National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, said Bergdahl served “the United States with honor and distinction.”

Yet everyone in the White House and the Pentagon knew this was a lie with monumental implications. In fact, Army officials refused to list Bergdahl as a POW. An internal 2009 Army report found that he walked off his post on more than one occasion and even said he wanted to join the ranks of the enemy. This report also noted he shipped his laptop back to Idaho with a note expressing his disillusionment with the American position in the war.

President Obama had all of this information at his disposal before he made a deal releasing Bergdahl. Why then did he mislead the American people? The answer can be found in the president’s desire to satisfy antiwar liberals keen on emptying Gitmo. At the Rose Garden event the president admitted as much when he said, “We’re committed to winding down the war in Afghanistan and closing Gitmo.” It is instructive that the CIA has evidence at least three of the released Taliban leaders have returned to the battlefield.

One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or Obama.

With this exchange and the elevation of Bergdahl’s rank, the president compromised national security knowingly and willfully. Although Bergdahl will not receive capital punishment when his sentence is determined, he probably should be tried as a traitor whose actions led directly to three soldiers seriously injured during search and rescue missions to find him. But if this fiasco is linked to American injuries and, perhaps deaths, one might well ask if the commander in chief should be held accountable as well.

The president’s dissimulation clearly violated the military code and has had a profound effect on morale. Those I know in the military invariably ask how a president could honor a deserter when he was fully aware of his prior actions. This, of course, wasn’t the first time President Obama allowed politics to determine a course of ethical behavior, but it may be among the most egregious examples. One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or Obama. With a political ecology in which standards have been debased, many have attempted to rationalize President Obama’s decision. In my judgment, however, his actions that jeopardized national security should be fully investigated and, where blame exists, the full weight of public opinion should be employed to condemn the president and his assistants.",Bowe Bergdahl deal compromised US national security and President Obama should be held accountable,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/22/bowe-bergdahl-deal-compromised-us-national-security-and-president-obama-should-be-held-accountable.html

Any nation that tries this foolish approach will see its enemies grow stronger and more dangerous, and will lose its allies when it abandons them.

Yet for eight years, the Obama administration followed this upside-down policy, and received contempt and bad behavior in return from nations around the world. And now, unfortunately, the Trump administration is following this policy with Iran, by “not taking sides” to prevent the Iraqi government from using military force against our Kurdish allies.

Following a Sept. 25 vote by the Kurds in Kirkuk calling for independence from Iraq, Iraqi troops and Iranian-backed militias moved north into the Kurdish province to take control from the Kurdistan Regional Government. Iraqi troops and Shia militias seized the last district in Kirkuk on Friday from Kurdish fighters, known as the Peshmerga, after a three-hour battle.

The Kurds had controlled Kirkuk since 2014, when Iraqi troops fled the forces of the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS. While remaining part of Iraq, the Kurdish province operated with a high degree autonomy.

The Iraqi Kurdish independence referendum sparked fears that Kurds in neighboring areas of Iran, Turkey and Syria would want to seek independence as well and unite to form a new nation – an idea opposed by all the those countries and Iraq.

The Iraqi Kurds have been loyal U.S. allies in our fight against Al Qaeda and ISIS, and have fought bravely and effectively. American troops have fought and died with our Kurdish allies defending Iraq and we have spent blood and treasure trying to build reliable partners in Iraq’s Security Forces.

But the Iraqi forces are also supported by Iran, including that nation’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. Treasury Department earlier this month.

And Iran is clearly an enemy of the United States, Israel and many of our Arab allies. It is a state sponsor of terrorism and an oppressor of its own people, with particularly harsh restrictions on women, homosexuals and Christians. President Trump has sharply criticized the nation’s conduct and has threatened to withdraw from the agreement designed to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

It’s in America’s interest to have good and peaceful relations with and between the Kurds and the Iraqis, despite Iran’s support of Iraq. But we shouldn’t abandon our Kurdish allies to achieve this goal.

The man most responsible for the failure of the U.S. to give adequate support to the Kurds is Brett McGurk, President Trump’s special envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS. He held the same position in the Obama administration and has been allowed to keep his job.

President Obama replaced one of our most respected military leaders – Marine Corps Gen. John Allen – with lawyer McGurk. While serving as envoy to Iraq, McGurk has presided over the Iranian takeover of what’s left of Iraq.

Shamefully, the State and Defense Departments followed McGurk’s strategy and gave tacit approval for the Iraqi government and its Iranian allies to move against our dedicated Kurdish friends.

McGurk told U.S. officials and Iraq, Turkey and Iran that he could convince the Kurds not to hold their independence referendum. He told U.S. and Kurdish officials that he could stop Baghdad from using military force against the Kurds. He failed on both accounts.

As President Trump has noted, Iran received $1.7 billion from the Obama administration for signing the nuclear agreement with the U.S. and other nations

“Just imagine the sight of those huge piles of money being hauled off by the Iranians waiting at the airport for the cash,” President Trump said. McGurk was one of the U.S. officials who handed over that money to the Iranians.

One of the leaders of Iranian forces backing Iraq against its Kurdish citizens is Qassem Soleimani, who commands the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force. He is a terrorist who has been killing Americans for years in Iraq and is still doing it through the Taliban in Afghanistan. Half a world away from the NFL, Soleimani also disrespects our flag, having his forces walk on it in parades.

Last month, the Kurds believed that being a proven ally of the United States against former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Al Qaeda and ISIS would result in America recognizing their referendum for independence from the Iraqi state.

But the hard-line that McGurk took against our Kurdish allies – warning them harshly against their peaceful independence referendum – had the effect of convincing the Iranian-backed militias and the political leadership in Baghdad that they had a green light to enter Kirkuk. In the words of former Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker, this criticism “may have emboldened Baghdad to take a harsher posture than it otherwise would.”

For the last decade, I’ve briefed Army Generals H.R. McMaster (now President Trump’s national security adviser), David Petreaus (who became CIA director) and Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno on the strong influence of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on Iraq’s security forces.

But for years, McGurk has been downplaying this influence.

On Oct. 1, a highly lethal roadside bomb called an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) reappeared in Iraq after six years. It killed Army Spec. Alexander Missildine and wounded another U.S. soldier. Its reappearance was a warning from Iran: the Islamic Republic is prepared to begin killing Americans again. The EFP is the signature weapon of two Revolutionary Guard-led militias in Iraq.

Scandalously, these militias receive paychecks and equipment from both the U.S.-backed Iraqi Ministry of Interior and the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force. It’s Brett McGurk’s responsibility to provide that information to the president and Congress, because it’s a violation of the Leahy Law. That law was enacted to keep U.S. funds and equipment from security forces involved in human rights violations. Qassem Soleimani is smiling.

If President Trump wants to push back against Iran he should do so in the Kurdish areas of Iraq. This is where he can stop Iran from creating its highly coveted land bridge through Iraq and from eventually controlling northern Iraq as well. Stopping Iran here would save lives, save alliances and give credibility to America’s commitment to our allies. We can do that by working with our only authentic allies in the region, the Kurds.

But some retailers are using the viral campaign to sell products, and not everyone agrees with this decision.

One product in particular has sparked a wave of backlash, with many accusing the designer of profiting off others’ pain. Jewelry company Adornia announced its latest product, a lariat necklace spelling out “Me Too,” which retails for $44.

Initially, the brand promised to donate 10 percent of all proceeds to the Rape Abuse Incest National Network. However, it later amended that amount to 100 percent, though it’s unclear whether this was spurred on by harsh criticism of the product or was simply a typo.

Allure reports that Adornia’s PR company followed up their initial email, correcting the error. “Apologies for the typo — 100% of the proceeds from this necklace is being donated to RAINN. Designer Moran Amir was inspired by her own experience as a survivor of adolescent sexual abuse to help women speak out loud.” However, according to Refinery29, Adornia designer Moran Amir made the change in an effort to assuage people’s criticism of her motives. “To eschew any controversy that I was profiting off of other people's pain, I raised the donation to RAINN to 100%,” she said.

But despite the altruistic element, reactions to the necklace were fierce, with people on Twitter calling the product “opportunistic” and “gross.”

“Today in the complete and utter reprehensible cooptation of feminist causes, a brand is selling a ""ME TOO"" necklace,” one Twitter user wrote.

“It seems really opportunistic and tone-deaf to be commodifying an organic movement for awareness of sexual assault with #MeToo jewelry,” another user wrote. ""I really like the idea of wearing our beliefs on our sleeve proverbial or not.""

FITNESS COMPANY SLAMMED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE' POSTER BLASTS CRITICS AS 'WHINY FEMINAZIS'

Others argue that there’s nothing wrong with the necklace, and is simply a symbol of female empowerment.

“I think it's cool. Feminists have always used fashion to get the message across, from Suffragette sashes to throwing away bras. Dope,” another user tweeted.

In spite of the harsh feedback to the product, Amir is standing by the necklace, and the company has responded to critics multiple times on Twitter.

“We mean no offense so decided to increase the donation to 100% for this necklace in order to state our mission more clearly,” Adornia wrote.

“I appreciate your feedback. Our intention was to unite women through this expression, not profit off their pain,” the company wrote.

Amir explained to Refinery29 why she created the necklace in the first place, noting how shocked she was by the controversy.

Thursday, New York Times columnist Charles Blow took liberal outrage to new decibel levels. His argument? President Trump is comparable to Adolf Hitler.

No, I’m not kidding. In Blow’s words: “Maybe I have crossed the ink-stained line of the essay writer, where Hitler is always beyond it. But I don’t think so. Ignoring what one of history’s greatest examples of lying has to teach us about current examples of lying, particularly lying by the ‘president’ of the most powerful country in the world, seems to me an act of timidity in a time of terror.”

Where to even begin? First and foremost, Donald Trump is indeed our president. There’s no need for quotations. He won nearly 63 million votes in November, in case liberals need another reminder. En route to victory, President Trump won union strongholds like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Not since the days of Ronald Reagan have we seen such crossover appeal. And, yes, he was democratically elected—even if liberal blowhards like Blow question it.

Second, why exactly is this “a time of terror?” If anything, the president is making it a priority to confront radical Islamist groups who have committed actual acts of terrorism. For the first time ever, the U.S. military is launching strikes on ISIS training camps in Yemen. Dozens of Islamic State militants were recently killed by U.S. airstrikes. Moreover, ISIS has officially lost control of Raqqa, the group’s self-declared capital in Syria, to U.S.-backed forces.","Sorry, New York Times, Trump Isn't Hitler.

After helping women and children into lifeboats Daniels swam away from the sinking ship before reaching an upturned lifeboat. He was eventually taken on board the rescue ship Carpathia, according to Encyclopedia Titanica.

Daniels died in 1983 at the age of 89.

The Bowling Green factory where the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 has been shut down the past few months for the installation of a new paint shop and other upgrades, so the model year was already truncated.

Chevy is still scheduled to build around 9,700 of the coupes and convertibles by January, according to the newspaper, so 2018 cars won’t exactly be rare, but they may end up being among the last of their kind.

“I was with my son Kamren and this cow ran out of Prospect Park and ran over a baby girl,” said Alexis Small, who was in the park when the unusual incident happened. “The mom was just crying and trying to calm her down. She was in such pain, I couldn’t even imagine.”

Police officers scrambled to capture the bull as it continued to run into a car before dashing into the Parade Grounds.

The event even sparked a social media debate on whether the animal was a cow or a bull.

“Hey, has anyone seen a cow?” NYC Parks tweeted.

“Anatomy is incorrect for a cow, that, my friends is a bull. Udders=cow, penis=bull. Collectively=cattle,” one user replied.

Another person tweeted: “This cow is really milking his time in the spotlight..”

Officers tranquilized and wrangled the bull around 1:30 p.m. after it appeared to trap itself between two fences. Officials loaded it into an NYPD truck.

The bull is headed to Skylands Animal Sanctuary and Rescue in Wantage, N.J., where workers have already named the animal ""Shankar,"" according to WABC-TV.

This isn’t the first bull run for New Yorkers.

A bull roamed the streets of Queens in February for about two hours before he was captured. The bull died shortly after.

Reality TV star Ksenia Sobchak said she hopes to appeal to the growing number of liberal voters unhappy with Putin’s many years in office.

Opinion polls show Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for nearly two decades, will win reelection comfortably if he decides to seek what would be his fourth term in March.

However, a significant minority of voters accuse him of overseeing a corrupt system that has isolated Russia from the rest of the world.

Many of them have taken part in mass protests organized by Putin critic Alexei Navalny.

Russian officials say Navalny is ineligible to run for president due to a criminal conviction which has left an opening for a genuine opponent.

Sobchak is seen by many as an alternative option to those that have had enough of Putin.

The reality TV star, who has been described by Vogue magazine as the Russian version of socialite Paris and is the daughter of Putin’s former mentor, said she had decided to run because she was tired of the same politicians, including Putin, running year after year.

The 35-year-old said she had the right to run for Russia’s top political job under the country’s constitution, which stipulates that all candidates must be 35 or older.

“I decided to exercise that right because I am against all of those (candidates) who usually exercise that right,” she said.

“When I was 18 and was studying in university, Vladimir Putin became president of Russia. Children who were born that year will go and vote themselves this year. Just think about that.”

But some Russian liberals fear Sobchak’s participation will play into the Kremlin’s hands by splitting the opposition vote.

Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, the reformist former mayor of St. Petersburg who hired Putin as an official in City Hall in the 1990s.

Sobchak, who died in 2000, became a mentor to Putin. Sobchak’s mother, Lyudmila Narusova, sits in the upper house of the Russian parliament.

Sobchak’s Instagram account, often featuring photographs of her dressed in designer outfits and appearing at glitzy society events, has 5.2 million followers.

After graduating from the prestigious MGIMO University in Moscow, she became a nationwide celebrity when she hosted a Russian reality TV show called Dom 2.

She became active in opposition politics around the time that Putin, in 2012, was reelected to the presidency after stepping down for four years to comply with constitutional term limits.

She appeared at opposition rallies, spoke out against the Kremlin on social media, and recast herself as a news anchor for the Rain broadcaster.",Russia’s version of Paris Hilton runs for president against Putin,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/18/russia-s-version-paris-hilton-runs-for-president-against-putin.html

FIREBALL WHISKEY BAGELS ARE THINGS THAT EXIST

The white truffle cream cheese, however, might actually be the star of the show. According to the hotel, white truffle is the second most expensive food in the world after caviar, largely because the truffles are grown in a specific region of Italy, and only trained dogs and pigs can locate them, WNBC reports.

Oddly enough, this is actually the second time the hotel has made this $1,000 bagel available. According to a spokesperson for the Westin, the first appearance of this bagel, in 2007, was so popular that ""requests for this over-the-top bagel have come in yearly without fail.”

This year’s bagel, too, is more than an expensive treat — 100 percent of the proceeds generated from the sale of the breakfast item will go New York City’s Holy Apostle Soup Kitchen, the AP reports.

Relatives of 20-year-old Rachel Nguyen said investigators had based their belief on the circumstances and positioning of the bodies.
The bodies of Nguyen and Joseph Orbeso, 22, were found in a steep canyon Sunday.
""We hold no grudges against Joseph or the Orbeso family,"" Nguyen's family said in a statement.

Relatives of 20-year-old Rachel Nguyen said investigators had based their belief on the circumstances and positioning of the bodies.

The bodies of Nguyen and Joseph Orbeso, 22, were found in a steep canyon Sunday. They had been missing for nearly three months after going for a hike in late July and failing to return to their bed-and-breakfast.

Autopsies found both had gunshot wounds and evidence at the scene led detectives to believe Orbeso shot Nguyen and then himself, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said in a statement Friday. The stunning announcement came days after Orbeso's father, who was with searchers who made the discovery, said the bodies were locked in an embrace.

""We hold no grudges against Joseph or the Orbeso family,"" Nguyen's family said in a statement. ""We thank God that we'll be able to give Rachel a proper burial and lay her to rest.""

The Orange County Register reports there was evidence the pair had been battling the elements. The bodies were found under a tree, with clothing covering their legs to protect them from the blazing sun. They appeared to have been rationing food and had no water.

Orbeso and Nguyen had once dated and he took her to Joshua Tree to celebrate her birthday, his best friend Austin Young told the newspaper.

A gun found near the bodies was registered to Orbeso. Young said Orbeso worked as a security guard, and may have carried the gun to protect Nguyen.

""I think they got lost and were suffering in 100-degree heat,"" Young said.

""They had a choice of a slow and painful death or a quick death,"" he said. ""And they made the choice of a quick death.""

Authorities continued to investigate Orbeso's actions, though his motive may never be known.

""Since we don't have any evidence (note, message) to tell us why the shooting occurred, we are left to speculate,"" sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said. ""Knowing that they rationed food, had no water and were seeking shade certainly sheds a different light on the apparent dire circumstances.""

The Joshua Tree Search and Rescue team said on its Facebook page that it's easy to get lost in the vast park covering more than 1,200 square miles of the Mojave and Colorado deserts, 130 miles east of Los Angeles.

""You can take a short hike and lose sight of the road, and, if you didn't pay attention to what the landmarks look like, in the opposite direction, you could start wandering,"" the team said.

The spotlight should be on the fallen soldiers who gave their lives for this country.

Instead, we’ve all been plunged into another anguished round of finger-pointing, blame-shifting and all-around nastiness that is nothing short of sad. Everyone is caught in the media crossfire and the deaths of brave Americans have become politicized.

Now there’s no denying that President Trump opened the door at his Monday news conference when he was asked why he hasn’t spoken publicly about the four soldiers killed in Niger. He turned that into a suggestion that Barack Obama and other presidents rarely or never called the families of the fallen, triggering vehement denials from former Obama aides.

The president may not have intended to pick this fight, but the next day he questioned whether Obama had called John Kelly, now his chief of staff, after he lost a son in Afghanistan in 2010. (Obama had not, but invited Kelly, who became a Marine general, to a breakfast for Gold Star families.)

The United States had said the appointment of Mugabe by WHO's first African leader ""clearly contradicts the United Nations ideals of respect for human rights and human dignity.""

Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, has been criticized at home for his frequent overseas travels for medical treatment that have cost impoverished Zimbabwe millions of dollars.","The head of the World Health Organization revoked his appointment of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe as a ""goodwill ambassador"" on Sunday after the choice drew widespread outrage and criticism. Zimbabwe's government said it respected the turnabout and that the U.N. health agency ""benefited tremendously"" from the attention.

WHO director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus last week told a conference in Uruguay on non-communicable diseases that Mugabe, who was present, had agreed to be a ""goodwill ambassador"" on the issue.

After the outcry by international leaders and health experts, Tedros said in a statement that he had reflected and decided to change his mind, calling it in the best interests of the U.N. health agency. Tedros said he had consulted with the Zimbabwe government about his decision.

The 93-year-old Mugabe, the world's oldest head of state, has long been criticized at home for going overseas for medical treatment as Zimbabwe's once-prosperous economy falls apart and the country's health care system deteriorates. Mugabe also faces U.S. sanctions over his government's human rights abuses.

The United States had said the appointment of Mugabe by WHO's first African leader ""clearly contradicts the United Nations ideals of respect for human rights and human dignity.""

Two dozen organizations — including the World Heart Federation and Cancer Research U.K. — released a statement slamming the appointment, saying health officials were ""shocked and deeply concerned."" The groups said they had raised their concerns with Tedros on the sidelines of the Uruguay conference, to no avail.

Zimbabwe's government said it respected Tedros' decision to withdraw Mugabe's appointment.

Foreign Affairs Minister Walter Mzembi told state broadcaster ZBC that the U.N. health agency ""benefited tremendously"" from the original decision to name Mugabe to the post because of the global attention that resulted.

""On a name-recognition scale this name beats them all, but it is our business to protect its brand equity from unnecessary besmirching,"" Mzembi said. ""So on the balance, it is wiser to let go.""

The heads of U.N. agencies and the U.N. secretary-general typically choose celebrities and other prominent people as ambassadors to draw attention to global issues of concern, such as refugees (Angelina Jolie) and education (Malala Yousafzai). The choices are not subject to approval.

The ambassadors hold little actual power. They also can be fired. The comic book heroine Wonder Woman was removed from her honorary U.N. ambassador job in December following protests that a white, skimpily dressed American prone to violence wasn't the best role model for girls.

Zimbabwe once was known as the region's prosperous breadbasket. But in 2008, the charity Physicians for Human Rights released a report documenting failures in the southern African nation's health system, saying Mugabe's policies had led to a man-made crisis.

""The government of Robert Mugabe presided over the dramatic reversal of its population's access to food, clean water, basic sanitation and health care,"" the group concluded. Mugabe's policies led directly to ""the shuttering of hospitals and clinics, the closing of its medical school and the beatings of health workers.""

Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, has been criticized at home for his frequent overseas travels for medical treatment that have cost impoverished Zimbabwe millions of dollars. His repeated visits to Singapore have heightened concerns over his health, even as he pursues re-election next year.

The U.S. in 2003 imposed targeted sanctions, a travel ban and an asset freeze against Mugabe and close associates, citing his government's rights abuses and evidence of electoral fraud.",World Health Organization revokes appointment of Mugabe,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/22/world-health-organization-revokes-appointment-mugabe.html

The fossilized remains of what are believed to be great ape teeth, an upper right first molar and an upper left canine, were found a little over a year ago near the town of Eppelsheim in southwestern Germany in sediments that date back 10 million years.

“It’s perfectly preserved. It actually looks like a new excellent tooth; however, it’s no longer white. It’s shining like amber,” Herbert Lutz, head of the excavation team and deputy museum director at the Mainz Natural History Museum, told USA Today.

Lutz said that the discovery is groundbreaking for its potential to alter our understanding of how humans developed and migrated in prehistoric times.

“I don’t want to over-dramatize it, but I would hypothesize that we shall have to start rewriting the history of mankind after today,” Mainz Mayor Michael Ebling told reporters during a press conference this week announcing the discovery, reports the Times of Israel.

According to researchers, our current understanding is that hominins, our extinct human ancestors, left Africa about 120,000 years ago. The discovered remains are significantly older.

“We have comparable finds only in East Africa…but they are only 2, 3, 4 or 5 million years old, and Eppelsheim is almost 10,” said Matz. “So the question is: What has happened? We don’t know where this great ape came from. We do not have comparable finds from southern Europe.”

Although the scientist made the discovery in September 2016, they were so confused by what they’d found they waited until this month to release a report about it.

As of now, it is not known where the teeth fit in humankind’s family tree. However, Lutz and his team of researchers are only just beginning to fully examine their unique find.

Take a page from your 5-year-old self and have a moment of fun where the sun is shining, and don’t let the fact that some will label your activity “exercise” ruin it.","So Americans are fat. At least that’s the running monologue playing out in more media outlets than we can completely ignore. But somewhere along the journey from childhood to retirement the solution to that problem has become the New Year’s Resolution that almost everyone makes and almost everyone hates: exercise more.

As children, playing outside was the reward, not the punishment … so much so that a ridiculous trend in too many elementary schools today is for children to be deprived of outside play time in a stationary timeout at recess as punishment (because we all know that the one-thing that helps discipline a hyperactive child to be calm is enforced stillness. Or not.)

Yet, trudging through the institutional world of education, exercise became the thing that the quintessential, sadistic gym teacher enforced, complete with tests, metrics and goals for the unattainable. The joy of movement dimmed as the realization that perfection was just not on the menu for most of us. And there was math to prove it. Charts, indexes, measurements, graphs – all calculated to show the weary where they fall short.

Exercise stopped being many people’s entertainment, when it stopped being fun.

I can’t be the only person who finds modern-day conversations about exercise about as compelling as a marketing report, full of deliverables and metrics. Or like a performance evaluation by a cranky boss who won’t notice the 10 things you did right, but only the one thing you did wrong.

I already live in a world of deadlines and demands. Whether at home or at work, I must comply with so many requirements that I cannot bear to take up an activity that has a to- do list.

In fact, a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that even when people were paid to go to the gym, most were not motivated to do it. Money could not camouflage the reality that many have lost that loving feeling for organized pain. And when the sales pitch is “no pain, no gain,” how surprising is it that many people just say no?

As my own children reach adulthood, I listen to their conversations about how they “should” exercise, if only they had the time. “Should” stands doomed in the English language, a verbal storeroom for closets we don’t want to clean or vegetables we don’t want to eat. As soon as you “should” do something, you don’t want to do it.

In today’s competitive school environments, the emphasis can be so much on winning that coaches don’t want to spend time with kids in general, but rather a specific few, so they cull every team to the top players.

Forgotten is the beautiful model of days past (called my childhood) in which every kid could come out to practice and to participate with the team, while only a deserving and talented few suited up on game day. The team was bigger than the perfect, and the fun of training together was its own reward. If you need a reminder of that, watch the movie “Rudy” with a box of tissues.

I am a proud member of the Track B team … and will probably live longer for it. The A Team intensified their performances and ran until they were sick in the grass, striving for excellence. Admirable to be sure.

On the B team, we jogged on the track, rarely so intensely that we couldn’t keep the conversation running, and got out of school on the day of the meets to run a few races and cheer on the winners. Staying in shape in the context of community was the draw.

Recently, I’ve rediscovered “running,” which for me means faster than walking at a pace most likely to be the worst in any timed race. I don’t want to train for anything, achieve anything or set a record. What I like best about running is that I’m not working.

I wonder if more people would overlook the fact that they are “exercising” if they could remember that it used to be fun outside. It feels a bit un-American to tell people don’t go for the gold, but I suspect that more people would try getting active if it sounded less like work and lot more like a reward.

The letter is one of the last known correspondences to have survived the sinking of the doomed ocean liner, Reuters reported. It was written on Titanic stationery by First Class passenger Alexander Oskar Holverson to his mother on April 13, 1912, when the ship embarked from Southampton, England.

“If all goes well we will arrive in New York Wednesday A.M,” Holverson wrote on the eve of the famous disaster.

The Titanic hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship’s time on April 14, 1912, and sank just over two hours later. More than 1,500 passengers and crew members perished.

Holverson, a Minnesota native, was a salesman traveling with his wife, Mary Alice, who survived the sinking. The letter was apparently found in a pocket book when Holverson’s body was recovered from the Atlantic. It was eventually returned to his family with his other effects.

In his letter, Holverson describes being on the ship with John Jacob Astor, an American financier and real estate investor and one of the ship’s most famous passengers.

""He looks like any other human being even though he has millions of money. They sit out on deck with the rest of us,” he wrote.

Henry Aldridge & Son auctioneer Andrew Aldridge told Fox News in an email Tuesday that he believes it is the most important letter written aboard the Titanic ever to come to market.

“It is exceptional on every level -- including content, historical context and rarity,” he explained, via email. “This letter represents one of the last known letters to have survived the sinking and the last known letter written on board by a victim.”

The auctioned letter was part of a lot that also included an original photograph of Holverson and his wife leaving for South America prior to their journey on the Titanic, and some unrelated handwritten letters from Holverson’s mother to his brother, Walter.

A number of artifacts from the doomed ship were auctioned in Britain last year, with the sextant used by the captain of rescue ship Carpathia selling for just under $97,000. Three photos and a handwritten note detailing the grisly discovery of the Titanic’s last lifeboat sold for $6,800.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) joined the Brian Kilmeade Show today to discuss the Iran deal. Listen to the full interview below:

Sen. Cotton on why he chooses not to spar with President Trump like many other Republicans:

The American people elected Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief and if we want to keep our country safe and secure, then it's important that the commander-in-chief succeed, and I think Donald Trump by and large is getting things right. He's certainly much more consistent with decades of bipartisan foreign policy leadership than Barack Obama was for the last eight years. So when the president does things like tells Congress and tells our allies that the Iran deal is not in the United States national security interests, or launches airstrikes against the Assad regime when they cross the U.S. red line, I'm going to support him.

Sen. Cotton on why he was glad the President did not certify the Iran deal:

Iran now is by all accounts about a year away from getting a nuclear weapon. This deal though starts to expire in a mere eight years, sometimes thirteen years with some of the provisions. I don't think we can wait eight to thirteen years. Iran is going to get stronger, it's economy is going to grow, it's going to get more conventional weapons like tanks and artillery and helicopters, and ultimately it will have a nuclear weapon. That's what we saw with the North Korea nuclear deal in 1994. They detonated their first bomb in 2006. So I don't think that we have the luxury of waiting eight to thirteen years to confront a nuclear Iran. I think we need to confront them now.

Thursday, New York Times columnist Charles Blow took liberal outrage to new decibel levels. His argument? President Trump is comparable to Adolf Hitler.

No, I’m not kidding. In Blow’s words: “Maybe I have crossed the ink-stained line of the essay writer, where Hitler is always beyond it. But I don’t think so. Ignoring what one of history’s greatest examples of lying has to teach us about current examples of lying, particularly lying by the ‘president’ of the most powerful country in the world, seems to me an act of timidity in a time of terror.”

Where to even begin? First and foremost, Donald Trump is indeed our president. There’s no need for quotations. He won nearly 63 million votes in November, in case liberals need another reminder. En route to victory, President Trump won union strongholds like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Not since the days of Ronald Reagan have we seen such crossover appeal. And, yes, he was democratically elected—even if liberal blowhards like Blow question it.

Second, why exactly is this “a time of terror?” If anything, the president is making it a priority to confront radical Islamist groups who have committed actual acts of terrorism. For the first time ever, the U.S. military is launching strikes on ISIS training camps in Yemen. Dozens of Islamic State militants were recently killed by U.S. airstrikes. Moreover, ISIS has officially lost control of Raqqa, the group’s self-declared capital in Syria, to U.S.-backed forces.","Sorry, New York Times, Trump Isn't Hitler.

As officers are now deployed around the neighborhood, Crime Stoppers of Tampa Bay and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives are offering a combined reward of up to $25,000 for information that leads to an arrest.

""Things are moving, just not as quickly as we want,"" Dugan said, referring to the investigation.

On Friday, police released surveillance video from Oct. 9 of a man seen walking in the area when the first victim, Benjamin Mitchell, 22, was shot to death. The second killing took place on Oct. 13, when Monica Caridad Hoffa, 32, was found dead in a vacant lot of a gunshot wound.

On Thursday, officers were patrolling the area when they heard gunshots and found Anthony Taino Naiboa dead on the sidewalk, about 100 yards from where one of the other victims was killed.

Naiboa, 20, was the oldest of five children and ended up in the area by mistake, according to Dugan.

It is a dangerous fiction that prejudiced white officers are going out and disproportionately killing black men.","The NFL players kneeling during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” in football stadiums across the country are engaging in protests based on false claims and misleading media reports that give the impression that police are killing African-Americans at a rate greater than they are killing whites.

In addition, my own research shows that contrary to some claims, blacks have good relations with police they deal with in their neighborhoods.

After Colin Kaepernick, then a quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers, started kneeling during the playing of the national anthem 13 months ago, he said: “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color…. There are bodies in the street and people (police) are getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”

However, a study last year by Harvard Economics Professor Roland Fryer, who is black, concluded that for the Houston police department: “On the most extreme use of force – officer-involved shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account.” Unfortunately, he doesn’t have the race of the officer doing the shooting and the data for just one police department doesn’t allow the investigation of police policies.

Using four national databases of crime statistics representing confrontations between police and civilians in many parts of the U.S., the study did find that blacks were more likely than whites to be treated with some lower level of force by police during confrontations – such as being handcuffed, pushed to the ground or pepper-sprayed. That is a legitimate issue that merits further study. But it’s not the same as saying racist white cops are – to use Kaepernick’s inflammatory phrase – “getting away with murder” of African-Americans.

A July poll in New York City found that blacks strongly support the cops in their own neighborhoods – 62 percent approve compared to just 35 percent who disapprove. That rating is 11 percent higher than blacks give the New York City Police Department as a whole.

Last Sunday, Hillary Clinton joined the debate, saying the player protests that have spread across the league “demonstrate in a peaceful way against racism and injustice in our criminal system.” She added that President Trump’s tweets denouncing players who kneeled during the anthem were “very clear dog-whistles” to his base, implying an appeal to anti-black racism.

The media have helped create a biased perception that is far from reality on police shootings. In a new study, the Crime Prevention Research Center (where I serve as president) finds that when a white officer kills a suspect, the media usually mention the race of the officer. This is rarely true when the officer is black.

As a result, many people incorrectly believe the police are racist. But when it comes to the cops who African-Americans deal with personally, they often have a different view.

For example, a July Quinnipiac University poll in New York City found that blacks strongly support the cops in their own neighborhoods – 62 percent approve compared to just 35 percent who disapprove. That rating is 11 percent higher than blacks give the New York City Police Department as a whole, where perceptions are far more likely to be influenced by media reports.

Data also show that blacks don’t hesitate to reach out to police and report crime. Indeed, from 2008 to 2012, blacks were actually more likely than whites, Hispanics or Asians to report violent crimes committed against them to the police.

How do we know this?

The Department of Justice conducts an annual survey that asks people if they have been the victim of a crime. That’s how we know how much crime there is in each neighborhood. Then, the Crime Prevention Research Center study compares that crime rate with how often people actually reported crimes to the police.

What we find is that blacks were 9 percentage points more likely than whites (54 percent to 45 percent) to report a crime to the police. Blacks are 16 percent more likely than Hispanics and 12 percent more likely than Asians to report a crime.

It's not just that blacks report more crime because they experience more of it. This higher rate of reporting even holds true in areas where other groups face higher violent crime rates than blacks do.

More importantly, this trust in local community police appears to be well-placed. This is because despite what Kaepernick and others falsely claim, white police officers aren’t killing defenseless blacks just because they can. Blacks also are a smaller percentage of people killed by police than the black share of murderers and other violent criminals.

Through extensive research, we found 2,699 police shootings across the nation from 2013-2015. That’s far more than the FBI found – its data is limited to only 1,366 cases voluntarily provided by police departments.

The FBI data has other problems, too: It disproportionately includes cases from heavily minority areas, giving a misleading picture of the frequency at which blacks are shot.

Our database also keeps track of characteristics of both the involved suspect and the officer in each shooting, local violent crime rates, demographics of the city and police department, and many other factors that help determine what causes police shootings.

Here’s what we found:

Black officers were at least as likely as their white peers to kill black suspects.

When more police are present at the scene of a confrontation with a civilian, suspects face reduced odds of being killed. The difference is about a 14 to 18 percent drop in the chances of being killed for each additional officer. Officers feel more vulnerable if they are alone at the scene, making them more likely to resort to deadly force. By the same token, suspects can be emboldened and resist arrest when fewer officers are present.

Police unionization has a harmful effect. Despite the success of the unionized NYPD, which has a good track record on shootings, our study finds that in general, police unionization has had the largest harmful effect, making suspects at least 65 percent more likely to be killed. This could be due to the fact that unions shield their officers from scrutiny with rules that delay prosecutors questioning officers. This may make officers more willing to shoot when their own safety feels at all jeopardized.

Body cameras don’t make a difference. Many people support having officers wear body cameras. But we surveyed 900 police departments, 162 of which reported their officers used body cameras. We found that police did not change their behavior when they started wearing the cameras.

It is a dangerous fiction that prejudiced white officers are going out and disproportionately killing black men. But that doesn’t mean that measures can’t be taken to reduce police shootings. The most obvious step would be to increase the number of officers, in the hopes that more will be present at the scenes of these incidents.",NFL kneeling protests based on false claims and misleading media reports,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/nfl-kneeling-protests-based-on-false-claims-and-misleading-media-reports.html

Could be real steamy, too. It's supposed to be almost 100 degrees at Dodger Stadium for the opener Tuesday night, maybe the hottest temperature ever at a World Series game.

At least the familiar October chill that makes players and fans shiver shouldn't be an issue outdoors in sun-baked California or under the retractable roof at Minute Maid Park.

Not that young stars Cody Bellinger and Carlos Correa would mind, nor would old pros Carlos Beltran and Chase Utley, nor top starters Dallas Keuchel and Yu Darvish.

Because a chance to win a ring doesn't come very often — these teams that have already played more than 700 games against each other over the years already know that.

The Astros have never won the crown. They're playing for a whole region, with the Houston Strong patches on their uniforms representing an area hit hard by Hurricane Harvey.

""There's a lot of people that are really hurting right now in this city,"" said Verlander, the ALCS MVP. ""And it gives the city something to rally around and gives people something to cheer for that otherwise may not have a lot to be hopeful for.""

""I just want to win a World Series,"" Kershaw said after the Dodgers dethroned the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of the NL Championship Series. ""I know more than anybody how hard it is to get there. So, I'm definitely not taking this one for granted.""

Said mercurial outfielder Yasiel Puig: ""The trophy's coming soon.""

The Astros, the major leagues' highest-scoring team this year, have never even won a World Series game. They only time they made it this far was 2005, when a club that included Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte got swept by the White Sox.

In fact, a World Series prize is the one piece of hardware missing from the trophy case from the Lone Star State. Texas teams have won the Super Bowl and championships in the NBA, NHL, college football and men's and women's basketball, but never in baseball.

Under the leadership of executive Nolan Ryan, the Texas Rangers came within one strike in 2011 before losing to St. Louis. The Ryan Express, who once pitched a no-hitter for Houston against the Dodgers, is currently an Astros exec.

The Astros posted 101 wins this year — not since Baltimore (108) and Cincinnati (102) in 1970 has the World Series matched teams who reached triple-digits.

These teams last met in 2015, when the Astros swept a three-game series at home. But they'd seen a lot of each other in the past.

Overall, the Dodgers are 388-323 vs. the Astros. Houston debuted as the Colt .45s as a National League expansion team in 1962, beat the Dodgers in a one-game playoff for the NL West championship in 1980 and eventually moved to the AL in 2013.

That first year in the AL, the young Astros got pounded and lost 111 times. But with smart drafts and player development, Houston emerged as a power. Hinch's club capped its rise by beating Boston in the AL Division Series, then stopping the Yankees 4-0 Saturday night in Game 7 of the ALCS.

The Dodgers, with a major league-high $226 million payroll, won their fifth straight NL West title this year, then 7-1 in the playoffs against the Diamondbacks and Cubs under manager Dave Roberts.

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

RELATED: Budget-Friendly Bathroom Sets for Guests

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

By Anna Eliopoulos

A New York family discouraged, after getting a letter from their insurer, that their nine-month-old's cancer treatment is denied.

Connor Richardson is the newborn of a retired NYPD officer, Wayne. He tells Fox News Radio, that up until two months ago, he was a smiling normal baby.

But then he was rushed to a Long Island hospital after exhibiting symptoms that Richardson says weren't normal for his son... and that's when they found out about the cancer

""He was in the operating room. They had to relieve the fluid,"" Richardson says."" The tumor in his brain was preventing the fluid from circulating to his spine.""

A cat scan and MRI confirmed that an aggressive and rare form of cancer was affecting Connor.

""They made an attempt to remove the tumor the first time and they got approximately 85% of it, bleeding started by the pituitary gland, and they had to wait approximately a week to go back in, and the doctor believes he got it all.""

However, doctors at Saint Jude's Childrens Hospital in Memphis, who had accepted him for chemo, said that they noticed that the cancerous cells had come back.

Connor continues to remain in their care, and to receive treatment.

Richardson says though that on October 11, he didn't expect to get a letter from his insurance provider that coverage for his son's treatment was denied.

""They're not covering because one of the chemo treatments is clinical,"" he says.

The experimental trial that their son was undergoing, with a mix of medications was considered by the letter ""investigational"" with no evidence of being effective.

""It's like a form letter, and the bold faced part is the part they fill on their own, and it wasn't medically necessary.""

Saint Jude's provides free care to patients. So while no one is really footing the bill for treatment, Richardson says it's the principal that bothers him.

""I believe Saint Jude's should get paid for this. It's going to come out to millions of dollars I'm sure.""

And Richardson adds that money is crucial to finding out how to treat and prevent cancer and other life-threatening diseases in children.

""It's taking literally millions of dollars away from their research development.""

Richardson says he plans on contesting the denial.

""You have insurance but you don't really. It's really for disasters and this is a disaster and they're not willing to cover it.""

According to Richardson, Connor is responding well to treatment.",Insurer Allegedly Sends Coverage Denial Letter to 9-month-old with Brain Cancer,https://radio.foxnews.com/2017/10/20/insurer-allegedly-sends-coverage-denial-letter-to-9-month-old-with-brain-cancer/

Over the past nine months, Donald Trump’s cage match with the Washington press corps has turned into an unedifying national spectacle. Too often, the serious business of the nation has been pushed aside so that the press and Mr. Trump could go tit for tat, like children on a schoolyard. On Thursday, an adult finally stepped into the room.

John Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff and a retired four-star general, addressed White House reporters on this week’s dispute between the press and the President. That is the controversy around Mr. Trump’s call to the mother of a U.S. soldier who was killed during an ambush in Niger recently.

As anyone who follows media reports knows, the President’s call to this mother grew into a personal feud between Mr. Trump and a Democratic Congresswoman who disclosed what the President said. It then produced long newspaper reports examining the President’s relationship with every identifiable Gold Star family during his term.

It took awhile for Mr. Kelly to get around to talking about that phone call. Instead, he spent some time offering what we in journalism—or anyone purporting to be engaged in a serious line of work—would call context. Mr. Kelly described what happens when a U.S. soldier or Marine—“the best 1% this country produces”—gets killed in action. What he described was a military process that is graphic, emotionally intense and, most of all, untouchable.

Untouchable, as Mr. Kelly made clear, in the sense that what has happened is so grave, so personal and so difficult that the reality of pushing through it comes down to an encounter between the fallen soldier’s family, the officer who informs them and, in time, support from those who served alongside their son or daughter.

FOX's Lilian Woo reports:

Thomas Jefferson hand selected some of the most important books of his time for the library at the University of Virginia, which he created, and now hundreds of them are available to the public online, which is in keeping with what our third President believed: At a time when books were very expensive he thought it was the duty of the university to make great works available.

Many of his initial list, 7,000 books on topics ranging from Agriculture to Zoology didn't make it, lost in a fire in the 1800's, but thanks to a 40-year search by a librarian at the school, more than 330 legal works have been collected so that people today can read for themselves.

The final resting places of the 1,146 black souls who once lived and worked there were anonymous. Though loved ones may have initially marked the spots with a homemade wooden cross or only a rock, the fragile tributes were lost to time.

For generations, segregation kept black and white Gainesville separate and unequal in life and death. On Sunday, those buried in obscurity will be revered by the town in a ceremony to unveil a monument to their lives and finally welcome them as fellow residents.

Though their names, birthdates and dates of death remain unknown, six benches, along with a seven-foot, black granite obelisk will stand in place of headstones for those interred in sections 16 and 17 of the cemetery.

The obelisk proclaims in gold letters: ""This memorial stands as our testament that these citizens are important to this community and we embrace them as our own.""

""These are home folks,"" said Barbara Brooks, Gainesville's only African-American city council member, who helped lead the effort to establish the memorial. ""They're ours, and we intend to take care of them.""

Alta Vista Cemetery dates back to 1872, and hold the remains of veterans from the Revolutionary and Civil wars — including Confederate Lt. General James Longstreet, a trusted adviser to Gen. Robert E. Lee. The cemetery was segregated until the mid-1960s, and the unmarked graves are believed to date from between the 1870s to the 1950s.

The project was born in 2015 — in the wake of the racially motivated shootings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina — and is the latest effort to memorialize the buried. After being an open secret in town for decades, the full extent of the unmarked graves was discovered a few years ago after the city used ground-penetrating radar to locate them.

Rumor had the number estimated at around 200. More than five times that amount was discovered.

""They just kept finding them over and over,"" said Rev. Stuart Higganbotham, pastor of Grace Episcopal Church in Gainesville, who went to the cemetery with Brooks after hearing about the unmarked graves.

""I know people at Grace had to have owned slaves,"" said Higganbotham, who is white. ""I've done a few funerals there. There was a time when people weren't even allowed to be buried together. These were human lives.""

After they were identified, the city placed numbered silver medallions on each of the 1,146 gravesites. But after Charleston, civic and community leaders wanted to do something to foster healing and reconciliation among its citizens. The idea for a memorial at Alta Vista was born.

A committee, consisting mainly of black residents, was formed to come up with a design. They wanted something big and bold that would stand out — but not a monument that would evoke white guilt for the past.

""Nobody living today can be blamed for what happened back then, but it is our duty to acknowledge what happened, and to try to bring attention to a people that really had no way to be recognized,"" Brooks said.

Sunday's ceremony is scheduled for 2 p.m. Organizers next plan to attempt to find descendants of those buried through historical documents and family Bibles. They encourage anyone who believes they may have a family member who was buried in the segregated sections at Alta Vista to contact the cemetery.

For those who already suspect as much, they will now have a place to grieve with dignity, said Higganbotham.

""Their families can come to continue that physical contact with their loved one,"" he said. ""In a powerful way, they become alive to us again.""

“And China's really helping us, and — well, also with respect to North Korea, 93 percent of things going into North Korea come through China.","President Trump detailed his historic tax cut plans, talked about his Twitter habits and praised Gen. John Kelly’s Thursday speech dismissing Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson’s suggestion that he was forced to make public statements to keep his job in an exclusive Fox News interview on Sunday.

In an interview on “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” Trump talked about his plan to bring the “biggest [tax] cuts ever in the history of this country.”

“I think we’re going to get our taxes,” Trump said in the two-part interview. ""I think it’s going to be — well, hopefully before the end of the year, but maybe much sooner than that.”

“So there’s a great spirit for it, people want to see it, and I call it tax cuts. It is tax reform also, but I call it tax cuts. It’ll be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country,” Trump added.

Trump said he believes he has the votes for his historic plan to pass in Congress. He reiterated his agenda to tackle taxes and health care to promote “tremendous growth” and address the debt and deficit in the U.S.

“Well, it’s going to be all growth. Look, it’s going to be growth. I think that growth can be staggering. I also think we have a lot of waste in this country. And we’ll be doing other things. We will be doing welfare reform. I mean that’s coming up,” the president said.

He added, “Okay, and whether people like it or not. You know people don’t like having a house and working three jobs and having somebody nearby where their living better than the person with the three jobs. It’s not fair. And that’s all coming up, believe me that’s going to be out there very soon.”

“I want to get the taxes first. I want to get health care. We’re doing a big infrastructure bill which will be a very positive thing. But we’re going to have tremendous growth,” Trump said.

When asked about the “bickering and feuding” with other Republican politicians, including Senators Bob Corker and John McCain, the president said it sometimes helps because “it gets people to do what they’re supposed to be doing.”

“I think, actually sometimes it helps. Sometimes it gets people to do what they’re supposed to be doing. And you know, that’s the way it is,” Trump told Fox News. “I just want what’s right. And I think, for the most part, they want what’s right too. So we’ll see what happens but I do believe we have the votes for health care at the appropriate time. And I think we’re going to have the votes for taxes and I will say the fact that healthcare is so difficult, I think, makes the taxes easier.”

The president also touched on Kelly’s Thursday appearance in the White House briefing room after Trump was criticized for his condolences to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed with three other U.S. soldiers in Niger on Oct. 4. Florida Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson said Trump told Johnson’s widow that her deceased husband “knew what he signed up for.”

Trump said his chief of staff is “an elegant man.”

“[Kelly] was so offended, because he was in the room when I made the call and so were other people,” Trump said. “And the call was a very nice call. He was so offended that a woman would be — that somebody would be listening to that call.”

Trump dismissed Wilson’s claim that Kelly was forced to make public statements to keep his job.

“He didn't want this job,” Trump said, adding that Wilson's comment was ""sickening"" to him. “He is a man who felt this was important for the country.”

Despite his past criticism on China’s lack of action against North Korea, Trump applauded Chinese President Xi Jinping and his actions against North Korea. He called Xi a “good man” who has been helping the U.S. with the nuclear crisis.

“He's for China and I'm for the U.S., OK? So we start off with that, but we do have a very good — I would say an exceptional relationship,” Trump told Fox News. “And China's really helping us, and — well, also with respect to North Korea, 93 percent of things going into North Korea come through China. China is big stuff.”

Talking about his Twitter habits, Trump said he has a “tremendous platform” between Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. He defended his tweets, saying they are “well crafted” and he is being “treated very unfairly by the media.”

“See I don’t call it Tweets, Tweeting is like a typewriter — when I put it out, you put it immediately on your show,” Trump said.

“I was always good student, I am like a person that does well with that kind of thing. And I doubt I would be here if weren’t for social media, to be honest with you. Because there is a fake media out there, I get treated very unfairly by the media,” the president added.

He said, “So when somebody, says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it. The other way, I would never be get the word out.”

President Trump said in a statement last week that the U.S. and Pakistani governments worked together and ""secured the release of the Boyle-Coleman family from captivity in Pakistan.""

""Today they are free,"" Trump said of the family, calling it ""a positive moment for our country's relationship with Pakistan.""

Boyle told the AP in an email that Coleman was admitted to a Canadian hospital on Monday and remained there through Wednesday. He did not specify why she was taken to the hospital.

""My wife has been through hell, and she has to be my first priority right now,"" Boyle wrote.

What do we know about Caitlan Coleman and her family?

The 32-year-old is a native of York County, Pa., Philly.com reported.

Coleman and her husband were abducted in 2012 while traveling in Afghanistan. Coleman was pregnant at the time, and their children were born in captivity.

Boyle told the AP that their children are now 4, 2 and ""somewhere around 6 months.""

After landing at Toronto's airport, Boyle said that the Taliban-linked Haqqani network killed their infant daughter and raped his wife during the years they were held. In an email exchange with the AP, Boyle did not respond to a question about the fourth child. The Taliban said in a statement on Sunday that it was a miscarriage.

Boyle, a former call center worker, said in an earlier statement that he had gone to Afghanistan with Coleman to help villagers ""who live deep inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where no NGO, no aid worker and no government has ever successfully been able to bring the necessary help.""

He was once briefly married to Zaynab Khadr, the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a senior Al Qaeda financier who had contacts with Usama bin Laden.

Coleman and Boyle were most recently seen in video from December 2016.

“Please don’t become the next Jimmy Carter,” Coleman said to then-President Barack Obama in the clip while reading a statement. “Just give the offenders something so they and you can save face so we can leave the region permanently.”

""My children have seen their mother defiled,"" Coleman said in the clip.

What has the reaction to the family's release been?

""It's a great day. They've been held a long time,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said, according to NBC.

""I applaud the innumerable lines of effort from across the U.S. Government,"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement.

Tillerson said he is ""particularly proud of"" U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan David Hale, along with ""his Mission Islamabad team for their engagement with Pakistan. These efforts reflect the best of what America can accomplish.""

Canada's foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said in a statement that her government is greatly relieved to learn that after five years of being held hostage, the family has been released and is safe.

She said that Canada has been engaged with the governments of the United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan. She thanked those countries for helping with the release.

""Joshua, Caitlan, their children and the Boyle and Coleman families have endured a horrible ordeal over the past five years. We stand ready to support them as they begin their healing journey,"" she said.

According to his Facebook page, Gonzalez is a talk show host and an investigator at Paranormal Central, in addition to being a technician at AT&T. He also founded the Sanger Paranormal Society.

Gonzalez said that the sighting is not that uncommon, with three additional Bigfoot sightings in the past five years, all located in East Fresno County.

“I would have never guessed in a million years that you would have told me there were Bigfoot on Shields or Ashlan Avenue. Right? So, I want to know what’s going on. Is this for real?” Gonzalez added.

He recounted two others stories, including one from a woman who said her two sons saw a Bigfoot in their orchard and one from a man who saw five creatures in the same orchard.

In addition, my own research shows that contrary to some claims, blacks have good relations with police they deal with in their neighborhoods.

After Colin Kaepernick, then a quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers, started kneeling during the playing of the national anthem 13 months ago, he said: “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color…. There are bodies in the street and people (police) are getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”

However, a study last year by Harvard Economics Professor Roland Fryer, who is black, concluded that for the Houston police department: “On the most extreme use of force – officer-involved shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account.” Unfortunately, he doesn’t have the race of the officer doing the shooting and the data for just one police department doesn’t allow the investigation of police policies.

Using four national databases of crime statistics representing confrontations between police and civilians in many parts of the U.S., the study did find that blacks were more likely than whites to be treated with some lower level of force by police during confrontations – such as being handcuffed, pushed to the ground or pepper-sprayed. That is a legitimate issue that merits further study. But it’s not the same as saying racist white cops are – to use Kaepernick’s inflammatory phrase – “getting away with murder” of African-Americans.

A July poll in New York City found that blacks strongly support the cops in their own neighborhoods – 62 percent approve compared to just 35 percent who disapprove. That rating is 11 percent higher than blacks give the New York City Police Department as a whole.

Last Sunday, Hillary Clinton joined the debate, saying the player protests that have spread across the league “demonstrate in a peaceful way against racism and injustice in our criminal system.” She added that President Trump’s tweets denouncing players who kneeled during the anthem were “very clear dog-whistles” to his base, implying an appeal to anti-black racism.

The media have helped create a biased perception that is far from reality on police shootings. In a new study, the Crime Prevention Research Center (where I serve as president) finds that when a white officer kills a suspect, the media usually mention the race of the officer. This is rarely true when the officer is black.

As a result, many people incorrectly believe the police are racist. But when it comes to the cops who African-Americans deal with personally, they often have a different view.

For example, a July Quinnipiac University poll in New York City found that blacks strongly support the cops in their own neighborhoods – 62 percent approve compared to just 35 percent who disapprove. That rating is 11 percent higher than blacks give the New York City Police Department as a whole, where perceptions are far more likely to be influenced by media reports.

Data also show that blacks don’t hesitate to reach out to police and report crime. Indeed, from 2008 to 2012, blacks were actually more likely than whites, Hispanics or Asians to report violent crimes committed against them to the police.

How do we know this?

The Department of Justice conducts an annual survey that asks people if they have been the victim of a crime. That’s how we know how much crime there is in each neighborhood. Then, the Crime Prevention Research Center study compares that crime rate with how often people actually reported crimes to the police.

What we find is that blacks were 9 percentage points more likely than whites (54 percent to 45 percent) to report a crime to the police. Blacks are 16 percent more likely than Hispanics and 12 percent more likely than Asians to report a crime.

It's not just that blacks report more crime because they experience more of it. This higher rate of reporting even holds true in areas where other groups face higher violent crime rates than blacks do.

More importantly, this trust in local community police appears to be well-placed. This is because despite what Kaepernick and others falsely claim, white police officers aren’t killing defenseless blacks just because they can. Blacks also are a smaller percentage of people killed by police than the black share of murderers and other violent criminals.

Through extensive research, we found 2,699 police shootings across the nation from 2013-2015. That’s far more than the FBI found – its data is limited to only 1,366 cases voluntarily provided by police departments.

The FBI data has other problems, too: It disproportionately includes cases from heavily minority areas, giving a misleading picture of the frequency at which blacks are shot.

Our database also keeps track of characteristics of both the involved suspect and the officer in each shooting, local violent crime rates, demographics of the city and police department, and many other factors that help determine what causes police shootings.

Here’s what we found:

Black officers were at least as likely as their white peers to kill black suspects.

When more police are present at the scene of a confrontation with a civilian, suspects face reduced odds of being killed. The difference is about a 14 to 18 percent drop in the chances of being killed for each additional officer. Officers feel more vulnerable if they are alone at the scene, making them more likely to resort to deadly force. By the same token, suspects can be emboldened and resist arrest when fewer officers are present.

Police unionization has a harmful effect. Despite the success of the unionized NYPD, which has a good track record on shootings, our study finds that in general, police unionization has had the largest harmful effect, making suspects at least 65 percent more likely to be killed. This could be due to the fact that unions shield their officers from scrutiny with rules that delay prosecutors questioning officers. This may make officers more willing to shoot when their own safety feels at all jeopardized.

Body cameras don’t make a difference. Many people support having officers wear body cameras. But we surveyed 900 police departments, 162 of which reported their officers used body cameras. We found that police did not change their behavior when they started wearing the cameras.

It is a dangerous fiction that prejudiced white officers are going out and disproportionately killing black men. But that doesn’t mean that measures can’t be taken to reduce police shootings. The most obvious step would be to increase the number of officers, in the hopes that more will be present at the scenes of these incidents.",NFL kneeling protests based on false claims and misleading media reports,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/nfl-kneeling-protests-based-on-false-claims-and-misleading-media-reports.html

On Thursday evening, ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" opened with a somber 25-minute diatribe that attempted to connect the tragic ambush attack that killed four American soldiers in Niger to the latest version of President Trump’s proposed travel ban, which included the nation of Chad. Maddow essentially claimed that the inclusion of Chad, which recently pulled its troops out of Niger, in the revised travel ban resulted in extremist attacks such as the one that left four Americans dead.

""Everybody that I know is appalled by this. I would like to think that Maddow's researchers are more responsible,"" Seay told the HuffPost.

While the MSNBC host called the tragic attack on American troops ""absolutely baffling,"" Seay said it was actually ""almost inevitable,"" because it's such a remote and hostile area.

Maddow continued: ""Now, this doesn’t mean that Chad withdrawing their troops was necessarily the cause of what happened to those U.S. troops who were ambushed. That ambush is being described by the Pentagon as a shock.""

Videos of the incident show the plane appearing to set down for a landing before it tilts sharply to the left and flies around the control tower. The Airbus A330 flight, carrying about 200 passengers, was Air Berlin’s last known transatlantic journey, according to The Local.

A Federal Aviation Office spokesman said Tuesday that it is not unusual for pilots to abort landings when necessary. The company also said in a statement that the maneuver was agreed upon with the airport’s flight control center and that no passengers made a complaint after the aircraft landed safely.

Skinnypigs Fitness placed a banner outside of a school announcing the more than “100 classes” they offer. The ad features two figures, one heavier and another with a much slimmer silhouette, complete with an arrow pointing from the heavier one to the slimmer one. Next to the images is a bold yellow “CAUTION: Skinnypigs will make you look better naked.”

On Twitter, people took issue with both the message and the location.

Heather Peacock tweeted, ""What element of totally inappropriate shall we say about this SkinnypigsUK?? Put up outside a school?! Come on!!""

Sarah Davy wrote, ""That's so shocking in so many ways. Negative body image, inappropriate location & a truly awful company name.""

Still another Twitter user accused Skinnypigs of ""purporting outdated and dangerous gender stereotypes.”

Skinnypigs owner, Jonathan Hair, was not on board with the attacks his business was receiving, and went on the defensive, resulting in a heated back-and-forth on the social media site.

Hair tweeted from the Skinnypigs handle, “You don't even realise that modern feminism is so polluted with self loathing, man hating looms. We have equality now, it's a good thing. While we are giving advice, stop being a feminazi, you are in the wrong side of history. You'll see when you're all growed up.""

Hair even directly attacked one of his critics, saying, ""Thanks for the input, you'd look far less stupid if you looked into what Skinnypigs is and has achieved if you did a little research.""

In another he added: ""Oooo a feminazi eh, I should have known with the glasses.""

He told another critic: ""Just another whiny feminazi who will end up bitter and alone with house full of cats (but thinks she can change the world by complaining).""

His responses fueled his opponents’ fire, and many launched more attacks about the perceived fat-shaming sign, and vowed to no longer give business to Skinnypigs.

The Twitter storm swelled to include Skinnypigs die-hards, who came to their favorite fitness center's aid by sharing their own weight-loss success stories.

One Twitter user said, ""Getting ready for Skinnypigs, a place [where] we support, encourage and empower each other.""

Hair spoke to Mirror Online and defended his responses, saying he had “nothing to be sorry for.”

Taking to Facebook on Oct. 12 to share the story, Chris Lopez of Chino, Calif, wrote that she and her partner, Cee Grant, were running errands one morning when Grant surprised her with a funny stain on his button-down dress shirt. Grant’s spot wasn’t accidental, but rather intentional, to show support for the mother of his two children, who is currently nursing their youngest.

“I didn’t know that I was leaking, and I was like, ‘What are you doing?’ He said, ‘Look at your nipple.’ It was a nice way to stop me from being humiliated,” Lopez told Yahoo Lifestyle. “I fell in love with him because he was always that person to turn an awkward moment into a hilarious moment.”

The gesture gave Lopez much more than a laugh. According to Lopez, Grant was recovering from a substance abuse problem back when she was breastfeeding their first child Dominic, who is now three, and his love and support as she breastfeeds little Camilla, almost 11 months old, makes all the difference.

Occasionally you know that you are watching history being made. October 5, 2017 was such a day for me.

On that day, Vice President Mike Pence stood before the space shuttle Discovery and called to order the first meeting of the renewed National Space Council. Historians of tomorrow will regard the meeting at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center as the beginning of America’s return as the leader in mankind’s race to explore outer space.

The meeting was of course historic in the literal sense. This was the Space Council’s first meeting in nearly 25 years, since the Clinton Administration disbanded it in 1993.

But this month’s meeting was especially significant for another reason. It signaled a serious change in the way the United States approaches and interacts with space. In addition to attendees from government agencies such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and others, the room at was filled with key people from private enterprise who are currently working to break out and lead the world in space activity.",Newt Gingrich: Renewing American Leadership In Space,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/20/newt-gingrich-renewing-american-leadership-space#commenting

""The one constant was always, 'I want to see my girls grow up, and I want to walk them down the aisle,'"" said Cheryl Shelton.

With seven daughters, the family realized it was unlikely the U.S. Army veteran would be able to accomplish that, so they came up with a plan to make his dream a reality.

With last minute help from hospice; David's Bridal; Taylor Elchert Photography in Tiffin, Ohio; a local hair studio, and others, the plan came together in just days.

""We had this idea we put together in three days. We got all the wedding gowns for the girls and hospice helped us out a great deal with some of the planning,"" said Cheryl.

""What girl doesn't want to get in a wedding dress and her hair and makeup done? So I was all in but more so for the reasoning behind it,"" said Candice Talbot.

The plan was kept a secret from Willie who was asked only to give away Emily Flinn, the only one of his daughters who was already married, so she could renew her vows.

""We got maried at a courthouse so there wasn't the formality to it where he could actually give me away,"" said Flinn.

""He had no clue that this was going on and everybody got dressed, so I said, 'she is going to have all the girls be the bridesmaids and everything for her;' little did he know that they were all going to be brides,"" said Cheryl.

""Actually, it was my sister, Candice, that texted me and said, 'hey, you need to pick out a wedding dress and give me your measurements because we are going to pick one out for you; you are going to walk down the aisle on Saturday,"" said Jennifer Talbot.

Three days later, with Willie in his dress uniform in a backyard ceremony, each of his daughters came out of the house, one at a time, all in wedding gowns.

""He looked a little confused , and then it was just great to see everybody,"" said Flinn.

""This was very touching for him and it was a dream that we could fulfill to the best or the closest we could possibly do,"" said Cheryl.

In a father-daughter ceremony performed by Millersburg Christian Church Pastor Wes McElravy, the girls got to see the gleam in their father's eye they would expect to see at their actual wedding.

And Willie was helped out of his wheelchair to stand with his daughters and experience his greatest wish.

""I always assumed that my dad would be there to walk me down the aisle and when the possibility was there that he wasn't going to be able to -- this was everything,"" said Lindsey Shelton.

Less than two weeks after the ceremony, on Monday, October 16, Willie Shelton passed away.

The girls will each now also have something of their own to keep for their actual weddings.

All seven will have a locket in which they will have a photo of their father with them in a wedding dress, and the words, ""a father's love never ends,"" engraved on the back.

""Even though part of the dream was fulfilled last week, when they get married, the rest of it will be because he will still be with them,"" said Cheryl.

Through their loss, the family says it is only fitting that they honor the life and the memory of Willie.

""He was the happiest person, the most giving person, and this was our chance to give him something,"" said Jennifer.​

WHO director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus last week told a conference in Uruguay on non-communicable diseases that Mugabe, who was present, had agreed to be a ""goodwill ambassador"" on the issue.

The 93-year-old Mugabe, the world's oldest head of state, has long been criticized at home for going overseas for medical treatment as Zimbabwe's once-prosperous economy falls apart and the country's health care system deteriorates.

Two dozen organizations — including the World Heart Federation and Cancer Research U.K. — released a statement slamming the appointment, saying health officials were ""shocked and deeply concerned."" The groups said they had raised their concerns with Tedros on the sidelines of the Uruguay conference, to no avail.

Zimbabwe's government said it respected Tedros' decision to withdraw Mugabe's appointment.

Foreign Affairs Minister Walter Mzembi told state broadcaster ZBC that the U.N. health agency ""benefited tremendously"" from the original decision to name Mugabe to the post because of the global attention that resulted.

""On a name-recognition scale this name beats them all, but it is our business to protect its brand equity from unnecessary besmirching,"" Mzembi said. ""So on the balance, it is wiser to let go.""

The heads of U.N. agencies and the U.N. secretary-general typically choose celebrities and other prominent people as ambassadors to draw attention to global issues of concern, such as refugees (Angelina Jolie) and education (Malala Yousafzai). The choices are not subject to approval.

The ambassadors hold little actual power. They also can be fired. The comic book heroine Wonder Woman was removed from her honorary U.N. ambassador job in December following protests that a white, skimpily dressed American prone to violence wasn't the best role model for girls.

Zimbabwe once was known as the region's prosperous breadbasket. But in 2008, the charity Physicians for Human Rights released a report documenting failures in the southern African nation's health system, saying Mugabe's policies had led to a man-made crisis.

""The government of Robert Mugabe presided over the dramatic reversal of its population's access to food, clean water, basic sanitation and health care,"" the group concluded. Mugabe's policies led directly to ""the shuttering of hospitals and clinics, the closing of its medical school and the beatings of health workers.""

Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, has been criticized at home for his frequent overseas travels for medical treatment that have cost impoverished Zimbabwe millions of dollars. His repeated visits to Singapore have heightened concerns over his health, even as he pursues re-election next year.

The U.S. in 2003 imposed targeted sanctions, a travel ban and an asset freeze against Mugabe and close associates, citing his government's rights abuses and evidence of electoral fraud.",World Health Organization revokes appointment of Mugabe,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/22/world-health-organization-revokes-appointment-mugabe.html

Mike Julianelle runs the Instagram account Got Toddlered, where he shares memes and photos featuring “things children have ruined.” But as it turns out, his kids have affected not only his household and his old way of life, but his appearance as well.

FATHER SUPPORTS BREASTFEEDING PARTNER WITH HILARIOUS, SWEET GESTURE

On Oct. 12, Julianelle shared side-by-side photos of himself. One was from 2006, before he had kids, and it shows him looking youthful and rested. In the other one, from 2016, Julianelle appeared unshaven and exhausted.

“Wanna see something REALLY scary? Here’s me, before and after I had kids!” he wrote alongside the images.

The father of two, who has a seven-year-old and almost two-year-old, told HuffPost that after sharing the picture, he got a message from a follower suggesting he ask for submissions from other parents, as well. So Julianelle encouraged everyone to share their “scariest ‘Before and After Kids’ pics” for him to post on the account.

“Let the nightmares begin!” he wrote.



Julianelle has since shared over a dozen before-and-after photos. He said he’s received far more of those submissions than any of the “my toddler destroyed something” memes he previously got.

“Obviously, it’s meant to be lighthearted, and no one is seriously blaming their children for the state of their faces or lives, except for me when I seriously blame my kids for the state of my face and my life, which is basically all I do on my blog and Facebook page and Twitter,” he told HuffPost.

He said he hopes the pictures make people laugh and let parents know they aren’t alone in feeling overwhelmed.

Trump is upset with Wilson, D-Fla., for her apparent attempt to politicize a condolence call he made last week to an Army widow. Wilson said she was present for the call and said Trump told the widow that her deceased husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, “knew what he signed up for.”

Johnson was one of four American servicemen killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger.

White House Chief of Staff retired Gen. John Kelly on Thursday publicly criticized Wilson’s involvement in the call and also suggested she was trying to politicize the matter.

Wilson later suggested in newspaper interviews that some in the White House are racist, though she didn’t single out Kelly. And she suggested that Kelly, whose son was killed in Afghanistan, was forced to make public statements on the call to save his job, amid speculation that Trump is unhappy with his performance.

On Saturday, Trump tweeted, “I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party!”

Q: With the Equifax breach, I am worried that hackers can steal money from my bank account. What can I do?

A: The sheer number of victims is massive, and it keeps climbing with every new report. Meanwhile, Equifax has done a miserable job of comforting its customers, and the fallout has left far more questions than answers. The best thing you can do for your security is to establish two-factor authentication on your bank account. Click here for the steps you can take to stop thieves from emptying your bank account.

Password help

Q: What’s the deal on passwords? I heard they needed to be long. Then I heard they could be short. Help!

A: The prevailing wisdom is to make a password as difficult as possible. The problem with complicated passwords is that they are very hard to remember, especially if they use an array of eccentric punctuation marks, like ampersands and pound signs. But the most current advice is actually a relief, especially if you have a poor memory. Believe it or not, hackers will have a devil of a time trying to figure your password out. Click here for three ways to craft great passwords based on the latest research.

Stalked by Google

Q: Is it true that Google keeps track of every place you go?

A: It stands to reason that your phone’s GPS can (a) track all your movements and (b) keep track of all your movements. Once you figure out just how meticulously Google records your every movement, you may be horrified enough to toss your Android in the nearest lake. All of this geographic documentation is probably harmless, but it's definitely unnerving, no matter how comfortable you are with a never-ending data stream.

Monitor color

Q: My photos look different colors when printed than they show on my monitor. Is my monitor bad?

A: A picture is only as strong as its weakest technical element, and problems are sometimes hard to pinpoint: Maybe your camera lens is malfunctioning, or you’re using cheap software, or your printer doesn’t do certain colors very well. Every little piece can affect how an image turns out. But if you’re pretty sure that your monitor isn’t showing its best colors, click here for a very simple way to fix it.

What Alexa hears

Q: I heard you say that Alexa and other gadgets are recording everything I say. Is this true?

A: The point of a hands-free device like Amazon Echo is that you don't have to press a button or flip a switch to activate the voice recognition software; you just say, “Alexa.” So what can you do to prevent your device from cataloging all of these audio files?

On Thursday evening, ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" opened with a somber 25-minute diatribe that attempted to connect the tragic ambush attack that killed four American soldiers in Niger to the latest version of President Trump’s proposed travel ban, which included the nation of Chad. Maddow essentially claimed that the inclusion of Chad, which recently pulled its troops out of Niger, in the revised travel ban resulted in extremist attacks such as the one that left four Americans dead.

The HuffPost, which is so anti-Trump that it refused to even cover him in the political section during the early stages of his campaign, published a story headlined, ""What the hell was this Rachel Maddow segment?"" The MSNBC host proclaimed that Chad’s pullout from Niger ""had an immediate effect in emboldening ISIS attacks,"" but the HuffPost easily shot down her theory.

Colby College Department of Government assistant professor Laura Seay told the HuffPost that ""any expert"" would have said Maddow's conspiracy theory was ""crazy"" and the pullout of Chadian troops isn’t necessarily related to the Trump’s travel ban.

""Everybody that I know is appalled by this. I would like to think that Maddow's researchers are more responsible,"" Seay told the HuffPost.

While the MSNBC host called the tragic attack on American troops ""absolutely baffling,"" Seay said it was actually ""almost inevitable,"" because it's such a remote and hostile area.

""The attacks that have increased can be traced back to militant group Boko Haram, which is based just across the border in Nigeria,"" the HuffPost reported, citing the Council on Foreign Relations and accounts from local residents.

""Over the course of the day today, lots of people have been very upset with me for reporting that last night, which is fine. I didn’t know you cared. But the upset over my reporting doesn’t mean that anything I reported wasn’t true,"" Maddow said. ""Everything I reported was true.""

Maddow continued: ""Now, this doesn’t mean that Chad withdrawing their troops was necessarily the cause of what happened to those U.S. troops who were ambushed. That ambush is being described by the Pentagon as a shock.""

The HuffPost’s Willa Frej wrote that Maddow built ""myths"" using unrelated or unreliable information and ""reduced the story so thoroughly that it lost any semblance of the larger truth.""

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

Senate Republicans narrowly passed a $4 trillion budget plan Thursday, taking their first big step toward a tax reform package promised by President Donald Trump.

Approval of the nonbinding plan allows the Senate to use a special process known as ""budget reconciliation"" that would forestall a Democratic filibuster.

""Tonight we completed the first step towards replacing our broken tax code by passing a comprehensive, fiscally responsible budget that will help put the federal government on a path to balance,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

The Senate plan, approved on a 51-49 vote, calls for $473 billion in cuts from Medicare over 10 years and more than $1 trillion from Medicaid.

If fully implemented, the plan would cut spending by more than $5 trillion over the next 10 years, with an average of approximately $540 billion per year over the life of the plan, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.

Researchers found that only one of them was predictive of higher flu antibodies four weeks after the flu shot.
“What we see is that the longer you maintain a positive mood, the better your health outcomes tend to be,” she says.

“Your immune system will be stronger, and that can be helpful on the day you get your flu shot.”This article first appeared on Prevention Magazine.","Unfortunately, getting a flu shot doesn’t absolutely guarantee that you’ll sail through flu season unaffected, or even that you’ll be safe from the specific flu strains contained in the shot. But there is one factor that might give you better odds: your mood.

A recent study recruited 138 adults aged 65 to 85, collecting data for two weeks before a flu shot about food and drink consumption, physical activity, stress levels, sleep, and having a positive or negative outlook. For a month after the shot, participants continued to track all of these factors.

Researchers found that only one of them was predictive of higher flu antibodies four weeks after the flu shot. They write in the study, “We found that greater positive mood, whether measured repeated over a 6-week period around vaccination, or on the day of vaccination, significantly predicted greater antibody responses to influenza vaccination.”

Previous studies have noted that chronic stress can negatively affect the immune response to vaccines, but this is the first one to look at whether lack of stress can have a positive impact, says Lisa Christian, PhD, at the Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

Having a sunnier outlook on life doesn’t just make you less likely to get the flu, either. Christian says research suggests that those with consistently low stress levels also have better health behaviors overall—they tend to exercise more, eat healthier foods, and sleep more soundly than their less-joyful peers.

“What we see is that the longer you maintain a positive mood, the better your health outcomes tend to be,” she says. “So, if you have that positivity for at least a few weeks before your flu shot, for example, you’ll likely be in a better position for that vaccine to work effectively.”

This is especially important for seniors, she adds, since those over age 65 tend to have a poorer response to flu shots than kids, teens, or younger adults.

Don’t have weeks to turn your mood around? Even having a short-term feeling of uplift can be helpful, adds Loretta Graziano Breuning, PhD, author of Habits of a Happy Brain. That’s because a positive mood can decrease levels of cortisol, the hormone associated with the stressful “fight or flight” response.

When cortisol is high, she says, the body shuts down or depresses systems that aren’t necessary in an emergency, and that includes the immune system. But when that hormone decreases, others surge—such as dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin—that support a healthy immune system.

“Even in the short term, this can have a beneficial effect,” says Breuning. “Your immune system will be stronger, and that can be helpful on the day you get your flu shot.”

Kia, Audi and BMW filled out the rest of the top five, while Cadillac, GMC, Ram, Dodge and Volvo were ranked the lowest.

Complaints about infotainment systems and new transmissions plagued the lowest-ranked automakers, while Toyota's slow and steady implementation of new technologies paid off with high marks.

Consumer Reports predicts reliability of 2018 vehicles based on a survey of subscribers who owned or leased 640,000 vehicles from the 2000-2017 model years. It forecasts how a model will perform based on recent data for that model.

The magazine gives more weight to mechanical and safety issues than minor problems like wind noise.

The magazine's rankings are closely watched in the industry, since many buyers seek advice from Consumer Reports.

Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing, says Toyota's strategy of adding new technology gradually — instead of all at once — helps make its vehicles more reliable. Toyota's new Camry sedan, for example, has an eight-speed transmission that was first tested on the Highlander SUV.

Kia has also steadily climbed in the rankings because it uses proven technology that has already been tested by its sister brand, Hyundai, which slipped in the rankings. Consumer Reports found that the Kia Niro hybrid, which went on sale earlier this year, was the most reliable vehicle in its entire survey.

Audi and BMW also have better-than-average infotainment systems because they were some of the first to market them more than a decade ago.

""They've had all those growing pains,"" Fisher said.

By contrast, Buick dropped from third to eighth in the rankings because of troubles with its new 2017 LaCrosse sedan, which has a new eight-speed transmission, new engine and new electronic shifter, among other features. Fisher said other recent Buicks, like the Envision, went on sale in China or Europe first and got some kinks worked out before heading to the U.S.

Electric cars escaped some of those reliability problems because they have fewer parts. General Motors Co. didn't fare well overall, but its new Chevrolet Bolt electric car had above-average reliability. In its debut on the list, Tesla Inc.'s Model 3 sedan got an ""average"" reliability score. The car isn't widely available yet, but the magazine based its ranking on responses for the company's Model S sedan, which has above-average reliability.

""There's a lot of stuff that's not in electric cars. They're simpler,"" Fisher said.

Chrysler was the biggest climber in the rankings, thanks to consumer reviews of its new Pacifica minivan. Acura fell the furthest, hurt by problems with the transmissions on several of its new models.

Carrey’s team filed a new motion on Friday against White, who killed herself in September 2015 by overdosing on prescription drugs, People magazine reported. White’s mother, Brigid Sweetman, and her estranged husband, Mark Burton, filed a wrongful death case against the actor, claiming he utilized his “wealth, influence and celebrity status” to supply her the drugs she overdosed on.

Carrey claimed White changed her friend’s Planned Parenthood records to trick him on her STD results when they began dating. She allegedly back-dated the form from 2013 to 2011, court documents obtained by People magazine stated. He added that White’s mother and her previous attorney, Filippo Marchino, were conspiring in 2013 to extort the 55-year-old actor through “smears and threats of public degradation via false allegations.”

""White's intent in obtaining these records was clear — she cooked the records, creating forgeries with altered information, phony tests and fictitious dates,"" the documents stated.

Carrey’s attorneys alleged that text messages between White and her friend proved the former girlfriend worked to forge the Planned Parenthood medical records before handing them to Carrey.

“On April 2, 2013, [White’s friend] had a routine appointment at Planned Parenthood to re-fill her birth control contraceptive. During her appointment, she gave a urine and blood sample for a routine HIV test and STD screening and was tested for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. The results were all negative,” according to the documents, adding that a week later White asked for a copy of the records.

The court documents added, “Though [her friend] never knew what White intended to do with her medical records or what she ultimately did with them, we now know that White, using a legitimate and official copy of her friend’s Planned Parenthood records, forged test results to ‘prove’ the lie that she had tested negative for sexually transmitted diseases just prior to her relationship with Carrey and to support her attempt to extort millions of dollars from her famous ex-boyfriend.”

Sweetman and Burton slammed Carey, saying in a statement to People magazine that his new court filing was a “desperate attempt to save himself.”

“Carrey has now resorted to outright falsehoods. Let’s see if his story holds up once he is under oath. It won’t,” the statement said.

Carrey’s lawyers are asking for the case against him to be dismissed if the medical records are fabricated. The new filing comes weeks after the attorney for White’s estate released a note allegedly written by White in 2013 that accused Carrey of giving her STDs and exposing her to drugs and mental abuse.

""Before you I might not have had very much, but I had respect, I was a happy person, I loved life, I was confident and I felt good in my own skin and was proud of most decisions I made,"" reads the note, which was dated April 8, 2013. ""I met you, you introduced me to cocaine, prostitutes, mental abuse and disease,” the note allegedly written by White stated.

Just four years removed from their third straight 100-loss season in 2013, the Astros shut down the Yankees for two straight games after dropping three in a row in the Bronx.

Next up for the Astros: Game 1 of the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night. Los Angeles opened as a narrow favorite, but Houston aces Dallas Keuchel and ALCS MVP Justin Verlander will have plenty of rest before the matchup begins at Dodger Stadium.

Houston has never won even a single World Series game. The only previous time the Astros made it this far, they were a National League team when they were swept by the Chicago White Sox in 2005.

Now, manager A.J. Hinch's club has a chance to win that elusive first title, while trying to boost a region still recovering from Hurricane Harvey.

Houston improved to 6-0 at Minute Maid Park in these playoffs and became the fifth team in major league history to win a seven-game postseason series by winning all four of its home games.

Morton bounced back from a loss in Game 3 to allow two hits over five scoreless innings. Starter-turned-postseason reliever McCullers limited the Yankees to just one hit while fanning six over the next four.

Combined, they throttled the wild-card Yankees one last time in Houston. Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez and their New York teammates totaled just three runs in the four road games.

CC Sabathia entered the game 10-0 with a 1.69 ERA in 13 starts this season after a Yankees loss. But he struggled with command and was gone with one out in the fourth inning.

Houston was up 2-0 in fifth when former Yankees star Brian McCann came through for the second straight game by hitting a two-run double after snapping an 0-for-20 skid with an ground-rule RBI double to give Houston its first run on Friday night.

The Yankees, trying to reach the World Series for the first time since 2009, lost an elimination game for the first time this season after winning their first four in these playoffs. New York struggled on the road this postseason, with this loss dropping the team to 1-6.

After going 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position through the first three innings, the Astros got on the board with no outs in the fourth with the 405-foot shot by Gattis off Sabathia which made it 1-0.

Altuve launched a ball off Tommy Kahnle into the seats in right field with one out in the fifth for his fifth homer this postseason. It took a while for him to see that it was going to get out, and held onto his bat until he was halfway to first base before flipping it and trotting around the bases as chants of ""MVP"" rained down on him.

Altuve finished 8 for 25 with two homers and four RBIs in the ALCS after hitting .533 with three homers and four RBIs in the ALDS against Boston.

Carlos Correa and Yuli Gurriel hit consecutive singles after that before Kahnle struck out Gattis. McCann's two-strike double, which rolled into the corner of right field, cleared the bases to push the lead to 4-0. Gurriel slid to avoid the tag and remained on his belly in a swimming pose at the plate for a few seconds after he was called safe.

It was just the second Game 7 in franchise history for the Astros, who dropped Game 7 to the Cardinals in the 2004 NLCS 13 years ago today.

Sabathia allowed five hits and one run while walking three in 3 1/3 innings. He wasn't nearly as sharp as he was in a Game 3 win and just 36 of the 65 pitches he threw were strikes.

Morton got into trouble in the fifth, and the Yankees had runners at the corners with one out. Bregman fielded a grounder hit by Todd Frazier and made a perfect throw home to allow McCann to tag Greg Bird and preserve Houston's lead. McCann held onto the ball despite Bird's cleat banging into his forearm. Chase Headley grounded out after that to end the inning.

A night after Springer kept Frazier from extra-bases with a leaping catch, Judge returned the favor on a ball hit by Yuli Gurriel. Judge sprinted, jumped and reached into the stands to grab his long fly ball before crashing into the wall and falling to the ground for the first out of the second inning.

Springer had another nifty catch in this one, jumping in front of Marwin Gonzalez at the wall in left-center to grab a ball hit by Bird for the first out of the seventh inning.","Astros beat Yankees 4-0, head to World Series",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/21/astros-beat-yankees-4-0-head-to-world-series.html

Throngs of children are without families or homes, entire villages and farming communities no longer exist, and cities are in ruins.

Fallout from the seismic Syrian civil war and upheaval besets the Middle East. Aggressor regimes and extremist groups have capitalized upon the chaos and despair.

It will be very difficult at this late juncture to get America’s Syria policy right, but the moral and strategic stakes are too high to keep getting it wrong. Instead of slouching toward a fatally flawed paradigm, the Trump administration should conduct an urgent policy review, such as it did for North Korea and Iran.

U.S. efforts in Syria are hampered by a narrow focus on defeating ISIS and corollary downplaying of the threat posed by the bloodthirsty Syrian regime and its allies; inadequate attention to atrocities and the plight of civilians; and failure to tackle the complexities and prepare for the future.

Obama administration officials were mostly idle and mute as the civil war and the tragic human toll escalated out of control. They did little or nothing in response to the Bashar Assad regime’s slaughter, disappearances, systematized torture, starvation sieges, and use of barrel bombs, heavy artillery and chemical weapons on civilians.

Even worse, the Obama administration deferred to Russian “peace plans” while resisting calls for strong sanctions on Syria, a humanitarian corridor and serious assistance for vetted pro-democracy rebels. This had the effect of buying the brutal President Assad time – often when time was running out for him.

Worse still, the Obama administration continued to defer to Russia and to suggest a “constructive role” for Iran, even after Iranian militias and Russian air forces entered the war on Assad’s side.

The vacuum created by U.S. and United Nations neglect allowed Iran and Russia – along with extremist groups from the al Quds unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, to al Nusra, to Hezbollah, to ISIS – to seize the day.

As ISIS metastasized, the Assad regime and Russia shrewdly positioned themselves as the best alternative to Islamist terror, even though they left ISIS mostly alone while brutally assaulting non-ISIS rebels and civilians.

By the time of President Trump’s inauguration, the wishful thinking of the Obama administration – that Russia could be a “partner” in fighting ISIS, that Iran could play a “constructive role” in Syria and Iraq, and that the Syrian people could “coexist” with a regime that caused so much horror and pain – were obvious delusions.

Iran had already doubled down on its violent and destabilizing activities. Russia had worked against American interests and assisted Assad at every turn.

The new Trump foreign policy and national security team at first seemed to chart a better course. It imposed significant new sanctions. It responded with limited military actions when pro-Assad forces used chemical weapons and threatened the American-led coalition.

With clarity that departed from Obama administration relativism, the Trump administration emphasized that “there can be no peace, stability or justice as long as Assad remains in power” and that Russia and Iran “support his killing his own people.”

But Russia again seized the day when it orchestrated the first Astana Conference, where it pushed a proposal for ""de-confliction zones"" to be enforced by Russia, Iran and Turkey. While skeptical about Russian intentions, the Trump administration didn’t provide alternatives.

The Syrian opposition knew where this would lead. “Ceasefires” sponsored by the Obama administration and Russia had allowed Assad to consolidate military gains and regroup. After a convenient lull in the action, regime forces had attacked opposition forces that stood down, along with defenseless civilians.

One need only look at ""de-confliction zones” in Idlib and elsewhere to know that Astana conferences serve similar purposes. Assad has locked down victories in the west and turned to the north and east. Civilian casualties have soared as pro-government forces have launched bombing raids in areas designated for protection.

Having mostly defeated the “Arab awakening” opposition, pro-Assad forces targeted ISIS, but with the goal of beating other powers to the punch in taking ISIS-held territory. Now that ISIS is on the run and Syrian Kurds and the U.S. coalition have driven ISIS out of Raqqa, we are likely to see Syrian regime forces turn on the Kurds, as Iran-embedded Iraqi forces did in Kirkuk.

Populations fleeing ISIS in Syria and Iraq face serious abuses of Iranian and other militias. As the Hudson Institute’s Michael Pregent points out: “Iran has sold itself as a responsible actor in Iraq” and many Americans still downplay Iran’s significant and deleterious role in the Iraqi security forces, intelligence apparatus and ministries.

Ultimately, Iran wants a contiguous land corridor from Tehran to Baghdad to Damascus to Beirut. Russia wants to capitalize on its success in saving Assad and its now major presence in the Middle East. Turkey’s and Jordan’s increasing cooperation with Russia are testimony to Russian boldness and leverage.

Given all of this, the U.S. and U.N. need their own bold initiatives and assertion of leverage. Instead, there has been an increasing inclination to accept Assad as inevitable, and to view Russia and Iran as troublesome but necessary partners in the war against ISIS.

Although President Trump is improving relations with Sunni states that can counter Iran, and just announced strong penalties on the Iranian Guard Corps, sound strategy for Syria is desperately needed.

Accepting the status quo in Syria is a bad idea and will only make things worse, for nothing is stable in that land of suffering. Assad will find new ways to oppress, terrorize and murder opponents and civilians. Exhausted Sunni moderates, who we need on our side if we’re to defeat Sunni-Islamist terrorists, might once and for all lose faith in the “free world.""

In addition, Iranian Shiite proxies will gain new strongholds and moderate Shiites will be pressed to join them. Although diminished, disparate anti-regime forces will continue to fight. Let us not delude ourselves into believing that as long as we defeat ISIS we can find some kind of equilibrium.

Early priorities of a new U.S. policy toward Syria should be: trying Assad for war crimes; deterring Russia and Iran; paying more attention to civilian suffering and casualties; forming safe zones; and pressing wealthy Gulf States to help refugees. It is far past time to consider the big picture and the long game.",Defeating ISIS isn’t enough: Trump urgently needs a new Syria policy,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/defeating-isis-isn-t-enough-trump-urgently-needs-new-syria-policy.html

The Board of Trustees voted 10-3 on Wednesday to fire Jurich after 20 years as the school’s AD. Jurich, 61, had been placed on paid administrative Sept. 27 by interim university President Greg Postel. Louisville’s Athletic Association fired men’s basketball coach Rick Pitino on Monday.

Jurich shepherded Louisville’s 2014 entry into the Atlantic Coast Conference. He also was responsible for facility upgrades and saw numerous sports thrive under coaches he hired.

Vince Tyra was named acting AD since Oct. 3, a move the Athletic Association approved on Monday before firing Pitino.

Louisville’s acknowledgment of being part of a federal probe into bribery of college recruits proved to be Jurich’s undoing. Postel’s Sept. 27 disciplinary letter to the AD called allegations in the complaint “disturbing and unprecedented.” His letter also called “unacceptable” the level of misconduct, alleged criminal activity and the negative attention it has brought to Louisville.

Postel also criticized Jurich for failing to update or consult the athletic board about his negotiation of the department’s sponsorship extension with Adidas.

Jurich’s lawyer, Alison M. Stemler, disputed Postel’s allegations in a letter that also questioned whether school’s disciplinary action might violate a contract clause.

Several Jurich supporters carrying signs urging trustees to retain the AD gathered outside the Grawemeyer administration building and briefly inside the meeting room. Jurich’s attorney, Alison M. Stemler, and members of Jurich’s legal team joined the meeting shortly after it began.

Trustees ultimately followed the same path as the ULAA, deciding to part ways with Jurich and move forward.

Jurich departs as construction continues on a $63 million expansion of the football stadium due for completion by next season. He had a long record of accomplishments that helped Louisville build one of the nation’s top athletic programs.

Jurich also remained loyal to coaches he hired, to a fault in some cases.

Jurich hired Pitino as coach in 2001 and celebrated Louisville’s third NCCA men’s basketball championship trophy 12 years later in perhaps the school’s most successful year in athletics.

The Cardinals’ women’s basketball team reached the NCAA championship game that same season and has remained a perennial NCAA Tournament contender. Both programs play in a 22,000-seat downtown arena that opened in 2010.

Lamar Jackson became Louisville’s first Heisman Trophy winner last year when the Cardinals flirted with a berth in the college football playoff. The Cardinals in 1998 began playing in Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium, which is undergoing its second expansion from its original 42,000-seat capacity.

The baseball team is coming off its third College World Series berth in five years and is also preparing to expand its stadium.

Jurich was scrutinized for his decision to re-hire football coach Bobby Petrino in January 2014, less than two years after Arkansas fired Petrino for misleading school officials about a motorcycle accident in which his passenger was later revealed to be his mistress.

At least one of the cases has resulted in death, with nearly 250 others requiring hospital care.

The cases span across 48 states, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates the number to be far higher than what’s been reported.

“For one salmonella case we know of in an outbreak, there are up to 30 others that we don’t know about,” CDC veterinarian Megin Nichols said.

Nichols said many people raising chickens don’t understand the potential danger, and treat the birds like pets allowing close contact and access to the family home. But poultry can carry salmonella bacteria in their intestines that can be shed in their feces, which could attach to feathers and dust and brush off on shoes or clothing.

YOUR BRAIN KNOWS WHEN YOU'VE JUST DIED, RESEARCHERS SAY

While salmonella can be prevented with thorough handwashing and discarding shoes used in chicken coops outside, some have taken to snuggling or kissing the birds. Nichols said they view the uptick in cases as a preventable health problem, and that the best way to protect against infection is to assume all birds carry the bacteria.

Salmonella infection is more widely-known as a food-borne illness, with more than 1 million cases and 300 deaths due to contaminated food recorded each year.

There are no firm figures on how many households in the U.S. have backyard chickens, but a Department of Agriculture report in 2013 found a growing number of residents in Denver, Los Angeles, Miami and New York City expressed interest in getting them. Coops are now seen in even the smallest yards and densest urban neighborhoods.

“I think it’s really important to know where your food comes from, but I do think they need to be educated on how to do it safely,” Dr. Stacene Maroushek, a pediatric infectious disease physician in Minneapolis, told the Associated Press. “There are things growing up as a farm kid you know instinctively, but city people don’t know.”

Salmonella can cause flu-like symptoms, including diarrhea, and can pose a more serious risk in children, pregnant women, elderly people and those with compromised immune systems.

“It gets into their blood and it can get into organs,” Maroushek said. “It can be much more significant in people with underlying health problems.”

Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it.
Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

If the Jazz are a barometer, the Thunder will be in trouble against Minnesota Sunday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.

However, the season is young -- both teams are 1-1 -- and Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan's team will likely not score only 34 points in the first half on most nights. The total was less than the lowest output of 35 points last year.

More Timberwolves coverage

That was the Thunder's production against Utah in a 96-87 loss in Salt Lake City. They made only 2 of 14 shots from 3-point range in the first half and 11 of 33 for the whole game.

""I thought we got off to a really good start offensively (taking a 6-0 lead) and then from there we had a hard time,"" Donovan said. ""I thought we had some fairly decent looks. We didn't shoot the ball particularly well. … I also thought that we had some shots that we are certainly more than capable of making and finishing and we didn't.""

Thunder forward Paul George made 8 of 19 shots from the field and 3 of 9 from 3-point range. The former Indiana Pacers All-Star also had six turnovers.

""It was just missed shots,"" George said of the reason for the loss to Utah. ""I thought we got a lot of great looks. I thought we could have done a better job getting ourselves in a better rhythm, but I thought offensively we were fine.""

Carmelo Anthony scored 26 points but he took 26 shots, making 12. He was 2 of 8 from 3-point range. George, Anthony and Russell Westbrook were a combined 6 of 22 from beyond the arc.

""We're great,"" George said afterward. ""This (loss) is good for us. This will build a lot within this locker room. Good thing about it is we got another game tomorrow. We'll go out and we'll execute. We will pick up the pieces and clean some things up and we'll be ready for tomorrow.""

Another concern is rebounding. Westbrook had a big first half on the backboards with 10 rebounds. No other Oklahoma City player had more than three. Westbrook finished with 11 rebounds and George was next with five.

Minnesota beat Utah 100-97 on Friday in Minneapolis behind the solid frontcourt play of center Karl-Anthony Towns and forward Taj Gibson, who combined for 18 rebounds. Towns had 10 of them and shot 7 of 12 from the field, finishing with 20 points.

Gibson and fellow Chicago Bulls import Jimmy Butler are making their mark early. Butler had 13 points, seven rebounds and five steals against the Jazz.

When the Timberwolves overhauled their roster in the offseason, the spotlight was on the acquisition of Butler, Gibson and Jeff Teague. Backup guard Jamal Crawford will also be an important contributor.

Crawford scored all 17 of his points in the fourth quarter in the narrow victory Friday. He made a 3-pointer to take sole possession of sixth in NBA history with 2,051. He is sixth among all active players in games played (1,183).

When asked of Crawford's potential impact this season, Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said: ""I think you saw. It's amazing. It doesn't take him much to get going.""

When he was a rookie, Teague played with Crawford in Atlanta. According to Teague, eight years later, the only thing that has changed is Crawford's age. He is now 37.

""I'm not amazed by him anymore,"" Teague said. ""I expect that from him.""

Andrew Wiggins, the third-year holdover, has led the team in scoring in both games. He scored 21 in Friday's game.",Preview: Wolves at Thunder,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/22/preview-wolves-at-thunder.html

Q: With the Equifax breach, I am worried that hackers can steal money from my bank account. What can I do?

A: The sheer number of victims is massive, and it keeps climbing with every new report. Meanwhile, Equifax has done a miserable job of comforting its customers, and the fallout has left far more questions than answers. The best thing you can do for your security is to establish two-factor authentication on your bank account. Click here for the steps you can take to stop thieves from emptying your bank account.

Password help

Q: What’s the deal on passwords? I heard they needed to be long. Then I heard they could be short. Help!

A: The prevailing wisdom is to make a password as difficult as possible. The problem with complicated passwords is that they are very hard to remember, especially if they use an array of eccentric punctuation marks, like ampersands and pound signs. But the most current advice is actually a relief, especially if you have a poor memory. Believe it or not, hackers will have a devil of a time trying to figure your password out. Click here for three ways to craft great passwords based on the latest research.

Stalked by Google

Q: Is it true that Google keeps track of every place you go?

A: It stands to reason that your phone’s GPS can (a) track all your movements and (b) keep track of all your movements. Once you figure out just how meticulously Google records your every movement, you may be horrified enough to toss your Android in the nearest lake. All of this geographic documentation is probably harmless, but it's definitely unnerving, no matter how comfortable you are with a never-ending data stream. So how might you turn this feature off, ensuring that no one at Google is following you around? Click here to learn which setting to change, and the rest is a walk in the park.

Monitor color

Q: My photos look different colors when printed than they show on my monitor. Is my monitor bad?

A: A picture is only as strong as its weakest technical element, and problems are sometimes hard to pinpoint: Maybe your camera lens is malfunctioning, or you’re using cheap software, or your printer doesn’t do certain colors very well. Every little piece can affect how an image turns out. But if you’re pretty sure that your monitor isn’t showing its best colors, click here for a very simple way to fix it.

What Alexa hears

Q: I heard you say that Alexa and other gadgets are recording everything I say. Is this true?

A: The point of a hands-free device like Amazon Echo is that you don't have to press a button or flip a switch to activate the voice recognition software; you just say, “Alexa.” So what can you do to prevent your device from cataloging all of these audio files? And what other devices are eavesdropping on your every private conversation?

226,"['paper', 'goods', 'dangerous', 'pose', 'faa', 'batteries', 'large', 'laptops', 'explosion', 'bags', 'ban', 'risk', 'airline', 'checked']","The U.S. government is urging the world airline community to ban large, personal electronic devices like laptops from checked luggage because of the potential for a catastrophic fire.
The proposed ban is on the agenda of a meeting of ICAO's panel on dangerous goods being held this week and next week in Montreal.
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration formerly led the U.S. negotiations on the regulation of dangerous goods at ICAO meetings.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has now decided to put PHMSA back in charge at future ICAO dangerous goods deliberations, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Thursday.
""I strongly believe it has the potential to put the lives of airline passengers and crews at serious risk,"" he said.","The U.S. government is urging the world airline community to ban large, personal electronic devices like laptops from checked luggage because of the potential for a catastrophic fire.

The Federal Aviation Administration said in a paper filed recently with a U.N. agency that its tests show that when a laptop's rechargeable lithium-ion battery overheats in close proximity to an aerosol spray can, it can cause an explosion capable of disabling an airliner's fire suppression system. The fire could then rage unchecked, leading to ""the loss of the aircraft,"" the paper said.

The U.N. agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization, sets global aviation safety standards, although member countries must still ratify them. The proposed ban is on the agenda of a meeting of ICAO's panel on dangerous goods being held this week and next week in Montreal.

The FAA has conducted 10 tests involving a fully-charged laptop packed in a suitcase. A heater was placed against the laptop's battery to force it into ""thermal runaway,"" a condition in which the battery's temperature continually rises.

In one test, an 8-ounce aerosol can of dry shampoo —which is permitted in checked baggage — was strapped to the laptop. There was a fire almost immediately and it grew rapidly. The aerosol can exploded within 40 seconds.

The test showed that because of the rapid progression of the fire, Halon gas fire suppressant systems used in airline cargo compartments would be unable to put out the fire before there was an explosion, the FAA said. The explosion might not be strong enough to structurally damage the plane, but it could damage the cargo compartment and allow the Halon to escape, the agency said. Then there would be nothing to prevent the fire from spreading.

Other tests of laptop batteries packed with potentially dangerous consumer goods that are permitted in checked baggage like nail polish remover, hand sanitizer and rubbing alcohol also resulted in large fires, although no explosions.

As a result, the paper recommends that passengers shouldn't be allowed to pack large electronic devices in baggage unless they have specific approval from the airline. The paper says the European Safety Agency, the FAA's counterpart in Europe; Airbus, one of the world's largest makers of passenger airliners; the International Federation of Airline Pilots' Association, and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Association, which represents aircraft makers, concurred in the recommendation.

The paper doesn't address whether the ban should extend to domestic flights, but points out the risk that baggage containing a large electronic device could be transferred from one flight to another without the knowledge of the airline. The FAA said it believes most devices larger than a smartphone are already being carried by passengers into the cabin, rather than put in checked bags.

Rechargeable lithium batteries are used in consumer products ranging from cellphones and laptops to electric cars. Manufacturers like them because they pack more energy into smaller packages, but the batteries can self-ignite if they have a manufacturing flaw, are damaged, exposed to excessive heat, overcharged or packed too closely together. The fires can burn up to 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit, close to the melting point of the aluminum used in aircraft construction.

Since 2006, three cargo jets have been destroyed and four pilots killed by in-flight fires that investigators say were either started by batteries or made more severe by their proximity.

Earlier this year, the U.S. imposed a ban on laptops in the cabins of planes coming into the country from 10 Middle Eastern airports for security reasons. The ban was fully lifted in July after U.S. officials said airports in the region had taken other steps to increase security.

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration formerly led the U.S. negotiations on the regulation of dangerous goods at ICAO meetings. But the Obama administration put the FAA in charge in 2009 after congressional Democrats accused high-level officials at PHMSA of being too cozy with the industries they regulate.

Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has now decided to put PHMSA back in charge at future ICAO dangerous goods deliberations, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Thursday. Both agencies are part of the Transportation Department.

DeFazio called the decision ""inexplicable"" in a letter to Chao.

""I strongly believe it has the potential to put the lives of airline passengers and crews at serious risk,"" he said.

Chao didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Lobbyists for lithium battery makers and companies that use the batteries in their products have previously urged the change.","US: Laptops in checked bags pose fire, explosion risk",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/20/us-laptops-in-checked-bags-pose-fire-explosion-risk.html

'Trick-or-treat' is right around the corner and one way to help keep Halloween safe is to make sure kids can see and be seen.

Life is starting to return to normal in parts of California wine country, where fires destroyed lives, homes and businesses. Pam Starr, co-owner of Crocker and and Starr in St. Helena, Napa County was evacuated from her home by the fires, and she didn't know whether her business was ruined.

""Both Napa and Sonoma were filled with smoke. We didn't know what was going on,"" Starr said.

But then the skies cleared, her business was intact, and they were able to get back to work ""we had a little fruit left, we picked what was left on the Crocker estate in St. Helena.""

Starr says there are many wineries, like hers, that survived. She was touched to see first responders from as far away as Canada, and Australia, coming to California wine country to save lives and preserve homes and businesses.

Now, survivors are helping their neighbors, and wineries that are still in operation are picking up employees from the businesses that were destroyed by the fires. Starr says now that things are returning to normal, ""Napa Valley is ready for visitors, we're getting into business again.""

“Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action & vote R!” Trump tweeted Sunday.

Every House member is up for re-election in 2018.

Johnson was one of four American servicemen killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger.

White House Chief of Staff retired Gen. John Kelly on Thursday publicly criticized Wilson’s involvement in the call and also suggested she was trying to politicize the matter.

Wilson later suggested in newspaper interviews that some in the White House are racist, though she didn’t single out Kelly. And she suggested that Kelly, whose son was killed in Afghanistan, was forced to make public statements on the call to save his job, amid speculation that Trump is unhappy with his performance.

On Saturday, Trump tweeted, “I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party!”

Trump also tweeted Sunday that nearly half of all Americans are “finally” starting to realize that major news organizations are publishing or airing fake stories about him. However, he did not cite the poll.

“It is finally sinking through,” he tweeted. “46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS, even worse! Lost cred.”",Trump turns feud with Democrat Wilson into midterm GOP rallying call,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/22/trump-turns-feud-with-democrat-wilson-into-midterm-gop-rallying-call.html

Attendees of the show were blasting the venue on Facebook and Twitter Friday morning, posting videos of Brooks playing with a significant echo that frustrated fans. Some fans who were sitting close to the stage reportedly left early.

“We sprung a couple hundred bucks to see Garth Brooks at the heavily advertised, much anticipated, and [first ever], concert at this stadium,” a fan wrote in a 1-star review on Mercedes-Benz Stadium’s Facebook page. “We sat in section 125, and we could not hear one word that Garth or Trisha [Yearwood] said or sang.

The venue said after the concert that it was looking into the issues.

“Garth Brooks played the first concert tonight at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and it was a spectacular show that tens of thousands enjoyed,” the venue stated. “We have heard some fan concerns about sound quality in certain sections of the upper concourse and sound engineers are looking into that now.

The team had three games remaining on its schedule. Players will still meet at practice times, but instead of preparing for upcoming games they will participate in mandatory discussions on racial intolerance, ethics and accountability.

Police said they were also investigating the content of the video.

Frank J. Thornton, president of the Henrico County chapter of the NAACP, said the school took a step in the right direction by forfeiting the remaining football games, but questioned whether the school district is equipped to get to the root of the problem.

""You can't just sugar-coat,"" Thornton told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""You need a group who really knows what they're doing.""

The Henrico County School Board said in a letter to the community that it is developing steps to prevent future similar incidents and will include parents in that discussion.

“And China's really helping us, and — well, also with respect to North Korea, 93 percent of things going into North Korea come through China.","President Trump detailed his historic tax cut plans, talked about his Twitter habits and praised Gen. John Kelly’s Thursday speech dismissing Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson’s suggestion that he was forced to make public statements to keep his job in an exclusive Fox News interview on Sunday.

In an interview on “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” Trump talked about his plan to bring the “biggest [tax] cuts ever in the history of this country.”

“I think we’re going to get our taxes,” Trump said in the two-part interview. I think it’s going to be — well, hopefully before the end of the year, but maybe much sooner than that.”

“So there’s a great spirit for it, people want to see it, and I call it tax cuts. It is tax reform also, but I call it tax cuts. It’ll be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country,” Trump added.

Trump said he believes he has the votes for his historic plan to pass in Congress. He reiterated his plan to tackle taxes and health care to promote “tremendous growth” and address the debt and deficit in the U.S.

“Well, it’s going to be all growth. Look, it’s going to be growth. I think that growth can be staggering. I also think we have a lot of waste in this country. And we’ll be doing other things. We will be doing welfare reform. I mean that’s coming up,” the president said.

He added, “Okay, and whether people like it or not. You know people don’t like having a house and working three jobs and having somebody nearby where their living better than the person with the three jobs. It’s not fair. And that’s all coming up, believe me that’s going to be out there very soon.”

“I want to get the taxes first. I want to get health care. We’re doing a big infrastructure bill which will be a very positive thing. But we’re going to have tremendous growth,” Trump said.

When asked about the “bickering and feuding” with other Republican politicians, including Senators Bob Corker and John McCain, the president said it sometimes helps because “it gets people to do what they’re supposed to be doing.”

“I think, actually sometimes it helps. Sometimes it gets people to do what they’re supposed to be doing. And you know, that’s the way it is,” Trump told Fox News. “I just want what’s right. And I think, for the most part, they want what’s right too. So we’ll see what happens but I do believe we have the votes for health care at the appropriate time. And I think we’re going to have the votes for taxes and I will say the fact that healthcare is so difficult, I think, makes the taxes easier.”

The president also touched on Kelly’s Thursday appearance in the White House briefing room after Trump was criticized for his condolences to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed with three other U.S. soldiers in Niger on Oct. 4. Florida Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson said Trump told Johnson’s widow that her deceased husband “knew what he signed up for.”

Trump said his chief of staff is “an elegant man.”

“[Kelly] was so offended, because he was in the room when I made the call and so were other people,” Trump said. “And the call was a very nice call. He was so offended that a woman would be — that somebody would be listening to that call.”

Trump dismissed Wilson’s claim that Kelly was forced to make public statements to keep his job.

“He didn't want this job,” Trump said, adding that Wilson's comment was ""sickening"" to him. “He is a man who felt this was important for the country.”

Despite his past criticism on China’s lack of action against North Korea, Trump applauded Chinese President Xi Jinping and his actions against North Korea. He called Xi a “good man” who has been helping the U.S. with the nuclear crisis.

“He's for China and I'm for the U.S., OK? So we start off with that, but we do have a very good — I would say an exceptional relationship,” Trump told Fox News. “And China's really helping us, and — well, also with respect to North Korea, 93 percent of things going into North Korea come through China. China is big stuff.”

Talking about his Twitter habits, Trump said he has a “tremendous platform” between Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. He defended his tweets, saying they are “well crafted” and he is being “treated very unfairly by the media.”

“See I don’t call it Tweets, Tweeting is like a typewriter — when I put it out, you put it immediately on your show,” Trump said.

“I was always good student, I am like a person that does well with that kind of thing. And I doubt I would be here if weren’t for social media, to be honest with you. Because there is a fake media out there, I get treated very unfairly by the media,” the president added.

He said, “So when somebody, says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it. The other way, I would never be get the word out.”

She was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and released after two days, and continues to take two heart medications daily, The Washington Post reported.","Doctors were expecting to treat a Texas woman who was mourning the death of her beloved Yorkshire terrier for a possible heart attack, only to discover that her symptoms were actually due to a broken heart. Joanie Simpson, whose 2016 medical ordeal was detailed in the New England Journal of Medicine, was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a condition commonly associated with the loss of a spouse or child.

The symptoms can mimic those of a heart attack and is also referred to as “broken-heart syndrome,” The Washington Post reported. The condition is most common in women ages 58 to 75, and can cause weakening of the left ventricle, according to Harvard Medical School.

For Simpson, who at the time was stressed due to her son’s impending back surgery, her son-in-law’s unemployment and a property sale, it was the loss of the dog named Meha that sent her over the edge.

“The kids were grown and out of the house, so she was our little girl,” Simpson, 62, told The Washington Post.

But when the dog was diagnosed with congenital heart failure, Simpson decided it was best to have her euthanized. She canceled the appointment when the dog seemed to bounce back to health, but Meha died the next day.

“It was such a horrendous thing to have to witness,” Simpson told The Washington Post. “When you’re already kind of upset about other things, it’s like a brick on a scale. I mean everything just weighs on you.”

Sometime after Meha’s death, Simpson woke with back pain that traveled to her chest and went to an emergency room near her Houston home. She was then airlifted to the Memorial Hermann Heart & Vascular Institute – Texas Medical Center, where doctors discovered her arteries were clear, indicating her illness was not a heart attack. She was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and released after two days, and continues to take two heart medications daily, The Washington Post reported.

She said she was not surprised by the diagnosis after it was explained to her.

“It is heartbreaking. It is traumatic. It is all of the above,” Simpson said of owning a pet. “But you know what? They give so much love and companionship that I’ll do it again. I will continue to have pets. That’s not going to stop me.”",Woman diagnosed with 'broken-heart syndrome' after loss of beloved dog,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/20/woman-diagnosed-with-broken-heart-syndrome-after-loss-beloved-dog.html

Toback, who directed “Black and White” and “Two Girls and a Guy” and was also nominated for an Oscar for writing “Bugsy,” allegedly sexually harassed at least 38 women for decades, according to a Los Angeles Times report. The newspaper interviewed the women, who detailed similar encounters with the 72-year-old director over the years.

The women said Toback would tout his success in Hollywood and lured them into a meeting, interview or audition for a role. But the encounters would quickly turn sexual as the director asks the women inappropriate questions such as, “How often do you masturbate?” the report stated. Toback would then dry hump the women or masturbate in front of them.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN SEX SCANDAL: DETAILING THE ALLEGATIONS

Actress Adrienne LaValley recalled to the Los Angeles Times the time Toback harassed her in a hotel room in 2008 when he rubbed his crotch on her leg.

“I felt like a prostitute, an utter disappointment to myself, my parents, my friends. And I deserved not to tell anyone,” she said.

Starr Rinaldi said she was an aspiring actress when Toback approached her in New York City’s Central Park about 15 years ago. She said she felt the alleged harassment she dealt with from the director was a “test” to how serious she was about acting.

“He always wanted me to read for him in a hotel or come back to his apartment, like, ‘How serious are you about your craft?’” Rinaldi said. “And the horrible thing is, whichever road you choose, whether you sleep with him or walk away, you’re still broken.”

She added, “You have been violated.”

HARVEY WEINSTEIN DISPUTES LUPITA NYONG'O'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS

The women Toback targeted ranged from aspiring actresses, women in the industry to people on the streets. Louise Post, the guitarist and vocalist for indie rock band Veruca Salt, said she met Toback in 1987 and went to his apartment.

“He told me he’d love nothing more than to masturbate while looking into my eyes,” Post said. “Going to his apartment has been the source of shame for the past 30 years, that I allowed myself to be so gullible.”

The women told the newspaper they are telling their stories after multiple women, including Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow, came forward accusing fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. Weinstein was ultimately fired from his own company after the New York Times revealed he paid off at least eight women, including Rose McGowan. The actress later tweeted she was raped by Weinstein.

Toback denied the allegations, telling the Los Angeles Times that he never met or has “no recollection” of meeting the women. He also said it was “biologically impossible” for him to engage in the sexual behavior the women accused him of doing because of the medication he takes for his diabetes and heart condition for the last 22 years.

Parents told WSVN-TV that the party at the Mater Lakes Academy charter school in Miami Wednesday exposed the students -- who were as young as 11 -- to sex-themed party favors.

The mother of a young girl who was an attendee said the party was for a former male student, and when he walked into the classroom “they surprised him with a hat that had a penis attached to the top and a string to be able to pull it . . . ,” the station reported.

She also said the party included a cake that was in the shape of the female form, according to the station.

The station aired snippets of video shot at the party showing the hat and other sexual items. Students who were reported to be members of the school's dance team can be heard singing happy birthday.

“You can’t even imagine,” said the mother, who is also a teacher, WSVN reported. “You know, I’ve raised my daughter the proper way and never taught her anything similar to that.”

The woman told the station her daughter was extremely upset.

Mike Julianelle runs the Instagram account Got Toddlered, where he shares memes and photos featuring “things children have ruined.” But as it turns out, his kids have affected not only his household and his old way of life, but his appearance as well.

FATHER SUPPORTS BREASTFEEDING PARTNER WITH HILARIOUS, SWEET GESTURE

On Oct. 12, Julianelle shared side-by-side photos of himself. One was from 2006, before he had kids, and it shows him looking youthful and rested. In the other one, from 2016, Julianelle appeared unshaven and exhausted.

“Wanna see something REALLY scary? Here’s me, before and after I had kids!” he wrote alongside the images.

The father of two, who has a seven-year-old and almost two-year-old, told HuffPost that after sharing the picture, he got a message from a follower suggesting he ask for submissions from other parents, as well. So Julianelle encouraged everyone to share their “scariest ‘Before and After Kids’ pics” for him to post on the account.

“Let the nightmares begin!” he wrote.



Julianelle has since shared over a dozen before-and-after photos. He said he’s received far more of those submissions than any of the “my toddler destroyed something” memes he previously got.

“Obviously, it’s meant to be lighthearted, and no one is seriously blaming their children for the state of their faces or lives, except for me when I seriously blame my kids for the state of my face and my life, which is basically all I do on my blog and Facebook page and Twitter,” he told HuffPost.

He said he hopes the pictures make people laugh and let parents know they aren’t alone in feeling overwhelmed.

Organizing digital photos takes time and patience, but just follow a few simple steps, and everything should fall nicely into place.

1. Upload your photos to your computer

This should always be your first step. Even in this cloud-based era, most people have a desktop or laptop that serves as their primary computer, and you should dump your images there first.

Mac: The go-to program for Mac is simply called Photos, and it comes free with macOS. Photos works the same way on any Mac, and the photos also save easily to iCloud. Once you’ve attached your camera or inserted a memory card, go to Files >> Import and you should be in business. Photos downloads images directly into the program.

Windows: Unlike Mac, Windows doesn’t have a standard photo editor that everybody uses, but there are plenty of free and powerful options. Microsoft also offers a free photos app, Microsoft Photos, that you can use to import your photos and videos from your camera or phone. You can edit your photos with a wide range of editing tools and create fun slideshows. Click here to get the Microsoft Photos app for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

If you're passionate about photography, you probably love editing photos as much as you love taking them. Photoshop is one of the best editing programs out there, but it's also expensive. Click here for a free alternative that doesn't skimp out on the features you want.

2. Don’t be a photo hoarder

Trigger-happy photographers end up with countless bad pictures. They snap away, not caring about framing or the Rule of Thirds, because they’re just hoping one of those shots ends up perfect.

Luckily, you can delete those extra shots, especially the ones you took to test the exposure or are obscured by your thumb. In fact, you should delete them, not just because they’re embarrassing, but because they clog your hard drive with needless images and make your albums harder to organize.

3. Use face recognition

If you’re using Apple Photos, the face recognition feature is extremely easy to use. Just go to “Faces” and find the row of “Suggested Faces.” Double-click on any of the people you see, and you can confirm or deny which faces belong to that friend or family member. This is an easy way to create albums based on people who are close to you.

Apple doesn’t have the monopoly on face recognition, but many Windows programs require an extra step or an additional plugin.

Tip in a tip: Whether you're attending a wedding, birthday party, family reunion or other special event, one of the best things is sharing the photos you've captured. Rather than email your photos back and forth to each other, click here for a much better method.

4. Add keywords and tags

Looking for a document is easy. Just type its title into your finder, and the document should appear. But images are harder to sift through. How do you make your photos searchable? Change their metadata.

Metadata is basically the hard information that is embedded in every photo, such as the date and location that it was taken. Many photos document the type of camera, lens and exposure, too. Adding keywords and tags makes your photos easier to track down. If you’ve visited the Grand Canyon on several occasions, you can tag all of these with “Grand Canyon,” and you’ll be able to track them all down, even if they’re located in different files.

In Photos, you just click a picture and then hit the “i” icon at the top of the screen. A small window will show you the metadata, and you can instantly add keywords and tags.

When looking at a photo file’s name, you can usually right click for “info.” This will reveal the photo’s metadata, and you can add specific tags there.

5. Create files that are easy to identify

Putting together files is an art because you have to anticipate what photos you’ll be seeking in the future. Keywords help enormously, but sometimes you want to find a whole batch of photos that aren’t exactly related.

You know yourself well, and you know how you’ll end up looking for things. You’ll likely end up putting all the photos from your Cancun vacation in a file marked “Cancun,” and if you travel a lot, the “Cancun” and “Virgin Islands” and “NYC” photos will all end up in a file called “Travel,” and so on.

6. Save the images online

Even if you have plenty of gigabytes available, you’ll want to back up the pictures that you have online. Here are a few ways.

Apple: When you sign up for iCloud, you automatically get 5GB of free storage. If you use all of your iCloud storage, you can buy more, starting at 50GB for $0.99 a month. To see how much iCloud storage you are using, go to Apple menu > System Preferences. Then, select iCloud to view your total and available storage.

Google Drive: This virtual storage site comes with every Google account. Once you open your Gmail, find the features icon in the upper right-hand corner (it looks like nine interlocking squares) and find Google Drive. This will grant you 15 GB of space, which is the equivalent of about 1,500 high-res photos of 10 MB each. Alternatively, use Google Photos, which is designed specifically for images. When uploading, select “High Quality,” and you have unlimited photo storage. These images can be no more than 16 megapixels in size.

Amazon Photos: Among the many perks of an Amazon Prime membership is Prime Photos, which provides unlimited photo storage. The service also offers its own app, which can help you organize your photos on the go. Remember, a Prime membership costs $99, so it’s far from free. But aside from its capacity to organize, Prime Photo is also compatible with Alexa, so you can give commands like, “Play a slideshow,” and “Show me photos of Jane.”

Tip in a tip: Like most people, you probably signed up for Amazon Prime for one reason. Maybe it was the free shipping. Maybe it was the streaming videos or the free music. But even now, several years after Amazon Prime was founded, few people know the full breadth of their membership perks. Click here for a master list of everything you get with your Amazon Prime account.

Flickr: I’m very suspicious of Flickr. Yahoo owns the site and it’s been having epidemic security problems lately. But Flickr helped create the online photo phenomenon, and it’s still a high-quality venue with lots of sharing options. Flickr offers 1TB of storage, which is a colossal amount of space. Like Google Photos, you can easily create physical portraits, photos on canvas and photo books.

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet.

“We thought, maybe others aren’t going. So we called the Bushes, and the elder Bushes were in the hospital, which I think was legitimate,” Clinton said to a laughing crowd.

“We call the younger Bushes, and they said, ‘Yeah, we’re going.’ We then call the Carters and they said, ‘Yeah, we’re going.’ So Bill and I looked at each other and said, ‘Well, we gotta go,” Clinton said, adding “ugh, my gosh!”

The former Democratic presidential candidate recalled not knowing what to expect before attending Trump’s inauguration, referring back to what she wrote in her book, “What Happened,"" about that morning.

“What I wanted to have happen [at the inauguration] was despite the kind of campaign he ran, I wanted [Trump] to rise to the occasion of being our president and being the president for everybody, not just people who supported him,” she said.

But she was left disappointed, Clinton said. She said Trump’s inauguration speech was “dark and divisive” and was a “cry from the white nationalist’s gut.”

“I was so disappointed. Really, so sad that it wasn’t an outreach but it was a narrowing and a hammering of what he had said before,” Clinton said.

“And it was reported that George W. Bush, as it ends, says, ‘That was some weird s—t,” she recalled with a laugh, to which Norton replied, “And it was.”

Clinton was a guest on the show as she continues to promote her book. She was seen with a surgical boot on stage after she broke her toe days earlier. She praised the care she received under England’s health care system. Clinton also revealed she “ignores” most of Trump’s tweets because “there are so many of them.” She admitted she responds when she feels like Trump’s tweets were “hurtful and unfair and really causing problems for people.”

She added, “The most dangerous thing he does is conduct diplomacy on Twitter,” such as trading insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Her memories included begging her father to take her to the local firemen’s carnivals, ice cream and hiking, according to a report Sunday in her hometown newspaper, the York Daily Record.

“So much of my childhood and even 20s were spent in York County; it has shaped me, and my fond memories helped to brighten some of the dark days,” Coleman, 31, wrote in an email Saturday, according to the paper.

Her husband says she was rushed to a hospital Monday but she told the paper she wasn’t ready to talk about her hospitalization, noting only that she hoped to be discharged soon and that the Canadian medical system was ""doing a pretty good job"" treating her.

She also said she wasn’t ready to talk about what she, her husband and their children went through during their captivity.

The paper reported that Coleman likened some of her interactions with the media to prison. She said the attention has led to scrutiny, negativity and pressure to speak before she was comfortable.

“Why don’t I have the right to just be myself and be with my husband and children?” she wrote, according to the paper.

""Everybody says 'No, you have to come out and talk about it', but no, no I don't and everybody nice has said it's my choice and I can talk when I want, and to whom I want,"" Coleman wrote.

The paper reported that her husband Joseph Boyle initiated the exchange.

Coleman, her Canadian husband and their three children were rescued Oct. 11 by Pakistani troops, five years after the couple was abducted in Afghanistan on a backpacking trip. The children were born in captivity.

Boyle said after landing at Toronto's airport that the Taliban-linked Haqqani network killed an infant daughter and raped his wife during the years they were held.

In prior email exchange with The Associated Press, Boyle did not respond to a question about the fourth child, but later told Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that it was a forced abortion. The Taliban said in a statement it was a miscarriage.

Boyle told the Daily Record that he believed his wife would enjoy speaking about her memories of home.

She told the paper she spent most of her childhood and early 20s in York County and was homeschooled.

“Good times and great timesare not forgotten, even now,” Coleman said in the emails.

Her father told the paper his daughter’s rescue was a “blessing.”

Jim Coleman gave credit to President Trump for his daughter's release, as well as to the Obama administration for aiding and working on getting his daughter and her family freed over the last several years, the paper reported.

He recalled how his daughter always wanted him to take her to the local carnivals.

""She always wanted me to win a bear,"" he said.

The same may well happen—or be happening—with Donald Trump.

One reason is that there is no hard constituency in America for political incompetence, and that is what he continues to demonstrate.

The first sign of political competence is knowing where you stand with the people. Gallup this week had him at 36 percent approval, 59 percent disapproval.

Well, besides being reasonable activities for a night out in Atlantic City, officials who help prepare specific sports for Olympic recognition apparently think they could soon take their place alongside running, gymnastics and ski jumping in the world’s most prestigious athletic competition.

Seriously.

The Switzerland-based Global Association of International Sports Federations earlier this month granted observer status to the International Federation of (Match) Poker, the International Pole Sports Federation and International Table Soccer Federation along with the organizing bodies for four other nontraditional sports — the first step toward joining the Olympic program.

“We warmly welcome our first Observers,” Patrick Baumann, the president of GAISF, said in a statement. “This is an exciting time for them and for us and we will do everything within our remit to help them realize their full potential as International Federations within the global sport’s family and, one day, maybe become part of the Olympic program.”

Baumann added: “The new sports debuting at Tokyo 2020 and at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics are evidence that the pathway is there.”

Joining the program in Tokyo in two years will be softball, karate, surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing and baseball — the games’ second shot at Olympic status. These sports were chosen, especially skateboarding and sport climbing, in part to reflect the changing interest in younger athletes and the worldwide popularity of these sports.

""Through these additional events, the Tokyo 2020 Games aims to inspire new generations and become a turning point and a model for future Olympic Games,” Yoshiro Mori, the president of the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said in a statement.

But pole dancing, foosball, aka “table soccer,” and poker?

These barroom pursuits, along with dodgeball, foot golf, kettlebell lifting and the previously mentioned sports, now all have the same status as sports like baseball and surfing once had.

Under the GAISF, observer status allows new sport to grow its base while being guided by the federation toward the requirements of membership, such as receiving the required recognitions by National Olympic Committees, increasing their membership and becoming compliant with the regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

And for aspiring poker Olympians, don’t worry, cigarettes and watered-down cocktails are so far not on the list of banned “performance-enhancing drugs.”

So now that they’ve taken the first steps toward Olympic gold, when – or, more importantly, will – these sports make their debuts in the Olympics?

Before anything else happens, the sport needs to be practiced by men in 75 countries on four continents and by women in 40 countries on three continents be considered for the Olympics.

So the men’s division of pole dancing – surely equality demands that there be a men’s division – may run into some issues there.

Besides these stipulations, poker may face the same challenge imposed on chess by the International Olympic Committee with its ban on purely “mind sports.”

And even if dodgeball, foot golf, kettleball lifting, table soccer and arm wrestling can pass these tests, the IOC has worked in recent years to manage the scope of the games by only permitting new sports to join when others are discontinued. Meaning that these athletes might have to wait for sports like curling and table tennis to go the way of tug-of-war and water skiing.","Olympics may soon feature pole dancing, foosball and poker",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/18/olympics-may-soon-feature-pole-dancing-foosball-and-poker.html

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts.
And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

Brandon Bloom, 8, of South Setauket, on Long Island, became an NHL athlete for a day, Newsday reported.

The boy was diagnosed with Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma last year. He has been undergoing chemotherapy and will be done with his treatment in August 2018.

The special day was set up by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Random Acts of Light Campaign. The campaign’s mission is to “bring light to the darkness of cancer and create awareness for the critical need to find new treatments and cures for blood cancer patients,” according to its website.

Bloom called the day at the Northwell Health Ice Center in East Meadow “a dream come true” and revealed he was scared at first but “had a lot of fun.”

Bloom was given ice skates and a custom-made jersey with his name stitched on the back, ABC 7 reported.

The boy was able to perform drills on the ice and shoot a hockey puck with the team’s players. Bloom also scored a goal, which prompted the Islanders to celebrate around their new teammate. One of the players, Casey Cizikas, wrapped up the puck Bloom shot with tape and wrote on it “1st NHL goal” before giving it to the boy.

With its recent announcement that it will admit girls, the Boy Scouts organization has not simply shown a profound disregard for its admirable roots. It has further abandoned boys to a culture that values them less and less.

Dressed in the language of equality and fairness, the move by the Boy Scouts may seem harmless enough. But I believe it’s unhelpful at best and damaging at worst – to both boys and girls.

However much some may wish it were otherwise, the reality is that males and females are fundamentally different in many ways – physically, emotionally and in their relationships. Pretending otherwise in the name of progress or permissiveness might be culturally acceptable, but it does both sexes a disservice.

Sadly, the Boy Scouts appear to have bought into the idea that rather than being something to be celebrated and championed, boyhood is something to be watered down.

One of those differences, in most cases, is the way boys and girls learn. Girls are more likely to do well in the quiet control of a classroom, while boys squirm and struggle.

Daring, action and competition – potential strengths that rival focus, reflection, and consensus – are qualities that need to be fostered and filtered. Boys know that rough-and-tumble play – like playing with squirt guns and laser tag – does just that. Restrictions on this are alienating and downplay the natural tendencies of boys.

Boys need strong male role models. They also need a place for adventure and opportunities to test themselves in pursuit of awards that challenge and channel their innate drive and daring. In this way they can be helped to grow into men of true strength, real character, and genuine conviction – not Hollywood’s distorted version of manhood.

Sadly, the Boy Scouts appear to have bought into the idea that rather than being something to be celebrated and championed, boyhood is something to be watered down. They are discounting a historically male-focused experience that made presidents, astronauts and leaders of mere men. Indeed, making the inclusivity announcement on the International Day of the Girl Child could be considered the ultimate put-down.

Indeed, I believe one of the main reasons we see the sort of indefensible behavior by men in power – like the actions Harvey Weinstein is accused of – is a lack of the kind of mentoring and coaching that models true manhood.

Don’t misunderstand: I’m not inferring that girls are lesser or inferior. The Boy Scouts message is actually that boys are lesser and inferior because their uniqueness needs to be denied rather than directed, stifled rather than strengthened.

While I’m clarifying something, let me also emphasize that my conviction that we must provide space for “boys to be boys” does not mean I’m advocating a breeding ground for a future generation of sexual predators.

Indeed, I believe one of the main reasons we see the sort of indefensible behavior by men in power – like the actions Harvey Weinstein is accused of – is a lack of the kind of mentoring and coaching that models true manhood.

I’m talking about instilling in today’s boys a culture of respect, honor and integrity. Properly guided, the drive and daring tendencies in boys will lead them to become the determined, focused, winning men of tomorrow who appreciate the uniqueness and dignity of women.

You don’t have to look too far to see that at every level of society we are losing ground in areas as basic as kindness, self-control, respect, honor and purity. These should be taught and modeled for boys in an atmosphere designed for their unique temperament under the tutelage of men with the mettle to guide, alongside their peers.

Robert Baden-Powell would not now recognize the organization he founded in 1910. But while the Boy Scouts may have lost their way, they are not alone. They are just another group favoring trendy political correctness over time-honored principled convictions.

The results of all this are sadly too evident when it comes to our sons. Boys are losing out in any number of categories, from heightened special education involvement and ADHD diagnoses to lower high school rankings and college attendance.

While my dismay at the Boy Scouts decision centers on what this means for boys, I am also concerned about its impact on girls. What’s bad for the gander is equally bad for the goose.

Girls, though wired differently, equally need an environment that caters to their unique traits and qualities. You can’t deliver a program at a character-changing level with any real effectiveness in the same style to two different types of learners.

As Baden-Powell observed: “Girls should … take a real and not a visionary share in the welfare of the nation.”

But they shouldn’t be squeezed into a Boy Scout uniform.

“Jemele Hill has been suspended for two weeks for a second violation of our social media guidelines.
As for Twitter, she said she will be back on the social media site.","ESPN anchor Jemele Hill said on Saturday she “deserved a suspension” from the sports network after she called for fans to boycott the NFL and called President Trump a “white supremacist” on Twitter, two days before she is set to return to work.

Hill told TMZ Sports in an impromptu interview at Los Angeles International Airport that she put “ESPN in a bad spot.”

“ESPN acted what they felt was right. I don’t have any argument,” Hill told TMZ Sports. ""After my Donald Trump tweets, I deserved a suspension.”

She said, ""I violated the policy. Going forward we'll be in a good, healthy place.""

Hill is set to return to work after she was suspended for two weeks when she violated the network’s social media guidelines for the second time, ESPN announced on Oct. 9.

“Jemele Hill has been suspended for two weeks for a second violation of our social media guidelines. She previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet. In the aftermath, all employees were reminded of how much individual tweets may reflect negatively on ESPN and that such action would have consequences. Hence this decision,” a network spokesman said in a statement.

“ESPN acted what they felt was right. I don’t have any argument."" - Jemele Hill

Hill bashed Trump on Twitter on Sept. 11, calling him a “white supremacist who has surrounded himself with other white supremacists. She continued her rant by saying Trump was “the most ignorant, offensive president of [her] lifetime,” a “bigot” and “unqualified and unfit to be president.”

She added, “If he were not white, he never would have been elected.”

Her tweets caught the attention of Trump and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who said the rhetoric was a “fireable offense” and demanded an apology. Hill issued an apology and said her tweets were her “personable beliefs” that “painted ESPN in an unfair light.”

But the outspoken liberal anchor continued her controversial comments on the social media site on Oct. 8 when she said Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones “created a problem for his players, specifically the black ones” in the NFL kneeling controversy. Jones said the NFL and the Cowboys were “going to stand up for the flag” after Vice President Mike Pence left an Indianapolis Colts game when several players kneeled during the national anthem.

“If they don't kneel, some will see them as sellouts,” Hill said.

“By drawing a line in the sand, Jerry put his players under more scrutiny and threw them under the bus... If the rationale behind JJ's stance is keeping the fan base happy, make him see that he is underestimated how all of his fan base feels,” Hill wrote on Twitter, adding that “paying customers” should “boycott” Jones’ advertisers.

Hill told TMZ Sports on Saturday that the time off was “reflective” and she was “grateful” for her supporters, including Al Sharpton and Rosie O’Donnell, who based the network for suspending her.

“I’m thankful for them but I’m happy to be back,” Hill said.

“Me and ESPN are fine…We are fine. We are in a good place. I’m happy to be back on the network,” she added.

""She didn’t think she had a future with Frank.
She didn’t think they had a stable enough environment to have a family.
It was a big tragedy for both of them.”According to Tina, Gardner later wondered what the couple could have done differently.","When Ava Gardner first met Frank Sinatra in 1943, the duo couldn’t have suspected that six years later, after the actress faced two disastrous divorces before the age of 25, they would happily dive into a controversial love affair.

Anthony Uzarowski and Kendra Bean, who chronicled the Academy Award-nominated star’s life and career in a coffee table book titled “Ava: A Life in Movies,” weren’t completely shocked by how quickly the romance formed between the two stars.

“I think she was really determined to find someone who would give her the kind of security and the kind of happiness that her parents had known,” Uzarowski told Fox News about the North Carolina-born Gardner’s quest for love. “She always wanted that. And I think she found that in Frank.”

However, there was one complication: Sinatra was still married to his longtime sweetheart Nancy Barbato. But that didn’t stop Gardner or Sinatra from seeing each other. Uzarowski claimed Gardner’s well publicized beauty proved too irresistible for the blue-eyed crooner.

“He… had already been married to Nancy for many years and I think he was just really getting tired of that,” he explained. “He didn’t really want that anymore. He wanted to break away… So I think they were both ready for each other… they just really plunged, immersed themselves into this affair… not really caring what anyone thought… They just wanted to be with each other.”

Sinatra may have still been married, but an insistent Gardner reportedly made the singer ask Nancy for a divorce. The mother of his three young children initially refused, but she eventually granted Sinatra a divorce in 1951. One week after his divorce was final, Sinatra married Gardner.

“I don’t think [Frank] wanted to hurt Nancy,” said Uzarowski. “But at the same time, I don’t think he went out of his way to hide [the affair]. They did get into quite a lot of trouble with the public. There were angry letters, hate mail coming in every week to the studio.

""Frank’s records were being burned. There was a huge backlash… it didn’t hurt Ava’s career too badly. Because she had this image of a man-eating femme fatale in movies. Her films actually became more successful. It did certainly hurt Frank’s reputation. His records weren’t selling at all. He was really hitting rock bottom.”

A post shared by Ava Lavinia Gardner (@avagardnerdaily) on Jun 25, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT

Despite the scandal, which reportedly even brought the condemnation of the Roman Catholic Church, Gardner managed to captivate another Sinatra: youngest daughter Tina. Uzarowski and Bean had a two-hour conversation with the now 69-year-old about the bond she developed with her stepmother.

“She really liked Ava,” said Uzarowski. “She could have had a very bad attitude towards Ava because she basically stole her father away from her mother. She could have been resentful. But there was none of that… Tina and Nancy were both very friendly with Ava.”

There’s one memory that Tina can still vividly recall.

“The first time she met Ava, when she was a little girl of 4 or 5, Ava got down on her knees so she [could] have eye contact with her,” said Uzarowski. “And she really treated her with a lot of attention and a lot of warmth. That obviously really impressed her as a child. She still remembered that after all of these years.”

Still, Gardner and Sinatra wouldn’t share a happily ever after. Their marriage was plagued by jealousy, fiery tempers and insecurity. They also publicly battled. The relationship was reportedly so tumultuous that Gardner had two abortions during their marriage, which she later publicly admitted.

“She always believed, and this is something she [later] wrote in her autobiography, that in order to have a family, she would have to make sure she had a very secure home and a secure marriage,” explained Uzarowski. “She really didn’t think she had that. So in her mind, bringing a child into the world would be unfair.

""She didn’t think she had a future with Frank. She didn’t think they had a stable enough environment to have a family. So as far as we know, that’s why she did it… It was certainly a great tragedy to both of them. When Frank found out, he was broken hearted. And I think later on, Ava probably regretted it as well. It was a big tragedy for both of them.”

According to Tina, Gardner later wondered what the couple could have done differently.

The marriage lasted for less than two years. In 1953, MGM announced their separation. Then in 1957, Gardner and Sinatra were divorced. However, they apparently never got over each other. There were even rumors of a possible reconciliation.

Gardner would move on and live a quiet life in London for more than 30 years, seeking salvation from the paparazzi. She never remarried.

One of Sinatra’s biggest tragedies would come in 1990 when Gardner died at age 67 of pneumonia.

“[Tina] said it was such a huge blow to him,” said Uzarowski. “She said he never got over it… It was such a huge shock to him. She was the love of his life, by all accounts. When she did pass away, he was devastated.

A post shared by Ava Lavinia Gardner (@avagardnerdaily) on Mar 18, 2017 at 2:47pm PDT

""Tina said the actual pain he experienced was so much more. He wouldn’t share that with anyone because it was too personal… There was a story that Nancy said in another book that he just locked himself in a room for 24 hours… and wouldn’t speak to anyone.”

Tina also revealed Gardner would always hold a special place in Sinatra’s heart.

“Ava gave Frank this medallion, a charm he wore for the rest of his life,” said Uzarowski. “It was Saint Francis. Because Ava always called him Francis. It was a tiny picture of Saint Francis on one side and another of Ava on the other side. He always kept that.”

We have the ability to promote and protect religious freedom both here and abroad – just remember that!","“How times have changed. But you know what? Now they’re changing back again, just remember that!” Nothing encapsulates President Trump’s message at the recent Values Voter Summit more than those words.

When the president addressed the summit last weekend in Washington, religious liberty was front and center in his speech. Perhaps more than any other president in recent history, he chose to squarely address the issue and not shy away from the social conservative base.

“In America, we don't worship government – we worship God,” President Trump boldly proclaimed. “We defend our Constitution. We protect religious liberty. We treasure our freedom.”

The president continued: “Religious liberty is enshrined in the very first amendment of the Bill of Rights. And we all pledge allegiance to … one nation under God. This is America’s heritage, a country that never forgets that we are all are – all, every one of us – made by the same God in Heaven.” Indeed. Let us not forget this.

Values Voter Summit attendees were thrilled to see the president promote religious freedom in his speech. But even more significant than his words are his actions – policies that reflect the promises he made during the election campaign.

President Trump mentioned three clear steps he has taken to protect religious liberty domestically. The message to socially conservative voters was clear, and they will not forget it.

· He signed an executive order to ensure the Johnson Amendment does not interfere with the First Amendment and “allow government workers to censor sermons or target our pastors or our ministers or rabbis.” The Johnson amendment, named after then-senator and future president Lyndon Johnson, was made a provision of the U.S. tax code in 1954. It bars most nonprofit organizations, including religious institutions, from endorsing or opposing political candidates.

· His Justice Department issued guidance explaining how religious liberty should be protected.

· He took “action to protect the conscience rights of groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor,” observing that “the Little Sisters of the Poor and other people of faith, they live by a beautiful calling, and we will not let bureaucrats take away that calling or take away their rights.” The nuns challenged an ObamaCare mandate that insurance plans must cover contraception.

True, religious freedom was not as much of a concern domestically until policies from the Obama administration and the courts placed the freedom to live according to our beliefs in the political crosshairs. Historically, politicians made promises to gain the important evangelical vote but rarely delivered with actual policies. The Trump administration is breaking with history and is laboring to keep its commitments.

President Trump went on in his remarks to specifically mention the importance of faith and religion in public life 19 times – not counting references to the idea by other terms. He quoted George Washington in noting “that ‘religion and morality are indispensable’ to America’s happiness, really, prosperity and totally to its success. It is our faith and our values that inspires us to give with charity, to act with courage, and to sacrifice for what we know is right.”

The president observed that the “American Founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence,” and “Benjamin Franklin reminded his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention to begin by bowing their heads in prayer.”

In an era when public prayer and displays of faith are so readily attacked, social conservatives were heartened to hear this reaffirmation of the role religion has played – and is still playing – for the public good of our country.

That the president recognizes the important social role of institutions of faith is a welcome turn from the Obama administration.

The Obama administration irrationally insisted on harassing the Little Sisters of the Poor and other faith-based groups, including threatening them with tens of millions of dollars in fines unless they yielded to the Department of Health and Human Services’ ObamaCare contraception mandate.

Yet the Federal Emergency Management Agency continues to deny disaster assistance to churches simply because they are religious institutions. Work still needs to be done to ensure that our First Amendment and the new Justice Department religious liberty guidance is followed –both with regard to the FEMA policy and in other areas.

One of these other areas is the Middle East. As the president recognized, ISIS has “ruthlessly slaughtered innocent Christians, along with the vicious killing of innocent Muslims and other religious minorities,” and “repressive regimes” must “restore political and religious freedom for their people.”

While a genocide in the Middle East has been recognized, assistance has been slower in coming. Under U.S. policy, Christians are still being funneled through United Nations-run refugee camps in the Middle East. At these camps – as if they were not already traumatized enough by barely escaping genocide – the Christians are regularly subject to violence and mistreatment at the hands of Islamists.

This can change by directing U.S. assistance away from the U.N. and to organizations providing aid directly to these Christian communities. We must do more on this issue. If the government of Hungary can devote financial assistance and a high-level government post to this specific concern, the United States should be able to do so too.

Yes, a lot changed over the last eight years. America went from being a zealous advocate of religious freedom and human rights for all people, to being a promoter of special rights for a few. But you know what? Now those times are changing back again. We have the ability to promote and protect religious freedom both here and abroad – just remember that!",Trump is a great champion of religious liberty -- a welcome change from Obama,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/trump-is-great-champion-religious-liberty-welcome-change-from-obama.html

In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, we fight to understand a murderer's motive. And many times we hear the words 'pure evil' to describe the act of lone gunman Stephen Paddock.

These troubles are not new, and did not begin with President Trump.
John Kelly reminded us what dignity, honor and truthfulness looks like, and how they can illuminate that darkness.","On Thursday, John Kelly reminded the country what dignity looks like. In a hushed White House briefing room, President Trump’s chief of staff recounted that most painful of human experiences, the loss of a child. The former general spoke of the circumstances under which the bodies of fallen soldiers are returned to their families, how their loved ones are told of their heartbreaking loss, what it is like to deliver the most devastating news imaginable.

He solemnly described how Marine General Joseph Dunford had delivered the news that his own son had been killed in Afghanistan. And how he had recently visited Arlington Cemetery to visit the graves of Marines who died under his own watch. He said these things with grace and dignity.

It was impossible to watch the retired four-star general without feeling at once inspired but also discouraged that so much of what consumes the public these days is petty and inconsequential. Even somber personal tragedies like the death of a soldier can be hijacked by those looking to score political points. The constant back-and-forth of “gotcha” journalism – the kind of story that, in fact, inspired John Kelly’s address to the press corps – drives headlines and delivers “clicks” but also helps create today’s toxic discourse. And yes, it comes from both sides and I do not absolve myself.

It also comes from our leaders. President Trump has been derided endlessly for his lack of decorum, his inability to resist tweet-storming critics and telling whoppers about topics important and unimportant. But President Obama taking selfies at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service or jumping into a golf cart minutes after declaring himself “heartbroken” over ISIS’ savage beheading of James Foley isn’t dignified either.

Nor is Hillary Clinton yelling “At this point what difference does it make?” at the committee investigating the lies told about the deaths in Benghazi.

It was impossible to watch the retired four-star general without feeling at once inspired but also discouraged that so much of what consumes the public these days is petty and inconsequential.

Don’t even get me started linking Bill, Monica Lewinsky and the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. This piece is supposed to be about dignity.

How do we turn this around? President George W. Bush lamented the “casual cruelty” of today’s public discourse, in a recent speech widely interpreted as a rebuke to President Trump. At the same forum, President Obama piled on, saying “What we can’t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before that dates back centuries.”

It might be helpful if both those gentlemen acknowledged that they bear some responsibility for those widening political fault lines. Donald Trump was not elected by accident; Americans were angry over Obama’s aggressive identity politics and progressive agenda of the past eight years, and by the financial crisis overseen by Bush.

They were angry that their prospects had stagnated for over a decade. For years, America’s workers have been slighted as our leaders pursued global ambitions and forgot to tend the home fires. Bush can bemoan the “fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade” but that value seems slight to an out-of-work steel maker in Pennsylvania. As Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently wrote in an oped published in the Wall Street Journal, “China’s tariffs are higher than those of the U.S. in 20 of the 22 major categories of goods. Europe imposes higher tariffs than the U.S. in 17 of 22 categories…” Our leaders have not been paying attention. It would help if Chuck Schumer, Rand Paul and so many others could stop posturing long enough to place the good of their countrymen about political one-upmanship.

There are important issues facing the country, but these folks have no sense of urgency, other than appeasing their funders and scoring political points. The battle over health care is dire for millions of Americans, but rather than work together to fix ObamaCare, which every sane person can acknowledge is deeply flawed, our politicians spend their time making sure they are not blamed for soaring premiums and ever-narrower choices.

These troubles are not new, and did not begin with President Trump. Those of us who follow current events intently do not often look up and survey a wide landscape. When we do, the horizon can appear dark.

John Kelly reminded us what dignity, honor and truthfulness looks like, and how they can illuminate that darkness.

President Obama had all of this information at his disposal before he made a deal releasing Bergdahl.
With this exchange and the elevation of Bergdahl’s rank, the president compromised national security knowingly and willfully.
This, of course, wasn’t the first time President Obama allowed politics to determine a course of ethical behavior, but it may be among the most egregious examples.
One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or Obama.","The admission is in; the sentence awaits us. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl admitted deserting his Afghan post and endangering fellow troops. By all accounts this is the most serious betrayal of presidential authority in my life time.

In 2014 President Obama attempted to cover Bergdahl with the achievement of a war hero, even inviting his Idaho based parents to the Rose Garden to celebrate news of his release. President Obama pointed out at the time that five Taliban leaders were freed from Guantanamo so that Bergdahl could be released from captivity. To gild the lily, National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, said Bergdahl served “the United States with honor and distinction.”

Yet everyone in the White House and the Pentagon knew this was a lie with monumental implications. In fact, Army officials refused to list Bergdahl as a POW. An internal 2009 Army report found that he walked off his post on more than one occasion and even said he wanted to join the ranks of the enemy. This report also noted he shipped his laptop back to Idaho with a note expressing his disillusionment with the American position in the war.

President Obama had all of this information at his disposal before he made a deal releasing Bergdahl. Why then did he mislead the American people? The answer can be found in the president’s desire to satisfy antiwar liberals keen on emptying Gitmo. At the Rose Garden event the president admitted as much when he said, “We’re committed to winding down the war in Afghanistan and closing Gitmo.” It is instructive that the CIA has evidence at least three of the released Taliban leaders have returned to the battlefield.

One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or Obama.

With this exchange and the elevation of Bergdahl’s rank, the president compromised national security knowingly and willfully. Although Bergdahl will not receive capital punishment when his sentence is determined, he probably should be tried as a traitor whose actions led directly to three soldiers seriously injured during search and rescue missions to find him. But if this fiasco is linked to American injuries and, perhaps deaths, one might well ask if the commander in chief should be held accountable as well.

The president’s dissimulation clearly violated the military code and has had a profound effect on morale. Those I know in the military invariably ask how a president could honor a deserter when he was fully aware of his prior actions. This, of course, wasn’t the first time President Obama allowed politics to determine a course of ethical behavior, but it may be among the most egregious examples. One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or Obama. With a political ecology in which standards have been debased, many have attempted to rationalize President Obama’s decision. In my judgment, however, his actions that jeopardized national security should be fully investigated and, where blame exists, the full weight of public opinion should be employed to condemn the president and his assistants.",Bowe Bergdahl deal compromised US national security and President Obama should be held accountable,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/22/bowe-bergdahl-deal-compromised-us-national-security-and-president-obama-should-be-held-accountable.html

The fossilized remains of what are believed to be great ape teeth, an upper right first molar and an upper left canine, were found a little over a year ago near the town of Eppelsheim in southwestern Germany in sediments that date back 10 million years.

“It’s perfectly preserved. It actually looks like a new excellent tooth; however, it’s no longer white. It’s shining like amber,” Herbert Lutz, head of the excavation team and deputy museum director at the Mainz Natural History Museum, told USA Today.

Lutz said that the discovery is groundbreaking for its potential to alter our understanding of how humans developed and migrated in prehistoric times.

“I don’t want to over-dramatize it, but I would hypothesize that we shall have to start rewriting the history of mankind after today,” Mainz Mayor Michael Ebling told reporters during a press conference this week announcing the discovery, reports the Times of Israel.

According to researchers, our current understanding is that hominins, our extinct human ancestors, left Africa about 120,000 years ago. The discovered remains are significantly older.

“We have comparable finds only in East Africa…but they are only 2, 3, 4 or 5 million years old, and Eppelsheim is almost 10,” said Matz. “So the question is: What has happened? We don’t know where this great ape came from. We do not have comparable finds from southern Europe.”

Although the scientist made the discovery in September 2016, they were so confused by what they’d found they waited until this month to release a report about it.

As of now, it is not known where the teeth fit in humankind’s family tree. However, Lutz and his team of researchers are only just beginning to fully examine their unique find.

Eventually, John’s love for colorful sock flair became an inspiration, and in December 2016, John’s Crazy Socks, an online one-stop sock shop, opened for business. From food-inspired knee highs to canine crew socks, John’s Crazy Sock’s now boasts over 1,300 pairs of fun, funky socks. Since opening, business has been booming.

“We are on a mission to spread happiness, and we are spreading that message through socks,” says Mark X. Cronin.

Each order is shipped out the same day which includes John’s story, often a hand written note by John, some candy and two discount cards - “one for you and one to give to a friend.”

Like any startup, John’s Crazy Socks ran into its fair share of challenges. Initially, manufacturers refused to do business with a startup that had no track record.

“I think there was an assumption on many that this was a quaint, little business, you were doing part time and on the side. When they find out, in our first year, we are going to do $1.2 to $1.3 million dollars, that makes people sit up,” says Mark X. Cronin. “Which I would suggest is pretty good for a startup.”

The nine-month old company has been recognized by local organizations, John and Mark recently completed the prestigious business accelerator MassChallenge, and have shipped socks to former president George H.W. Bush, comedian Kevin James and Houston Texans defensive end JJ Watt.

More than profit, John and Mark are dedicated to giving back. 5% of their sales go to charity, like the National Down syndrome Society, and they carry specialty socks for causes like Autism Awareness. In addition, John and Mark’s staff include employees who have a disability.

“We are demonstrating that by working with people with special needs they become an asset, they become a reason for our success, not a liability, not an obstacle. We had to overcome that,” says Mark X. Cronin.

“It feels good knowing that I got a full day of work and I can go home and I am happy” says Elyssa, a sock picker at John’s Crazy Socks.

“It really shows that you can do anything you want, anything,” echoes Alex, a sock picker at John’s Crazy Socks.

The team recently expanded, now headquartered in a 6,400 square foot warehouse and office in Melville, New York. John spends his days working with fellow employees, packing orders, making phone calls and coming up with unique initiatives like the “Monday Madness Mystery Bag” and a sock-of-the-month club. Mark and John also make it a priority to keep their fans informed via John’s social media channels.

Barnard also claimed her mother, who was present at the photo shoot, arranged the ordeal. The artist believed her mother was paid to walk away from the incident so she could pay for a Ph.D.

“After it happened, I didn't say anything to anyone. I wish that I had been brave enough to speak out, tell a friend, their parent or even a teacher,” the artist wrote. “Maybe if I had, the other girls wouldn't have been molested by Polanski (a convicted statutory rapist) also. That's a terrible heartache to carry.”

Barnard asked online users to sign the petition to have Polanski’s board membership revoked from the Academy. More than 12,500 people have signed the petition as of early Saturday afternoon.

She said the petition was motivated by the Academy's decision last week to expel disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein from the board following a string of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against the movie mogul.

“It is a small consequence for him considering his crimes and the great amount of harm he has caused me and his other victims,” Barnard wrote.

Barnard listed the four other women who have come forward with sexual misconduct allegations against the contentious director.

“We've stayed silent until now. We feared. But, we can no longer be silent and allow this man who sexually assaulted little girls to enjoy fame, recognition or an honored place in history,” Barnard wrote.

Barnard is the latest woman to come forward with allegations against the Oscar-winning director. Earlier this month, Renate Langer, a German woman, said she was assaulted by Polanski when she was a teenager in 1972.

In August, another woman, who identified herself only as Robin, said the director sexually victimized her in 1973 when she was 16.

Polanski, 84, served 42 days in prison before fleeing to France from the U.S. after pleading guilty to having unlawful sex with a minor in California. His victim, Samantha Geimer, was 13 at the time.

Geimer said Polanski drugged, raped and sodomized her at “Chinatown” actor Jack Nicholson’s Hollywood Hills home in 1977.

This summer, Geimer asked a Los Angeles judge to drop the 40 year old case against Polanski, who can only travel between France, Switzerland and Poland.

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water. Do not use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning products on a clay pot.",Essential cleaning tips for the 7 most popular cookware materials,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/essential-cleaning-tips-for-7-most-popular-cookware-materials.html

“My wife and I have been passionate about education being a gateway for upward mobility and equality,” Long told The Associated Press. “I think we can all agree that equity in education can help affect change that we all want to see in this country.”

Long signed a two-year, $4.5 million contract with the Eagles, including a $500,000 signing bonus and $1.5 million guaranteed. His base salary in 2017 is $1 million.

The charitable initiative encourages people to make donations to improve equal education opportunities. Long began his career in St. Louis in 2008 and played for the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots last season. Long’s foundation has selected four organizations whose missions focus on making education easily accessible to underserved youth while also providing students the support they need to develop strong social and emotional character.

The four organizations are based in the three communities in which Long has played during his NFL career. The city that raises the most money during the season will receive an additional $50,000 donation.

“There’s a lot of opportunities to help out and they’re wonderful organizations,” Long said. “We have such a great platform as football players and hopefully fans get behind it.”

Long grew up in Charlottesville and starred in high school at St. Anne’s-Belfield before going to the University of Virginia. He was moved to start the scholarship program following the violent protests in Charlottesville in August.

The tech company recently tested a feature that showed users how many calories they would burn walking from point A to point B, along with a note that equated those calories to mini cupcakes. For example, as Buzzfeed pointed out in one example, a four and a half mile walk would burn around 406 calories: “that’s almost 4 mini cupcakes,” the app reads, alongside a pink cupcake graphic.

The feature also included additional info about how those numbers were calculated. “The average person burns 90 Calories by walking 1 mile. To help put that into perspective, we’ve estimated how many desserts your walk would burn. One mini cupcake is around 110 Calories.”

Google began testing this feature with some iPhone users about a week ago, but not everyone was happy with it. While some welcomed it as motivation to walk rather than take a car or public transit, others accused it of being potentially harmful to those with an eating disorder, pointing out that an obsession with calorie-counting can be a warning sign. There was also no opt-out option available, forcing anyone who used the app to see the built-in feature.

""This is reinforcing behaviors that we’re trying to stop when we're treating a patient for an eating disorder,"" Michelle Lupkin, Ph.D., clinical director of the Eating Disorders Program at Montefiore Medical Center, tells SELF. And, according to Jennifer J. Thomas, Ph.D., codirector of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, using exercise as a way to compensate for calories consumed is a hallmark of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, SELF reports.

In addition to the potentially harmful side effects of the feature, as the Washington Post points out, Google’s measurements of both calories burned and calories per cupcake were questionable. People burn calories at differing rates depending on a number of factors, such as weight and speed at which they’re walking, as Harvard Medical School notes.

Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, joined the Brian Kilmeade Show today to discuss the importance of passing the budget today so we can move forward with tax reform. Listen to the full interview below:

Chairman Brady on the importance of the budget passing today's vote:

It means everything. This is, the budget gives us the runway to land tax reform on in a big, bold way. Secondly, and I think most importantly, it makes sure that no party including the democrats can obstruct tax reform from getting to the president's desk this year. So it's very simple. No budget, no tax reform. And from a timing standpoint, once that budget is reconciled between the house and senate it's signed, sealed and delivered within 24 hours. We're going to bring forward the Republican tax reform plan and for the first time in 31 years we're going to start action on it.

Chairman Brady responding to Joe Manchin saying he could get six to eight democrats:

I think we do have a lot of common ground with Democrats like Joe Manchin. They want a strong middle class tax cut. They want to stop seeing our jobs go overseas, in fact we want to see them come back here, we deliver exactly that. I wouldn't raise that business rate because it just gives an advantage to China and Europe and our competitors, but I want to continue to work with democrats on how we make our businesses more competitive, especially our main street businesses. You know those small businesses on average they make about $75,000 a year. They work their fingers to the bone. It is a tough slog and they're hiring a lot of our workers. We're continuing in the House in the Ways and Means Committee to continue to work to provide even more help for our smaller business.

Chairman Brady on what's at stake today with the budget vote:

Everything. In my view. One, it's the direction of this country. We cannot stay saddled with this current tax code. We're losing jobs right and left. We've got to change. Secondly, for Republicans you know, how hard is it for us to unite behind President Trump and deliver on our promises? Especially on tax reform. And I think Republicans are not going to disappoint. We are going to get this tax cut done, I predict we're going to get it done this year and it's going to I think transform the U.S. economy.",Chairman of Ways and Means Committee Kevin Brady To Republicans: How Hard Is It For Us To Unite Behind President Trump and Deliver On Our Promises?,https://radio.foxnews.com/2017/10/19/chairman-of-ways-and-means-committee-kevin-brady-to-republicans-how-hard-is-it-for-us-to-unite-behind-president-trump-and-deliver-on-our-promises/

La Nina, the opposite of El Nino, is the cooling of the central Pacific Ocean that affects weather patterns around the globe.
La Nina winters tend to have more storms coming from the west and north instead of from the Gulf of Mexico or the East Coast.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its U.S. Winter Outlook on Thursday, which shows a higher chance of a warm winter from parts of California stretching all the way eastward to Maine.

On the opposite end of the forecast, cooler-than-average temperatures are forecast this winter for southern Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and states along the northern border with Canada stretching eastward to Minnesota.

The big driver in this year's forecast from the NOAA is a La Nina weather event potentially developing next month for the second year in a row. La Nina, the opposite of El Nino, is the cooling of the central Pacific Ocean that affects weather patterns around the globe. La Nina winters tend to have more storms coming from the west and north instead of from the Gulf of Mexico or the East Coast.

“If La Nina conditions develop, we predict it will be weak and potentially short-lived, but it could still shape the character of the upcoming winter,” said Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. “Typical La Nina patterns during winter include above average precipitation and colder than average temperatures along the Northern Tier of the U.S. and below normal precipitation and drier conditions across the South.”

In terms of drought, the NOAA warns conditions may develop across areas of the South that missed out on rainfall from the 2017 hurricane season and in parts of the northern Plains.

While the South may be drier, the northern part of the country from eastern Washington through the Great Lakes to upstate New York is likely to better.

The winter outlook is not a forecast for specific storms or snow, but instead ""give the likelihood that temperature and precipitation will be above-, near, or below-average, and also how drought is expected to change.""

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius.","A women's suit company has launched a racy new ad campaign featuring women in sleek, tailored suits alongside men in, well, nothing.

Dutch suit label Suistudio has taken their slogan “Not Dressing Men” to a whole new level by including buff, butt-naked men in the promo shots for their latest fashion line.

The photos show women dressed in well-fitted suits and clearly in a position of power, while the naked men are featured in the background and are almost used as a type of prop.

One of the pictures shows a woman sitting on a lounge, dressed in a beige suit, while she rests her feet on the naked man stretched out beneath her.

Another features a woman in a sleek black suit, lounging on a couch with her hand on a man’s bare butt.

The photos are all set in what looks like a luxury high-rise apartment, with the woman always front and center and the man in the background or half out of the frame with his face concealed.

The studio is using the campaign as a statement to highlight the sexist way women are commonly portrayed in advertisements, particularly when selling products aimed at men.

Vice president of Suistudio USA Kristina Barricelli said the pictures bring focus to the normalized way women are often sexualized and used as objects in advertisements — the men aren’t portrayed in any way that women haven’t been before.

“There is nothing wrong with sex, the naked human body, and the inclusion of that in a campaign. Sex is a big part of fashion,” she told online newsite Upworthy.

“The problem is that in recent history, we haven’t seen a naked man objectified in the background. How strange! Why not?”

The ad campaign has gained a lot of attention online and there has been backlash from people calling the ad out for objectification, claiming it is a step backwards in the fight for gender equality.

“I’m sure if the roles were reversed and this was published there would be a backlash from females saying that they are being [sexualized], objectified, abused and so on. But somehow it is OK to do the same things to males. Hypocrites,” one Instagram user commented.

“Sexism is sexism, no matter if a woman dominates a man or vice versa.”

“And revenge is not a way to overcome injustice,” another user said.

While some are calling out the ad for being sexist, others are saying it is empowering and praising the company for shedding light on gender inequality.

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius. How many times have we seen a woman’s legs only or her bottom as a prop in men’s ad campaigns? All is fair in love and fashion.”

“Excellent cultural commentary! Love the irony,” another said.

Waters' most recent comment about Trump, as reported first by The American Mirror, comes just a few months after a gunman opened fire on congressional Republicans as they practiced for a charity baseball game, severely wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.

Democratic Rep. Al Green, Texas, also threatened to try to impeach Trump.

Earlier this month, he withdrew at the last minute an attempt to force the entire chamber to take a preliminary vote on the issue.

Though the effort would unlikely get a final vote in the GOP-controlled House, any such vote would be politically messy for any member, including Democrats who are trying to develop the message for the 2018 midterms beyond one merely opposing Trump, which has been unsuccessful for them.",Rep.

The singer visited shooting victims still in a Las Vegas hospital Sunday.","Country star Jason Aldean brought the party back Thursday in his return to the stage following the deadly mass shooting that broke out while he was performing in Las Vegas, but the fun was tempered by the sting of the tragedy.

Three songs into his show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the singer launched into a five-minute speech that honored the 58 killed and nearly 500 hurt in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But Aldean took a defiant tone in telling concertgoers to resist living in fear, and he called for more of the national unity he's seen since the attack.

""These people are going to continue to try to hold us down,"" Aldean said. ""To those people that keep trying to do that, I say (expletive) you, we don't really care.""

Fans agreed. They pumped their fists and held up American flags as Aldean continued.

""I want to play the show for you guys that the people in Las Vegas came to see and didn't get a chance to,"" he said.

Friends Audra Miller, Lee Holstein and Amanda Zmak were some of those fans. They were in the audience when the shooting happened and ran for cover like thousands of others.

They traveled from Dallas for the Tulsa show and wore T-shirts they decorated themselves that said ""Vegas Strong,"" a popular meme since the attack.

Miller, 34, said Aldean made them proud and viewed the evening as a triumph.

""It was therapeutic and kind of like a cleansing all at the same time,"" she said. ""We just wanted to represent family, friends, love and hope.""

Aldean gave fans the show they wanted. The Georgia native is one of country music's biggest stars, touring in support of his album ""They Don't Know,"" which debuted atop the Billboard 200 in 2016. Much of his catalog includes Southern rock, pop and hip-hop influences, a mix of hard-charging party anthems and ballads with lyrics about farm work, drinking and small-town life.

He blasted through hits including ""Big Green Tractor,"" ''Fly Over States"" and ""She's Country,"" and popped open a can of beer onstage after the encore.

Aldean canceled shows in California last week to mourn those killed Oct. 1 at the outdoor Route 91 festival. He resumed his tour in an arena where concertgoers walked through metal detectors, and police presence was visible.

The singer visited shooting victims still in a Las Vegas hospital Sunday. The day before, Aldean performed Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" on ""Saturday Night Live"" in tribute to the victims and the late rock superstar.

Petty died the day after the shooting in Los Angeles after suffering cardiac arrest.

Authorities have said Stephen Paddock targeted the country music festival, opening fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel before killing himself.

“For the past few days I’ve been struggling with some things, such as my depression, life, and some teen girl probs too (ya know a broken nail) and I couldn’t figure out why I was in such bad shape. I stayed in bed for about four days with minor aches and pains and I couldn’t find out a reason, it bothered me so much, I lost any want to be healthy or motivational, I was just a husk,” Brown wrote.

She continued that although it felt wrong to “stay in bed and watch videos” it was sometimes “okay” to not do anything.

“In the time of all this happening I told myself that over and over but it also hit me I had to actually believe it and just let it go and stop being bothered by it, I still feel kinda down and like being lazy, but that’s alright because my body knows what it needs and if that’s rest I won’t be one to refuse,” Brown said.

She concluded with telling her fans to stay strong and not to let “depression or dark feelings” get you down.

“I don’t care who you are. I don’t care what you’ve been through. I don’t care how old you are. If you hear that your mother has cancer, it’s going to shock you,” Rain said. “I just wish I could change it somehow. I’m very scared for her.”

Charleston Hartfield, 34, was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

The married father of two was off-duty and attending the Oct. 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from a hotel room.

LAS VEGAS SHOOTING DETAILS STILL MURKY AS MANDALAY BAY ORDERED TO KEEP EVIDENCE

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.
