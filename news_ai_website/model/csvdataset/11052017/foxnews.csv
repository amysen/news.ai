The company we trusted to handle our credit scores has become a pariah of the financial world since it allowed hackers to steal vital information from 145 million American adults.

I’m one of them. You probably are too. Click here to check if your personal data was exposed in the Equifax data breach.

How much information was stolen? Let’s start with the basics: Your name, Social Security number and birthdate. That alone is a treasure trove for identity thieves. But they also may have your address and driver’s license number. These people know where you live. They can find out almost anything about you. The list of nefarious things they can do is beyond comprehension.

An example? Click here to learn how the Equifax breach lets ID thieves have surgery on your dime.

Here’s my best advice: Assume the worst. The hackers have your information, and Equifax can’t do anything to protect you. Law enforcement is too overwhelmed to find the culprits, and you are completely exposed.

Here’s what to do next.

Establish two-factor authentication

If you work at a modern business or organization, you’re probably familiar with this process already. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step to the login process of your most critical accounts. When a website asks for your user name and password, you may also receive a text message or an email with a special code. This is a standard practice and is considered safe.

The idea is that even though hackers may have figured out your credentials, they won't be able to access your account without the special code. Cybercriminals would have to nab your physical cellphone, which is probably protected by a passcode, as well. Using this system makes the task much too complicated, especially when many hackers are located in other countries.

Who allows 2FA?

Several websites and email providers already offer 2FA to help protect accounts. The problem is that these sites and providers don’t seem to promote these extra security measures. It’s up to users to figure it out.

Use Amazon, Google or Facebook? How about Apple or Microsoft? All offer 2FA protection, but only if you take a few minutes to set it up. Click here for the steps you need to take now to lock down your accounts.

But what about banks? Incredibly, not all banks support two-factor authentication. Given recent events, I expect this to change. In the meantime, you’ll have to check and see if your online banking permits 2FA. If it does, sign up for it right away.

You can usually set up two-factor authentication either on your online banking account page or within the bank’s official app. Here are the links to some of the more popular banks or financial institutions' two-factor authentication setup pages:

· Bank of America

· Capital One

· Discover

· USAA

· Wells Fargo

If your bank is not on the list, call or visit it.

Prevent identity theft

OK, you’ve done your best to secure your accounts and made it hard for hackers to break into your bank or email. But remember, the Equifax hack happened last spring. Cybercriminals have had plenty of time to steal your identity. So what can you do to keep them from finishing the job?

Try executing a “credit freeze,” more accurately known as a “security freeze.” The name may sound strange, almost like sabotaging your own finances, but it’s a common defensive maneuver. If you suspect someone is already pretending to be you, you can lock your credit reports so that no one can open a new account in your name.

How does this work? Lenders consult your credit score before they start a partnership with you. If lenders can’t check those scores, no new accounts can be established.

Click here to learn more about how to set up a security freeze.

The most important thing is not to wait. Hackers move quickly, and this is their fulltime job. If they can steal your identity and bank account, they will, and as expediently as possible. Equifax made one of the biggest blunders in banking history. Now it’s up to us to clean up the mess.

Clinton fainted while attending an outdoor ceremony in New York City marking the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
Brazile said Clinton was already “wobbly on her feet” and had a “rattled cough,” according to the review.
She purportedly thought they had the best potential to win over working-class voters and defeat Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to the book review.
I could not do this to them,” Brazile writes.","Former DNC leader Donna Brazile says she considered replacing 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden after Clinton fainted in the closing weeks of the White House race, according to full review of Brazile’s upcoming book published Saturday.

Clinton fainted while attending an outdoor ceremony in New York City marking the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. But Brazile, then the interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, had already known that Clinton has pneumonia, she writes in her upcoming book, according to The Washington Post, which received an advance copy.

The Post’s review of the book -- “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House” -- says Brazile writes in “wrenching detail” about the former first lady’s bout with pneumonia, including her seeing Clinton at a Manhattan gala two days before she collapsed.

Brazile said Clinton was already “wobbly on her feet” and had a “rattled cough,” according to the review.

Clinton's former campaign team said in an open letter posted Saturday on the blogging platform Medium that they were dismayed by Brazile's revelations.

""We were shocked to learn the news that Donna Brazile actively considered overturning the will of the Democratic voters by attempting to replace Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine as the Democratic Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees,"" reads the opening of the letter.""It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.""

The Post review was published two days after Brazile published excerpts of the book in Politico that including bombshell revelations about her taking over the DNC in the summer of 2016 with roughly $20 million in debt.

Brazile also made the startling claim Thursday that a joint fundraising agreement between the DNC and the Clinton campaign, which included Clinton’s input on hirings and spending, effectively rigged the primary contest against Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Brazile also writes, according to the Post review, that she wanted to replace Clinton and Vice Presidential Nominee Sen. Tim Kaine with a ticket of Biden and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker as his running mate. She purportedly thought they had the best potential to win over working-class voters and defeat Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to the book review.

But “I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them,” Brazile writes.

The Post review also states that Brazile, when frustrated with Clinton aides, would remind them that the DNC charter gave her the authority to initiate the replacement of the party's presidential nominee.

She said that if a nominee became disabled, the party chairman would oversee the replacement process, though it would ultimately require a meeting of the entire DNC.

The review also details Brazile's reported wide-ranging takedown of the Clinton campaign over such matters as perceived “inevitability” and a focus on analytics over truly understanding voters.

Brazile also reportedly says she cannot remember sending an email, as a paid CNN contributor, to the Clinton campaign sharing potential topics and questions in advance of a town hall event the cable news network was hosting, nor does she have a record of sending it. However, she nevertheless apologized. The email was released by WikiLeaks.",Brazile as DNC chair considered replacing Clinton with Biden after she fainted: report,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/04/brazile-as-dnc-chair-considered-replacing-clinton-with-biden-after-fainted-report.html

Evidence continues to mount that it was Clinton who may have conspired with the Russians, while also rigging the primary election process to hand herself the Democratic nomination for president.","Hillary Clinton has spent a year crying about how the presidency was stolen from her. Turns out, she stole the Democratic nomination from Bernie Sanders.

The stunning revelation from former Democratic National Committee interim chairperson Donna Brazile that Clinton secretly rigged the primary process by commandeering the DNC should come as no surprise to anyone. Clinton is nothing, if not unethical and corrupt. She always has been. This is precisely why pre-election polls consistently showed that a majority of Americans found her dishonest and untrustworthy.

The critical question now is whether she committed crimes in her theft of the nomination.

The Scheme

According to Brazile, the DNC went broke under the leadership of Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. This dire circumstance presented a perfect scenario for Clinton to seize command of the party apparatus by paying off its debt of roughly $20 million dollars. But in exchange, the DNC executed a written, albeit hidden, agreement transferring to Clinton the committee’s finances, strategy, and money raised -- all to the benefit of Clinton and to the detriment of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her primary opponent.

Even more deceptions and money shuffling ensued. It was a clever and complicated stratagem, but here is the simple version. During Clinton’s joint fundraising events with the DNC and state parties held across the nation, more than $82 million was raised. The states immediately kicked back nearly all of their share to the DNC which, in turn, kicked back their share and the states’ share to Clinton’s campaign.

With Clinton in control of the Democratic party’s staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, mailings and money, she was able to overcome the serious primary challenge by Sanders in securing the nomination. The DNC, which was supposed to remain neutral, had been neutered by Clinton. It devolved into nothing more than a willing accessory to a devious scheme for Clinton’s campaign to get rich at the expense of Sanders.

There appears to be little doubt that Clinton rigged the election process. It was so unconscionable and unprincipled, that Brazile’s discovery of the incriminating document left her in tears. So she says.

Clinton Crimes?

The Federal Election Commission must immediately launch an investigation. So, too, must the Department of Justice and the FBI. It appears that Clinton may well have violated several laws which could constitute serious crimes.

First, federal law sets strict limits on campaign contributions. Financial records must now be subpoenaed to determine whether these laws were broken. Given Clinton’s past record of shady transactions such as the Whitewater land deal and her sale of cattle futures, there is a strong chance that a document trail will lead investigators to multiple violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act.

Second, if Brazile’s account of Clinton’s artifice is true, it is likely that campaign finance reporting laws were broken under the same Act. Hiding campaign money through false or misleading campaign reports is illegal. In egregious cases it is a crime, not just a civil penalty.

Finally, the funneling of campaign funds from one source to another smacks of money laundering. Any transaction that seeks to conceal or disguise proceeds of illegal activity constitutes money laundering. So, if it can be shown that Clinton violated campaign contribution limits or reporting requirements, then the channeling of the proceeds from one source to another would be the “laundering” of it.

Second Special Counsel

Clinton and her campaign are already suspected of playing a pivotal role in violating federal law by paying a substantial amount of money to a British spy and Russian government sources in order to obtain the infamous and discredited Trump “dossier”. Talking to a Russian in a campaign is not a crime, but paying money to one as part of a political campaign is a crime.

There is also evidence Clinton used her public office to confer a benefit to the Russian government in exchange for millions of dollars in donations to her foundation and cash to her husband. If the Clintons were enriched at the very time Hillary presided over a governing body which unanimously approved the sale of one-fifth of America’s uranium supply to Russia, it would amount to a violation of seven criminal statutes, including racketeering.

Yet, despite calls by the House Judiciary Committee and others on Capitol Hill for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel, he has taken no action whatsoever. Perhaps this is because he recused himself from any matter related to Hillary Clinton during his confirmation hearing in January.

This, however, would not legally prevent him from appointing a special counsel to handle the investigation. But it does underscore that Sessions has become so compromised on so many disqualifying matters of vital public interest, including the Trump-Russia case, that he can no longer serve in an able capacity.

As I have written before , Sessions should resign, but not before appointing a special counsel.

It is clear from President Trump’s many comments over the last several months that he has lost all confidence in his attorney general. It is time for him to go.

Hillary Clinton has bemoaned for months that the presidential election was stolen from her and that Donald Trump “colluded” with the Russians. As with many thing in Clinton’s mind, she has it backwards.

Evidence continues to mount that it was Clinton who may have conspired with the Russians, while also rigging the primary election process to hand herself the Democratic nomination for president.

Good riddance. Turns out it’s a lot like Justin Bieber – way overrated.

People think that farmers like DST, but that’s a myth. Author Michael Downing points out his book “Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time” that farmers were the main group lobbying against the first peacetime imposition DST in 1966.

It seems farmers don’t like the later sunrise created by DST and dairy cows adjust poorly to moooving the clock.

But DST helps conserve energy, right? No, that’s another myth, burst by a study by the California Energy Commission that found a reduction in energy use under DST of less than two-tenths of 1 percent.

And National Geographic reported that a 2008 National Bureau of Economic Research study of DST in Indiana “found that lighting demand dropped, but the warmer hour of extra daylight tacked onto each evening led to more air-conditioning use, which canceled out the gains from reduced lighting and then some.” As a result, electric bills increased slightly under DST.

The real beneficiaries of DST are the charcoal and grill industry, which lobbied successfully to tack a seventh month on to DST, and the candy companies, which pushed Congress to add an eighth month so they could sell more mini-Kit Kats in the days before Halloween.

So I say, let’s have Congress – which hasn’t been able to agree on almost anything this year – pass a bill eliminating daylight saving time. And as a kicker, the bill could revoke Justin Bieber’s work permit and send him back to Canada.

Eliminating DST provides endless benefits – and not just for cows. You won’t have to struggle to figure out what time it is in Arizona or Hawaii, which don’t change their clocks.

The airlines will save hundreds of millions of dollars, because they won’t have to shift flights to handle the twin time changes in spring and fall.

Amtrak won’t have to pull its trains over to sidings in the fall (so they don’t arrive too early – and yes, they do that) or race to be on time in the spring.

Best of all, you won’t be an hour late for church or golf in March or an hour early in November. There’s always one guy who strolls in an hour late on the first Sunday of DST, oblivious to the time change, the cause of much snickering among people intelligent enough to spring ahead.

Childhood obesity will diminish, because kids will have an hour less to trick-or-treat. (OK, that’s wishful thinking.)

But on a serious note, the New York Times published an article in 2014 reporting that Swedish researchers found a 5 percent increase in the risk of heart attacks right after DST began, along with an increase in traffic accidents, workplace injuries and suicide rates. The problem is that while our body clocks can slowly adjust to seasonal changes in the amount of daylight, the sudden change when DST begins throws off our body rhythms.

Some people might say that Daylight Saving is a hallowed national tradition. Yes, Benjamin Franklin had the idea first, but when he wrote about it in 1784, he was in Paris and he meant it as a joke. He wrote a satirical piece about how the French could save 200,000 candles a year if they adopted his plan.

The French, of course, had no sense of humor, took Franklin seriously, and adopted the idea. They didn’t save any candles, but since everybody could see who was going to whose apartment, the rate of adultery may have dropped precipitously.

The real origin of DST was World War I, when the Germans tried to squeeze an extra hour of daylight in the evenings, inadvertently forgetting that they would lose an hour of daylight in the mornings. Maybe that’s why they lost.

America adopted DST in fits and starts, kept it going all year long (how can you tell?) during World War II, and finally made it national in 1966, unless a state opted out.

So it’s only as much of a tradition in this country as, say, expecting the Mets to be out of the pennant race by August.

While we’re at it, it’s time to realign time zones in the United States so they actually make sense. Who said time zones have to be vertical? They would actually make much more sense if the country were realigned as follows:

Have one time zone that encompasses most business and finance – the new Important Standard Time, which will stretch from Boston to New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, Denver, Salt Lake City, Dallas, and Los Angeles.

South of that will be Golf Standard Time.

Just north, Redwood Standard Time, which will separate Southern California from Northern California, which is what both halves of the state have always wanted anyway.

Trump will be looking for Japan to limit trade with neighboring North Korea, to squeeze the rogue nation economically, while Abe wants reassurances that the United States will stand by its treaty obligations to defend Japan if attacked.

After visiting Japan, Trump then travels to South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Sunday’s casual lunch, nine holes of golf at the Kasumigaseki Country Club and the dinner will give way Monday to formal talks, a press conference and a state dinner.

Eager to forge a bond with Tokyo's crucial ally, Abe was one of the first world leaders to court President-elect Donald Trump. He was the first to call Trump after the election, and rushed to New York days later to meet the president-elect and present him with a pricey, gold Honma golf driver.

The two men also met on the sidelines of an international summit in Italy this spring and Trump hosted Abe in Florida. White House officials said Trump has spoken with Abe by phone more than any world leader, aside from British Prime Minister Theresa May.

That bond was clear on Sunday.

""The relationship is really extraordinary,” Trump also said Sunday before the dinner. “We like each other, and our countries like each other.""

When Trump hosted Abe in Palm Beach earlier this year, they played at one of Trump's Florida golf courses. For that outing, Trump brought along pro golfer Ernie Els, so this time Abe matched him by bringing along Japanese pro Hideki Matsuyama, who Trump described on the plane ride to Asia as ""probably the greatest player in the history of Japan.""

Before the game, Trump delivered a speech in which he hailed Japan as a ""crucial ally"" and warned adversaries not to test America's resolve.

""Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations,"" Trump told American and Japanese service members at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo, after arriving from Hawaii, his first stop on the trip.

Though Trump did not mention North Korea by name during the speech, the specter of its weapons program will loom large throughout Trump's five-nation trip. The president warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the ""most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.""

""Together with our allies, America's warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one — no dictator, no regime and no nation — should underestimate, ever, American resolve,"" he told the troops.

And while there is worry in the region about Trump's unpredictable response to the threat posed by Kim, Trump made clear he did not intend to tone down his bellicose rhetoric -- including dubbing Kim ""Little Rocket Man"" -- even while in an Asian capital within reach of the North Korea dictator's missiles.

""There's been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach,"" he said, speaking to reporters on Air Force One.

Trump also will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an upcoming summit in Vietnam.

The easy rapport with Japan could be strained if Trump takes an aggressive approach on trade or the two men disagree on how best to approach the threat looming in Pyongyang. During his campaign, Trump suggested Japan should acquire its own nuclear weapons to defend itself, hinted the U.S. might not come to the nation's defense, and accused Japan of ""killing us"" on trade. He has dropped that antagonist language almost entirely since the election, but tensions remain.

Scott Seaman, a director for Asia of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultant organization, noted: ""everything is fine with Trump until you tell him no. So far, Abe hasn't told him no.""

The beautiful island of Cuba, once a hotspot for American tourists in the 1940's and 1950's, is now an oppressed nation of 11 million people governed by a ruthless communist dictator. In this gripping episode of ""War Stories with Oliver North,"" you'll see how Fidel Castro brought a country together with promises and hope, and then tore it apart in one swift grab for power.

You'll witness how Castro committed this ultimate betrayal through a campaign of murder, mayhem and lies to his fellow countrymen.

You'll bear witness to Castro's 1959 victorious entrance into the city of Havana from the man who rode alongside him. In a rare firsthand account, Oliver North interviews Huber Matos, one of Castro's most trusted commanders. Matos was betrayed, tortured and jailed by Castro for 20 years.

You'll go inside the ensuing Cuban Missile crisis and see how a nuclear holocaust was narrowly avoided between America and the Soviet Union. From the pilot himself, you will hear him retrace the mission of a U-2 spy plane that provided the proof the world needed that ballistic missiles were aimed at the United States.

Annie Concannon of Turpin High School in Cincinnati posted a photo of herself in the offending outfit on Twitter. She’s wearing a cropped t-shirt with fraternity letters on it, high-waisted jeans, and sneakers. In her tweet she wrote, “I got dress coded for this outfit. Turpin high school. Twitter do your thing.”

The 17-year-old senior also told Yahoo Lifestyle that her outfit didn’t break the dress code, which she describes as: “Don’t show the three Bs: Boobs, Butt, Belly Button.”

She said that her outfit went unnoticed early in the day, but her homeroom teacher later called her out for the “inappropriate” attire. Concannon claims she’s worn the same clothes before without issue, but this time the teacher pulled her aside and told her she should know better because she’s a senior.

She said the teacher also referred to the shirt as “provocative,” Yahoo reports.

Concannon claims the teacher instructed her to go to the principal’s office, and to find a new shirt to put on, but the student decided to disregard the teacher because she felt her outfit was appropriate. “I disregarded her comment and went to my second-period class without changing. I was really frustrated because my outfit wasn’t breaking our dress code.”

Other teachers took note after being warned of Concannon’s shirt, informing them she should be wearing something over her t-shirt. “As I went to third period, my teacher approached me and told me that I needed a jacket put on immediately,” she told Yahoo. “At this point I started crying because I was so frustrated by the situation. I have never been dress-coded before, and I felt the staff of my school put a target on my back.”

The teen said people aren’t dress-coded often at her school, and she feels the rules are one-sided against the female gender.

Reactions on Twitter were mixed. While some defended the student’s outfit as perfectly acceptable, many bashed Concannon for breaking the rules and using social media to “harass” the school.

President Donald Trump gave a wide-ranging interview on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle” Thursday, revealing his thoughts on this week’s terror attack in New York City and the campaign actions of the Democratic National Committee.

“We are in the midst of discussions on many subjects, including North Korea and trade and other things,” Trump said before the dinner in Tokyo with first lady Melania Trump and Abe’s wife, Akie Abe. “But time is a little bit limited. Tomorrow’s a busy day.”

On Wednesday, the 100-year-old veteran got his recognition and finally his money, too.

Almeda received the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin also announced at a Capitol ceremony that Almeda was getting a check, 72 years after the war ended.

Shulkin's announcement drew gasps from some of the hundreds in attendance at the Gold Medal ceremony, which House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged was ""long, long overdue.""

Almeda, dressed in his military cap, told the crowd he was glad to be able to accept the medal, noting that ""many have passed away waiting for 75 years for this time to come.""

Almeda said he and other Filipino veterans have long ""felt unrecognized for fighting for our country,"" adding, ""I wondered why"" since he and his fellow soldiers had brought ""victory during a long war in the Philippines.""

The gold medal signified that his service — and that of thousands of other Filipino veterans — is recognized, Almeda said, calling himself a warrior who ""will never quit.""

Almeda was a 24-year-old teacher when he joined the Philippine Commonwealth Army in 1941. After the war, he resumed his career as a teacher and was granted U.S. citizenship in the 1990s. In 2003, he began receiving medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs under a law aimed at Filipino veterans.

But Almeda, now 100 and living outside Washington, has been fighting for nearly a decade to receive a $15,000 lump-sum payment promised to Filipino veterans under the 2009 economic stimulus law.

Almeda was among more than 250,000 Filipino soldiers who served alongside U.S. soldiers in World War II, including more than 57,000 who died. After the war ended, President Harry S. Truman signed laws that stripped away promises of benefits and citizenship for Filipino veterans.

Only recently have the veterans won back some concessions and acknowledgment, including the gold medal.

Ryan said the Capitol ceremony was more than ""a feel-good story of delayed recognition. We are here to immortalize the legacy of great liberators, who have paved the way for generations to follow.""

The ceremony — and the gold medals — should ""serve to ensure that those who fought for freedom are never forgotten, and always remembered,"" Ryan said.

Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said Filipino veterans enlisted for World War II ""knowing full well that the enemy could discover who they were and retaliate against their families.""

Even after their service ""was practically erased from American records ... these veterans never gave up,"" Hirono said. ""They organized and fought for what they had earned.""

In 1990, Congress awarded U.S. citizenship to thousands of Filipino veterans and later extended VA benefits to them. The 2009 stimulus law authorized the lump-sum payments, although in some cases missing or poor records blocked the payments from being made.

""After bravely serving our country, it is frankly shameful that these veterans had to fight so hard for what they were promised,"" Hirono said.

Today, only 18,000 Filipino veterans are still alive.

""We are living in tumultuous times, and we have many disagreements,"" Hirono said, ""but we agree that it is our responsibility as public servants and Americans to honor each veteran in the same way they honored our country.""",Filipino WWII veterans awarded Congressional Gold Medal,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/25/filipino-wwii-veterans-awarded-congressional-gold-medal.html

However, Guillod’s attorney, Thomas M. Ferlauto, told The Wrap the case was dropped due to lack of evidence.

“Witnesses were interviewed whose version of events belied and completely contradicted Ms. Barth’s and LAPD determined the charges to be unfounded. No criminal or civil case was ever brought against Mr. Guillod,” Ferlauto said.

The Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment.

Barth said she was not aware of witnesses who may have contradicted her allegations and said her boyfriend at the time and now-husband Danny Cusumano, confirmed her statements.

Last week, Barth wrote in a blog post for The Wrap that she blacked out while having dinner with “Atomic Blonde” producer Guillod.

“The next thing I remember is waking up at home with six hickeys on my neck,” she wrote.

“I was horrified. I was completely and utterly confused and I was sick to my stomach. Through email, he tried to play it off as a silly make-out session between friends. He sent me message after message begging that we talk and letting me know how upset he was and that he couldn’t sleep because of the pit in his stomach,” Barth wrote.

The actress said she dropped Guillod as a manager immediately.

Barth claimed Guillod made sexual advances toward her on previous occasions and only went to the noted dinner because actress Felisha Terrell was going.

Terrell, whose manager is still Guillod, told The Wrap Barth’s recount of the dinner seemed to be inaccurate.

“There were some inaccuracies in the story as I recall it. If I felt these accusations were 100 percent true I would not have remained a client. As a woman in this business, I am both supportive and inspired by women speaking their truth,” Terrell said.

Barth said that after her blog post was published, another woman contacted her and named Guillod as a person who sexually assaulted her.

“She titled the email with his name. I immediately had shivers from head to toe,” Barth told The Wrap. “The woman said that she had a similar experience, which was horrific … She said it was about three years ago.” The woman asked not to be identified.

The show also talked about Weinstein in its opening skit, where Alec Baldwin, portraying President Trump, said the producer was “an idiot.”

“What an idiot that Harvey Weinstein is,” Baldwin told Alex Moffat, who was playing Paul Manafort. “He could have gotten away with it all if only he had gotten himself elected president.”

Other members of the production crew told the outlet that they witnessed Spacey be inappropriate with many younger male members of the staff.","The allegations against “House of Cards” star Kevin Spacey continue to mount as eight crew members reportedly have come forward to detail allegations of sexual harassment and groping on the set of the popular Netflix drama.

On Thursday, CNN reported that eight people close to the production of the series, which shoots just outside of Baltimore, Maryland, have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct from the 58-year-old star that made working on the set an alleged nightmare.

All eight accusers have chosen to remain anonymous, but claim that the behavior was very well known on set and that it created a difficult work environment. Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the companies behind ""House of Cards,"" claim they had no reports of any widespread misconduct.

“When the allegations broke about Kevin Spacey on Sunday night, in conjunction with MRC, we sent a representative to set on Monday morning,"" Netflix told Fox News in a statement.

""Netflix was just made aware of one incident, five years ago, that we were informed was resolved swiftly,"" it continued. ""On Tuesday, in collaboration with MRC, we suspended production, knowing that Kevin Spacey wasn’t scheduled to work until Wednesday. Netflix is not aware of any other incidents involving Kevin Spacey on-set,” the company said.

“We continue to collaborate with MRC and other production partners to maintain a safe and respectful working environment. We will continue to work with MRC during this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the production, and have nothing further to share at this time.”

The report cites a production assistant who details that he had to drive Spacey to set one day and the two-time Academy Award-winning actor reached into his pants in a nonconsensual manner. He said he didn’t disclose the details of what happened next for fear of being identified, but said that when they got to the set, he was asked to help bring things to the actor’s trailer.

The production assistant then alleges that Spacey cornered him, blocked his ability to exit and made “inappropriate contact” with him.

The incident allegedly happened months after the same production assistant had complained that Spacey was harassing him. His supervisor’s solution was to make sure they never were alone. The harassment stopped, making him feel comfortable enough to drive Spacey on the day in question.

Other members of the production crew told the outlet that they witnessed Spacey be inappropriate with many younger male members of the staff. It was typically done out in the open, in full view of others.

They allege that most on set were aware of Spacey’s behavior, and that it was well-known among the crew. However, Netflix and MRC maintain they were not made aware of any serial behavior on the part of Spacey.

“We are deeply troubled to learn about these new allegations that are being made to the press concerning Kevin Spacey’s interaction with members of the crew of ‘House of Cards,'"" MRC said in a statement provided to Fox News.

""As the producer of the show, creating and maintaining a safe working environment for our cast and crew has always been our top priority. We have consistently reinforced the importance of employees reporting any incident without fear of retaliation and we have investigated and taken appropriate actions following any complaints,"" MRC said.

""For example, during our first year of production in 2012, someone on the crew shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey. Immediate action was taken following our review of the situation and we are confident the issue was resolved promptly to the satisfaction of all involved,"" the statement reads.

""Mr. Spacey willingly participated in a training process and since that time MRC has not been made aware of any other complaints involving Mr. Spacey.”

MRC also noted that, in the wake of the new allegations it has set up an anonymous hotline where crisis counselors and sexual harassment advisors will help any crew members that come forward with complaints about anyone on the set.

The allegations come days after actor Anthony Rapp revealed to Buzzfeed News that Spacey had made a sexual advance on him when he was 14, and Spacey was 26. Since then, several other men have come forward with similar stories about the star, prompting Netflix to suspend production on season six of “House of Cards.” Meanwhile, Spacey has announced that he will seek an undisclosed treatment during the hiatus.

Additionally, Deadline reports that the talent agency that's repped Spacey for eight years, CAA, has dropped him.

Now, nearly a year later, the Democratic Party is awash in competing narratives.
And they, not Stanley Greenberg, are writing the Democratic Party’s talking points.
The Democratic activist class does not trust its elite representatives; they were sold out to by an opaque and corrupt party.","Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, is in search of absolution. In a cloyingly self-pitying article for Politico Magazine excerpted from her upcoming book, she reveals the extent to which the DNC willingly surrendered control of the organization to Hillary Clinton’s campaign well before Clinton became the party’s presidential nominee.

In the article, Brazile scolds her predecessors at the DNC and scolds President Obama and his allies for allowing the party’s fundraising apparatuses to atrophy. But most of all, she attacks Hillary Clinton.

Brazile alleges that the joint fundraising agreement the DNC signed with the Clinton campaign in August was “unethical,” a claim disputed by DNC Chairman Tom Perez. And she confesses to being disturbed by her inability to confirm that the DNC was not trying to “throw the primary” to Clinton.

Finally, Brazile reveals that she knew all along that the polls couldn’t be trusted, even if the Democratic Party’s elected representatives and pollsters had no idea. “I found a lack of enthusiasm for her (Clinton) everywhere,” she confessed to Bernie Sanders alone.

Brazile could endure the shame of secretly relaying Democratic primary debate questions to Hillary Clinton when the Clintons were the powers that be. But those days are over. Now it’s Bernie Sanders’ party, and Brazile is surely hoping her offering to the new overlords will be satisfactory.

It’s not necessary to buy every detail of Brazile’s account to see the writing on the wall. When asked about Brazile’s confessional and whether that meant that the primary was rigged against Sanders, progressive darling Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., replied flatly, “yes.”

This is no country for a Clinton.

Brazile’s self-serving effort to expose the Democratic Party’s skeletons is a step toward recovery. It demonstrates that the party’s efforts to avoid conducting an “autopsy” on its failed effort in the 2016 election can only be suppressed for so long.

Democratic lawmakers and party insiders have gone to great lengths to ensure that any postmortem on the 2016 race is kept under wraps. But rather than controlling the direction in which the party’s post-2016 debate will flow, the Democratic Party has inadvertently let activists and pollsters perform the dissections on the party’s 2016 corpse.

A study conducted by the Democratic political research firm Global Strategy Group, for example, found that the Democratic Party’s base voters actually did turn out to vote. But the problem for Democrats was that many of them turned out to vote for Donald Trump.

“Those Obama-Trump voters, in fact, effectively accounted for more than two-thirds of the reason Clinton lost,” the report said.

Another study conducted by the super PAC Priorities USA learned that voters in swing states, including many Democrats, thought the Democratic Party was more likely than the GOP to favor the wealthy, and voted accordingly.

It’s all rather confusing and often conflicting. Now, nearly a year later, the Democratic Party is awash in competing narratives. In a comprehensive New York Times Magazine piece, Robert Draper examines a party at war with itself – not over policy, but over tone and tactics.

For example, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel helped engineer a Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006 by hunting for conservative Democratic prospects to run in conservative districts.

“When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at,” Emmanuel confessed. “‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

Emmanuel is still getting yelled at. Progressive Change Campaign Committee founder Stephanie Taylor attacked Emanuel’s “50-state strategy” for, of all things, only being able to maintain control of the House for four years. Had the party run true-blue progressives in those red districts, she said, the Democrats might have enjoyed more “lasting success.”

The impulse to impose ideologically progressive homogeneity on the Democratic Party is evident in how the progressive activist base responded to Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie’s foray into immigration-related issues.

Gillespie’s decision to make the matters of the MS-13 gang and sanctuary cities an issue in the Virginia gubernatorial campaign has offended the sensibilities of his Democratic opponents. They claim, correctly, that MS-13’s presence in Virginia is, while not negligible, numerically modest. They add that there are no sanctuary cities in Virginia.

To even raise this issue is to inflame cultural tensions toward no higher purpose than dividing the electorate against itself and stoking racial anxieties. But it wasn’t until the Democratic candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, confirmed that he would sign an anti-sanctuary city bill if one crossed his desk that the progressive left truly revealed its capacity for inchoate rage.

“Northam caves to opponent’s racist ads on sanctuary cities,” the progressive blog Think Progress barked.

Ezra Levin, one half of a team of activists lauded in Politico as responsible for crafting the “playbook for stonewalling the Trump presidency,” attacked his favored candidate, writing that “parroting Gillespie’s hateful xenophobia is despicable.”

The Nation’s Washington editor, George Zornick, mourned the Northam campaign’s validation of “Gillespie’s racist narrative.”

The activist organization Democracy for America went a step further and dubbed the Northam campaign itself a “racist” organization.

This isn’t political analysis; it’s a primal scream. Moreover, it has blinded progressives to the fact that local candidates know best how to appeal to their constituents.

A Monmouth University survey released Oct. 17 found Gillespie’s message on crime and immigration resonating with voters. Gillespie’s image on crime had improved markedly over the course of one month, coinciding with a decline in overall support for Northam.

“This is a game of inches right now, so any small advantage counts,"" said Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray.

Northam’s struggles are indicative of a broader problem with a party that has outsourced agenda-setting to the activist base. Longtime Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg recently warned his party that the Democratic brand is “weakening” and the opportunities the party could enjoy in 2018 will be forfeited if Democrats do not develop a concise agenda.

Greenberg advised Democrats to hammer away on the GOP’s failure to preserve access to health insurance, preserve entitlement programs, or protect the little guy from abuse. Greenberg’s firm found that the message that tests best with voters is a familiar one: “Trickle-down has failed and the richest need to pay their fair share of taxes.”

The dirty secret is that the Democratic Party’s activist base is not animated by messages like these. The activists get out of bed in the morning ready to do cultural battle with pro-Trump forces, not over economic issues but cultural concerns. And they, not Stanley Greenberg, are writing the Democratic Party’s talking points.

Say what you will about the GOP’s 2012 “autopsy,” at least the Republican Party engaged in an open display of introspection in the wake of a humiliating defeat. The autopsy galvanized a Republican activist base resentful of what it saw as the false elite consensus around diversity and immigration, and vowed to show the party leaders why they were wrong.

Perhaps mindful that Donald Trump’s nomination represented a repudiation of that Republican autopsy’s recommendations, Democrats have opted to pass on the public self-flagellation. In the process, though, they’ve only hastened the same reckoning that Republicans endured.

The Democratic activist class does not trust its elite representatives; they were sold out to by an opaque and corrupt party. They do not share their representatives’ enthusiasm for road-worn talking points about Reaganomics. They see the rise of Trump as an urgent threat, but their representatives do not appear to share their burning apprehension.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse.

Now, more than three decades later, authorities say, it's been confirmed.

A Georgia district attorney says Timothy Coggins was killed for ""socializing with a white female."" Prosecutor Ben Coker told a judge Wednesday that Coggins was dragged behind a truck through the woods, news outlets reported. Arrest warrants say he was stabbed and sliced to death and suffered ""severely disfiguring"" wounds.

A break in the cold case came in mid-October, when local and state law enforcement officials announced the arrests of five longtime local residents on charges stemming from the slaying. All five are white; two worked in law enforcement.

Spalding County Sheriff Darrell Dix was emphatic about the motive during an Oct. 13 news conference in Griffin, about 40 miles south of Atlanta.

""Based on the original evidence recovered in 1983 and new evidence and interviews, there is no doubt in the minds of all investigators involved that the crime was racially motivated, and that if the crime happened today it would be prosecuted as a hate crime,"" he said.

Two men are charged with murder: Frankie Gebhardt, 59, and Bill Moore Sr., 58. Arrest warrants accuse them of stabbing and slicing Coggins to death and giving him ""seriously disfiguring"" wounds.

Moore and Gebhardt were just a year or two older than the victim, and Heather Coggins says she believes her uncle was acquainted with them. But she said the rest of the family didn't know them.

""This is the first time we've heard their names and seen their faces,"" she said in a recent interview.

Three other suspects — Sandra Bunn, 58; her son Lamar Bunn; and 47-year-old Gregory Huffman — are charged with obstructing the investigation. Sandra Bunn worked as a Spalding County detention officer until her arrest, when the sheriff fired her. Huffman was also a detention officer and later a police officer in nearby Milner. He's charged with revealing the identity of a confidential informant who was being used against Gebhardt.

Officials haven't detailed the connections between the suspects, but court records show Sandra Bunn sued Gebhardt in 2003 to have him evicted from a property she owned. Gebhardt has been convicted in the past of aggravated assault and criminal damage, both felonies, along with multiple misdemeanors, records show.

Coker said he will seek indictments in December but hasn't decided whether to seek the death penalty against Gebhardt and Moore.

Heather Coggins was just 6 when her uncle was killed, but she still tears up at how his slaying wracked her large extended family, longtime residents of the community, with ""uncertainty, heartbreak, fear.""

She remembers her uncle as ""just a fun person. If anything, I remember just the joy, the playfulness of him."" He didn't finish high school and had no regular job but worked for his stepfather, a plumber and carpenter in Griffin.

He loved the R&B music of Frankie Beverly and loved to dance.

But his life ended in horrific violence.

A 1983 article in the Griffin Daily News said his body was found by hunters in a field not far from a highway in the Sunny Side community a few miles north of Griffin. He wasn't immediately identified.

""He had been worked over with a knife pretty well,"" an investigator told the newspaper — stab wounds in the back, punctured lungs and defensive wounds on his arm.

Heather Coggins said that when investigators passed around the unknown victim's photo to the local community, Timothy Coggins' own mother didn't recognize her dead son, but Heather's mother, the victim's oldest sister, said: ""No, that's Tim.""

His mother was burdened by his slaying until she died in February 2016. She called out his name on her death bed, Heather Coggins said.

""I really don't think my grandmother ever recovered from losing her son ... not because of his death, but because of the uncertainty of who did it,"" she said. ""She felt like justice wasn't done.""

In July, authorities announced that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had new information.

Seeking to bolster that new lead, the sheriff issued a July 24 news release, imploring witnesses to step up.

""We understand that over the years those suspected of being involved in the murder of Timothy Coggins have threatened and intimidated potential witnesses,"" he said. ""We believe that there are people with pertinent information regarding this case that are still out there and we are asking them to come forward.""

As witnesses did so, he said, they told investigators ""they had been living with this information since Coggins' death but had been afraid to come forward or had not spoken of it until now.""

Heather Coggins said the family won't rest easy until those responsible for killing him are convicted. But she said they are deeply grateful to the sheriff, the GBI and other officials who didn't give up on solving her uncle's killing.

""We're totally thankful that someone has been arrested,"" she said. ""We're grateful because that didn't happen for 34 years.""

President Trump is right: We should end the diversity lottery for immigration. It is an absurd system for randomly selecting who should come to the United States. The lottery system should instead be replaced with a merit-based system that actively seeks people who will help grow the American economy.

Instead of continuing liberal, politically correct immigration rules that emphasize what the left calls “diversity,” we need a system that focuses on an individual’s merit, work and achievement. What a person can contribute to America should be more important when making immigration decisions than whether he or she fits some political science mantra of diversity.

However, in light of the terrorist attacks in New York, Orlando, San Bernardino, Boston and elsewhere, closing the lottery loophole isn’t enough. We need to take far more decisive steps in improving and securing our immigration system.

First, we need to identify terrorists as enemy combatants. They should be thoroughly interrogated and a new law should be developed so that captured terrorists are not able to benefit from Miranda rights.","Newt Gingrich: Get Smart -- Scrap The Diversity Lottery, Be Honest About Terrorists",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/03/newt-gingrich-get-smart-scrap-diversity-lottery-be-honest-about-terrorists#commenting

First of all, a travel alert is different from a travel warning, and the biggest difference between the two is time.
Temporary situations, such as a disease outbreak or a public demonstration, are among the things that could lead to a travel alert.

When an alert or warning includes a destination you were planning to visit, you likely have questions and concerns. But before you imagine the worst case scenario and cancel a trip, here's what you need to know.

First of all, a travel alert is different from a travel warning, and the biggest difference between the two is time. According to the State Department, an alert is issued when the government recognizes “short-term events” they think you need to be aware of when visiting a country. Temporary situations, such as a disease outbreak or a public demonstration, are among the things that could lead to a travel alert.

More ongoing issues, like a civil war or a rise in crime, are typically what call for a travel warning. When that happens, the U.S. State Department wants you “to consider very carefully whether you should go to a country at all.”

For example, the South Pacific's tropical cyclone season recently got an alert, while Venezuela's ongoing issues with crime and shortages in food and medicine got a warning.

Although this information should never be taken lightly, understanding the events behind both alerts and warnings will give travelers context for planning their own itinerary. One thing to remember is that not every part of a continent or country with a travel advisory is dangerous.

“Countries generally don’t fit in a one-size-fits-all category,” John Rendeiro, Vice President of Global Security and Intelligence at International SOS, told USA Today last year. “Variable levels of risks exist within countries, as there are safer and more dangerous parts of the United States as well.”

As an example from personal experience, I recently visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although the U.S. government advises “to avoid unnecessary travel to the DRC because of ongoing instability and sporadic violence,” I visited the country's Virguna National Park, but I didn’t blow off the recommendations. Prior to finalizing my plans, I e-mailed the park directly, and through our correspondence, a ranger assured me that a member of the park's team would escort me into the Congo at the border and I’d be accompanied by an armed guard throughout the entire trek. Overall, the park was extremely well run and I had no issues doing what I came to do: see the gorillas.

After being a few feet away from a gorilla family and watching one of the babies spin from a tree branch, I'd say it was one the best experiences I’ve ever had.

No matter where travelers go, they should always prioritize their safety and exercise caution. When in a foreign country, keep in mind the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program and the long list of U.S. embassies worldwide, which are there to help and inform citizens of how to handle themselves when visiting other countries.

The man posted on Facebook about a photo the restaurant had up that he believed to be an image of two white people in blackface.

Since the post, the man's claims went viral and people on social media called to boycott the restaurant and some made extreme threats which prompted police to respond, News channel 3 reports.

“We got a phone call saying they were going to come down here rioting and they were going to come in here and wreak havoc,” owner Sandy Bloomfield said.

TRUMP HOTEL SKEWERED BY TWITTER FOR STEAK PHOTOS

However, Bloomfield explains there is a much different story for the photo, which “has been on the wall for six years,” she says.

After the unexpected backlash, Bloomfield posted the original color version of the photo on Facebook, which shows two employees dressed up as members of the Blue Man Group for Halloween in 2009.

Bloomfield, who has owned Julianna’s Restaurant in Kalamazoo for nearly 30 years, said the restaurant’s aesthetic is all black and white, which is why the original blue photo isn’t the one hung up.

“All the décor in the restaurant is in black and white,” Bloomfield told News channel 3.

“Clearly, it's the blue man group,” Bloomfield said.

Since the social media firestorm, Juliana’s Restaurant issued a statement, which further caught flack for being “sarcastic,” Strick Strickland, Kalamazoo’s NAACP chapter president told the news outlet.

On social media, the restaurant posted, “After this stunt, blue people will be given one free meal as an apology for the photo.""

Of the response, Strickland said, “I think that says I don't take how others feels seriously, and I think they should,” Strickland said.

Bloomfield said she thought the restaurant’s response “might not have been the best,” but was “what they could do to protect the business.”

Both Strickland and Bloomfield do agree that the situation can serve as a learning opportunity for members in the community.

Strickland wants people to “try and educate one another"" after incidents like these.

Bloomfield hopes for a similarly interactive approach where people would ask questions rather than immediately posting their assumptions on social media.

“I hope that people, when people see something, they can ask instead of jumping to conclusions,” Bloomfield said.

The '80s star said the man who attacked him when he was 14 years old is named Jon Grissom, an actor who had bit parts in some of Feldman's films including ""License to Drive"" (1988) and ""Dream a Little Dream"" (1989). He is listed as John Grissom in his IMDB account. His full name is Cloyd Jon Grissom.

Prior to the singer's revelation on the talk show, Feldman wrote about the alleged pedophile in his 2014 autobiography, ""Coreyography: A Memoir,"" identifying Grissom by a false name, Ron Crimson, as advised by his lawyers at the time.

However, Grissom, who has been suspected by some on social media for several years, addressed speculation that he was Feldman's predator.

Grissom presently lives in Mexico. He is 55 years old and is a convicted sex offender with his conviction dating back to 2003.

Feldman warned Hollywood pedophiles issuing a message, ""Now is your time. Be a man for the first time and come forward yourself. Turn yourself in. Let it be known... If you do not we’re coming for you.""

The 46-year-old told Dr. Oz he informed the Santa Barbara Police Department in 1993 the names of attackers in Hollywood.

Kelly Hoover, public information officer for Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, told Fox News, ""We are aware of the statements that Mr. Feldman is making regarding an investigation in 1993. Our records do not indicate that he named any suspects. If he has any information regarding a crime or crimes that occurred, we encourage him to contact our office or his local law enforcement agency.""

Feldman instead called the Los Angeles Police Department while on Dr. Oz with the intention of naming alleged pedophiles in Hollywood. The call was not allowed to be recorded for confidentiality reasons, but the actor claimed he would cooperate with any investigations going foward.

Feldman and Grissom did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Following the Dr. Oz appearance, some social media users falsely identified a man sharing the name John Grissom as Feldman's alleged predator. He wrote on Facebook about the identity confusion.

TIME: Pregame coverage begins at 3 p.m.

The Los Angeles Clippers cap off a modern-day NBA rarity -- consecutive afternoon home games -- when they host the Miami Heat on Sunday.

The Clippers began the daytime double with a 113-104 loss Saturday afternoon to the Memphis Grizzlies.

The Heat, meanwhile, needed the day off Saturday to shake off the disappointment of Friday's 95-94 loss at Denver that tipped off a six-game trip.

Miami Heat on FOX Sports Sun

Miami led the game 94-92 before fouling Nuggets forward Paul Millsap on a 3-point attempt with 11.9 seconds remaining. Millsap made all three free throws to give Denver the lead, and eventually the win.

""You feel the emotions right now,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said after the game. ""Everybody's disappointed when you have the opportunity to win on the road like that.""

Playing an afternoon game at the Staples Center in Los Angeles is nothing new for the Heat. They struggled to their sixth-lowest scoring output of the season last year in a 98-86 loss on a Sunday afternoon in January that allowed the Clippers to sweep the two-game season series.

The Heat shot just 36.9 percent overall and 7 of 27 (25.9 percent) on 3-pointers in the defeat.

Miami began this season by scoring 100 or more points in three of four games, but has since been held to 97 or fewer in three of four, losing three of those games.

The Heat are just 3-5 despite having started the season with six of their first seven at home. That will even out in the next week, with Miami currently on a six-game trip.

Miami guard Goran Dragic had a team-high 23 points and seven assists at Denver. He has scored at least 17 points in all eight games, and 20 or more in five of the last seven.

Of course, a game against the Clippers no longer means a matchup with Chris Paul. Los Angeles is now starting Patrick Beverley at the point.

Beverley had 23 points and Blake Griffin 30 in Saturday's loss to the Grizzlies.

The difference in the game came from the bench, as all four Grizzlies reserves who played scored in double figures and combined for 55 points, outscoring their Clippers counterparts by 33.

Sunday's game takes on added importance for the Clippers because of Saturday's loss. It caps a five-game homestand for a team that, by day's end, will have played seven of nine at home.

After a 4-0 start that had them looking down at the champion Golden State Warriors in the standings, the Clippers have lost three of four on a homestand that ends Sunday.

That stretch included a 141-113 blowout loss to the Warriors on Monday.

Up next for the Clippers: eight of nine on the road, starting with a couple of Western heavyweights -- San Antonio and Oklahoma City.

""We wish they weren't both at 12:30 (p.m.),"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said of the unusual scheduling. ""We talked about them. We can't think about the road right now.""

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

The television plays a crucial part in our day-to-day lives, so it’s important to keep its placement in mind when planning out a room. Given the shape and massive size of today’s TVs, the big screen has become a massive eyesore without many places to go other than smack dab in the center of a wall. If this is sounds familiar, get ready to get inspired by these three inventive tricks to hide your TV in plain sight.

1. Camouflage it with a black wall. One lone rectangular block of black in a room can create a striking feature that is unfavorable in many designs. By extending the dark hue across a bigger space, you can create a fun accent wall and play down the glaring, shiny black electronic screen. All it requires is a bucket of paint from your local hardware store and a little know-how on basic painting techniques.

If a full black wall is too bold for your design taste, painting just the horizontal strip of the wall that the TV occupies is a nice compromise. Then, you can balance the room with black home decor pieces. Keep it minimal with a black-and-white palette or add some color to lighten the look.

2. Pair it alongside other appliances. If you’re faced with the scenario of having two or more gaping black holes in your room, the best solution may be to simply combine them as an intentional arrangement instead of an odd-one-out situation. For example, you can juxtapose a fireplace with a TV above the mantel. Get a gallery look by hanging similarly-sized pieces, such as a cabinet or oversized artwork. Alternatively, if you enjoy watching television in the kitchen while you prepare or eat dinner, nestle it in with other appliances, such as an oven or wine fridge.

Be sure to take some safety measures when displaying electronics above appliances. Protect your TV from rising heat by mounting it above a mantel or enclosing it in a well-ventilated cabinet. Also make sure the television is still at a comfortable viewing angle to reduce neck strain or consider investing in a flexible wall mount.

3. Invest in built-ins. This is a more customized approach to hiding a TV. Sliding doors, swiveling panels and folding cabinets are carefully measured to the device for a sleek disguise. One of the simpler strategies is to cover the TV with sliding doors that can be matched to the rest of your wall or stand out as an interesting focal point. Other popular ideas include a snug art panel that slides to reveal or conceal a TV.

MCDONALD’S SINGAPORE'S NEW ‘NASI LEMAK’ BURGER IRKS SOME, COMPLETELY SELLS OUT ANYWAY

According to the BBC, nasi lemak, which means “fatty rice” in Malay, is “coconut milk-infused rice accompanied by various ingredients — the standard ones are a fried egg, cucumber slices, tiny fried anchovies, peanuts, and a hefty dollop of sambal, or spice paste.” It’s typically wrapped in banana leaves and often eaten for breakfast.

The gown, however, required much more preparation than the dish: Designed by Malaysian designer Brian Khoo, the dress reportedly took more than 400 hours to complete. Khoo used hand-embroidered rhinestones to represent grains of rice, red rhinestones for the spicy sambal, and a pair of ""wings"" that represent banana leaves. The outfit also includes added embellishments representing peanuts, cucumbers and a fried egg, The Malay Mail Online reports.

Organizers describe it as a ""feast for the eyes and the senses, mmm!"" according to the BBC.

James added that she ""loves nasi lemak"" and eats it ""all the time,” according to Channel news Asia. “It represents me and my country.""

Alex Schrier and Jeffrey Bounds, both 16, were driving home Friday evening in Cote de Caza in Orange County when they spotted the vehicle on fire, the Orange County Register reported. The car was tipped on its side and flames were shooting out of the hood.

“We didn’t see any other cars around so we assumed no one called 911,” Schrier told the Orange County Register. “We didn’t know if it was going to explode or not.”

“As I got closer I could see the flames getting closer and closer to the main part of the car and I heard someone screaming,"" Bounds added.

The teenage boys attempted to break the car’s sunroof with a small rock. An unidentified man then helped break through the glass with a larger rock.

The three good Samaritans pulled the trapped passengers, a man believed to be in his mid-20s and woman in her mid-40s, just moments before the vehicle “started to just blow up.”

“Honestly, I’ve never been more scared,” Bounds told the newspaper.

The man and the women were taken to the hospital shortly after. The woman suffered head and shoulder injuries while the man had minor injuries.

Court papers filed Friday say about $1.65 million would go upfront to the widow and daughter of Jason Simcakoski, of Stevens Point, Wis., who was 35 when he died in 2014 at the Tomah VA facility. Another $659,000 would go into annuities for Simcakoski's widow, Heather, and their daughter, Anaya. The rest would go to attorney fees and expenses.

Time: 1 p.m.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jacksonville Jaguars defensive end Calais Campbell rattled off three reasons why Sunday's game against Cincinnati is important.

It's at home.

It's an AFC game.

It's following a bye week.

""You never want to start talking playoffs too early in the thick in things, but every game is so critical to that future success and trying to win the division,"" Campbell said. ""This is a very important game for us for many reasons.""

The Bengals (3-4) and Jaguars (4-3) believe they have to start stacking wins if they're going to be postseason contenders in the AFC. Jacksonville hasn't won consecutive games in more than a year and followed three 20-plus-point victories this season with letdown losses.

More Jacksonville Jaguars news

The next chance comes against the Bengals, who are beginning a three-game road stretch that could go a long way toward determining whether or not they will be in postseason contention. Cincinnati has won three of four since an 0-3 start, with impressive wins against Cleveland and Buffalo, a lopsided loss at Pittsburgh and a nail-biter against Indianapolis.

""Everyone talks about the Pittsburgh game, but in our last four, we are 3-1,"" quarterback Andy Dalton said. ""So we're trying to be 4-1 at this point. All we can do is worry about what we do this week and keep trying to stack wins on top of each other.""

The Bengals could have their hands full with Jacksonville's defensive front, which leads the league with 33 sacks.

Cincinnati fired offensive coordinator Ken Zampese after a 0-2 start in which they failed to score a touchdown and elevated Bill Lazor. The offense got a little better, but it managed just one first down and 19 yards in the second half against the Steelers.

And Dalton was under constant pressure against the Colts last week.

Now, the Jaguars get a shot at Cincy's rebuilt offensive line, which has allowed 22 sacks. Jacksonville has two games with 10 sacks this season and another with five turnovers.

The team traded for two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Marcell Dareus last week, hoping he solidifies the unit's shaky run defense and provides another defender who can wreak havoc on opposing quarterbacks. Dareus has 35 career sacks in seven seasons with Buffalo.

""They're doing a little bit of everything,"" Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said. ""They're doing a great job when they straight rush you. They're doing a great job (limiting) gains. … They're doing a lot of good things, and they're all fitting together well.""

Here are some other things to know about the Bengals and Jaguars:

GETTING HEALTHY

The Jaguars expect running back Leonard Fournette (ankle), left tackle Cam Robinson (ankle) and center Brandon Linder (illness) to return from injuries. Fournette sat out the team's last game at Indianapolis and got extra time to heal. Jacksonville also could get rookie receiver Dede Westbrook on the field for the first time this season. Westbrook, a fourth-round draft pick who led the NFL in receiving in the preseason, had core muscle surgery in September.

RUNNING ON EMPTY

Cincinnati's inexperienced offensive line has struggled to protect Dalton and open holes for the running game. The trio of Jeremy Hill, rookie Joe Mixon and Giovani Bernard combined for only 34 yards on 17 carries against a Colts defense ranked next-to-last in the league. There was confusion in some of the blocking schemes, allowing linebackers to blitz untouched up the middle.

""With the different stuff they're going to do, we need to know what we're doing and what they're doing, and then react,"" Dalton said. ""We just need make sure we get our job done.""

STOP THE RUN

Frank Gore ran for 82 yards and averaged 5.1 yards per carry against the Bengals last week. They know they have to be much better against the Jaguars, who lead the league in rushing yards.

""They're dedicated to run,"" defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said. ""They're going to stay the course on the running game. Whether they're going to get (stopped) or not, they're going to run it. They're going to play good field position and they're going to play good defense. To me, that's how you win.""

RECORD WATCH

Fournette can make history against the Bengals. The rookie has scored a touchdown in each of his first six games in the league. If he scores against the Bengals, he would become the first player in NFL history to score a touchdown in each of the first seven games of his career, according to Elias Sports Bureau.

""That's my job, and I try to do it to my best,"" Fournette said.

The former employee, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution by Webster, said Webster also told the then-employee directly that he received oral sex, on multiple occasions, in exchange for the meet-and-greets.

The ex-employee told Fox News that Webster routinely approached fans and asked for sexually explicit images, and told the fans they could meet the 71-year-old country superstar if they complied. The former employee said Webster showed her and other employees the explicit photos he received from fans, after promising to introduce them to Parton.

The former employee said she does not believe Parton was ever aware of Webster’s behavior.

Another former staffer who worked for Webster told Fox News he also heard the publicist brag about “trading” meet-and-greets and backstage passes for oral sex, as late as Parton’s “most recent touring season.” Parton’s ""Pure and Simple"" tour ran from June 3, 2016 to December 10, 2016.

A third employee echoed the others’ statements and said Webster often spoke of using Parton’s name for sexual favors from fans.

Parton cut ties with Webster’s firm this week, and her face disappeared from the front page of the company website on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if she had acquired a new publicist.

She walked over to Marilyn Monroe.
“So when it happened, it was a shock and a total surprise… It’s like winning a lottery ticket… It’s too much of a long shot.”In fact, Chakiris didn’t think the romantic drama would have been a hit.","George Chakiris is still recognized by fans as headstrong rival Bernardo in 1961’s Oscar-winning musical “West Side Story,” but by then he had already worked with Hollywood’s most famous actress twice.

At age 19, Chakiris danced alongside Marilyn Monroe in the sex symbol’s signature number “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” for 1953’s “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.”

They reunited again in 1954 for another musical, “There’s No Business Like Show Business.” The 83-year-old actor and dancer still has fond memories of working with the blonde bombshell, who had a completely different persona when cameras weren’t rolling.

“She was so intensely concentrated on her work,” Chakiris told Fox News. “She was very quiet. She didn’t speak with anyone, not to be rude, but she was just so concentrated on her work.

""Whenever they cut [a scene] for any reason, she didn’t go to the mirror or her dressing room. She went right back to her starting position and was ready to shoot the number again or that portion of it… She was just so strikingly beautiful. She had such fair skin.”

Monroe, who wasn’t a superstar yet when filming began for “Gentleman Prefer Blondes,” relied on renowned choreographer Jack Cole to help her move like a titilating screen siren. However, things became awkward when her acting coach Natasha Lytess got involved — and that was often, Chakiris said.

“I remember one time… Jack Cole was facing Marilyn and behind him, also facing Marilyn was Natasha Lytess,” recalled Chakiris. “But he didn’t know Natasha was behind him. And I guess he was giving Marilyn some kind direction and Natasha was very slowly shaking her head. It looked like, ‘Pay no attention to what he’s telling you, I’ll tell you later.' But Marilyn Monroe was wonderfully polite to the both of them.”

And Chakiris would had his own unexpected encounter with Monroe at a cast party for “There’s No Business Like Show Business” just a year later.

“The girl who was my partner in a couple of the dance numbers said, ‘Why don’t I go over there and ask her to give you a kiss on the cheek?’” said Chakiris. “I said, ‘No! No! No!’ Well, she did it anyway! She walked over to Marilyn Monroe. She pointed in my direction and asked her. Marilyn listened to the request and very nicely, she said, ‘But I don’t know him.’ I love that because I think it says something about her.”

Over the years, Monroe would later garner an infamous reputation for her behavior on set. The actress would reportedly show up hours later for work or sometimes not at all.

She would supposedly flub her lines so much that multiple takes were required. There were also reported tearful meltdowns and those unexpected moments when an insecure Monroe would hide in her dressing room. But Chakiris never witnessed any of that. Instead, he saw an actress who dressed casually, was ready to work and eager to impress.

“I know there are those other stories, of course,” explained Chakiris. “But the thing that I noticed was her courtesy, how wonderfully quiet she was, how her main concern was her work… I really admired that… She never made a big, loud entrance.

""I always thought that in spite of what anybody said about her in any way, shape or form, I always felt [that] in her heart she was kind. There was a sweetness to her… I respect who she was and what she was trying to do… When you see her in a movie, any movie she’s in, your eyes always go to her… She’s so gifted, I think. She’s musically gifted.”

While Monroe never won an Oscar for any of her films, Chakiris did in 1962 for “West Side Story.” At age 27, he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor — out beating Montgomery Clift, George C. Scott, Peter Falk and Jackie Gleason. Chakiris was in disbelief when Shirley Jones said his name.

“You sort of hope you’ll hear your name, but you totally do not expect to hear your name,” said Chakiris. “So when it happened, it was a shock and a total surprise… It’s like winning a lottery ticket… It’s too much of a long shot.”

In fact, Chakiris didn’t think the romantic drama would have been a hit.

“I remember at one point, there was a break in filming and I was standing out in the alleyway by the soundstage,” he explained. “There were a few other men from the production team. I overheard them say…’Well, we’re not sure that we will have a commercial success, but we think we might have an artistic success.’

""Everybody felt strongly about the film because we loved what we were doing and we felt like were working on something that was truly wonderful. We were so committed to what we were doing.”

Chakiris still stays in touch with his former cast-mates. Rita Moreno, who played Anita, not only accompanied Chakiris for the Oscars, but the fellow Academy Award-winner would later choose him to be the godfather of her daughter.

“It sounds corny to say, but we’re like a family,” he said. “That experience for all of us really created a bond… The ‘West Side Story’ experience, it really is a family. There’s a closeness that has continued.”

Today, Chakiris still stays busy pursuing his other passion — designing jewelry. He described it as “a small business,” but one that continues to grow.

“That was never my intention,” he said. “But it was just great making things with your hand. It’s just a gratifying thing to do. I really love it. I didn’t call an agent for an acting job at all. Now I was just doing something else, not as a career change. I just was doing something new that I really loved doing. It ended up taking all my time. I really enjoyed that.”",Marilyn Monroe co-star George Chakiris spills on working with the blonde bombshell,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/03/marilyn-monroe-co-star-george-chakiris-spills-on-working-with-blonde-bombshell.html

Scott Ostrem, 47, was taken into custody without incident after police stopped his red Mitsubishi Mirage at an intersection less than 10 miles away from the Walmart he had attacked, FOX31 Denver reported.

Authorities descended on an apartment complex believed to be associated with Ostrem after they received an anonymous tip.

Now, nearly a year later, the Democratic Party is awash in competing narratives.
And they, not Stanley Greenberg, are writing the Democratic Party’s talking points.
The Democratic activist class does not trust its elite representatives; they were sold out to by an opaque and corrupt party.","Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, is in search of absolution. In a cloyingly self-pitying article for Politico Magazine excerpted from her upcoming book, she reveals the extent to which the DNC willingly surrendered control of the organization to Hillary Clinton’s campaign well before Clinton became the party’s presidential nominee.

In the article, Brazile scolds her predecessors at the DNC and scolds President Obama and his allies for allowing the party’s fundraising apparatuses to atrophy. But most of all, she attacks Hillary Clinton.

Brazile alleges that the joint fundraising agreement the DNC signed with the Clinton campaign in August was “unethical,” a claim disputed by DNC Chairman Tom Perez. And she confesses to being disturbed by her inability to confirm that the DNC was not trying to “throw the primary” to Clinton.

Finally, Brazile reveals that she knew all along that the polls couldn’t be trusted, even if the Democratic Party’s elected representatives and pollsters had no idea. “I found a lack of enthusiasm for her (Clinton) everywhere,” she confessed to Bernie Sanders alone.

Brazile could endure the shame of secretly relaying Democratic primary debate questions to Hillary Clinton when the Clintons were the powers that be. But those days are over. Now it’s Bernie Sanders’ party, and Brazile is surely hoping her offering to the new overlords will be satisfactory.

It’s not necessary to buy every detail of Brazile’s account to see the writing on the wall. When asked about Brazile’s confessional and whether that meant that the primary was rigged against Sanders, progressive darling Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., replied flatly, “yes.”

This is no country for a Clinton.

Brazile’s self-serving effort to expose the Democratic Party’s skeletons is a step toward recovery. It demonstrates that the party’s efforts to avoid conducting an “autopsy” on its failed effort in the 2016 election can only be suppressed for so long.

Democratic lawmakers and party insiders have gone to great lengths to ensure that any postmortem on the 2016 race is kept under wraps. But rather than controlling the direction in which the party’s post-2016 debate will flow, the Democratic Party has inadvertently let activists and pollsters perform the dissections on the party’s 2016 corpse.

A study conducted by the Democratic political research firm Global Strategy Group, for example, found that the Democratic Party’s base voters actually did turn out to vote. But the problem for Democrats was that many of them turned out to vote for Donald Trump.

“Those Obama-Trump voters, in fact, effectively accounted for more than two-thirds of the reason Clinton lost,” the report said.

Another study conducted by the super PAC Priorities USA learned that voters in swing states, including many Democrats, thought the Democratic Party was more likely than the GOP to favor the wealthy, and voted accordingly.

It’s all rather confusing and often conflicting. Now, nearly a year later, the Democratic Party is awash in competing narratives. In a comprehensive New York Times Magazine piece, Robert Draper examines a party at war with itself – not over policy, but over tone and tactics.

For example, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel helped engineer a Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006 by hunting for conservative Democratic prospects to run in conservative districts.

“When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at,” Emmanuel confessed. “‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

Emmanuel is still getting yelled at. Progressive Change Campaign Committee founder Stephanie Taylor attacked Emanuel’s “50-state strategy” for, of all things, only being able to maintain control of the House for four years. Had the party run true-blue progressives in those red districts, she said, the Democrats might have enjoyed more “lasting success.”

The impulse to impose ideologically progressive homogeneity on the Democratic Party is evident in how the progressive activist base responded to Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie’s foray into immigration-related issues.

Gillespie’s decision to make the matters of the MS-13 gang and sanctuary cities an issue in the Virginia gubernatorial campaign has offended the sensibilities of his Democratic opponents. They claim, correctly, that MS-13’s presence in Virginia is, while not negligible, numerically modest. They add that there are no sanctuary cities in Virginia.

To even raise this issue is to inflame cultural tensions toward no higher purpose than dividing the electorate against itself and stoking racial anxieties. But it wasn’t until the Democratic candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, confirmed that he would sign an anti-sanctuary city bill if one crossed his desk that the progressive left truly revealed its capacity for inchoate rage.

“Northam caves to opponent’s racist ads on sanctuary cities,” the progressive blog Think Progress barked.

Ezra Levin, one half of a team of activists lauded in Politico as responsible for crafting the “playbook for stonewalling the Trump presidency,” attacked his favored candidate, writing that “parroting Gillespie’s hateful xenophobia is despicable.”

The Nation’s Washington editor, George Zornick, mourned the Northam campaign’s validation of “Gillespie’s racist narrative.”

The activist organization Democracy for America went a step further and dubbed the Northam campaign itself a “racist” organization.

This isn’t political analysis; it’s a primal scream. Moreover, it has blinded progressives to the fact that local candidates know best how to appeal to their constituents.

A Monmouth University survey released Oct. 17 found Gillespie’s message on crime and immigration resonating with voters. Gillespie’s image on crime had improved markedly over the course of one month, coinciding with a decline in overall support for Northam.

“This is a game of inches right now, so any small advantage counts,"" said Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray.

Northam’s struggles are indicative of a broader problem with a party that has outsourced agenda-setting to the activist base. Longtime Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg recently warned his party that the Democratic brand is “weakening” and the opportunities the party could enjoy in 2018 will be forfeited if Democrats do not develop a concise agenda.

Greenberg advised Democrats to hammer away on the GOP’s failure to preserve access to health insurance, preserve entitlement programs, or protect the little guy from abuse. Greenberg’s firm found that the message that tests best with voters is a familiar one: “Trickle-down has failed and the richest need to pay their fair share of taxes.”

The dirty secret is that the Democratic Party’s activist base is not animated by messages like these. The activists get out of bed in the morning ready to do cultural battle with pro-Trump forces, not over economic issues but cultural concerns. And they, not Stanley Greenberg, are writing the Democratic Party’s talking points.

Say what you will about the GOP’s 2012 “autopsy,” at least the Republican Party engaged in an open display of introspection in the wake of a humiliating defeat. The autopsy galvanized a Republican activist base resentful of what it saw as the false elite consensus around diversity and immigration, and vowed to show the party leaders why they were wrong.

Perhaps mindful that Donald Trump’s nomination represented a repudiation of that Republican autopsy’s recommendations, Democrats have opted to pass on the public self-flagellation. In the process, though, they’ve only hastened the same reckoning that Republicans endured.

The Democratic activist class does not trust its elite representatives; they were sold out to by an opaque and corrupt party. They do not share their representatives’ enthusiasm for road-worn talking points about Reaganomics. They see the rise of Trump as an urgent threat, but their representatives do not appear to share their burning apprehension.

That’s according to a new study from research firm YouGov and Washington, D.C.-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, which surveyed over 2,000 people regarding their views on socialism and the communist political system. The biggest takeaway from the study was that one out of every two millennials surveyed said they would rather live in a socialist or communist country over a capitalist democracy like the U.S.

“Millennials now make up the largest generation in America, and we're seeing some deeply worrisome trends,"" Marion Smith, executive director of the foundation said in a statement to Fox News. ""Millennials are increasingly turning away from capitalism and toward socialism and even communism as a viable alternative.”

Nearly 45 percent of millennials polled said that they would prefer to live in a socialist country compared to the 42 percent who said they preferred a capitalist one. Another 7 percent said that the preferred living in a communist country above all. The findings show that the percentage of millennials who prefer socialism over capitalism if a full 10 points higher than that of the general population.

By comparison, over half of baby boomers polled favor capitalism, compared to 26 percent who support a socialist system.

The report also found that one in five Americans in their 20s consider former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin a hero, despite his genocide of Ukrainians and Orthodox priests. Over a quarter of millennials polled also thought the same for Vladimir Lenin and Kim Jong Un.

One of the most troubling findings of the report is that over 40 percent of Americans believe that there should be restrictions placed on the First Amendment and free speech to ensure that anything being said is not “offensive.”

The survey also uncovered that a basic working knowledge of communism among all Americans is lacking.

Seven out of 10 Americans do not know the definition of communism as it is most often confused with socialism. The same amount also underestimates the number of people who have been killed by communist regimes.

""This troubling turn highlights widespread historical illiteracy in American society regarding socialism and the systemic failure of our education system to teach students about the genocide, destruction, and misery caused by communism since the Bolshevik Revolution one hundred years ago,” Smith said.","Millennials think socialism would create a great safe space, study finds",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/03/millennials-think-socialism-would-create-great-safe-space-study-finds.html

The new regulations were designed to avoid questions about the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas and other political topics.

The statement comes following a backlash by artists, including from the co-host for the awards show, Brad Paisley.

""I'm sure the CMA will do the right thing and rescind these ridiculous and unfair press guidelines. In 3...2....1.....,"" Paisley tweeted Friday.

After the decision was reversed Paisley tweeted, ""Bravo CMA awards for doing the right thing & apologizing for this mistake. All are welcome, let's have a great show.""

The CMA's original statement was as follows:

“In light of recent events, and out of respect for the artists directly or indirectly involved, please refrain from focusing your coverage of the CMA Awards Red Carpet and Backstage Media Center on the Las Vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like,” read the guidelines provided to Fox News.

“It’s vital, more so this year than in years past due to the sensitivities at hand, that the CMA Awards be a celebration of Country Music and the artists that make this genre so great. It’s an evening to honor the outstanding achievements in Country Music of the previous year and we want everyone to feel comfortable talking to press about this exciting time.”

A representative for the CMAs noted to Fox News that “all outlets must agree for access” to the event. The 51st Annual CMA Awards are scheduled to take place in Nashville, Tennessee on November 8.

At a media preview Thursday in New York City, with hosts Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley, The Associated Press asked the performers about the Vegas shooting. The stars said they want to honor the victims’ families during the show.

The world of country music has been in unique and unfamiliar territory of late following the tragedy in Las Vegas at a Jason Aldean concert that left nearly 60 people dead. Additionally, one of the genre's most popular publicists, Kirt Webster, is embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal.

What’s it like to guide a disabled person for Achilles International in the New York City Marathon?
It’s not hard to understand why hundreds of able-bodied athletes will run this Sunday as guides for Achilles.","The Babylonian Talmud teaches: “Because you have greeted one who cannot see, you merit to be greeted by the One who cannot be seen.” Inspiring words that would be reason enough for me to serve as a guide runner for a blind athlete in Sunday’s New York City Marathon. But there are other reasons as well.

Sunday will be the sixth time in the last eight years that I’ve run the marathon in New York as a guide runner for runners with disabilities, always under the auspices of Achilles International. The mission of the organization is “to enable people with all types of disabilities to participate in mainstream running events in order to promote personal achievement.”

Achilles is the brainchild of Dick Traum, a wheelchair-bound athlete who competed in New York back when the marathon was a series of loops around Central Park. He wondered: What if there were facilities and a training program to aid athletes with disabilities from around the globe in their quest to run marathons?

Well, now all that exists.

Sunday morning, hundreds of athletes with every conceivable disability, from Manhattan to Mongolia, along with their able-bodied guides, will gather at the Achilles tent in the shadow of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.

The athletes include veterans who have lost limbs in battle, individuals born with disabilities, and others who have overcome the unimaginable to make it to the starting line in New York.

The athletes I guided in past years were: a deaf man from California; a South African survivor of a car accident that left him with a stroke and brain damage; a woman from New Jersey with scoliosis (a condition that causes curvature of the spine); a woman from North Carolina with severe GI tract issues; and a French cancer survivor in his early 70s.

The woman with scoliosis had the best line. “My doctor said I could only run two miles a day,” she told me. “I decided I’d do two weeks worth of running today.”

My wildest moment (so far): In 2010, the night before the race, I went into a drugstore and ran into the Chilean miner who had trained for New York by running laps while trapped underground for 69 days. I’d seen him the night before on Letterman.

Turned out he knew little about the “lore” of marathoning – Vaseline to avoid chafing; carrying snacks on the course; and insoles because his running shoes didn’t quite fit.

So we talked, through his interpreter, and shopped for half an hour.

We came out of the store and a crowd had gathered – he was something of a celebrity back then. He pointed back to me, as everybody was trying to get selfies and autographs, and shouted, “I love you, boy!”

My hardest experience as a guide came with my French runner. My fellow guide and I literally linked arms with him and walked him the length of the course. This was in 2014, when crosswinds on the Verrazano and on Manhattan side streets reached over 50 mph. I’ve never been so cold, but our guy made it.

So why do people with disabilities run with guides? New Yorkers (and their guests) are an aggressive lot, and it never hurts to have someone to keep you from getting jostled on the course. Also, in case of injury or inability to finish, the guide provides company and reassurance until help arrives.

The Achilles athletes in wheelchairs or handcarts don’t need guides; they would be too fast for guides, anyway.

Last year, a father pushed his son in a wheelchair the length of the race. Now that’s athleticism.

What’s it like to guide a disabled person for Achilles International in the New York City Marathon?

The closest comparison I can offer is the scenes in the film “A Hard Day’s Night,” where the London cops escorted the Beatles as they rushed past their fans from limo to hotel.

New Yorkers recognize the yellow Achilles T-shirts, and they go bonkers for the runners with disabilities.

The spectators may not know exactly what disability a given runner possesses, but they certainly understand – and applaud – the intense courage it takes for a person with disabilities to go 26.2 miles.

This year my blind runner comes from New Zealand, and a scrum of guides will surround him. One in front to clear the path, two on either side, and one in back. Projected finish time: 7 hours, 30 minutes.

But what’s the rush?

It’s not hard to understand why hundreds of able-bodied athletes will run this Sunday as guides for Achilles. Where else can you get the runner’s high and the helper’s high – all at the same time – and then get a medal as a reward for your efforts?

Where else can you help make someone’s impossible dream come true, with 2 million people cheering you on?

As Achilles International says on its website: “While our programs focus on running, the truth is, running is simply the tool for accomplishing our main objective: to bring hope, inspiration, and the joys of achievement to all.”

About 1,900 years ago, the Stoic philosopher Epictetus wrote, “God divided man into men that they might help one another.”

How Do I Know Whether My Transmission Fluid Needs to Be Changed?","Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site.

Taking care of your car or truck’s transmission is important for its long-term health. But all too often, car owners misunderstand the basic maintenance that’s needed to keep a gearbox running smoothly. Consumer Reports’ chief mechanic, John Ibbotson, explains what you need to know.

Do I Need to Have My Transmission Fluid Changed?

The simple answer is “yes.” But service intervals for new vehicles can exceed 100,000 miles before this needs to be done.

That makes this seemingly clear-cut advice something of a conundrum for car owners. Those who don’t hold on to a new vehicle for very long may never have to have the transmission fluid changed.

On the other hand, factoring in that service is good advice for any owner who plans to keep a vehicle for an extended period of time—or for someone who has bought a used car with high mileage.

The time and cost involved vary from car to car. According to Repair Pal, a CR partner, getting this work done on a 2010 Camry in Rochester, N.Y., should cost $163 to $242.

Whatever the price might be, it’s necessary work. Getting the fluid replaced is certainly going to cost you less than replacing a transmission that’s been left in the lurch by skimping on service requirements. Failing to properly maintain your car’s transmission could leave you stranded and with a big repair bill.

Simple online tools can be invaluable when it comes to knowing whether your car or truck has been subject to any recalls. Other than regular service, your transmission might be due for some important repairs—or have an extended warranty—because of a past recall. (Go to the CR Car Recall Tracker.)

How Often Do I Need to Have My Transmission Fluid Changed?

The best advice is to know your car and the manufacturer’s recommended service intervals.

It’s worth noting that intervals for changing transmission fluid vary widely. For some cars and trucks, it can range from as little as 30,000 miles to more than 100,000 miles. Some new vehicles, especially those fitted with automatic gearboxes, have transmissions that are almost sealed shut, with fluid that’s meant to last the lifetime of the car.

Remember that unlike engine oil, transmission fluid should never burn off. And a tell-tale sign of a transmission leak will be a puddle of red liquid on the ground, usually underneath the middle or front of the car.

Should I Have My Mechanic Flush My Transmission Fluid?

First, it’s helpful to understand the role transmission fluid plays in a car’s operation. Transmission fluid helps keep mechanical components cool and lubricated, whether it’s an automatic or manual gearbox. Over time, the transmission’s interior components wear down and tiny particles contaminate the fluid. This could potentially lead to damage.

Getting rid of this dirty fluid makes sense, right? If it’s called for in the service manual, go ahead and let your mechanic do the job.

“This shouldn’t be a frequent occurrence, since a gearbox in good working order would not have metal shavings polluting the fluid over a short period of time,"" Ibbotson says. ""If that’s the case, it’s likely a sign of a bigger and more complicated problem.”

“There is also a distinction between simply draining and refilling a transmission versus power-flushing the system,” he adds. “In a high-mileage car, power-flushing the transmission fluid can dislodge sludge and other particles, leading to clogs even after the clean fluid has been added.”

Again, the best advice is to research your vehicle and know exactly when a transmission drain (or flush) is recommended. Doing either option too often is a waste of time and money.

Does My Manual Transmission Need Fluid, Too?

Yes, even a manual needs transmission fluid. The type of fluid can vary from car to car, however. Some manuals require conventional engine oil and others function best with automatic transmission fluid. So make sure you’re putting in the fluid that’s specified for your car. Failing to do so can rapidly affect its performance and the gearbox’s longevity.

Car owners with a continuously variable transmission (CVTs) will also want to pay special attention to the needs of their vehicle. Unlike a traditional automatic that has a set number of gears, a CVT often relies on a belt or pulley system to operate an infinite number of gear ratios. Make sure you use a CVT-specific fluid or you’ll risk big headaches (and repair bills) down the road.

How Do I Know Whether My Transmission Fluid Needs to Be Changed?

Checking transmission fluid isn’t always easy. In many cases, it’s necessary to have a mechanic put your car on a lift for examination. Some cars do have a transmission dipstick or reservoir in the engine bay, so check under the hood first.

Even though fluid levels might look fine, it could be harder to discern whether there are pollutants or small metal particles in the fluid. “If your car is in for routine maintenance, ask your mechanic to check the transmission fluid,” Ibbotson says.

Separating transmission maintenance from breakdowns is trickier. In a malfunctioning automatic, gearshifts might become more abrupt and occur at awkward intervals. For a car with a manual gearbox, the feel and action of the gear lever could become stiffer and more balky in regular daily operation. These types of problems probably indicate an issue with the gearbox itself. If you experience any of them, let your mechanic know right away.

Is Changing the Transmission Fluid an Easy DIY Job?

It can be a complicated and messy task for the average car owner. “Accessing the transmission requires ramps, jackstands, or a lift,” Ibbotson says. “Even then, getting to the fill plug can require a higher degree of patience and dexterity than what’s required for a typical change of engine oil.”

Many modern cars—the ones with fluid guaranteed for the life of the vehicle—have transmissions that are basically sealed tight, making them all but impossible to work on for the average DIY’er.

If Republican candidate Ed Gillespie can defeat Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam for the position now held by a term-limited Democrat, his victory would be prime proof for Republicans across the country that the conservative movement is alive, well and on the ascendency.

Both former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have toured the state raising money for the candidate of each of their parties. President Trump regularly tweets support for Gillespie and attacks Northam. A flood of other politicians, journalists and commentators have suddenly taken an interest in the governor’s race as well.

It is no secret that in the past few years conservatives have been deeply worried about how changing demographics and a coarser discourse could affect the conservative movement’s future appeal. These worries were further amplified last year as many Republicans in Washington and beyond were concerned about how President Trump’s rash statements at times would affect the GOP’s appeal to Hispanic-Americans, women and other demographic groups.

However, on Election Day last year many of those doubts were temporarily put to rest as Donald Trump scored stronger than expected support among all these groups, according to exit polls. Yet many still worried that this was just an exception in an overall downward trend for Republicans.

Virginia is a strong test case for the Republican Party’s future appeal because it is a state that has for so long been out of the reach of conservatives. A diverse state in nearly every way, no Republican has won statewide since 2009, with a steadily declining share of the vote since then.

In last year’s presidential race, Hillary Clinton carried the state with nearly 50 percent of the vote and President Trump received just over 44 percent.

As one of the Virginia GOP’s statewide Electoral College members and a campaign official on the Trump campaign in the state, I got to see and participate firsthand in the efforts to help President Trump win in Virginia – sadly, to no avail.

However this year looks different. Republicans are still energized by the extraordinary victory of President Trump and congressional Republicans last year, as well as the string of special election wins this year. Recent polling has also shown positive signs for Gillespie, with a Hampton University poll a few days ago showing him up 8 points over Northam.

Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman and White House counselor for President George W. Bush, has run an incredible campaign in Virginia. He has combined the inclusive and aspirational Reagan-Bush approach – as represented by his slogan “For ALL Virginians” – with strong concern for the working-class voters who were so essential to President Trump’s victory nationwide.

While reaching out to ethnic communities and business leaders in Northern Virginia, Gillespie has also toured rural and Appalachian Southwest Virginia to talk about the opioid crisis and providing economic opportunity for those employed in industrial jobs.

If Gillespie loses, it would show that Virginia’s extremely lopsided political demographics remain difficult to overcome.

But if Gillespie wins, Republicans across the country may find that the strange coalition we’ve built in Virginia is a new and lasting one for our modern era. It is a coalition that that can help Republicans nationwide in reinvigorating the conservative movement and ending much of the “establishment versus grassroots” infighting that has characterized Republican politics in recent years.

I’ve personally worked tirelessly on Gillespie’s campaign over the past two years, serving on his Jobs and Economic Growth Policy Working Group as well as several other roles from the early primary campaign until now. I know he and his pro-growth and inclusive leadership style will allow him be an excellent governor for Virginia.

Furthermore, Gillespie can be an inspiration for conservatives across the nation looking for a leader whose style other Republicans can follow to victory.

In the hands of a bad actor, Trump’s Twitter account could even be used to target certain corporate valuations or market segments.""

The brief deactivation of Trump’s Twitter account on Thursday also sparked amusement on social media, with some people hailing the rogue employee as a “hero.” The employee has not been named.

If Republican candidate Ed Gillespie can defeat Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam for the position now held by a term-limited Democrat, his victory would be prime proof for Republicans across the country that the conservative movement is alive, well and on the ascendency.

Both former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have toured the state raising money for the candidate of each of their parties. President Trump regularly tweets support for Gillespie and attacks Northam. A flood of other politicians, journalists and commentators have suddenly taken an interest in the governor’s race as well.

It is no secret that in the past few years conservatives have been deeply worried about how changing demographics and a coarser discourse could affect the conservative movement’s future appeal. These worries were further amplified last year as many Republicans in Washington and beyond were concerned about how President Trump’s rash statements at times would affect the GOP’s appeal to Hispanic-Americans, women and other demographic groups.

However, on Election Day last year many of those doubts were temporarily put to rest as Donald Trump scored stronger than expected support among all these groups, according to exit polls. Yet many still worried that this was just an exception in an overall downward trend for Republicans.

Virginia is a strong test case for the Republican Party’s future appeal because it is a state that has for so long been out of the reach of conservatives. A diverse state in nearly every way, no Republican has won statewide since 2009, with a steadily declining share of the vote since then.

In last year’s presidential race, Hillary Clinton carried the state with nearly 50 percent of the vote and President Trump received just over 44 percent.

As one of the Virginia GOP’s statewide Electoral College members and a campaign official on the Trump campaign in the state, I got to see and participate firsthand in the efforts to help President Trump win in Virginia – sadly, to no avail.

However this year looks different. Republicans are still energized by the extraordinary victory of President Trump and congressional Republicans last year, as well as the string of special election wins this year. Recent polling has also shown positive signs for Gillespie, with a Hampton University poll a few days ago showing him up 8 points over Northam.

Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman and White House counselor for President George W. Bush, has run an incredible campaign in Virginia. He has combined the inclusive and aspirational Reagan-Bush approach – as represented by his slogan “For ALL Virginians” – with strong concern for the working-class voters who were so essential to President Trump’s victory nationwide.

While reaching out to ethnic communities and business leaders in Northern Virginia, Gillespie has also toured rural and Appalachian Southwest Virginia to talk about the opioid crisis and providing economic opportunity for those employed in industrial jobs.

If Gillespie loses, it would show that Virginia’s extremely lopsided political demographics remain difficult to overcome.

But if Gillespie wins, Republicans across the country may find that the strange coalition we’ve built in Virginia is a new and lasting one for our modern era. It is a coalition that that can help Republicans nationwide in reinvigorating the conservative movement and ending much of the “establishment versus grassroots” infighting that has characterized Republican politics in recent years.

I’ve personally worked tirelessly on Gillespie’s campaign over the past two years, serving on his Jobs and Economic Growth Policy Working Group as well as several other roles from the early primary campaign until now. I know he and his pro-growth and inclusive leadership style will allow him be an excellent governor for Virginia.

Furthermore, Gillespie can be an inspiration for conservatives across the nation looking for a leader whose style other Republicans can follow to victory.

The conservative movement is in need of bold leaders, and hopefully in a few days we here in Virginia will be electing a truly extraordinary one.",A GOP victory in the Virginia governor's race would inspire conservatives nationwide,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/gop-victory-in-virginia-governors-race-would-inspire-conservatives-nationwide.html

A high-level employee at Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holding Co. told The Associated Press that the royal— who is one of the world's richest men— was among those detained overnight Saturday. The company's stock was down nearly 9 percent in trading Sunday on the Saudi stock exchange.

The surprise arrests, which also reportedly include two of the late King Abdullah's sons, were hailed by pro-government media outlets as the greatest sign yet that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is keeping his promise to reform the country, long been plagued by allegations of corruption at the highest levels of government.

Analysts have suggested the arrest of once-untouchable members of the royal family is the latest sign that the 32-year-old crown prince is moving to quash potential rivals or critics. The prince's swift rise to power has unnerved more experienced, elder members of the ruling Al Saud family, which has long ruled by consensus, though ultimate decision-making remains with the monarch.

The king named his son, the crown prince, as head of an anti-corruption committee established late Saturday, just hours before its arrest of top officials.

A Saudi government official with close ties to security says 11 princes and 38 others are being held in five-star hotels across the capital, Riyadh. The official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.

The scale of the arrests is unprecedented in Saudi Arabia, where senior royals and their business associates were seen as operating above the law. Saudi nationals have long complained of rampant corruption in government and of public funds being squandered or misused by people in power.

Shortly before the arrests, King Salman had ousted Prince Miteb bin Abdullah from his post as head of the National Guard. The prince is reportedly among those detained in the sweep, as is his brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, who was once governor of Riyadh. Both are sons of the late King Abdullah, who ruled before his half brother King Salman.

Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne.

Saudi Twitter accounts released several other names of those arrested, such as: Alwalid al-Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman with ties to the royal family who runs the Arabic satellite group MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, the former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Ibrahim Assaf, the former finance minister; and Bakr Binladin, head of the Saudi Binladin Group, a major business conglomerate.

An earlier crackdown on perceived critics of the crown prince included clerics, writers, lesser-known princes and Saudi figures popular on social media.

""The dismissals and detentions suggest that Prince Mohammed rather than forging alliances is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the national guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,"" James M. Dorsey, a Gulf specialist and senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said an analysis of the shake-up.

Saudi Arabia said late Saturday it intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen at Riyadh International Airport, on the outskirts of the capital. The crown prince, as defense minister, oversees the stalemated war against Yemen's Iranian-allied rebels.

The Finance Ministry said the anti-corruption probe ""opens a new era of transparency and accountability,"" enhances confidence in the rule of law and improves the kingdom's investment climate.

Reports suggested those detained were being held in the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, which only days earlier hosted a major investment conference.

Marriott International said in a statement that it is currently evaluating the situation at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. ""As a matter of guest privacy, we do not discuss the guests or groups with whom we do business or may be visitors of the hotel,"" the statement added.

It is not clear what Prince Alwaleed or others are being investigated for.

The Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel said the anti-corruption probe was looking into the response to flooding in Jiddah that killed around 120 people in 2009 and devastated the city again in 2011, as well as the government's handling of a Coronavirus outbreak that has killed several hundred people in recent years.

Prince Alwaleed's many investments include Twitter, Apple, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Citigroup, and the Four Seasons, Fairmont and Movenpick hotel chains. He is also an investor in ride-sharing services Lyft and Careem.

The prince, often pictured on his 85.65-meter (281 foot) superyacht in the Mediterranean, is among the most outspoken Saudi royals and a longtime advocate for women's rights. He is also majority owner of the popular Rotana Group of Arabic channels.

The AP reached out overnight to Kingdom Holding for comment. There was no response as of Sunday afternoon. The senior employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of repercussions, said security bodies informed him of the arrest.

The kingdom's top council of clerics issued a statement saying it is an Islamic duty to fight corruption— essentially giving religious backing to the high-level arrests being reported. A top royal court official, Badr al-Asaker, on Sunday appeared to confirm the arrests on Twitter, describing a ""historic and black night against the corrupt.""

The government said the anti-corruption committee has the right to issue arrest warrants, impose travel restrictions and freeze bank accounts. It can also trace funds, prevent the transfer of funds or the liquidation of assets, and take other precautionary measures until cases are referred to the judiciary.

Meanwhile, Prince Miteb was replaced by a lesser known royal, Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin, to head the National Guard— a prestigious force tasked with protecting the royal family, important holy sites in Mecca and Medina, and oil and gas sites.

Just three months earlier, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was plucked from the line of succession and from his post as interior minister, overseeing internal security.

It’s also extremely rare, but holding in a sneeze can cause the rupture of aneurysm, a condition where part of your artery wall weakens, causing a bulge.","It’s always the worst time when that urge to sneeze hits—a quiet movie theater, an elevator packed with people, or right before you lean in you kiss your date goodnight.

There are just some times when you don’t want to spray snot all over the place. So is it safe to hold in a sneeze? We checked in with experts to find out what’s exactly behind your sneezing, and what can happen to your body if you try to snuffle one.

Why do we sneeze in the first place?

Sneezing is a complex physiological reflex. It occurs when you breathe in an irritating substance or particle, which passes through your nostrils into the lining of your nose.

This triggers a release of histamine, irritating the nerve cells in your nasal lining that travels from your trigeminal nerve—which provides sensation to your face—to your brain, explained Dale Amanda Tylor, M.D., M.P.H., otolaryngologist at ENT Associates of Santa Barbara. (Nasal congestion or allergies can spark the release of histamine, too.)

FDA WARNS ON 'POT CURES CANCER' CLAIMS

When your brain gets the signal, it activates your throat muscles, and tells your lungs to release a powerful burst of air through your windpipe, she says. This release of air occurs to push out the particles that are irritating your nose.

""Sneezes are so powerful that [your snot can] travel the dimensions of a room and land up to 6 to 8 meters away,"" said Erich Voigt, M.D., clinical associate professor in the department of otolaryngology at NYU Langone Health.

What happens if you hold in a sneeze?

All that pressure has to go somewhere.

“If you keep the mouth or nose closed, the generated pressure will back up into your head (sinuses), nasal cavity, or down the throat back into the chest,"" said Voigt. ""Suppressing the sneeze by holding the nose or mouth leads to a noticeable increase in pressure, about 5 to 24 times of that during a normal sneeze.”

Still, snuffling a sneeze is so quick, so that rise in pressure is over fast. That means it can’t be harmful, right? Well, not exactly.

""It’s kind of like saying that when Floyd Mayweather punches you, his glove is in contact with your face for only a fraction of a second,” said Ahmad R. Sedaghat, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor in the department of otolaryngology at Harvard Medical School. “But because the force/pressure during that fraction of second is so high, it can do real damage.”

What are the health effects of holding in a sneeze?

That trapped pressure can be the reason that holding in a sneeze can be dangerous, he said.

For one, your ears can be at risk. When you hold in a sneeze, air and pressure can travel up your Eustachian tubes—small passageways linking your throat to your middle ear—and cause your eardrum to rupture.

BOY'S CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS LEAD TO TUMOR DIAGNOSIS

""In the more severe case, instead of the air rupturing the ear drum, it leads to rupture of the delicate structures of the inner ear causing permanent hearing loss,"" Sedaghat said.

The pressure of holding in a sneeze can also cause you to pop a small blood vessel in your eye, nose, or eardrum, but that’s very rare, said Tylor.

It’s also extremely rare, but holding in a sneeze can cause the rupture of aneurysm, a condition where part of your artery wall weakens, causing a bulge.

“With an aneurysm, a weak part of [a blood vessel in the brain] could rupture at any time, or never rupture at all—but a sudden change in intracranial pressure could cause it to rupture,” said Tylor. “That would probably less common than getting struck by lightning.”

And before you freak out, the people most at risk of the serious injuries generally have health conditions that leave them more susceptible, like abnormal blood vessels, or have had recent sinus, vascular, or brain surgery, or a head, neck or chest injury of some kind, said Voigt.

Bottom line: Should you hold in your sneeze?

Let them rip: The function of the sneeze is to allow a release of pressure. If you hold it in, not only are you not allowing your body to do its job—clear out those nasal irritants—but you’re also putting your body at risk by containing that pressure.

Still, if there is a time when you really don’t want to sneeze, you can try to stimulate your other sensory nerves, which can help block your sneeze reflex, said Tylor. By blocking it at that step, you wouldn’t be trapping any pressure.

HOSPITAL, FAMILY TO DISCUSS TODDLER'S STALLED KIDNEY TRANSPLANT AMID PROTESTS

""You can sometimes prevent it by blowing the nose, or pressing on the region of the lip just below the nose, or rubbing the nose,"" she said.

And if you do sneeze, make sure you follow proper sneezing etiquette when it comes to spreading germs.

""Covering with a hand, which most of us were taught as kids, is now considered outdated advice,"" said Tylor. ""The name of the game now is sneeze into your elbow (which you don't use to touch things like doorknobs or tablet screens or keyboards) or to sneeze into a tissue and then wash your hands right after.""

It's not that this method diminishes your spray of saliva and mucus, but since you don't touch a lot with your elbow, you're essentially protecting others from viral or bacterial particles in your sneeze.

Second, we must force the big tech companies to help our security services track down terrorists and prevent attacks.","Programming Alert: Watch ""The Next Revolution with Steve Hilton"" Sunday evenings at 9pm ET on Fox News Channel.

Another sickening Islamist terror attack, this time on the streets of New York. On each occasion we seem to go through the same ritual -- sympathy, condemnation, a parade of well-meaning statements from government officials insisting that the terrorists “will not win.”

Fine. But forgive me for feeling a certain sense of frustration. The truth is, we are not taking this threat seriously enough. Our response needs to be much more aggressive.

First though, let’s give credit where it’s due. Our brave men and women have taken the fight to ISIS in the Middle East, and by all accounts have done a spectacular job. For years, our security services have worked patiently and relentlessly to track down terror plots. They have foiled many and saved countless lives. For that we should be unequivocally grateful.

It’s not their response that I question: but the response of our leaders, in government and the bureaucracy. They still seem to be treating Islamist terror as a law enforcement issue, rather than what it is: a war waged on us by an ideologically-driven and globally-distributed enemy.

Big Tech is investing billions in artificial intelligence and virtual reality -- let’s see some of that directed towards identifying potential terrorist murderers.

Here are four things we could do that would show we are serious in this fight.

First, we should remove all known Islamists from our country. If they are not U.S. citizens, they should be immediately deported. If they are naturalized U.S. citizens, they should first have their citizenship revoked. As the former head of the UK’s crisis response committee, Colonel Richard Kemp said after the Manchester terror attack earlier this year, “Every single person who we have intelligence upon, who is known to be involved in terrorism...we deport and send them back to where they came from. We do not allow them to roam free on our streets and murder and maim and disfigure our children.”

Of course, in order to do this we need to know how many such people there are. After Manchester, British authorities announced that they know of 23,000 Islamist extremists who are potential terrorist attackers living in the UK. How many are there in America? It’s time the FBI told us.

Second, we must force the big tech companies to help our security services track down terrorists and prevent attacks. When there’s money to be made, there’s no limit to Silicon Valley’s ingenuity -- or invasion of privacy. Google announced earlier this year that it can track your online browsing and your movements in the real world by combining credit card data with data from your smartphone and services like Google Maps. But when the authorities ask tech firms to help in the fight against terror, suddenly they’re all about privacy. Big Tech is investing billions in artificial intelligence and virtual reality -- let’s see some of that directed towards identifying potential terrorist murderers.

Third, we need to force Saudi Arabia to pay reparations for their role in incubating today’s terror threat. Over the years, the Saudis have funded a huge number mosques in the world -- and with that funding came the vile, medieval strain of Islam known as Wahhabism (or Salafism) that is at the heart of today’s Islamist ideology, whether practiced by ISIS, Al Qaeda or any other of the murderous death cults. The least the Saudis could now do is put some of their oil riches towards building and supporting moderate mosques on the same scale they funded extremist ones.

Fourth, we need to toughen our own immigration procedures, just as President Trump pledged to do this week. No more entry by lottery; extreme vetting for everyone who wants to come to America and fits the profile of a potential Islamist supporter or sympathizer -- whether they have become radicalized or not.

The second generation of its autonomous vehicles is being developed on Uber’s test track, an Uber spokeswoman told Fox News.

Uber's self-driving vehicles made their debut in Pittsburgh in 2016 and have been picking up passengers ever since.

Current models require one or two vehicle operators, Uber Hardware Engineer Brian Zajac told Fox News. An Uber employee sits in the driver's seat and is ready to take over the vehicle when the computer system tells the opertator it needs to go off self-driving mode. Another employee sits in the passenger seat monitoring a map that displays what the vehicle's sensors see in real-time, including bikers, pedestrians and other vehicles. Customers can see what the car ""sees"" through an iPad provided in the back seat.

The next generation is a step closer to having no vehicle operators, Zajac said.

“In the far future, there won’t be any vehicle operator,” Zajac said. “The car rolls up, there’s no human inside at all, and the customer gets in and takes a ride.”

Some of the more immediate changes, which will be incorporated into the third generation of autonomous vehicles, are not easily visible.

“From the outside, a lot looks the same, but under the hood, we’ve made a whole bunch of improvements,” Zajac said.

One of those improvements is a higher resolution set of cameras.

“That extra resolution allows the sensors to see a little bit farther which allows the system to drive a little bit faster,” Zajac said.

The cameras will also have a better cleaning system for inclement weather.

“It’s been redesigned to handle heavier rain and to handle other types of contamination that gets on our cameras,” Zajac said.

The camera system will also have fewer parts to assemble, which would make it easier to mass produce in the future.

Current models have limited trunk space that’s shared with computer equipment. The new version will give passengers the full trunk space of the vehicle.

“You’ll see it’s a nice big open trunk that you can throw all of your luggage, jump in the car and go to the airport or wherever you might be headed,” Zajac said.

For now, Uber’s newest release will not change the passenger experience too much, a spokeswoman said.

Zajac said the engineers will keep pushing toward the goal of full autonomy.

“This is kind of uncharted territory for a lot of companies but there’s a lot of really good other industries we can draw from such as aerospace and the automotive industry,” he said.",Uber prepares next generation of self-driving cars,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/11/03/uber-prepares-next-generation-self-driving-cars.html

The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr. John Wells, the executive director of Military Veterans Advocacy, with the Peoples Health Champion award during last week’s game in New Orleans, according to The Advocate.

On Wednesday he told the organization he was unable to accept the award at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome because of the anthem protests. Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem.

“Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players' disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation,” Wells said. ""I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails. Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it.”

Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. He was set to receive the award given by Medicare to senior citizens who have made significant accomplishments.

The Saints said in a statement Thursday that they were disappointed by Wells’ decision.

“We will not allow Mr. Wells' decision and subsequent media appearances to distract our players and organization from continuing to honor and support our military and veterans,"" the statement read. ""We, as an organization, have decided to move on from this sad and divisive discourse and focus our attention on supporting our military and veterans.”

Q: Is there such a thing as a TV Guide for programs, movies and shows that are streaming online? I want a real simple way to see what’s available on Amazon vs. Apple vs. Hulu vs. YouTube vs. Roku and all the others!

A: There are so many different streaming services available, and each provides a different blend of programming. As you’ve pointed out, it’s hard to tell what flicks and shows are available on each service, especially when titles appear and vanish so unpredictably. You’ll be happy to hear that several different sites have answered the call and can summarize these streaming catalogs at a glance. Click here for easy-to-follow guides to streaming content.

Adjust TV volume

Q: The dialogue on my TV is awful. I can hardly hear people, but the sounds are loud. How can I fix this?

A: When you bring a new TV into your home, it arrives with a lot of arbitrary settings: tint, color, contrast and so on. The volume controls are nearly as important as the picture, because they can dramatically affect the sound of the dialogue, ambient noise and music. There are many ways to fix this problem, but if you’re not accustomed to working with speakers and acoustics, you’ll need a little guidance. Click here to learn about a hidden volume setting.

Comparing smart temperature controls

Q: I was thinking about getting a smart thermostat to save money on heating bills. Is the Nest or Ecobee the better choice?

A: Most of our monthly energy bills relate to the heating and cooling of our homes, and the smarter your thermostat is, the less energy you’ll use. The exciting part of both systems is that they will automatically adapt to your household’s needs. You just have to set the thermostat to its regular settings for about a week, and the internal computer will figure out the rest. Both systems are excellent, but there are a few clear differences. Click here for my recommendation on smart thermostats.

Apple’s virus vulnerability

Q: Is it true that Apple users will never get ransomware?

A: It's true that Apple devices and apps are significantly less vulnerable to viruses and malware than their competitors’ products, but that doesn’t mean your iMac is invincible. In fact, cybercriminals are working around the clock to find new ways to hack into Apple devices, and a new kind of Apple-specific ransomware is now at large. So if you’re dedicated to Mac, the time has come for you to think about protecting yourself. If there are any chinks in your armor, you can bet there’s a hacker who will find them, no matter what brand of computer you own. Click here to learn about new ransomware targeted at Apple products.

Investing in Tech

Q: I invest in the market. What are the best tech stocks?

A: When I was a kid, my dad and I used to pore over the financial pages, and I have been following the stock market religiously ever since. We both know that the market can take unpredictable turns, but certain companies have outstanding records when it comes to profitability, and there is definitely a shortlist of great tech stocks.

The crown prince, as defense minister, oversees the stalemated war against Yemen's Iranian-allied rebels.
This laid the groundwork for the king's son to claim the mantle of crown prince.","Saudi Arabia has arrested dozens of princes, senior military officers, businessmen and top officials, including a well-known royal billionaire with extensive holdings in Western companies, as part of a sweeping anti-corruption probe that further cements control in the hands of its young crown prince.

A high-level employee at Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holding Co. told The Associated Press that the royal— who is one of the world's richest men— was among those detained overnight Saturday. The company's stock was down nearly 9 percent in trading Sunday on the Saudi stock exchange.

The surprise arrests, which also reportedly include two of the late King Abdullah's sons, were hailed by pro-government media outlets as the greatest sign yet that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is keeping his promise to reform the country, long been plagued by allegations of corruption at the highest levels of government.

Analysts have suggested the arrest of once-untouchable members of the royal family is the latest sign that the 32-year-old crown prince is moving to quash potential rivals or critics. The prince's swift rise to power has unnerved more experienced, elder members of the ruling Al Saud family, which has long ruled by consensus, though ultimate decision-making remains with the monarch.

The king named his son, the crown prince, as head of an anti-corruption committee established late Saturday, just hours before its arrest of top officials.

A Saudi government official with close ties to security says 11 princes and 38 others are being held in five-star hotels across the capital, Riyadh. The official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.

The scale of the arrests is unprecedented in Saudi Arabia, where senior royals and their business associates were seen as operating above the law. Saudi nationals have long complained of rampant corruption in government and of public funds being squandered or misused by people in power.

Shortly before the arrests, King Salman had ousted Prince Miteb bin Abdullah from his post as head of the National Guard. The prince is reportedly among those detained in the sweep, as is his brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, who was once governor of Riyadh. Both are sons of the late King Abdullah, who ruled before his half brother King Salman.

Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne.

Saudi Twitter accounts released several other names of those arrested, such as: Alwalid al-Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman with ties to the royal family who runs the Arabic satellite group MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, the former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Ibrahim Assaf, the former finance minister; and Bakr Binladin, head of the Saudi Binladin Group, a major business conglomerate.

An earlier crackdown on perceived critics of the crown prince included clerics, writers, lesser-known princes and Saudi figures popular on social media.

""The dismissals and detentions suggest that Prince Mohammed rather than forging alliances is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the national guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,"" James M. Dorsey, a Gulf specialist and senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said an analysis of the shake-up.

Saudi Arabia said late Saturday it intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen at Riyadh International Airport, on the outskirts of the capital. The crown prince, as defense minister, oversees the stalemated war against Yemen's Iranian-allied rebels.

The Finance Ministry said the anti-corruption probe ""opens a new era of transparency and accountability,"" enhances confidence in the rule of law and improves the kingdom's investment climate.

Reports suggested those detained were being held in the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, which only days earlier hosted a major investment conference.

Marriott International said in a statement that it is currently evaluating the situation at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. ""As a matter of guest privacy, we do not discuss the guests or groups with whom we do business or may be visitors of the hotel,"" the statement added.

It is not clear what Prince Alwaleed or others are being investigated for.

The Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel said the anti-corruption probe was looking into the response to flooding in Jiddah that killed around 120 people in 2009 and devastated the city again in 2011, as well as the government's handling of a Coronavirus outbreak that has killed several hundred people in recent years.

Prince Alwaleed's many investments include Twitter, Apple, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Citigroup, and the Four Seasons, Fairmont and Movenpick hotel chains. He is also an investor in ride-sharing services Lyft and Careem.

The prince, often pictured on his 85.65-meter (281 foot) superyacht in the Mediterranean, is among the most outspoken Saudi royals and a longtime advocate for women's rights. He is also majority owner of the popular Rotana Group of Arabic channels.

The AP reached out overnight to Kingdom Holding for comment. There was no response as of Sunday afternoon. The senior employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of repercussions, said security bodies informed him of the arrest.

The kingdom's top council of clerics issued a statement saying it is an Islamic duty to fight corruption— essentially giving religious backing to the high-level arrests being reported. A top royal court official, Badr al-Asaker, on Sunday appeared to confirm the arrests on Twitter, describing a ""historic and black night against the corrupt.""

The government said the anti-corruption committee has the right to issue arrest warrants, impose travel restrictions and freeze bank accounts. It can also trace funds, prevent the transfer of funds or the liquidation of assets, and take other precautionary measures until cases are referred to the judiciary.

Meanwhile, Prince Miteb was replaced by a lesser known royal, Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin, to head the National Guard— a prestigious force tasked with protecting the royal family, important holy sites in Mecca and Medina, and oil and gas sites.

Just three months earlier, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was plucked from the line of succession and from his post as interior minister, overseeing internal security.

Margulies told Jenny Hutt on her SiriusXM show “Just Jenny” on Friday that a female casting director asked the “ER” actress when she was 23-years-old to meet Seagal in his hotel room to go over a scene, Page Six reported.

Margulies declined the offer due to the late time and that she lived far away.

Margulies said the casting director told her: “Don’t worry, we’ll reimburse you. And I’m here, a woman.”

The Emmy Award-winning actress recounted the uncomfortable encounter she had with Seagal once she went to his hotel room.

“I got to the hotel at 10:40, and she (the casting director) wasn’t there. And he (Seagal) was. Alone. And he made sure that I saw his gun, which I had never seen a gun in real life. And I got out of there unscathed. I never was raped. And I never was harmed. And I don’t know how I got out of that hotel room. I sorta screamed my way out,” Margulies told Hutt.

Margulies did not elaborate further on her encounter with Seagal.

Margulies also told Hutt of a similar encounter she had with Weinstein. Margulies said she went to Weinstein’s room only because she was accompanied by a female assistant.

“He (Weinstein) opened the door, in a bathrobe. I could see that there were candles lit in the room, and there was a dinner for two. And I saw him stare at her (assistant), daggers. And he looked at me, furious. And he slammed the door. And, of course, I didn’t get the part,” Margulies said.

Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by a number of women following last month’s bombshell exposes that revealed the disgraced producer’s inappropriate behavior.

Third-grader Lealond Henderson has spent the first half of this year as the number one ranked mini-bareback rider in the world. But being on top of the Pee Wee Division has come with some hard hits -- even mild concussions.

“And I had a big ol’ rainbow across my head where a horse kicked me when I landed on my hands and knees,” Henderson told FOX4 News.

The 9-year-old is one of the lightest riders in the Pee-Wee division, weighing in at 55 pounds.

Hannah Summers, an 18-year-old nursing student who just started her first year of college, had lost her mother Peggy to kidney cancer on Oct. 31, Huffington Post reports. But just a short while later, Hannah discovered that her mother, who was only 55 when she passed, had previously written a touching letter of encouragement and advice for each of her children, to be opened in the event of her death.

9-YEAR-OLD WITH MONTHS TO LIVE ASKS FOR CHRISTMAS CARDS

“Mom wrote us all letters before her surgery, thinking things could go wrong,” wrote Hannah in a Facebook post she shared on Wednesday. “Although she made it through her surgery, she passed 4 months later.”

At first, Hannah didn’t want to share her mother’s personal message online, but she eventually changed her mind. “The more I read it, the more I feel like I want to,” she said.

In the letter, Peggy Summers tells her daughter not to be angry, but instead to lean on her loved ones for support. She also shared advice about jobs, driving and boys.

""If you are reading this then the surgery did not go well,"" Peggy wrote. “I’m sorry, I tried my best to beat this terrible disease, but God had other things for me to do.”

“Please don’t be mad,” she continued. “Bad things happen in life and we have to learn to deal with it no matter how much it hurts.”

Peggy went on to advise Hannah about keeping an emergency kit in her car, and staying away from wild parties. But she also told her daughter how proud she was to be her mom, and told her she would be just as “wonderful” a nurse as she is a human being.

“I am thankful God gave us this past year to get closer and spend a lot of quality time together,” Peggy wrote. “Hang on to those good memories and tell everyone you love them as often as you can. Enjoy life and live each day as if it is your last because none of us know if today will be the last.”

But it wasn’t just Hannah who took Peggy’s words to heart — her letter soon went viral on social media, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and more than 1,000 comments.

No? Doesn’t matter! Oprah Winfrey has already released her annual “Favorite Things” gift guide featuring both, as well as a hundred of her other preferred housewares, kitchen gadgets and luxury items for the holidays.

OPRAH SAYS STEDMAN STILL HAS TO ASK PERMISSION TO DO THIS

Winfrey’s “things,"" which will be featured in the December issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, are currently available for purchase in their own Amazon e-shop. Generally, Winfrey's list is not as outlandish as Goop’s similarly comprehensive year-end gift guide, but the roundup always seems to contain its fair share of novelty items and pricey head-scratchers.

Although one item is technically free — a download of her “Super Soul Conversations” podcast — prices for some “things” can swell well over a thousand bucks. This year, her two most expensive items include a $2,000 55-inch Samsung TV that morphs into a large digital photo frame when not in use, and a basket-accented, two-gear “commuter bicycle” for around $1,150, respectively.

The president and first lady also made a solemn visit to the USS Arizona Memorial, where they tossed flower petals into the water above the battleship’s sunken hull.

The memorial, which is accessible only by boat, straddles the wreckage of the battleship on which more than 1,000 Navy personnel lost their lives during the attack that drew the U.S. into World War II.

Trump did not speak publicly while at Pearl Harbor, but expressed anticipation earlier in the day, before a briefing with leaders of the U.S. Pacific Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the region.

""We are going to visit very shortly, Pearl Harbor, which I've read about, spoken about, heard about, studied, but I haven't seen. And that is going to be very exciting for me,"" he said.

A total of more than 2,300 sailors, soldiers and Marines died as a result of the attack, as did 68 civilians, according to the National Park Service.

During his visit in Hawaii, Trump was expected to meet with the U.S. Pacific Command to discuss the escalating threat from North Korea. He was also scheduled to meet with the governors of Alaska, Hawaii and Pacific U.S. territories, which are all relatively close targets if North Korea opts for a missile strike aganst the U.S.

Trump will head to Japan on Saturday, then make subsequent stops in South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, where the looming crisis in North Korea will likely remain a key topic of discussion.

The president plans to attend the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) conference in Vietnam and the East Asian Summit in the Philippines, for which he recently tacked on an extra day to his trip.

Dallin Redd, owner of a hardware store and a supporter of allowing alcohol sales, said he worries broad opposition in town to the monument may persuade residents who would have otherwise voted for alcohol sales to decide to keep it dry.
Last year voters in the village of Ephraim, Wisconsin's last dry municipality, lifted its ban on alcohol sales.
If Blanding votes to allow alcohol sales they would likely start in summer 2018, according to city manager Jeremy Redd.
Lyman, the city councilman, said even if the town votes to stay dry, he thinks attitudes toward alcohol are relaxing and the town will eventually allow it.","The rural Utah city of Blanding, one of the last ""dry"" communities in the Mormon-majority state, will ask voters Tuesday whether to allow beer and wine sales in town for the first time in more than 80 years.

Even though most locals are Mormon and their faith teaches its members to avoid alcohol, some restaurant and hotel owners say the city of 3,500 people needs to accommodate drinkers and the influx of tourists.

""I think that we shouldn't be imposing our standards on other people,"" said Sharon Guymon, a restaurant owner pushing for the change after years of customer complaints, including tourists sometimes storming out of her steakhouse after being denied a glass of wine.

Opponents of alcohol sales, like longtime resident and health department inspector Rick Meyer, said the prohibition is key to the city's character and public safety.

""You don't see anybody drunk walking up and down the streets,"" Meyer said.

Blanding is a waypoint for visitors traveling between Denver, southern Utah's national parks and the Grand Canyon. It's a conservative community that bills itself as the ""Base Camp to Adventure,"" on vast desert landscapes nearby, much of which is controlled by the U.S. government. The town itself has been a hotspot in decades-old debates over who controls land in the West, including the newly declared Bears Ears National Monument.

Besides worries about public safety and health, residents opposed to alcohol sales say the prohibition may curb visitors flocking to the area to see the new monument and prevent Blanding from turning into Moab, the red rock outdoor recreation mecca about an hour north that many in Blanding see as an out-of-control tourist trap.

""We want to be able to control the tourism a little more,"" said pharmacist Dana Nielson. ""Once alcohol is available, that opens it up for all these huge motels and everything. Especially again, with the Bears Ears situation as it is.""

Dallin Redd, owner of a hardware store and a supporter of allowing alcohol sales, said he worries broad opposition in town to the monument may persuade residents who would have otherwise voted for alcohol sales to decide to keep it dry.

""People are pretty nervous about the monument coming in and they don't like to see a lot of change,"" he said.

City officials say the town has been dry since the 1930s. Talk of repealing the prohibition has bubbled up periodically since then, including a 1983 city-commissioned opinion poll of residents that found overwhelming support for keeping the ban.

""It's probably time to see if the opinion has changed,"" said Joe Lyman, a city councilman and the only candidate running for mayor in Tuesday's election.

Many residents appear to be keeping their opinions to themselves.

Robert Ogle, a city councilman who suggested the question on alcohol sales be put on the ballot this year, said he's shocked there's been almost no public debate.

""I thought this would be a tinderbox,"" Ogle said. ""No one has said anything.""

The debate follows similar ones in other dry communities. Last year voters in the village of Ephraim, Wisconsin's last dry municipality, lifted its ban on alcohol sales.

Around the country, nine states have entire counties that are dry, while at least a dozen states have some dry municipalities, according to the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association.

Utah doesn't have any dry counties and only has about half a dozen dry communities, mostly small towns, according to Utah's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control spokesman Terry Wood.

If Blanding votes to allow alcohol sales they would likely start in summer 2018, according to city manager Jeremy Redd.

Redd notes that residents and visitors who drink can already work around the city's ban because a convenience store 3 miles outside of town sells beer and a state-run liquor store is about 20 miles away.

Still, locals say visitors are surprised and sometimes angry at their sober options in Blanding.

In her restaurant, Guymon offers several varieties of non-alcoholic beer just so she can offer visitors a taste of what they're used to.

And Guymon still may be prohibited from serving alcoholic drinks if the ban is lifted. A preschool sits across the street from her restaurant so she'd likely violate state rules about serving alcohol that close to schools.

Lyman, the city councilman, said even if the town votes to stay dry, he thinks attitudes toward alcohol are relaxing and the town will eventually allow it.

""If it's not now, then it will be 10 years from now,"" he said. ""And I think 10 years after it changes, we'll look back and say it wasn't that big of a deal.""

""Families are talking about money and we know the more they talk, the more confident they feel about their future,"" Marcy Keckler, Vice President of Financial Advice Strategy, Ameriprise Financial, tells FOX Business.

The study shows that most family financial conversations revolve around day-to-day activities, but only about half of families across generations have spoken about the heavy, hard-to-ignore topics. 14% of parents say they don't want their kids thinking about death, 19% feel it's not appropriate to discuss and 25% of people simply haven't thought about it yet, the report says.

""Three out of four parents tells us they plan on leaving an inheritance either to their children or their grandchildren,"" says Keckler. 18% say they plan to leave some money for siblings, 17% to charity and yes, even Fido gets in on the action, 5% to their pets.

""People expect to receive over $100,000, but most commonly don't receive that much,"" adds Keckler.

Keckler urges families to act now, not to wait for a life-changing event (a family member's sickness or death), to prompt the conversation. Also, triple check the details (like beneficiaries) in any plan that you may have. Keckler also suggests to tell your family members where your documents can be found.

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



Jeff Flake last week took to the Senate floor to proclaim that since he would not be “complicit or silent” in the Trump presidency, he will not seek re-election. The first-term Arizona senator bemoaned that as a “traditional Republican,” he had a “narrower and narrow path” to office in this Trump world.

The speech earned Mr. Flake all the plaudits you’d expect, from all the usual suspects. Conservative Never Trumpers and the media “resistance” believe the president is destroying the Republican Party, the country, democracy and the universe—in that order. Those who join in their daily denouncements of Mr. Trump receive standing ovations. Those who don’t are falsely accused, to quote Mr. Flake in his speech, of “complete and unquestioning loyalty” and duly excommunicated from “moral” conservative society.

Yes, Mr. Trump is a wrecking ball; and yes, conservatives have a right and a duty to worry about the damage he may do to the Republican Party and its principles. Where the Never Trumpers err is in insisting that the only response is full-on resistance, shaming and utter denunciation. Not only is that approach simplistic, it is a proven loser.

Mr. Flake is a case in point. Among elected officials, he is rivaled perhaps only by Ohio Gov. John Kasich as loudest Never Trumper. The senator doesn’t like the president’s views on trade or immigration (join the club). But like Mr. Kasich, he has rarely bothered to spell out specific areas where he disagreed with Mr. Trump, or to note the significant points of agreement (deregulation, judges, etc.). His is a blanket condemnation. In Mr. Flake’s new book, “Conscience of a Conservative,” he compares Mr. Trump’s politics to a “late-night infomercial.”

This sweeping reproof was a sign to Trump supporters in Arizona that Mr. Flake either didn’t know or didn’t care why they support this president. So they wrote him off—much as he wrote off Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake was never going to get Democratic support, and once he alienated half of his state’s Republican voters, of course his path to re-election was narrow. Mr. Flake blew himself out of office, and he is now in a much poorer position to make any difference in the shape of Washington policies or the future of his party.",A Tale of Two Republicans,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/03/tale-two-republicans

Dumont noted that the United States is evaluating North Korea's ability to target heavily populated areas of South Korea with long-range artillery, rockets and ballistic missiles. He pointed out that Seoul, the South's capital with a population of 25 million, is just 35 miles from the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas.

The amount of casualties would differ depending on the advance warning and the ability of U.S. and South Korea forces to counter these attacks, he told Reps. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.

""A classified briefing would be the best place to discuss in detail the capability of the U.S. and its allies to discuss capabilities to counter North Korea's ability to respond with a nuclear weapon and eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons located in deeply buried, underground facilities,"" Dumont said. He also mentioned the possibility that chemical and biological weapons might be used by the North in case of a conflict.

Feinstein said she was pleased that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was accompanying President Donald Trump during his Asia trip, when North Korea is a main issue.

""I think if he will stay the course and use diplomacy the way diplomacy can be used, then it might be possible to work something out. The worst alternative is a war which could become nuclear,"" Feinstein told CNN's ""State of the Union.""

In a joint statement Saturday, 15 Democratic lawmakers and one Republican— all military veterans — called the assessment that a ground invasion would be required to destroy the North's nuclear arsenal ""deeply disturbing"" and that such an action ""could result in hundreds of thousands, or even millions of deaths in just the first few days of fighting.""

""It is our intent to have a full public accounting of the potential cost of war, so the American people understand the commitment we would be making as a nation if we were to pursue military action,"" the lawmakers said.

They also said the Trump administration ""has failed to articulate any plans to prevent the military conflict from expanding beyond the Korean Peninsula and to manage what happens after the conflict is over.""

""With that in mind, the thought of sending troops into harm's way and expending resources on another potentially unwinnable war is chilling. The President needs to stop making provocative statements that hinder diplomatic options and put American troops further at risk,"" they said.",'Bleak' assessment of toll of destroying North Korea nukes,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/05/grim-cost-predicted-in-effort-to-destroy-north-koreas-nukes.html

Humans of New York is a page dedicated to photos and stories from New Yorkers. One subject – an anonymous male in the city – was quoted confessing his honest feelings about his relationship.

“We had excellent dates. Everything else about her was exactly what I wanted. I didn’t want to ruin something good for that one little reason,” he says.

But that “one little reason” has stirred a controversy on the post, which has amassed over 30,000 comments and nearly 1,500 shares.

“At first I told myself I could get past it. I said, ‘Let’s just see how it goes,’” the post reads before he goes on to confess, “But it’s been 1.5 years. And I feel horrible, but I just can’t get past it.”

“And I feel like a bad person for being bothered by it. I can’t bring myself to tell her. We’re going to couple’s therapy next week, but I still don’t think I’ll be able to say it. Is there any right way to ask someone to lose weight for you?” it concludes.

The majority of people on Facebook have agreed that there isn’t a right way to ask.

One person wrote on Twitter, “If a man can’t love a woman when she’s overweight, he doesn’t deserve to love her if she ever decides to lose weight on her own.”

Another person posted on the Facebook page, “No. You are the one with the problem, not her. Do her a favour and end it.”

While some comments were more aggressive, with one person saying, “That is a terrible human being,” they all pretty much said the same thing – the man should end the relationship.

But there were at least a couple of defenders, with one tweeting, “How is this shallow? He obviously loves her, and wants her to be attractive. Dont[sic] we all want our partner to be attractive?”

A senior official of Puigdemont's party, the center-right Democratic Party of Catalonia, said on Sunday that the party wanted Puigdemont to repeat as its candidate.
Puigdemont wrote in Dutch in his Twitter account on Saturday that he was ""prepared to fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the European arrest warrant issued by Spain.""

The grassroots group Catalan National Assembly has also called for a strike on Wednesday and a public protest on Saturday.","Brussels prosecutors said Sunday that ousted Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and four ex-regional ministers were taken into custody to start the process of their possible extradition to Spain.

The five presented themselves to federal police at around 9 a.m. local time, Brussels prosecutor's office spokesman Gilles Dejemeppe said. He said that they haven't been arrested and that Puigdemont and the four members of his disbanded Cabinet will be heard by an investigative judge later in the day.

The Belgian judge will have to decide within 24 hours what comes next for the five separatist politicians wanted in Spain on suspicion of rebellion for pushing through a declaration of independence for the northeastern Catalonia in violation of Spain's Constitution.

Dejemeppe said the judge's options range from ""refusal to execute the European arrest, arresting the people involved, releasing them on conditions or under bail."" He said if they are arrested then they will be sent to jail as the extradition process continues. Dejemeppe said that the entire process from arrest to extradition, could take more than 60 days.

That delay could give Puigdemont time to participate, albeit from afar and in largely a symbolic capacity, in the snap regional election called by Spain's government for Catalonia on Dec. 21.

A senior official of Puigdemont's party, the center-right Democratic Party of Catalonia, said on Sunday that the party wanted Puigdemont to repeat as its candidate. Spanish government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo has said that any politician can run in the election unless he or she has been convicted of a crime.

Puigdemont and the four ex-ministers fled to Belgium this past week after being removed from power by Spanish authorities as part of an extraordinary crackdown to quash the region's illegal secession claim.

A Spanish National Court judge issued warrants for the five absconded lawmakers on suspicion of five crimes, including rebellion, sedition and embezzlement, on Friday, a day after the same judge sent another eight former Catalan Cabinet members to jail without bail while her investigation continues. A ninth spent a night in jail and was freed after posting bail.

Puigdemont wrote in Dutch in his Twitter account on Saturday that he was ""prepared to fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the European arrest warrant issued by Spain.""

Puigdemont's lawyer in Brussels had previously said that his client plans to fight extradition to Spain without requesting political asylum.

Political forces in Catalonia are hurriedly jockeying for position to start a campaign that promises to be as bitter as it is decisive to Spain's worst institutional crisis in nearly four decades.

While pro-union parties try to rally support to win back control of the regional parliament in Barcelona, pro-secession parties are debating whether or not to form one grand coalition for the upcoming ballot.

Parties have until Tuesday to register as coalitions or they must run separately.

Catalan ex-regional president Artur Mas, the first leader to harness the political momentum for secession, told Catalan public television on Sunday that he backed a fusion of parties for the December vote. But, he said, the main goals must be to recover the self-rule of the region and the release of the jailed separatists, not another immediate attempt to culminate the independence drive.

""Under these exceptional circumstances that our country is going through, don't we have to substitute the normal and logical competition for the cooperation we all need?"" Mas said. ""If we add the issue of independence, we won't get as many people to support us.""

An opinion poll published by Barcelona's La Vanguardia newspaper Sunday forecasts a tight electoral race between parties for and against Catalonia ending century-old ties with the rest of Spain.

The poll predicts that pro-secession parties would win between 66-69 seats. They won 72 two years ago. Sixty-eight seats are needed for a majority.

Catalonia's Parliament defied Spanish authorities and voted in favor of a declaration of independence on Oct. 27. The next day, Spain's central government used extraordinary constitutional powers to fire Catalonia's government, take charge of its administrations, dissolve its regional parliament and call a regional election.

Despite fears that there would be massive resistance to the intervention, the takeover by Spanish authorities has gone smoothly.

Spain's Constitution says the nation is ""indivisible"" and that all matters of national sovereignty pertain to the country's parliament.

In all, Spanish prosecutors are investigating 20 regional politicians for rebellion and other crimes that could be punishable by up to 30 years in prison.

Another two leaders of pro-secession grassroots groups are also in jail while an investigation continues into suspicion of sedition.

Hundreds of pro-secession Catalans gathered in town squares across the region Sunday to put up posters in support of independence and to demand the release of the jailed separatists.

""People came today because we want to send a message to Europe that even if our president is still in Brussels and all our government now is in Madrid jailed, that the independence movement still didn't finish and people are still striving to get independence in a peaceful and democratic way,"" said 24-year-old protester Adria Ballester in Barcelona.

The grassroots group Catalan National Assembly has also called for a strike on Wednesday and a public protest on Saturday.

Fueled by questions of cultural identity and economic malaise, secessionist sentiment has skyrocketed to reach roughly half of the 7.5 million residents of Catalonia, a prosperous region that is proud of its Catalan language spoken along with Spanish.

Puigdemont and his fellow separatists claim that an illegal referendum on secession held on Oct. 1 that polled 43 percent of the electorate and failed to meet international standards gives them a mandate for independence.","Catalan ex-president Carles Puigdemont, 4 others in Belgian police custody",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/05/catalan-ex-president-carles-puigdemont-4-others-in-belgian-police-custody.html

Pendants, uplights, downlights, LEDs — are you confused by all the options out there in kitchen lighting when it comes to creating the illumination you need to prep, cook and dine? We’ve asked expert Ben Mills to explain the different lighting types and the main things to consider in planning an effective design.

Why is kitchen lighting so important? For most of us, the kitchen is the workhorse of the home and a busy spot from morning till night. Good lighting is essential, as it allows you to perform tasks such as prepping food and cleaning up safely, says Mills, executive general manager at Australia’s Crompton Lighting. Plus, it adds character to a space and can quickly take the mood from functional to cozy, perfect for an eat-in kitchen.

Plan lighting as early as possible. Moving light fixtures after a kitchen has been installed can be expensive: Rewiring and repainting mean costs can add up quickly. For that reason, it’s best to plan kitchen lighting during the design stage.

What is a layered lighting design? Light layering involves creating different shades of light, playing with shadows and using colors to highlight a room’s best features. In the kitchen, it generally incorporates task lighting for food prep and cooking, ambient lighting for general illumination and character, and accent lighting to highlight specific features such as a gorgeous backsplash or a piece of art.

Consider safety first. The first priority of kitchen lighting is to provide sufficient illumination for safe and efficient meal prep, cooking and cleaning. This is achieved with task lighting — think LED strip lights under an upper cabinet (these create a lovely, even light with no shadows or heat) or a track system over the island.

Make sure there are no shadows in your prep zones. The best way to do is this is to install task lighting in front of or above you, rather than behind you.

Add ambient lighting for character. Soft, ambient lighting will wash your kitchen with light and create a warm, welcoming glow. It could be in the form of a pendant above a counter or dining table, downlights around the perimeter of the room or a central ceiling light.

Highlight your best features with accent light. Use accent lighting to draw attention to special features such as a backsplash or a dramatic island facade. Installing strip lighting under cabinets or counters is a great way to achieve this. You could also add accent lighting to glass cabinets or open shelving to highlight your displays.

Choose the right style. When it comes to choosing kitchen lights, take your cues from your home’s architecture and the lighting styles in the rest of the home. Choosing similar styles (or at least having a unifying theme such as shape or finish) will create a sense of flow among the spaces. This is particularly important in an open-plan kitchen that flows directly into a living or dining area.

When it comes to decorative lighting trends, the Scandi look is still popular, as well as simple styles in natural wood and black, white and industrial metallics.

Get the proportions right. With pendant lights and other decorative styles, size is also important: too large and the fixture will overwhelm a small kitchen; too small and it may get lost in a large space.

It’s also important to hang the pendant at an appropriate height to reduce the risk of people bumping their heads. Generally speaking, it should be about 32 inches above a table or counter.

Take control. Lighting control systems allow you to alter the illumination as needed and change the mood of the space. With dimmers, for example, you can go from bright lighting for precision cooking to a warm glow for dining. Having controls on separate switch plates lets you control lights in different areas separately.

Don’t be tempted to do the job yourself — unless you’re a trained electrician, always hire a professional to do electrical work in your home.",9 pro tips for choosing kitchen lighting,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/9-pro-tips-for-choosing-kitchen-lighting.html

Cody Andersen, 33, told Fox News he was thrilled to be accepted in 2010 as an intern at Webster PR, a firm that boasted Dolly Parton, Charlie Daniels and Kenny Rogers among its clients. And when Webster, the firm’s CEO, started taking an interest in him, Andersen said he thought it was because of his work ethic.

“Everything was fine for a while,” Andersen told Fox News in an interview Wednesday. But when the then-intern revealed he was transgender, things started to become “uncomfortable” with Webster.

“After I told him I was trans, he told me he was gay,” Andersen told us. “And one day he followed me [into] the bathroom and he was like, ‘Do you want to?’ I was like, ‘What?’ He said, ‘F--k.’ And I was like, ‘No, no.’”

“I was really taken aback by it…” Andersen said.

Harvey Weinstein scandal: What you need to know

Andersen alleged Webster would speak openly about a number of sexually graphic topics, like owning a 24-carat gold sex toy. He also said Webster often told sexually explicit stories about his employees.

Andersen alleges that Webster once asked him to come into a hot tub, naked. That prompted Andersen to alert the Webster company human resources office — several times.

“[My complaint] didn’t go anywhere,” Andersen said. “To get out of Kirt Webster’s grasp once he brings you in, it's hard to get away from him… He’s a predator.”

Andersen said he told his family about the ongoing harassment. A family member spoke to Fox News who recalled hearing about Webster’s alleged behavior in detail at the time, back when Andersen was 26.

Andersen’s claims came a day after former singer Austin C. Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, told Fox News he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

Through his company, Webster denied the allegations in a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying he engaged in a consensual relationship with Rick. Fox News was told on Wednesday afternoon Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

The company announced Wednesday it will continue operating under the name Westby PR with former Webster PR Vice President Jeremy Westby as CEO. However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.

When reached by email about Andersen’s allegation, a rep for Webster said she had no additional information at this time.

Rick and Andersen’s stories are two of “many,” according to five former employees who spoke to Fox News this week. They detailed instances where they say Webster showed them porn, made lewd gestures in the office and mocked clients during staff meetings.

A former employee previously known to Fox News, who wished to remain anonymous, said Webster touched him inappropriately on “multiple occasions” adding there are “so many” stories similar to his.

“There’s no telling how many there are,” he said. “There [is] sexual harassment running rampant through that place as long as I’ve known.” A close friend told Fox News the former employee discussed Webster’s behavior in detail many times with him.

A former female employee told Fox News Webster once grabbed her hair and “humped” her in front of fellow staff members. She called the behavior “typical,” and said her former boss would “caress me” on multiple occasions. She also alleged Webster made comments about her vagina in front of clients. Her roommate at the time told Fox News the former employee told her they discussed Webster’s behavior at length, and the roommate met Webster several times and witnessed his “lewd behavior.”

Another female former employee told us Webster was “verbally abusive” and told her he was going to “cut my [clitoris].’”

“He scares you. He makes you think you’ll never work in country music again,” she said. Her boyfriend at the time told Fox News he often urged her to leave Webster after hearing about her then-boss’ behavior.

A fourth former employee told Fox News he was hired after graduating from college, and was asked to bring things to Webster at his home, where he encountered his then-boss watching porn.

“One time he was just sitting in a towel on his couch watching porn. He invited me into his hot tub, and when I told him I didn’t have a swimsuit, he implied I could come in naked.”

A fifth former employee told Fox News working for Webster was “the worst experience"" of his life.

“Everybody in Nashville knows Kirt Webster and knows he's a horrible person,” he said.

Reviews on the site Glassdoor, a platform for people to anonymously share information about companies, mimic the sentiments former Webster employees shared with Fox News.

“[Webster] runs his business using fear, intimidation, and harassment,” one reviewer from October 15 wrote. “I am not exaggerating in my accusation of Webster PR as a hostile work environment where employees are subject to sexual harassment, sudden and inappropriate anger outbursts.”

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



Jeff Flake last week took to the Senate floor to proclaim that since he would not be “complicit or silent” in the Trump presidency, he will not seek re-election. The first-term Arizona senator bemoaned that as a “traditional Republican,” he had a “narrower and narrow path” to office in this Trump world.

The speech earned Mr. Flake all the plaudits you’d expect, from all the usual suspects. Conservative Never Trumpers and the media “resistance” believe the president is destroying the Republican Party, the country, democracy and the universe—in that order. Those who join in their daily denouncements of Mr. Trump receive standing ovations. Those who don’t are falsely accused, to quote Mr. Flake in his speech, of “complete and unquestioning loyalty” and duly excommunicated from “moral” conservative society.

Yes, Mr. Trump is a wrecking ball; and yes, conservatives have a right and a duty to worry about the damage he may do to the Republican Party and its principles. Where the Never Trumpers err is in insisting that the only response is full-on resistance, shaming and utter denunciation. Not only is that approach simplistic, it is a proven loser.

Mr. Flake is a case in point. Among elected officials, he is rivaled perhaps only by Ohio Gov. John Kasich as loudest Never Trumper. The senator doesn’t like the president’s views on trade or immigration (join the club). But like Mr. Kasich, he has rarely bothered to spell out specific areas where he disagreed with Mr. Trump, or to note the significant points of agreement (deregulation, judges, etc.). His is a blanket condemnation. In Mr. Flake’s new book, “Conscience of a Conservative,” he compares Mr. Trump’s politics to a “late-night infomercial.”

This sweeping reproof was a sign to Trump supporters in Arizona that Mr. Flake either didn’t know or didn’t care why they support this president. So they wrote him off—much as he wrote off Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake was never going to get Democratic support, and once he alienated half of his state’s Republican voters, of course his path to re-election was narrow. Mr. Flake blew himself out of office, and he is now in a much poorer position to make any difference in the shape of Washington policies or the future of his party.",A Tale of Two Republicans,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/03/tale-two-republicans#commenting

NEW YORK — September 18, 2017 – FOX News Channel (FNC) has named Laura Ingraham as the host of The Ingraham Angle, a new live primetime program to debut on October 30th, announced Suzanne Scott, president of programming for the network. Ahead of Ingraham’s debut, Hannity, hosted by Sean Hannity, will move to the 9PM/ET hour, the ensemble program The Five will return to the 5PM/ET timeslot, while the 10PM/ET hour will be helmed by rotating hosts during the interim period. Each of these changes will take effect on September 25th.

The Ingraham Angle will aim to cut through the Washington chatter to speak directly with unexpected voices and the actual people who are impacted by the news of the day. Ingraham will challenge the decision makers to focus on everyday, hard-working Americans who serve as the backbone of the nation.

“I think people are taking advantage of the whole situation with Weinstein, and they’re trying to make a living or they’re trying to get famous,” Krupa said.
I was defending my friend jeremy that has been nothing but nice man.” Krupa responded in a two-tweet retort.
“And I sure don’t need therapy but stating my opinion and defending my friend Jeremy.","While Hollywood big shots like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and many more are having allegations of sexual harassment and assault dropped on them, model and actress Joanna Krupa claimed many accusers are just trying to make money.

The Blast caught up with the former “Real Housewives” star on the streets of Los Angeles Wednesday and asked about the ongoing conversation about sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry. When the conversation turned to the recent allegations against her friend, Jeremy Piven, Krupa sounded off on what she believes to be a rush to take advantage of the situation.

“I love Jeremy Piven, like I’ve known Jeremy Piven for a very long time,” she told a crowd of paparazzi. “He’s like the nicest f---ing guy I’ve ever met.”

As previously reported, Piven has been accused by reality star Ariane Bellamar of sexual harassment while working on the HBO series ""Entourage.” Krupa, however, says that she’s never experienced any negative behavior from the 52-year-old actor.

“I think people are taking advantage of the whole situation with Weinstein, and they’re trying to make a living or they’re trying to get famous,” Krupa said. “Jeremy never did anything wrong to me. He’s always been an amazing friend to me, so I support him.”

The star went on to say that she knew about Weinstein more than 10 years ago, but doesn’t have any issues with him. However, she says she hoped that the conversation would lead to an environment where people get jobs in showbusiness based on talent alone.

Since the interview, Krupa has reacted publicly to someone on Twitter who posted a Page Six article about it and criticized her reaction.

“Clearly, YOU! @joannakrupa are the one that needs therapy. Women are taking advantage of Weinstein scandal,” a user wrote.

“Maybe read the whole thing before making stupid comments. I was defending my friend jeremy that has been nothing but nice man.” Krupa responded in a two-tweet retort. “And I sure don’t need therapy but stating my opinion and defending my friend Jeremy.

But Kristaps said much of the comments were taken out of context and that fans shouldn't be concerned.","It was an end-to-end sequence that brought the crowd at New York’s Madison Square Garden to its feet.

With just under 5 minutes remaining in a Friday night win over the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks center Kristaps Porzingis raced back on defense for an emphatic block of a shot by Suns rookie Josh Jackson, then raced forward on offense to execute a powerful dunk – and even draw a foul in the process.

""M-V-P! M-V-P!"" rang the chants from the Garden crowd.

Porzingis ended the game with 37 points as New York topped Phoenix, 120-107.

That was just one point shy of the career-high 38 that Porzingis scored just four nights earlier in a win against the Denver Nuggets. And it was his sixth 30-point performance in eight games this season for the 4-4 Knicks.

In other words, Porzingis has been getting the message out across the NBA:

A young star is becoming an even bigger star.

Just months ago, the Knicks seemed to be a team in disarray. Team president and failed messiah Phil Jackson had been jettisoned after an unexpectedly rocky tenure with the club, and hometown favorite player Carmelo Anthony had been shipped off to the Oklahoma City Thunder after nearly seven seasons in New York.

With the marquee names gone, the team was now in the hands of Porzingis, the 7-foot-3, 22-year-old import from Latvia whose arrival in New York via the fourth overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft initially drew groans from fans and the humbling question, “Who?”

But these days Porzingis No. 6 jerseys are an increasingly familiar sight around the streets of Gotham, beginning to replace the fraying No. 7 jerseys with Anthony’s name. (Last season, Forbes ranked Porzingis' jersey as the seventh-best seller, while Anthony's ranked 15th.)

Porzingis is now undeniably the face of the Knicks – and it’s a role he seems to relish. He even appears to enjoy razzing the cross-town rival Brooklyn Nets and their fans.

“Sometimes I see somebody with a Brooklyn hat on, I say, ‘What is that? You need a Knicks hat,’” Porzingis told the New York Daily News in 2015.

But Porzingis’ desire to stay in New York was recently called into question when a Latvian magazine published some comments by his brother, Janis Porzingis, who works for the firm that represents the Knick.

Janis Porzingis cited his brother's dissatisfaction with the Knicks last season, when he skipped his exit interview, and noted that Kristaps would need to be happy to re-sign with the team in the future, even if leaving meant taking less money.

But Kristaps said much of the comments were taken out of context and that fans shouldn't be concerned.

""I think the fans know I'm here in New York, I love New York and I see myself as a Knick for a long, long time,” Porzingis said.

“I don't think they should be worried about it.""

Rookie firefighter Omar Ahmed Sattar, 30, is the eldest son of Ahmed Abdel Sattar, who was convicted in 2005 of “soliciting crimes of violence” and conspiracy to murder Jews.
“My son Omar decided to go straight to the boss and ask him to his face why they were fired,” she wrote.
Officials noted that Omar Sattar worked for the city Sanitation Department for three years before joining the FDNY.
You gotta give this kid a fair shot.”Said FDNY spokesman Jim Long, “Omar Sattar will be judged on the merits of Omar Sattar.”","The 279 firefighters who graduated from the New York City fire department's academy last month include the son of a firefighter killed on 9/11 — and the son of a terrorist.

Rookie firefighter Omar Ahmed Sattar, 30, is the eldest son of Ahmed Abdel Sattar, who was convicted in 2005 of “soliciting crimes of violence” and conspiracy to murder Jews.

The elder Sattar, now 58, was a seemingly mild-mannered postal-service worker raising his family in Staten Island. Behind his peaceful facade, the court found, he was an Islamist extremist who used his home as a communications hub to further the schemes of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Muslim cleric who masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six, as well as failed plots to blow up other New York City buildings and tunnels.

Ahmed Sattar, also known as Abu Omar and Dr. Ahmed, was tried along with Rahman’s radical defense lawyer, Lynne Stewart, and another accused terrorist, Mohammed Yousry.

According to federal charges, he and a co-conspirator in 2000 published a fatwa, or Islamic ruling, in Rahman’s name, calling for the killing of Jewish civilians.

He and cohorts also tried to use the Oct. 12, 2000, al Qaeda bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 US sailors, to extort the US into freeing Rahman from prison, court papers say.

'Witch hunt'?

A Web site set up in Ahmed Sattar’s defense, ahmedabdelsattar.org, says that the Egyptian immigrant had “deep roots in America” and that he studied the Quran and “became an opponent of the murderous Hosni Mubarak regime in Egypt.”

It says Ahmed Sattar “lived a clean life” and blames the charges against him on “a witch hunt” by New York “Zionists.”

In a letter to the sentencing judge, Omar, then an 18-year-old student at the College of Staten Island, begged for leniency.

“I know that he did not commit any crimes or plan to. I feel that an injustice has been done. My father is a man of honesty and kindness, he wouldn’t attempt to hurt any one or even think about it,” Omar wrote.

“Yes, he has views, like so many people, but his views were just that and nothing more.”

Omar, who has two younger brothers and a sister, said his father raised his kids well.

“Most importantly, he wanted us to be good children and then grow up to be better adults,” he wrote. “I will forever hold his lessons in my heart, and I thank god every day for the father I have.”

Manhattan federal Judge John Koeltl sentenced Ahmed Sattar to 24 years in prison. He is serving time in the federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill., which once held Mafia godfather John Gotti.

A dream come true

In a statement to The Post, the young fireman did not mention his father, but described how his new job is a dream come true.

“This is what I have always wanted to do. This is who I have always wanted to be. I have always admired firefighters,” he said.

""This is what I have always wanted to do. This is who I have always wanted to be. I have always admired firefighters."" - Omar Ahmed Sattar, 30, rookie firefighter in New York City

He recalled when, as an 8-year-old, he came home from school to find his family standing outside their charred apartment, heartbroken over the fate of their missing cat, Tootsie.

“One of the firefighters standing in the street overheard, walked over and asked who was missing,” Sattar recalled.

“My mother replied, ‘Our cat,’ and he went up and found her hiding under a bed and brought her down,” he said.

“I remember being impressed and in awe of what just happened. … I respect FDNY members, and I am humbled to have this opportunity to be a part of this incredible Department. The FDNY is a family that always supports each other, and now I am living it. It means the world to me to be here. When I look back on my career as a firefighter, I want to know that I did the best I could with the opportunity I was given.”

Omar’s mother, Lisa, defended her husband online as “a man with morals and values.” She also complained that Omar and a brother were victims of illegal discrimination when the owner of a local restaurant fired them as busboys in July 2004.

“My son Omar decided to go straight to the boss and ask him to his face why they were fired,” she wrote. “Well, the truth came out in front of customers and other employees: ‘My wife died on 9-11, every time I look at you I think of my wife and I don’t want you working here!’ ”

Lisa Sattar, along with her three other adult children, attended “family day” at the FDNY Academy on Randalls Island last month. She posted a Facebook photo of Omar in his FDNY jacket marked “SATTAR.”

On graduation day, she posted photos of Omar accepting his probationary firefighter certificate from Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro and holding it up.

Also graduating that day was John Palombo, whose firefighter dad, Frank, was killed in the World Trade Center terror attacks that claimed 343 Bravest on Sept. 11, 2001. Last year, John’s brother Thomas also joined the FDNY.

The department assigned Sattar to Engine Co. 282 in Borough Park, a heavily Orthodox Jewish neighborhood.

An FDNY spokesman would not say whether the department knew of the elder Sattar’s criminal record when it hired the son.

“All individuals — prior to appointment as a firefighter — must pass a comprehensive background check,” said the spokesman, Frank Dwyer.

Officials noted that Omar Sattar worked for the city Sanitation Department for three years before joining the FDNY.

Several FDNY employees who learned of Sattar’s family history are concerned, saying uniformed firefighters have virtually free access to hospitals, crime scenes and other official areas.

Others were incredulous.

“They should hire Osama bin Laden’s son and put him in the same firehouse,” one cracked.

Another recalled Kevin Shea, a firefighter with Manhattan’s Rescue Co. 1, who raced to the 1993 WTC bombing. While trying to reach a victim, Shea fell 45 feet into a pile of rubble, breaking bones. His leather helmet was credited with saving his life. Shea later searched for survivors at Ground Zero.

“If he passed the background check, we can’t hold him accountable for the sins of the father. You gotta give this kid a fair shot."" - Joseph Giacalone, retired NYPD sergeant, adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice

But Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and adjunct professor at CUNY’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said sons or daughters of criminals can, and do, serve with distinction.

“This will probably be the first time we’ve hired someone with a family history of terrorism,” Giacalone said.

But he added, “If he passed the background check, we can’t hold him accountable for the sins of the father. You gotta give this kid a fair shot.”

Said FDNY spokesman Jim Long, “Omar Sattar will be judged on the merits of Omar Sattar.”",Son of convicted terrorist becomes New York City firefighter,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/04/son-convicted-terrorist-becomes-new-york-city-firefighter.html

Dallin Redd, owner of a hardware store and a supporter of allowing alcohol sales, said he worries broad opposition in town to the monument may persuade residents who would have otherwise voted for alcohol sales to decide to keep it dry.
Last year voters in the village of Ephraim, Wisconsin's last dry municipality, lifted its ban on alcohol sales.
If Blanding votes to allow alcohol sales they would likely start in summer 2018, according to city manager Jeremy Redd.
Lyman, the city councilman, said even if the town votes to stay dry, he thinks attitudes toward alcohol are relaxing and the town will eventually allow it.","The rural Utah city of Blanding, one of the last ""dry"" communities in the Mormon-majority state, will ask voters Tuesday whether to allow beer and wine sales in town for the first time in more than 80 years.

Even though most locals are Mormon and their faith teaches its members to avoid alcohol, some restaurant and hotel owners say the city of 3,500 people needs to accommodate drinkers and the influx of tourists.

""I think that we shouldn't be imposing our standards on other people,"" said Sharon Guymon, a restaurant owner pushing for the change after years of customer complaints, including tourists sometimes storming out of her steakhouse after being denied a glass of wine.

Opponents of alcohol sales, like longtime resident and health department inspector Rick Meyer, said the prohibition is key to the city's character and public safety.

""You don't see anybody drunk walking up and down the streets,"" Meyer said.

Blanding is a waypoint for visitors traveling between Denver, southern Utah's national parks and the Grand Canyon. It's a conservative community that bills itself as the ""Base Camp to Adventure,"" on vast desert landscapes nearby, much of which is controlled by the U.S. government. The town itself has been a hotspot in decades-old debates over who controls land in the West, including the newly declared Bears Ears National Monument.

Besides worries about public safety and health, residents opposed to alcohol sales say the prohibition may curb visitors flocking to the area to see the new monument and prevent Blanding from turning into Moab, the red rock outdoor recreation mecca about an hour north that many in Blanding see as an out-of-control tourist trap.

""We want to be able to control the tourism a little more,"" said pharmacist Dana Nielson. ""Once alcohol is available, that opens it up for all these huge motels and everything. Especially again, with the Bears Ears situation as it is.""

Dallin Redd, owner of a hardware store and a supporter of allowing alcohol sales, said he worries broad opposition in town to the monument may persuade residents who would have otherwise voted for alcohol sales to decide to keep it dry.

""People are pretty nervous about the monument coming in and they don't like to see a lot of change,"" he said.

City officials say the town has been dry since the 1930s. Talk of repealing the prohibition has bubbled up periodically since then, including a 1983 city-commissioned opinion poll of residents that found overwhelming support for keeping the ban.

""It's probably time to see if the opinion has changed,"" said Joe Lyman, a city councilman and the only candidate running for mayor in Tuesday's election.

Many residents appear to be keeping their opinions to themselves.

Robert Ogle, a city councilman who suggested the question on alcohol sales be put on the ballot this year, said he's shocked there's been almost no public debate.

""I thought this would be a tinderbox,"" Ogle said. ""No one has said anything.""

The debate follows similar ones in other dry communities. Last year voters in the village of Ephraim, Wisconsin's last dry municipality, lifted its ban on alcohol sales.

Around the country, nine states have entire counties that are dry, while at least a dozen states have some dry municipalities, according to the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association.

Utah doesn't have any dry counties and only has about half a dozen dry communities, mostly small towns, according to Utah's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control spokesman Terry Wood.

If Blanding votes to allow alcohol sales they would likely start in summer 2018, according to city manager Jeremy Redd.

Redd notes that residents and visitors who drink can already work around the city's ban because a convenience store 3 miles outside of town sells beer and a state-run liquor store is about 20 miles away.

Still, locals say visitors are surprised and sometimes angry at their sober options in Blanding.

In her restaurant, Guymon offers several varieties of non-alcoholic beer just so she can offer visitors a taste of what they're used to.

And Guymon still may be prohibited from serving alcoholic drinks if the ban is lifted. A preschool sits across the street from her restaurant so she'd likely violate state rules about serving alcohol that close to schools.

Lyman, the city councilman, said even if the town votes to stay dry, he thinks attitudes toward alcohol are relaxing and the town will eventually allow it.

""If it's not now, then it will be 10 years from now,"" he said. ""And I think 10 years after it changes, we'll look back and say it wasn't that big of a deal.""

Dumont noted that the United States is evaluating North Korea's ability to target heavily populated areas of South Korea with long-range artillery, rockets and ballistic missiles. He pointed out that Seoul, the South's capital with a population of 25 million, is just 35 miles from the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas.

The amount of casualties would differ depending on the advance warning and the ability of U.S. and South Korea forces to counter these attacks, he told Reps. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.

""A classified briefing would be the best place to discuss in detail the capability of the U.S. and its allies to discuss capabilities to counter North Korea's ability to respond with a nuclear weapon and eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons located in deeply buried, underground facilities,"" Dumont said. He also mentioned the possibility that chemical and biological weapons might be used by the North in case of a conflict.

Feinstein said she was pleased that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was accompanying President Donald Trump during his Asia trip, when North Korea is a main issue.

""I think if he will stay the course and use diplomacy the way diplomacy can be used, then it might be possible to work something out. The worst alternative is a war which could become nuclear,"" Feinstein told CNN's ""State of the Union.""

In a joint statement Saturday, 15 Democratic lawmakers and one Republican— all military veterans — called the assessment that a ground invasion would be required to destroy the North's nuclear arsenal ""deeply disturbing"" and that such an action ""could result in hundreds of thousands, or even millions of deaths in just the first few days of fighting.""

""It is our intent to have a full public accounting of the potential cost of war, so the American people understand the commitment we would be making as a nation if we were to pursue military action,"" the lawmakers said.

They also said the Trump administration ""has failed to articulate any plans to prevent the military conflict from expanding beyond the Korean Peninsula and to manage what happens after the conflict is over.""

""With that in mind, the thought of sending troops into harm's way and expending resources on another potentially unwinnable war is chilling.

Under President Benjamin Harrison in 1890, the Wounded Knee massacre took the lives of 150 Native Americans.
Any attempt to coerce the United States into erasing our history is disingenuous.
The statues of President Jackson and President Lincoln, both fervent oppressors of Native Americans, stand tall in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.
We have African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and members of other ethnic groups elected to positions inside our governments.","The conversation happening in our nation in light of recent events is more about political correctness than the issue at hand. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and terrorists are bad people. The ideals of these groups are in opposition to everything our nation stands for and everything that holds true to our founding principles. Their hatred of people dissimilar to them is un-American and it should not be tolerated under any circumstances.

Days ago, my colleague in the Senate, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, announced that he plans to introduce legislation that would remove all of the statues in the U.S. Capitol that honored Confederate soldiers. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has also called for the elimination of such statues. I respect their rights as elected officials to put forth legislation they believe is in the best interest of their constituents, however I simply do not agree.

As a Cherokee, I can attest to the fact that Native Americans have been on the losing side of history. Our rights have been infringed upon, our treaties have been broken, our culture has been stolen, and our tribes have been decimated at the hands of our own United States government. Native Americans have faced centuries of atrocities to their people, their land, and their culture – all under various presidents who took an oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.

When we censor our history by disguising our scars, we belittle the struggles our ancestors fought so hard to overcome. America doesn't cower behind political correctness. It defiantly and courageously moves forward, with its history as a reminder of where we have been.

Under President Andrew Jackson in 1830, our government passed the Indian Removal Act that drove thousands of Native Americans out of their homes on the treacherous journey better known as the Trail of Tears. Under President Franklin Pierce in 1854, parts of Indian Territory were stolen from tribes to create the Kansas and Nebraska Territories. Under President Abraham Lincoln, the Sand Creek massacre occurred in 1864 when the U.S. Army attacked the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes unprovoked, killing about 250 Native Americans. The Dawes Act of 1887 gave President Grover Cleveland the power to take back tribal land and redistribute the land to native people as individuals, not as tribal members. Under President Benjamin Harrison in 1890, the Wounded Knee massacre took the lives of 150 Native Americans. Under President Theodore Roosevelt in 1907, Indian and Oklahoma territories were unified to create the state of Oklahoma after Congress refused to consider a petition to make Indian Territory a separate state. President Roosevelt is even quoted as saying: “I don’t go so far as to think that the only good Indians are the dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every 10 are.”

Let me ask you this: Is history not an opportunity to learn from one’s mistakes? When we fall short of the high standard we set for our nation and its citizens, we make mistakes. What's most important is that our nation remembers and learns from them. As soon as we forget about our history, we are bound to repeat the same errors.

Still, we have professional athletes like Colin Kaepernick who refuse to stand during the national anthem and others who stand in solidarity with him in protest of the United States. To what end? To protest this country, a country that I love and my friends have died to defend? As an American, you have the right to protest me, or another individual, or a group, but I believe that protesting the United States for the mistakes it has made – when it gave you the freedom to do so in the first place – is disrespectful. Any attempt to coerce the United States into erasing our history is disingenuous. Especially, when our country has learned from the mistakes it has made and is determined not to repeat them.

Should we erase our history in the name of being politically correct? Can we not all agree that it is what shaped our country to be the great nation it is today? One that we know to be full of freedoms, liberties, and rights that other nations only dream of?

The removal of Confederate statues in the U.S. Capitol doesn’t change our history. The removal of these statues merely attempts to disguise our ugly scars by hiding these statues out of plain sight. In an imperfect world, full of imperfect leaders, there are countless statues that may not live up to our American values. The statues of President Jackson and President Lincoln, both fervent oppressors of Native Americans, stand tall in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. Still, these statues tell the history of the good and the bad of our nation.

America is – and will always be – a success story. We have African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and members of other ethnic groups elected to positions inside our governments. The American free enterprise system is the greatest tool to lift people out of poverty ever created in human history and when applied properly, does not discriminate by race, religion, or skin color. When we censor our history by disguising our scars, we belittle this process and the struggles our ancestors fought so hard to overcome. America doesn't cower behind political correctness. It defiantly and courageously moves forward, with its history as a reminder of where we have been. Let us look boldly into our history and learn the lessons that made us the “shining city on the hill” and the example for all other peoples.

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

RELATED: Get an Exhaust Fan for the Bathroom

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Want to be really sure your air purifier is doing its job? Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html

Other cosmetics brands, however, have historically chosen more age-appropriate spokeswomen for their campaigns, as HuffPost points out. L’Oreal has featured such celebs as Diane Keaton and Helen Mirren, and Ellen Degeneres has starred in both CoverGirl and Olay ads.

Vice President of the United States Mike Pence spoke with Brian Kilmeade about the latest on the New York City terrorist attack and why the Trump administration has not labeled terrorist Sayfullo Saipov an enemy combatant. Plus, VP Pence explained how the tax reform plan being unveiled today will reduce taxes for all Americans and stated President Trump has been clear about his red line on the corporate tax rate being lowered to 20%.

Listen here for the full interview:

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: And, joining us right now it's our privilege to bring the vice president of the United States. If there's somebody more respect on our Capital Hill or by the president I don't know who it is. Mr. Vice President, welcome back.

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Brian, it's great to be on the program and congratulations on your book. I can't wait to get through it.

KILMEADE: Thank you very much and I'll definitely get it to you if you're allowed - I can never know what the rules are with politicians. If I can actually send it to you or not. I don't want to get you in trouble.

PENCE: Don't worry, I'll get one on my own. I've read a biography in the past of Andrew Jackson but I'm really looking forward to reading yours.

KILMEADE: Thanks so much. Mr. Vice President, I tell you I know you're as strong on terror as anyone when you were in Congress let alone now. Have we - have your policy now mirroring President Obama's policy of going through the legal system instead of putting him through the military system?

PENCE: Look, well first off let me - let me say as the president has said that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of Tuesday's terrorist attack in New York City. We are bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear to support the efforts of the New York City Police Department to follow through on the investigation.

And, we're going to hold this assailant responsible and if there are any more involved we're going to hold them to the very strictest account. This was a barbaric act of terrorism and it will not stand. And, it is in a very real sense, Brian, we believe, of indication of aggressive posture President Trump has taken in taking the fight to ISIS on their soil on our terms.

As you reported very well on this radio program and on the airwaves of Fox and Friends as we speak thanks to U.S. Armed Forces and our allies ISIS is on the run. We have overtaken the so-called capital of their caliphate Raqqa. There's more fighting to be done but Tuesday was a grim reminder --

KILMEADE: Right.

PENCE: ... that our enemies are still - are still afoot. They're still inspiring violence that threatens our people and I can assure you President Trump and our entire administration, our Armed Forces will not rest, we will not relent until we destroy ISIS at its sore so it can no longer inspire or make possible these kinds of acts of violence.

KILMEADE: But, Mr. Vice President, he said -

PENCE: I would say that very clearly. But so there's nothing - I got to tell you there's nothing about President Trump's policies that mirror the last administration. I mean, ISIS came to life, was literally conjured out of the - out of the desert policies of the last administration -

KILMEADE: But they brought the battle here, Mr. Vice President and we're not treated like that.

PENCE: Well, they did.

KILMEADE: He's a - he say's he's a soldier of the caliphate. As Senator Lindsey Graham said, ""Why are we treating him like a criminal?"" Here is Ed Davis. He said the way the Boston bombers were treated he said this is the call he got after they got the Zarnia brother. The other one was dead. Cut 24.

ED DAVIS: There's a clause in the Patriot Act that takes the process out of the civilian courts into a military style process. So, in the case of (inaudible) I got a call from the United States Attorney who ordered me to give orders to my officers not to read the suspect their rights.

And, they brought a special team in of intelligence and military personnel because they thought that this may be an ongoing plot. So, there is - there is a possibility of doing that in the law.

KILMEADE: Why didn't we do that? This guy - yes go ahead.

PENCE: Well, Brian, the president made it clear that he was open to sending this assailant, this terrorist to Guantanamo. In fact I think he - the president tweeted this morning that he would have loved to send the New York terrorist to Guantanamo but the process takes longer and justice delayed is justice denied.

KILMEADE: But we Mirandize him. He's got a lawyer. Why did we -

PENCE: We want to see - we want to see - and the president has made it clear he believe this is a case where death penalty is warranted, I agree with that in the strongest possible terms. I mean running down innocent civilians, killing eight, injuring more than 11. This was a barbaric terrorist attack and we want to bring this person - we want to bring this person to justice as swiftly as possible. And, that's what informed the president's decision.

KILMEADE: Right. It's just that I want to question more (ph).

PENCE: I really want to take issue, Brian. I mean the truth is as I began to say moments ago, literally the precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq created the vacuum in which ISIS was created -

KILMEADE: Oh, I hear you.

PENCE: Literally overran more than half of Iraq. President Trump came into office and he said we are going to destroy ISIS, we're going to - we're going to allow our military to take the action there, take the fight to terrorists and if anything this vicious terrorist attack in New York is simply a confirmation that in President Trump we have the right leadership.

KILMEADE: Right.

PENCE: We have the right commander-in-chief who's taking the fight to the enemy.

KILMEADE: I just hope - I hope next time we get them, we don't Mirandized him. We hold onto him until our interrogators are - feel as though they understand what - who he's talked to and what he's capable of. I don't think, as much as I respect New York, I don't think they know everything he knows.

And, they - now has a lawyer and he's smiling with an ISIS flag and he's going to start using our legal system. Even though I know he's going to get convicted and maybe killed, I want to know what he knows and I'm not convinced we can do that now. Are you?

PENCE: Well, let me be - let me be - let me be very clear with all of your millions of listeners around the country, we are going to get to the bottom of this terrorist action, who inspired him, who worked with him. There are - there is an aggressive investigation underway. I was briefed again on it this morning.

I was at the CIA yesterday. As I said, your listeners should be confident. We are bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear in support of New York law enforcement. We're going to get to the bottom of this. We're going to hold him to the strictest and swiftest account and justice.

And, we're going to find if there were any others involved and I can't really speak at this moment about that, if there were any other involved, we will hold them to the strictest account. We're going to bring justice to these people. That's how we protect the American people.

KILMEADE: I want to talk about tax reform, I know you do, too. You're going to - later on you're going to be with Governor Scott in Florida but I also know that you have a - the House is finally ready to unveil tax reform. Can you let our listeners know what we - the takeaways?

PENCE: Well, it's been more than a generation since we've - we've passed the kind of tax cuts and tax reform to really liven the American economy. I mean, john F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan did it, and what really begins today in the House of Representatives, and we believe will - will be completed before the end of this year is going to be a historic tax cut that's going to building on the momentum that we already see in this economy, Brian, it really is remarkable. After eight years, of less than 2 percent economic growth, we just posted the second quarter in a row of over 3 percent growth because of the policies President Trump's been advancing in terms of rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy.

But this tax cut plan, will reduce taxes on individuals, it'll simplify the tax code and it'll lower business taxes in America like the business I'm visiting in Florida, to make it possible for American companies to compete with companies around the world. It is - it is remarkable to think that in the most powerful economy on earth, we have one of the highest business tax rates on the planet.

President Trump is committed to change that, bringing middle class tax relief to working families to simplify the tax code, and the great news for the America people is that all starts today with the introduction of the House tax cut bill.

KILMEADE: Some specifics, if I can. The 20 percent the president spoke about, is that a red line, and is it true that you're considering a phase in of it, a gradual decrease?

PENCE: Well, I think the president - I think the president's made it very clear to members of Congress that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent is absolutely imperative. That puts us in a competitive position, the president - we were talking about going to 15 percent early on, the president made it clear we'll do 20, that's it.

So, people - people, I think, understand hoe firmly the president is committed to that. But the other part of this, don't forget, I grew up in a small business family. My family was in the gas station business, Brian, and - and my family, like - like literally millions of business around the country - my - my folks filed their taxes as individuals, that was business income. And we're going to make sure that we also lower the taxes on people that are reporting large incomes that are business income, we're going to lower that to 25 percent.

I mean, if you look back at 1980's, the majority of jobs that were created, the last time we - we passed historic tax relief, were created in small business America. I'm just saying (ph), 20 percent on big corporations, so called, C-corporations, but we're going to go to 25 percent on - on so called past through small businesses. And - and the combination of this, we - we think - we think the combination of this, it's going to be hard to calculate how - how much the American economy is - is - is going to rally around the tax cuts that we're going to fight to get on the president's desk before Christmas.

KILMEADE: Right, and I know you've got to run, you've got to do another interview, but I understand, Steve Scalise told us today, that it's going - the top bracket is going to stay at 39.5 percent. Would you actually say that too?

PENCE: Well, we'll - I know the House of representatives is going to be unveiling heir plan today, President Trump has made it clear that he wants to focus this tax relief on middle class Americans and on job creators and businesses across this country. And we think that what House Republicans unveil today is a great start in that direction, we're grateful for the leadership of Speaker Ryan, of Chairman Kevin Brady and all those that have been working tirelessly with the administration. The Senate will be moving very quickly on their version of the bill and in the weeks ahead, we're literally going to fight everyday to give the American people the kind of tax cuts and tax reform that will make the American economy great again.

KILMEADE: Mr. Vice President, thanks so much for putting us on your schedule, always appreciate it and you say they're going to get it done before the year's end, that will make a lot of people happy. Thanks so much.

We will bring together volunteers and equip them with skills to reach voters more effectively. Following their training, they will go out into their communities and put their new-found skills to work. These “rock star” volunteers bolster our ground game efforts and are eager to give their time and energy in order to spread our Party’s message of opportunity, prosperity, and freedom.

This is part of the RNC’s multi-year effort to establish a permanent, uninterrupted presence in states across the country. The plan worked well during the 2016 cycle and, because we never left these states, was a big reason the Party went undefeated in four special elections. This same on-the-ground strategy enabled us to invest nearly 100 people and millions of dollars in Virginia, which is proving to be critical in an extremely close governor’s race.

Our flagship Republican Leadership Initiative (RLI) Program helps us recruit, organize, and mobilize volunteers who then expand our footprint – and our majorities -- nationwide.

Just today, 1000 new RLI Fellows are being trained across 18 states at over 100 locations. The volunteers who graduate from this program become our voices on the ground, and spread the conservative message across the country.

Dana Perino Named As Host of New 2PM/ET Show

Sandra Smith Joins Bill Hemmer as Co-Anchor of America’s Newsroom

NEW YORK— September 26, 2017 — FOX News Channel (FNC) will unveil a new daytime lineup on Monday, October 2nd, announced Jay Wallace, President of News. Harris Faulkner will anchor her own 1PM/ET signature news hour entitled Outnumbered Overtime with Harris Faulkner and Dana Perino will host a 2PM/ET program with news and analysis on the day’s top stories, known as The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino. Additionally, Sandra Smith will permanently join Bill Hemmer in co-anchoring America’s Newsroom (9-11AM/ET).

In making the announcement, Wallace said, “Harris, Dana and Sandra are rising stars and their combined background and expertise across news, business and politics will enable us to provide a more in-depth look at the major stories breaking out of Washington, and around the country. We are living in unprecedented times and this new lineup ensures our viewers will get the best news, information and analysis on the news of the hour across the nation and around the globe.”

Faulkner and Smith will remain on Outnumbered (12-1PM/ET) alongside rotating panelists. Jon Scott will continue to helm Happening Now (11AM-12PM/ET) and Shepard Smith Reporting and Your World with Neil Cavuto will occupy the same 3PM and 4PM/ET time periods respectively, while Perino will continue as co-host of The Five.

Capitalizing on the strength of Outnumbered, Faulkner will anchor an additional hour of news with Outnumbered Overtime with Harris Faulkner (1-2 PM/ET). Each day, Faulkner will continue the conversation on the top news stories by utilizing the resources of FNC journalists in the field, plus one-on-one interviews with newsmakers and roundtable discussions with the network’s top contributors. Outnumbered Overtime originally debuted as a web show led by Faulkner following the TV version every day and her new program will seek to harness the popularity of that effort.

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

Following Outnumbered Overtime, Perino will host The Daily Briefing at 2PM/ET, an hour often dominated by breaking news, White House press briefings, and more from Washington and around the nation. With her understanding of what makes news, how to respond to it and her unique political expertise, Perino will break it all down with insight from key Beltway experts.

Perino remarked, “Our new show will aim to take on the major issues facing Americans and explore them from all angles. I am excited for this opportunity to draw from my political background to help our viewers get beyond the headlines and better understand what is really going on behind the scenes in Washington each day.”

It’s not. The term has many shades of meaning, and it would not surprise me if others came up with an entirely different grouping of strong-minded, gritty, gutsy ladies. Here's my list. Who is on yours?

""She talked back to Jesus, irritated his disciples and became an effective evangelist despite her succession of five husbands and counting. The label badass applies.""

1. Eve

Eve rises to the standard. She was not pale skinned and compliant as renaissance artists often portrayed her. When lying on the moss among brilliant hibiscus, her ebony skin glistened in the filtered sunlight. Her eyes, her hair, her lips, her breasts—she was a beauty. And she was brainy. She asked questions, interacting with the serpent while Adam stood by mute. She overstepped her bounds and ate the forbidden fruit—all for knowledge—all for a good Ivy League education. She and Adam were banished from the Garden. She had babies—the oldest boy killing his younger brother. She knew sorrow and she is the mother of us all.

2. Sarah

Sarah, wife of Abraham was also a gutsy, strong-minded lady who stood her ground with husband Abraham, the great patriarch. But her strong-mindedness did not necessarily translate into strength of character. In fact, she behaved shamefully to Hagar, her live-in maid, whom she ordered to sleep with Abraham in order to give her a son, heir to the patriarchal line. She took the child Ishmael as her own until her “womb was opened (at age ninety no less) and she bore baby Isaac. She resented Hagar and soon thereafter banished her and Ishmael to the desert to die.

3. Rebekah

Rebekah, Sarah’s daughter-in-law, was another badass woman. She, like her mother-in-law, was a looker and equally strong-minded. She bore twins, Esau and Jacob, favoring the latter (and younger twin) who turned out to be just as sneaky and duplicitous as she. He trafficked in pottage, trading a bowl of it for the birthright that belonged to his starving brother. Later, prodded by his mother, he stole Esau’s blessing by tricking old man Isaac into believing he was Esau.

4. Rachel

Rachel, Rebekah’s daughter-in-law, was another one of those beautiful, ballsy, badass wives. Second and favorite wife of Jacob, she competed in the game of baby-making with her cross-eyed sister Leah. Both sent in subs (their maids) and Leah won, but Rachel gave birth to Benjamin, youngest and favorite son of his father. Later Jacob, on the outs with his father-in-law, snuck away in the dead of night with the wives, maids and kids. In the morning when the old man realized the household gods were also missing, he raced to catch up with the caravan. Sneaky Rachel got by with grand theft by hiding them under a pile of Persian rugs, sat on the pile and told Dad she couldn’t move because she was having her period.

5. Jael

Jael is not a well-known biblical name. If we’re looking for a woman who made her mark as arguably the best judge in Israel, Deborah fits the bill. She was also a faithful prophet and army commander. But Jael was a badass on steroids. She hailed from outside the camp of Israel and served as a holy turncoat, aiding Israel in its military campaign by bringing down Sisera the enemy commander. He trusted her when she invited him into her tent and offered him warm milk. And though the Bible doesn’t say, she also may have plied him with one skin after another of her sweet raspberry wine. After he fell asleep fully inebriated, she nailed his head to the ground with one fatal spike.

6. Ruth

The impoverished and widowed Ruth was far more badass than we usually imagine. With her widowed mother-in-law Naomi she hatched a plan. After she was all perfumed and manicured, she snuck out in the dark and lay at the feet of wealthy Boaz, merry with wine, on his threshing floor. The text doesn’t explicitly tell us what happened but in the morning he was determined to marry her. At an appropriate time later—and who’s counting the months—she gave birth to Obed, who would become father of Jesse, father of David.

7. Bathsheba

Bathsheba is the one, not Ruth, with the bad reputation. Beautiful Bathsheba, a sex object in the eyes of the polygamous King David. Some say she was a teasing temptress, taking a bath and exposing her nubile naked body on her veranda below the Palace porch. Perhaps. The text is not entirely clear. But knowing David, she was just as likely the victim of rape. David knew her husband was away serving in the army, and she would be one more woman he could seduce. When she later reported to the King she was pregnant, he took care of the problem by ordering her husband to the most dangerous position in the front lines, and then took the widowed Bathsheba as his wife. She was an assertive badass woman who later fought to make her son Solomon first in line of succession.

8. Queen Vashti

Badass Queen Vashti knew how a queen should behave. She refused to do a strip tease in front of the inebriated King Ahasuerus and his drunken cronies. Good for her. For daring to act like a sovereign should, the king put her out of the palace, determined to find the most beautiful lady in the land. All dolled up, Esther took Vashti’s place—very capable but too perfect to be a badass herself.

9. Samaritan woman

The Samaritan woman is for my money the most interesting, but un-named, badass woman of the Bible. When Jesus was taking a high-noon break at the well outside Sychar, she showed up. She talked back to Jesus, irritated his disciples and became an effective evangelist despite her succession of five husbands and counting. The label badass applies.

10. Mary

Jesus’ mother Mary was equally assertive. Like most mothers, she was perturbed when her twelve-year-old son stayed back in Jerusalem, failing to join the crowd heading back to Nazareth after Passover. Later she gathered his siblings and together they headed out to bring Jesus home for an intervention. Word on the street was that he needed serious therapy. The label fits her.

The stunning revelation by longtime operative Donna Brazile that the Hillary Clinton campaign secretly took control — literal control — of the Democratic National Committee a year before Hillary became the party’s nominee is the talk of American politics.

As it should be.

Brazile’s piece in Politico describes her shock at the discovery of formal legal paperwork between the two entities when she took the reins at the DNC in August 2016. Brazile had been tapped for the job when DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign. Leaked e-mails had shown how Schultz had been putting her finger on the scale to help Clinton while the insurgent Bernie Sanders campaign was making a serious bid to seize the party nomination away from New York’s favorite carpetbagger.



Her account features ridiculous and unbelievable melodramatics — she says she “gasped” when she found out the truth and that she “lit a candle in my living room and put on some gospel music” to calm her before she called Bernie Sanders to deliver the awful news.

But silly though Brazile’s prose is, her account is vitally important not only for all those who want to understand how American politics works but also for the future of Brazile’s beloved party.

First, it raises key questions about what was happening as Hillary Clinton faced a time of trial in the middle of 2015. Her reputation was taking hits as her evasions and denials and untruths about what had happened to the private e-mail server she had set up illegitimately in 2009 seemed to mushroom on a daily basis.

As this was happening, she found herself with only two semi-serious challengers for the nomination — Sanders and former Maryland Gov.

Margulies told Jenny Hutt on her SiriusXM show “Just Jenny” on Friday that a female casting director asked the “ER” actress when she was 23-years-old to meet Seagal in his hotel room to go over a scene, Page Six reported.

Margulies declined the offer due to the late time and that she lived far away.

Margulies said the casting director told her: “Don’t worry, we’ll reimburse you. And I’m here, a woman.”

HARVEY WEINSTEIN SPOTTED IN DISGUISE AT PHOENIX RESTAURANT: REPORT

The Emmy Award-winning actress recounted the uncomfortable encounter she had with Seagal once she went to his hotel room.

“I got to the hotel at 10:40, and she (the casting director) wasn’t there. And he (Seagal) was. Alone. And he made sure that I saw his gun, which I had never seen a gun in real life. And I got out of there unscathed. I never was raped. And I never was harmed. And I don’t know how I got out of that hotel room. I sorta screamed my way out,” Margulies told Hutt.

Margulies did not elaborate further on her encounter with Seagal.

Margulies also told Hutt of a similar encounter she had with Weinstein. Margulies said she went to Weinstein’s room only because she was accompanied by a female assistant.

“He (Weinstein) opened the door, in a bathrobe. I could see that there were candles lit in the room, and there was a dinner for two. And I saw him stare at her (assistant), daggers. And he looked at me, furious. And he slammed the door. And, of course, I didn’t get the part,” Margulies said.

Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by a number of women following last month’s bombshell exposes that revealed the disgraced producer’s inappropriate behavior.

A spokesperson for Webster told Fox News in a statement he will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

Here’s what you need to know about the scandal:

Who is Kirt Webster?

Webster, 43, is a Nashville publicist who was the president and CEO of Webster PR. Fox News was told on Wednesday afternoon Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

The company announced Wednesday it will continue operating under the name Westby PR with former Webster PR Senior Vice President Jeremy Westby as CEO. However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.

Webster has worked in the music industry in Nashville for over 20 years. In addition to clients like Dolly Parton, his firm has also helped artists like George Jones and Kenny Rogers with their marketing campaigns.

Who is Austin Rick?

Austin Rick, whose stage name is Austin Cody, is originally from Waldorf, Maryland. He moved to Nashville in 2008 to work with Webster.

But after a year of alleged sexual assault and harassment by Webster, Rick moved back to Maryland and stepped away from his career, according to the Tennessean.

After ending his country career, Rick attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He graduated in May with a degree in sociology.

Despite moving away, Rick told Fox News that Webster has allegedly tried to contact him as recently as this year.

Rick created a GoFundMe page on Oct. 31 to help pay for his legal fees as he prepares to take Webster to court over the allegations.

Rick said he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

“He sexually assaulted me repeatedly, he drugged and sexually violated me, he offered me publicity opportunities and magazine columns in exchange for sexual acts. He paid me to keep my mouth shut,” Rick wrote on his GoFundMe page and on Facebook.

He is crowdfunding $15,000 for his legal fees.

Rick said he was inspired to share his story after the #MeToo social media movement went viral, which began after countless allegations against famed Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came to light.

COUNTRY MUSIC'S TOP PUBLICIST ACCUSED OF PROPOSITIONING INTERN FOR SEX

What has happened since Rick came forward?

Webster has denied Rick’s claims. Since then, many of Webster’s former employees have stepped forward with harassment allegations against him. One ex-employee, a man who requested anonymity, told Fox News “There [is] sexual harassment running rampant through that place as long as I’ve known.”

Another female employee told Fox News Webster once grabbed her hair and “humped” her in front of fellow staff members. She called the behavior “typical,” and said her former boss would “caress me” on multiple occasions.

Many former employees also detailed stories of unwanted physical contact. And, in addition to Rick, other men have come forward with allegations against Webster.

'HOUSE OF CARDS' CREW MEMBERS CLAIM KEVIN SPACEY ROUTINELY SEXUALLY HARASSED PEOPLE ON SET

Cody Anderson, 33, told Fox News on Wednesday that Webster propositioned him for sex while he was working as an intern for Webster PR in 2010.

Webster did not return Fox News' multiple requests for comment on the allegations.

What's happening now?

Police are not pursuing Rick’s charges against Webster because a statute of limitations prevents them from doing so, the Tennessean reported.

However, in addition to Parton, Rock, and Cyrus, many of Webster’s clients have also left the company. Those artists include: Justin Moore, Naomi Judd, Charlie Daniels and more.

Parton tweeted Friday that she “hopes the accusations are not true.”",Kirt Webster accused of sexual harassment: What to know about the claims,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/03/kirt-webster-accused-sexual-harassment-what-to-know-about-claims.html

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

Turn the lights down. If you’ve got absolutely no time to get ready for guests, you can try this last-ditch technique: Turn the lights down low, or close the blinds. The darker the room, the less dirt your guests will see. The darkness will hide many of your sins.",8 tricks to speed-clean your house before unexpected guests arrive,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/8-tricks-to-speed-clean-your-house-before-unexpected-guests-arrive.html

Time: 8:30 p.m.

MIAMI (AP) -- Exciting options this week for Sunday night TV viewers include ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" on E!, ""Vitamix -- More Than a Blender"" on QVC, and ""Anger Management"" on the CW, which might be the best choice for Dolphins and Raiders fans.

Or they can watch their own teams. The matchup between the Dolphins (4-3) and Raiders (3-5) will test the patience of their supporters and the tolerance of the prime-time audience.

The records are misleading; both teams are reeling. The Raiders have lost five of their past six games, including a 34-14 thumping last Sunday at Buffalo. The Dolphins are coming off a 40-0 loss at Baltimore, their worst defeat in 20 years.

More Miami Dolphins news

Oakland has been the better prime-time performer of late. The Raiders' lone win since mid-September was a Thursday night upset of Kansas City in Game 7, and they've won six of their past eight night games.

The Dolphins' drubbing at Baltimore also came on a Thursday night. They've lost four of their past five night games and now play three in a row, including in their next game at Carolina, giving the nation plenty of chances to watch the NFL's worst offense.

""Very seldom do you get back-to-back national TV games, and we're going three in a row,"" Dolphins offensive coordinator Clyde Christensen said. ""We can change the impression of the country.""

Or not. Here are things to know about this week's alternative programming to the Kardashians and Vitamix:

DOLPHINS SHAKE-UP

In the wake of the humiliation at Baltimore, coach Adam Gase fumed about missed assignments and poor study habits, then jettisoned 2016 Pro Bowl running back Jay Ajayi to the Philadelphia Eagles for a fourth-round draft pick.

Kenyan Drake and Damien Williams will replace Ajayi, which hardly guarantees improvement for an offense averaging a league-low 13 points per game.

""We've still got to open up holes for them,"" quarterback Jay Cutler said. ""We've got to get the ball to them out of the backfield. The other 10 guys, including myself, all have to do our part to help the running back position.

""I don't think it's an indictment on Jay that we traded him, because he's a really, really good player, and I think he's going to go up to Philadelphia and do well.""

Cutler rejoins the lineup after missing last week's loss with cracked ribs.

BEAST MODE'S BACK

Oakland gets a boost with the return of running back Marshawn Lynch. Beast Mode was suspended last week after running onto the field during a skirmish against Kansas City and shoving an official. The Raiders rushed for just 54 yards on 14 carries without him in last week's loss. Lynch has 266 yards on 72 carries this season.

""He's a physical guy. He brings passion for the game,"" coach Jack Del Rio said. ""Those are things that we welcome back.""

NO PICKS

The Raiders are the first team in NFL history to fail to intercept a pass in the first eight games of the season. Oakland has only five takeaways compared with 11 turnovers, a big turnaround from a year ago when the Raiders had a plus-7 turnover margin at the midway point.

""We need to be playmakers aggressively going for the ball, competing,"" Del Rio said. ""That's what I'm looking for. That's what we're looking to get this second half.""

ROAD TRIP

Following the game at Buffalo, the Raiders flew to Sarasota, Florida, and practiced this week at the IMG Academy. Oakland had a similar routine last year between games at Jacksonville and Tampa Bay, winning both.

""I believe it gives the team some time to gel,"" linebacker NaVorro Bowman said. ""When we have adverse situations, we're able to stick together and not go home and focus on other things.""

DOWN AND DISTANCE

The Dolphins have converted 29 percent of their third and fourth downs, worst in the league. They're averaging 4.3 yards on first down, worst in the AFC.

""Our biggest issue has been we haven't put ourselves in great position on third down,"" Gase said. ""We've been in a ridiculous amount of third-and-10, third-and-11-plus. The percentages of converting those are so low. Right now every yard we can get to get us in third-and-6 or less is really a step we need.""

Womer was taking photos with her dear horses Dutch, a sorrel gelding, and Cricket, a paint mare, when Cricket started smiling for the camera.

FLORIDA COUPLE GOES TO TACO BELL FOR POST-WEDDING PHOTOSHOOT

Now the cocked-head, wide-mouthed grin has gone viral on Facebook after the photographer, Tony Bendele, posted them to his Facebook.

“I honestly don’t mind having attention on her instead of me. Dutch and Cricket are such a big part of me, and I will always have a special place in my heart for them,” Womer tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The two horses were a present from her father when she was 8 years old. Her close bond to the two animals and their connection to her father – who passed away in 2016 – prompted her to include them in her wedding. The two escorted Womer up to the ceremony. Dutch, her father’s horse, walked beside Cricket with an empty saddle.

“This just showed that my father was there with me through the whole thing,” Womer, an agriculture science major at Penn State University, said to Yahoo.

Bendele, who has photographed wildlife before, told Yahoo that he’s “never seen a horse doing the smile like that.”

“It actually caught my eye initially when we first started doing the photographs. As the bride was smiling the horse would look up and put its teeth just like that,” he said.

Womer concedes that Cricket isn’t exactly smiling for the cameras.

“Honestly, the horse is just shaking her head trying to get a fly off or something but with her showing her teeth, it looks like she is smiling,” she said.

But people on Facebook have still been enjoying the pictures and many have commented saying they would like to incorporate their own animals into their ceremonies.

To that, Bendele encourages people to make sure they know how their animals will react to large groups and loud sounds.

“We had an experience back in 2016 where we had a bride come down in a carriage and they were going to walk it down the aisle,” he recalls. “As soon as one of the horses got close to the people, somebody had their back turned to it and then turned around and scared it, so it took off and actually flipped the carriage.”

We don't all have to be boots on the ground to serve. When we each bring our talents to give back, the country thrives.

The week after Chris and his friend Chad Littlefield were buried, Jason and I began our work.

He spent hundreds of hours with me on the phone -- at all hours -- as I was making my way through the loss of Chris.

Many times the conversations about our lives and the movie were squeezed in between kids' activities or after the kids were in bed and the work for the day could be set aside.

Jason's wife was amazing in understanding the toll and timing of working through this widow's intense grief while multiple projects were looming and my kids and their pain were still my first priority.

I know Jason's dedication to detail in getting a story right.

I have experienced the sacrifices he is willing to make to honor raw vulnerability and strength as he brings real lives to the screen.

This movie is aptly named for a man who is clearly experiencing his own years of service as he gives his huge Thank You For Your Service with this film.

This is his thank you, and it can be ours, too, as we watch, remember and learn about what it is to serve.

This movie is for our men and women in uniform and a tribute to the families who love them.

It is for all citizens and those internationally who respect the heart of Americans who will die for each other, die for our allies and the freedom we value for all people.

But Chinese leaders are spooked. President Trump is the first American president to sanction a Chinese bank for helping North Korea evade U.S. and United Nations economic sanctions.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will no doubt flatter his American guest, hoping that President Trump prefers the image of a successful summit to a confrontation over sanctions. But President Trump should not fall for it.

With North Korea on the brink of being able to strike the U.S. with a nuclear missile, President Trump must increase pressure on Pyongyang and its enablers, especially Beijing.

China has responded well to U.S. pressure so far. For example, it issued a banking directive prohibiting financial transactions with North Koreans and another directive prohibiting North Korean businesses in China and joint ventures. But this is not enough.

China accounts for an estimated 90 percent of North Korean trade, giving it significant economic leverage. And according to the U.N., China imported $182 million of North Korean coal in August and September this year, despite its February pledge to stop the practice.

If Beijing cannot implement its own coal restriction, we should not trust that it will act against its own citizens who help North Korea evade economic sanctions. President Trump should tell Xi as much.

While the two leaders should project a cordial relationship in public, President Trump should warn Xi in private that Washington will move forward with robust sanctions targeting Chinese companies and banks that facilitate North Korea’s evasion of sanctions.

Chinese entities that strengthen North Korea’s economy by getting around sanctions undermine the American policy of financially isolating North Korea. That isolation is key to gaining leverage as a means to prevent a military conflict.

Xi knows what’s coming. The Trump administration has already sanctioned Chinese and Russian facilitators of North Korea’s sanctions evasion, and in September sanctioned 26 overseas representatives of North Korean banks.

These actions are a clear warning shot to Beijing that Washington is widely expected to target additional Chinese nationals and banks that play a key role in these illegal schemes.

The Trump administration should take a page from the Iran sanctions playbook and issue fines against Chinese banks for failing to identify North Korean transactions – similar to the $12 billion in fines issued from 2012 to 2015 against European banks for Iran sanctions violations.

President Trump is also visiting Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe solidified his supermajority in recent elections.

Abe declared North Korea as one of Japan’s two national crises. And in a sign that Washington fully backs Abe’s North Korea policy, President Trump will meet with families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. At minimum, the visit will shine a spotlight on Pyongyang’s abhorrent human rights record.

President Trump’s itinerary also includes South Korea. His relationship with President Moon Jae-In has not always been an easy one, because of differences in whether to confront or engage the North Korean regime of dictator Kim Jong Un. However, North Korea’s provocations have drawn the U.S. and South Korea closer.

U.S. military assistance has also strengthened ties with South Korea. Seoul has deployed a U.S.-supplied Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense system to defend against North Korea’s missile program. The North Korean human rights issue offers another area of commonality with Moon, who was a human rights lawyer.

If President Trump plays his cards right, he will discourage South Korea from drawing closer to Beijing. China already agreed to suspend its sanctions against South Korea in exchange for a commitment that Seoul will not deploy additional THAAD launchers, participate in a U.S. regional missile defense, or enter into a trilateral defense alliance with Japan. The China-South Korea détente could erode American leverage with Beijing.

More broadly, President Trump must seize the opportunity on this trip to build a multilateral coalition outside the U.N. of likeminded countries (South Korea, Japan, Australia, Britain, France and Germany) that commits to increasing pressure on North Korea.

This group of nations should focus on identifying additional networks ripe for coordinated sanctions actions. It should also target North Korean shipping by declaring that all vessels linked to North Korea can be inspected under U.N. and international law.

Amidst all of this, President Trump should be prepared for new North Korean missile tests during his time in the region. Kim Jong Un wants to remain in the spotlight.

But no matter what Pyongyang launches, Trump’s message must be consistent: denuclearization is America’s vision for the Korean Peninsula. The United States must not accept anything less, given North Korea’s egregious history of nuclear, chemical and missile proliferation.",Trump should confront China on North Korean nukes during his Asia trip,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/trump-should-confront-china-on-north-korean-nukes-during-his-asia-trip.html

His party's power is long gone, his ideas mostly discredited — but Vladimir Lenin's visage remains a fixture in much of the former Soviet Union.

The thousands of statues of him spread across the vast region bring to mind poet Vladimir Mayakovsky's ringing line of devotion: ""Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live.""

The past tense applies to many of the statues. They were torn down and pulverized by angry mobs, as happened in Kiev during the wave of protests in 2013-14, or methodically demounted by local authorities.

Some of the Lenin statues taken down with care were moved from public squares and prominent points to quiet, secluded parks. There Lenin seems less like a fiery leader than a grumpy retiree, his arm outstretched as if trying to call back a bus that sped past him.

But in other spots, that arm is clearly calling the masses to rise up and go forward.

That effect is especially dramatic in the statue that towers over the square at St. Petersburg's Finland Station — a site historically renowned as the place where Lenin returned to his homeland aboard a sealed train after years in exile, a few months before the 1917 Russian revolution.

Viewed as a whole, the statues are monotonous — Lenin is always portrayed as stern — but there are individual nuances. In some, he holds a lapel in a gesture of self-confidence. In others, like the one in the center of Moscow's noisy, traffic-choked Kaluzhskaya Square, he has one hand in his pocket, casually surveying the scene with a boulevardier's air.

Of all the statues, the one that may distill the cult of Lenin to its purest form is the seven-meter (25-foot) tall head that dominates the central square of Ulan-Ude, a city 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) southeast of Lake Baikal in southeast Russia.

There's no body language to read, just Lenin's judgmental stare.

The square was redesigned especially to accommodate the giant head. Removing it would leave the square seeming barren and pointless. There, at least, it's likely that Lenin will live.","100 years after Russian revolution, Lenin statues abound",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/05/100-years-after-russian-revolution-lenin-statues-abound.html

Previous research suggested the T-Rex was more of a sensitive lover than you might think.","The Tyrannosaurus Rex was one of the scariest killers in the history of Planet Earth.

But its fearsome image was undermined a little by the ridiculousness of its puny arms, which were among the smallest of all dinosaurs when considered proportionally against the size of its body.

Now one scientists has claimed the tiny arms were actually ""vicious weapons"" equipped with four-inch claws which would have allowed it to eviscerate its unfortunate prey.

Steven Stanley, a palaeontologist working at the University of Hawaii, gave a presentation to The Geological Society of America last week in which he claimed nature equipped the monster with ""formidable weaponry"".

The research flies in the face of previous suggestions that the T-Rex was a lover as well as a fighter, which used its little arms to clasp its partner close during sex.

“Its short, strong forelimbs and large claws would have permitted T-Rex, whether mounted on a victim’s back or grasping it with its jaws, to inflict four gashes a metre or more long and several centimetres deep within a few seconds,” said Stanley, according to New Scientist.

“And it could have repeated this multiple times in rapid succession.”

Other scientists have cast doubt on these claims, with Jakob Vinther, a paleobiologist from the University of Bristol, suggesting Stanley's argument was ""illogical"".

The T-Rex's stubby extremities were just three feet long, meaning it would have needed to get extremely close to its victims if it wanted to rend them limb from limb.

And the arms really were used for lovemaking, the claws would hardly have made the encounter very comfortable.

Previous research suggested the T-Rex was more of a sensitive lover than you might think.

The terrifying meat-eater, which stood 20 feet tall and had jaws bristling with serrated teeth up to nine inches long, was believed to have had a snout as sensitive to touch as human fingertips.

A team of researchers suggested two rexy beasts would rub their noses together during foreplay, before getting down to the monstrous act of physical love.

Now the cocked-head, wide-mouthed grin has gone viral on Facebook after the photographer, Tony Bendele, posted them to his Facebook.

“I honestly don’t mind having attention on her instead of me. Dutch and Cricket are such a big part of me, and I will always have a special place in my heart for them,” Womer tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The two horses were a present from her father when she was 8 years old. Her close bond to the two animals and their connection to her father – who passed away in 2016 – prompted her to include them in her wedding. The two escorted Womer up to the ceremony. Dutch, her father’s horse, walked beside Cricket with an empty saddle.

“This just showed that my father was there with me through the whole thing,” Womer, an agriculture science major at Penn State University, said to Yahoo.

Bendele, who has photographed wildlife before, told Yahoo that he’s “never seen a horse doing the smile like that.”

“It actually caught my eye initially when we first started doing the photographs. As the bride was smiling the horse would look up and put its teeth just like that,” he said.

“Honestly, the horse is just shaking her head trying to get a fly off or something but with her showing her teeth, it looks like she is smiling,” she said.

But people on Facebook have still been enjoying the pictures and many have commented saying they would like to incorporate their own animals into their ceremonies.

To that, Bendele encourages people to make sure they know how their animals will react to large groups and loud sounds.

“We had an experience back in 2016 where we had a bride come down in a carriage and they were going to walk it down the aisle,” he recalls. “As soon as one of the horses got close to the people, somebody had their back turned to it and then turned around and scared it, so it took off and actually flipped the carriage.”

You can usually set up two-factor authentication either on your online banking account page or within the bank’s official app.
If they can steal your identity and bank account, they will, and as expediently as possible.","The name “Equifax” now sends shivers down our spines. The company we trusted to handle our credit scores has become a pariah of the financial world since it allowed hackers to steal vital information from 145 million American adults.

I’m one of them. You probably are too. Click here to check if your personal data was exposed in the Equifax data breach.

How much information was stolen? Let’s start with the basics: Your name, Social Security number and birthdate. That alone is a treasure trove for identity thieves. But they also may have your address and driver’s license number. These people know where you live. They can find out almost anything about you. The list of nefarious things they can do is beyond comprehension.

An example? Click here to learn how the Equifax breach lets ID thieves have surgery on your dime.

Here’s my best advice: Assume the worst. The hackers have your information, and Equifax can’t do anything to protect you. Law enforcement is too overwhelmed to find the culprits, and you are completely exposed.

Here’s what to do next.

Establish two-factor authentication

If you work at a modern business or organization, you’re probably familiar with this process already. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step to the login process of your most critical accounts. When a website asks for your user name and password, you may also receive a text message or an email with a special code. This is a standard practice and is considered safe.

The idea is that even though hackers may have figured out your credentials, they won't be able to access your account without the special code. Cybercriminals would have to nab your physical cellphone, which is probably protected by a passcode, as well. Using this system makes the task much too complicated, especially when many hackers are located in other countries.

Who allows 2FA?

Several websites and email providers already offer 2FA to help protect accounts. The problem is that these sites and providers don’t seem to promote these extra security measures. It’s up to users to figure it out.

Use Amazon, Google or Facebook? How about Apple or Microsoft? All offer 2FA protection, but only if you take a few minutes to set it up. Click here for the steps you need to take now to lock down your accounts.

But what about banks? Incredibly, not all banks support two-factor authentication. Given recent events, I expect this to change. In the meantime, you’ll have to check and see if your online banking permits 2FA. If it does, sign up for it right away.

You can usually set up two-factor authentication either on your online banking account page or within the bank’s official app. Here are the links to some of the more popular banks or financial institutions' two-factor authentication setup pages:

· Bank of America

· Capital One

· Discover

· USAA

· Wells Fargo

If your bank is not on the list, call or visit it.

Prevent identity theft

OK, you’ve done your best to secure your accounts and made it hard for hackers to break into your bank or email. But remember, the Equifax hack happened last spring. Cybercriminals have had plenty of time to steal your identity. So what can you do to keep them from finishing the job?

Try executing a “credit freeze,” more accurately known as a “security freeze.” The name may sound strange, almost like sabotaging your own finances, but it’s a common defensive maneuver. If you suspect someone is already pretending to be you, you can lock your credit reports so that no one can open a new account in your name.

How does this work? Lenders consult your credit score before they start a partnership with you. If lenders can’t check those scores, no new accounts can be established.

Click here to learn more about how to set up a security freeze.

The most important thing is not to wait. Hackers move quickly, and this is their fulltime job. If they can steal your identity and bank account, they will, and as expediently as possible. Equifax made one of the biggest blunders in banking history. Now it’s up to us to clean up the mess.

Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple.
On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.
President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

Getting 200,000 miles of use—or more—from a vehicle is an impressive feat, but it’s not impossible. Owners should be aware, though, that as a vehicle approaches that milestone, many of its components will start to wear out.

You’ll see some warning signs, or red flags. Pay attention to them and you can avoid the double whammy of being stranded and slapped with an expensive, unexpected repair.

To help out owners trying to reach that 200,000-mile mark, we compiled estimates of the expenses involved to fix these common problems. Using a 2010 Toyota Camry with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, located in northern New Jersey, as our model car, we used the free Consumer Reports Car Repair Estimator to determine the costs. Powered by CR’s partner RepairPal, it provides regional estimates for repair work; your actual costs may differ. Remember to shop around for the best deals.

These repairs are ordered from the most expensive to the least expensive to complete.

1. Brakes

What are the warning signs? “A spongy or sinking brake pedal can be a sign of a failing brake master cylinder,” says CR's chief mechanic, John Ibbotson. If you live in the snow belt, make sure to check the hard brake lines for rust or weak spots.

Can I do it myself? Unless you’ve worked on brakes with someone else (like helping a parent years ago), this is a job for a qualified mechanic.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Brake Master Cylinder $294-$375 $216-$306 Brake Calipers (front, both side) $235-$300 $260-$918 Brake Rotors and Pads (rear, both sides) $235-$300 $243-$890 Brake Rotors and Pads (front) $127-$163 $215-$402 Brake Rotors and Pads (rear) $127-$163 $195-$345 Brake Fluid Flush $112-$156 $34-$56

What happens if I ignore the red flag? In the worst-case scenario, you’ll have a brake failure and end up in a crash. In the best scenario, you’ll wear the brake pads down to their metal backing plates, resulting in poor braking performance and a loud metal-on-metal noise when you try to stop the car.

CR's best advice: You should have your brakes checked regularly and change the brake fluid as recommended in the owner’s manual. Don’t do the work yourself unless you are absolutely confident in your ability.

2. Mechanical Components Reaching the End of Life

What are the warning signs? Even the strongest original parts can wear out. “Don’t go cheap on replacement parts in order to save a few bucks,” Ibbotson says. “If you replaced worn parts with substandard knockoffs, they might be on their way to failure much sooner than the original equipment.” Slow cranking of the engine can be a sign of a failing battery or alternator.

Can I do it myself? If you're mechanically inclined and used to working on cars, you can probably replace the alternator and maybe the power steering pump. But it’s best to have a mechanic handle the steering rack.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Alternator $98-$125 $271-$649 Power-Steering Pump $186-$238 $204-$409 Steering Rack $726-$925 $410-$904

What happens if I ignore the red flag? If your alternator fails, your car has no way of charging the battery. Eventually the vehicle will leave you stranded, either from a lack of battery voltage or because you won’t be able to start it. A bad power-steering pump means it will get more difficult to turn the wheels. Ignoring the steering rack can be dangerous because you might lose the ability to steer.

CR's best advice: Don’t mess around with steering components; get them handled ASAP. And don't ignore a bad or failing alternator. Note that some premium parts may come with a lifetime warranty, so be sure to ask when buying.

3. Noisy Exhaust System

What are the warning signs? “You can tell that your exhaust system is reaching the end of its life because your car will get increasingly louder,” Ibbotson says. Exhaust leaks can be dangerous and should be repaired at the first sign.

Can I do it myself? No.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Catalytic Converter $127-$163 $874-$1,301 Exhaust Manifold $137-$175 $325-$750

What happens if I ignore the red flag? Exhaust fumes will eventually enter the vehicle and could make occupants ill.

CR's best advice: You should have a mechanic or a muffler/exhaust shop do the repairs. And don’t go with cheap catalytic converters; they probably won’t last very long and you’ll be back in the same situation in a couple of years.

4. Electrical Components Beginning to Fail

What are the warning signs? “Don’t be surprised if features such as power windows, windshield wipers, and even the instrument panel go on the fritz,” Ibbotson says. “The gremlins can be frustratingly difficult to trace.”

Can I do it myself? The door and window components can be handled by a home mechanic who has experience working on cars. The windshield parts are trickier to work on, but it's still something a competent amateur mechanic can handle. But the oxygen sensors should be replaced by a professional mechanic.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Windshield Wiper Motor $78-$100 $187-$227 Windshield Washer Pump $49-$63 $35-$54 Power Door Lock Actuator $88-$113 $292-$323 Door Window Regulator $127-$163 $101-$164 Door Window Motor $98-$125 $239-$488

What happens if I ignore the red flag? You may not be able to lock or unlock your door or raise and lower the windows if you ignore those components. Your windshield will be messy and difficult to see through if you don’t fix the washer pump or wiper motor.

CR's best advice: Keeping the windshield clean isn’t just an appearance issue, it’s a safety one, too. Get that handled ASAP. The door and window components are somewhat less important—unless you can’t lock your car manually or the windows are stuck open in the winter!

5. Moisture Buildup

What are the warning signs? If it seems that the inside of your windshield is always fogging up or you are mysteriously losing coolant, it’s likely that the heater core is starting to fail.

Can I do it myself? No.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Heater Core $1,029-$1,313 $207-$386

What happens if I ignore the red flag? You'll notice poor defrosting capability that results in decreased visibility. If left for too long, it can result in the engine overheating, leading to engine damage.

CR's best advice: “Even the smallest pinholes will cause interior fogging,” Ibbotson says. “It’s most likely going to be an expensive repair, because the heater core is under the dashboard.” Use a high-quality replacement unit to avoid having to repeat the repair again too soon.

6. Outdated Shocks and Struts

What are the warning signs? Does your car bounce up and down as you drive down the road? You may need new shocks or struts, Ibbotson says. Uneven tire wear is also an early indicator of this.

Can I do it myself? Not unless you own a lot of tools, are very handy, and have plenty of time. Make an appointment with a mechanic.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Front Struts/Shocks $284-$363 $278-$412 Rear Struts $324-$413 $326-$510

What happens if I ignore the red flag? You'll experience poor or dangerous handling, and you could wind up with excessive and uneven tire wear.

CR's best advice: Get it done as soon as you notice the warning signs in order to avoid any safety issues.

7. Failing Radiator

What are the warning signs? “A failing radiator or thermostat can cause the engine to run too hot or eventually overheat,” Ibbotson says. Low fluid levels in the coolant reservoir could indicate a leak in the radiator, engine, hoses, or all three.

Can I do it myself? No.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Radiator Hose Replacement $255-$325 $60-$93 Thermostat Replacement $137-$175 $40-$64 Radiator Replacement $304-$388 $295-$601

What happens if I ignore the red flag? An engine that runs too hot can overheat, damaging the internal parts. This could result in the engine failing, forcing you to get a replacement.

CR's best advice: Routinely check and top off your vehicle’s coolant, especially before long road trips. If the fluid level looks low or you see the engine temperature is often very high, make an appointment with a mechanic as soon as possible.

8. Oil Consumption and Leaks

What are the warning signs? Increased oil consumption is common in older cars, so don’t panic if your car seems thirstier the older it gets. But if you think you’re topping off the oil too much, it could be a sign of a bigger leak.

Can I do it myself? An oil and filter change can be done by most competent home mechanics who have the proper tools. But it usually isn’t worth the savings to do it yourself because you still have to dispose of the oil. If you think there's a leak or the oil light has come on in your car, immediately check the oil level. Then take the vehicle to a professional to find out what's wrong.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Oil and Filter $27-$62 (labor & parts)

Oil Leak Diagnosis $98-$125 $0 Engine Oil Light Diagnosis $98-$125 $0 Valve Cover Gasket $88-$113 $28-$41

What happens if I ignore the red flag? Oil lubricates the engine parts and helps dissipate heat. So running out of oil will result in the internal engine parts contacting each other directly and wearing out prematurely. Never changing the oil will result in the engine seizing; if that happens, it will have to be replaced.

CR's best advice: Routinely check and top off your vehicle’s oil between changes, especially before long road trips.

9. Spark Plugs That Haven't Been Changed

What are the warning signs? If you haven’t changed the plugs in 100,000 miles of use, the engine runs rough and misfires, or you have trouble starting your car, you should replace the spark plugs. Buying the right kind and getting the right service can make all the difference.

Can I do it myself? While spark plugs come pre-gapped—that is, there's the appropriate amount of space between the center and side electrodes of the plug—you have to use a special tool to make sure they are gapped to your car’s requirements. If it isn’t gapped properly, the plug won’t make a spark to ignite the gas. Make sure you buy the right type of plug for your make and model at an auto-parts store. With cars built before the 1990s, you can probably do the job yourself. But with most newer models, Ibbotson recommends having the dealer or a certified repair shop handle it.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Spark Plug Replacement $59-$75 $48-$72

What happens if I ignore the red flag? You might see your fuel economy and engine performance get worse.

CR's best advice: If maintained well, spark plugs can last 100,000 miles. By the 200,000 mark, you could be overdue for installing a third set of plugs. Make an appointment with your dealer or a trusted mechanic to have the work done.

10. Rust

What are the warning signs? It starts with paint that looks like it has bubbles forming. Once you see even a little bit forming around the wheel wells, hood, trunk, or suspension mounting points, there could be a serious problem beneath the surface.

Can I do it myself? No.

What’s the cost? It depends on the extent of the damage. If you have rust, get several competing estimates on the work.

What happens if I ignore the red flag? You can patch surface rust, but that will only slow down the problem. Replacing body panels on a 200,000-mile car can be expensive. At this point, the clock has started ticking on how much longer you’re going to keep the car.

CR's best advice: Have a professional repair shop check to see whether it’s surface rust or there's a structural weakness that will make your car less safe in a crash.

Lt. Steven Arango was attending Bates College in Maine, when he read a New York Times article that inspired him.

The article profiled Captain George Whitney, 38, a Bates College alumnus and a C.I.A paramilitary officer who was killed in December in Afghanistan.

“After I read about him, I knew right away that Bates needed to honor him,” Arango said to ConnectingVets.com.

Whitney excelled both academically and athletically at Bates College; he graduated cum laude after playing football as the starting fullback. After college, Whitney joined the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, serving in Anbar, Iraq. He then joined the C.I.A, but was killed in action during an operation in Afghanistan.

Whitney, along with two others, was awarded stars from the C.I.A for dying in the line of duty.

“He epitomized selfless service and gave his life in protection of our country,” Arango said. “Simply put, he’s a hero.”

Inspired by Whitney’s heroism, Arango petitioned Bates College to honor his legacy.

Arango decided that a sculpted bust would be the perfect tribute to Whitney, and contracted the help of retired USMC Colonel and Alabama artist Lee Busby.

Also a University of Alabama graduate, Busby sculpts Alabamians who have been killed in Iraq of Afghanistan.

""I'm no Michelangelo, but I know the world that these people operate in, and I know what they went through,” Busby told Southern Living. “And, I do have some ability to sculpt. So, that's what I want to do.""

Now, Busby is nearly halfway done with the bust of Whitney and is ready to sculpt the finishing touches.

“We are flying Caryn Whitney into Tuscaloosa to put the final touches on the bust,” Arango said. “We want to make sure the likeness is exactly of her son.”

Busby expects to complete the sculpture by December, which then will be used for pouring — the process used to make a bronze bust.

Arango is funding this project completely alone, and hopes that Bates College can provide space for the memorial.

“I just want Captain Whitney to be honored,” Arango said. “For the next 100, 200 years with Bates students walking next to him and seeing him? I promise you Bates will turn out even better students than they are now.”

The new homeowners, who wished to remain nameless, are now suing the Lennar construction company for fraud and breach of warranty. They’re also seeking punitive and compensatory damages, as well as any court costs they incur, per the Post.

In addition to bottles of urine, court documents say the couple found “containers containing remnants of partially eaten food, construction debris and other garbage” within the walls of their new residence at the luxury 1200 Avenue at Port Imperial building, including partially eaten Chinese food orders and cupcake wrappers. The insulation in the master bedroom was also found to be soaked in urine.

(Lennar is only opening up the lower parts of certain walls, the Post reports.) The couple also tried to sell the home back to Lennar, but their offer was rejected.

The Boston Celtics and the Orlando Magic hold two of the top records in the Eastern Conference.

Heading into Sunday's meeting in Orlando, the teams are coming off distinctly different performances.

Boston (7-2) is on a seven-game winning streak while the Magic (6-3) are smarting from their worst showing of the season and first home defeat of the season.

The Celtics continued their streak by executing a complete reversal Friday night in Oklahoma City. Before Kyrie Irving scored 22 of his 25 points in the second half in a 101-94 win, the Celtics were shooting 31 percent and trailed by halftime.

Orlando Magic on FOX Sports Florida

""It feels good, understanding what we were battling, the type of first half we put out there,"" Irving said. ""Man, it was ugly. It was an ugly first half. It wasn't pretty. We understand that.""

Irving scored 15 points in the fourth quarter, helping the Celtics become the first team to start 0-2 and follow it up with a seven-game winning streak.

The Celtics are a seven-game winning streak for the second time in 2017. They also won seven straight Jan. 25-Feb. 5 and are looking to get an eighth straight victory for the first time since putting 14 straight wins together Nov. 22-Dec. 22, 2010.

Boston leads the league in points allowed at 93.8, is among the league leaders in opposing field goal percentage (43.1) and opposing 3-point percentage (32.1).

The Celtics improved those numbers by outscoring Oklahoma City 64-39 after halftime and limiting the Thunder to 33.3 percent from the field in the final 24 minutes.

The turnaround from Boston's worst first half of the season occurred after a spirited halftime discussion.

""I think that we just all challenged each other to just come out and play hard, to be better,"" center Al Horford said of the halftime talk. ""And we did that. We could have easily kind of folded, but it shows character. Our guys came out and kept fighting. We didn't make excuses. You know, just proud of the group. We responded the right way.""

About three hours before Boston kept its streak going, the Magic were handed an ugly 105-83 loss to the Chicago Bulls, who are 2-5.

Orlando held a one-point lead at halftime but was outscored 61-38 the rest of the way, shooting 32.6 percent (14 of 23) while allowing the Bulls to shoot 57.8 percent (22 of 38).

""There's no reason to panic,"" center Nikola Vucevic said. ""It's one game. We've had eight games before that. So, we have to prepare for a big one against a great team like Boston. It's going to be a huge test for us, but we have to respond.""

Orlando shot a 40.7 percent and a season-worst 28.6 percent from 3-point range (10 of 35). The tough shooting night dropped its 3-point percentage from 44 percent to 42.1.

""We had a tough-shooting half both from the 3-point line and at the basket and missed some layups, but you have to play through that stuff and stay true to who you are,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""I thought when we got behind, or we weren't making shots we kind of fell into some bad habits and that's part of the reason for the offensive woes.""

The Magic played without Elfrid Payton, who missed his seventh straight game with a hamstring injury and D.J. Augustin, who sat out with a hamstring injury. Augustin has a mild to moderate injury after getting hurt Wednesday and was starting for Payton, who may return Sunday.

Shelvin Mack started at point guard and while he recorded eight assists, he was 1 of 8 from the field. He would likely start again if Payton does not play.

""We had our starting point guard out the whole season and we played really well and with a good rhythm offensively,"" Vogel said. ""We just have to make sure we come back and find that on Sunday.""

Korie and her husband, Willie Robertson, adopted their son Will when he was just five weeks old. They’ve become proponents of adoption and previously told People that their son being biracial hasn’t come up in the way they raise him, only in how the public looks at them.

“We have an active conversation with our members and a whole host of ideas on things to add to this bill,” Ryan said.
“And that’s one of the things that’s being discussed.”","House Speaker Paul Ryan expressed outrage Sunday about recent revelations that Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign cut a deal with the Democratic National Committee that effectively eliminated any potential primary challenger’s chances of winning the party nomination, saying, “this takes the cake.”

“We’ve all said the Clintons live above the law,” the Wisconsin Republican told “Fox News Sunday."" “But this takes the cake.”

The Clinton campaign in 2015 reportedly made a deal with the DNC to give the cash-strapped group money -- including a purported $1.2 million down payment -- in exchange for being able to have input over such key decisions as hiring, spending and strategic research.

The revelations came to light last week when former interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile, in Politico, highlighted the plan in excerpts from her upcoming book.

A copy of the joint-funding agreement, which other Democratic candidates, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also could have used, was published this weekend by NBC News.

Trump has suggested the FBI or the Justice Department investigate the matter.

Ryan on Sunday suggested the Federal Election Commission should investigate.

“You can understand why the Democrats are mad about this,” he also said. “They should be. I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Ryan, in the wide-ranging interview, also expressed optimism for the tax-reform plan that congressional Republicans released last week.

“I feel very good about it,” he said about the plan and its path to President Trump’s desk for signature.

Ryan said the GOP-controlled House is on track to pass the bill by Thanksgiving, with the GOP-controlled Senate to follow in about a week.

He also acknowledged that the House this past summer passed a measure to repeal and replace ObamaCare, only to have the effort fail in the Senate. And he argued the tax-reform plan will be better, more coordinated.

“We did things differently this time because of the health care experience,” Ryan told Fox News. “We worked for the Senate ahead of time, from the summer on, to put this bill together, to basically create a framework of this bill: House, Senate, and the White House, and launch this thing together, and be very coordinated.”

He also left the door open that a final version of the plan could indeed include ending the so-called individual mandate in ObamaCare, which requires Americans to purchase health-care insurance or face a tax penalty.

[It] impacts their emotional well-being.”For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash.
And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back.
The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood.
We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies.","This past weekend the Wall Street Journal published what I consider to be the most important op-ed of the 21st century. Due to its sensitive nature, Americans rarely hear about this subject. But they should.

The article, by James Taranto, is entitled “The Politicization of Motherhood,” and it centers on an interview with psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, whose new book “Being There: Why Prioritizing Motherhood in the First Three Years Matters,” makes the oh-so-obvious yet controversial argument that babies need their mothers.

As Komisar says in a video about her book, “Mothers are critically important to children in the first three years of life. [It] impacts their emotional well-being.”

For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash. After all, it’s taboo enough to suggest parents should stay home. It’s even more taboo to suggest that parent be Mom. Why? Because popular orthodoxy insists the sexes are interchangeable. That’s what the gender equality crowd believes, and it’s what they want everyone else to believe.

If you don’t agree with it (and you shouldn’t, because it isn’t true), you’ll be treated as a pariah. “I couldn’t get on NPR,” Komisar told Taranto. And, she adds, she was “rejected wholesale—particularly in New York—by the liberal press.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

Komisar did manage to get a spot on “Good Morning America;” but prior to the interview, host Lara Spencer made it clear to Komisar that she didn’t like her book and didn’t “believe in its premise.”

Well, of course she didn’t. Morning television is dominated by female producers and journalists, many of whom are married with kids. And as Bernard Goldberg wrote in “Bias,” “…those gals got a dog in this fight.” He adds, “America’s newsrooms are filled with women who drop their kids off someplace before they go to work or leave them at home with a nanny. These journalists are not just defending working mothers—they’re defending themselves!”

How rich I’d be if I had a dollar for every time I’ve run into this media bias. My first book, which was published 15 years ago (and was coincidentally re-released this year), is similar to Komisar’s in that I make a case for why a mother’s physical and emotional presence are vital to children, to families and to society as a whole. And I too was vilified in the media.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back. What we do want is to be a child-centric society.”

Not the kind of child-centric society we have now, where children are coddled by well-meaning but overprotective parents.

The kind that puts the needs of children above the needs of adults.

Unfortunately, Komisar and I part ways on how to create such a society. As a political liberal, Komisar believes the answer is other people’s money. “All mothers and babies should have the right to be together in the first year,” she says. To do that, America needs maternity leave at full pay “and then flexibility to be together as much as possible for the next two years—meaning mothers should have the ability to work flexibly and part time.”

It is true that flexibility and part-time work become indispensable once children are older and in school all day, but it’s pointless in the first three years. The needs and demands of a baby, let alone a baby and a toddler, are simply too great to be able devote one’s attention to something else without everything falling apart.

Still, there is much Komisar gets right. Her case is particularly compelling because her work has been developed from “three decades’ experience treating families,” writes Taranto. And her conclusions are right on the mark—though admittedly, for some, are hard to hear.

“What I was seeing,” notes Komisar, “was an increase in children being diagnosed with ADHD and an increase in aggression in children, especially in boys, and an increase in depression in little girls.” She saw that the absence of mothers in children’s daily lives was “one of the triggers for these mental disorders.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

They won’t acknowledge it because they refuse to allow themselves, or anyone else, to feel guilty about the choices they’ve made—as if experiencing this emotion is tantamount to being tortured.

But it isn’t the end of the world to feel guilt. “My best patient is a patient who comes to me feeling guilty,” says Komisar. “Women who feel guilty—it’s a ‘signal’ feeling, that something’s wrong, that they’re in conflict. If they go talk to a therapist or deal with the conflict head-on, they often make different choices and better choices.”

And one of those choices, to prioritize baby care well in advance of its arrival, is a smart one. The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood. We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies. We don’t understand it because we refuse to look.

But the information is there for all who choose to see.",It's time we acknowledge how indispensable mothers are to their babies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/31/its-time-acknowledge-how-indispensable-mothers-are-to-their-babies.html

The stunning revelation by longtime operative Donna Brazile that the Hillary Clinton campaign secretly took control — literal control — of the Democratic National Committee a year before Hillary became the party’s nominee is the talk of American politics.

As it should be.

Brazile’s piece in Politico describes her shock at the discovery of formal legal paperwork between the two entities when she took the reins at the DNC in August 2016. Brazile had been tapped for the job when DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign. Leaked e-mails had shown how Schultz had been putting her finger on the scale to help Clinton while the insurgent Bernie Sanders campaign was making a serious bid to seize the party nomination away from New York’s favorite carpetbagger.



Her account features ridiculous and unbelievable melodramatics — she says she “gasped” when she found out the truth and that she “lit a candle in my living room and put on some gospel music” to calm her before she called Bernie Sanders to deliver the awful news.

But silly though Brazile’s prose is, her account is vitally important not only for all those who want to understand how American politics works but also for the future of Brazile’s beloved party.

First, it raises key questions about what was happening as Hillary Clinton faced a time of trial in the middle of 2015. Her reputation was taking hits as her evasions and denials and untruths about what had happened to the private e-mail server she had set up illegitimately in 2009 seemed to mushroom on a daily basis.

As this was happening, she found herself with only two semi-serious challengers for the nomination — Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.",Did Hillary's Rigging at the DNC Push Biden Out of the Race?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/03/did-hillarys-rigging-dnc-push-biden-out-race

Through thick and thin and a switch to Chinese ownership, it hasn’t left its wagon-loving fans in the lurch, even as other brands have come and gone from the segment to find comfort in the sales reports for their SUVs.

Its latest is the V90, and it’s Volvo’s largest and most luxurious wagon yet. Based on the sleek S90 sedan, the V90 can be filled with all of the premium trim and semi-autonomous gadgetry offered in the sedan. Really, the only difference between the two is their tail ends.

That is, unless you opt for the V90 Cross Country, the jacked-up and ruggedized V90 that will account for the vast majority of the wagon’s sales. Because it’s sort of an SUV. In fact, if you want the regular V90, you have to custom order it. Dealers are stocking their lots with a steady stream of V90 CCs.

They have all-wheel-drive, and you can get them with a 250 hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder or Volvo’s unique and remarkable 2.0-liter supercharged and turbocharged four-cylinder, which delivers 316 hp along with a 30 mpg highway fuel economy rating.

The starting price is $53,295, but expect to see many V90 CCs equipped with pricey options like the $4,500 luxury package with its buttery Nappa leather-upholstered massaging seats, and the $3,200 Bowers and Wilkins audio system, which sounds as ridiculously good as its price sounds ridiculous.

The V90 CC does come standard with Volvo’s Pilot Assist, a feature that uses a radar and a camera to self-steer the car in its lane on the highway without rear-ending the vehicle in front. It’s one of the best systems of its kind, and it works well even if the lines on the road aren’t freshly-painted.

Pilot Assist won’t let you take your hands off the wheel for more than about 15 seconds, but you get the impression that it could. The twistiest roads will eventually trip it up, but I didn’t need to make any inputs along a winding 50-mile stretch of the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey, except to change lanes and exit.

Pilot Assist isn’t meant for off-road, but the V90 CC very much is. With 8.3 inches of ground clearance, it rides about two inches higher off the ground than the street-smart version of the V90, which puts it well into crossover country and endows it with a pretty capable rough-road ride without ruining its comfort and handling on pavement.

VOLVO S90 W/PILOT ASSIST TEST DRIVE:

Tall sidewall all-season tires and a $1,200 self-leveling rear air suspension get the CC over big bumps and through deep divots without much pain. I wouldn’t suggest chasing Jeeps onto the rocks with it, but an off-road mode locks it in four-wheel-drive and engages hill descent control under 25 mph to help manage reasonably challenging terrain.

An available 360-degree camera is useful when navigating tight trails, but you’ll want to turn off all the parking sensors that go with it if you’re among the trees. They make a lot of beeps. (So many beeps.)

This won’t be an issue for most V90 CC owners, who will likely be using them more on snowy streets than fire roads. Either way, its snazzy, Scandinavian interior is so nice, you’ll want to do your best not to track in any mess. Especially if you opt for the white carpet. Do so at your own risk.

Since the V90 CC shuns the classic boxy Volvo wagon design, its trunk isn’t as voluminous as it could be, but the space back there is deep and features a power cargo cover to go along with its power tailgate — because if you can afford one of these cars, you’ve probably gotten soft.

In fact, if you have enough money for a V90 CC, you could buy the larger, even higher-riding three-row XC90 SUV and end up with change to spare. So why wouldn’t you?

Most cross-shoppers will. The XC90 is one of Volvo’s top sellers. But the V90 CC does have a few practical advantages, including a low roof for loading bikes and antiques, better fuel economy and more car-like handling. And above all, it’s a station wagon. Some Volvo customers wouldn’t drive anything else.

These and other security measures have ensured that online elections remain fair and that voters remain anonymous in Estonia.
Participation in online polls shows that we genuinely love voting online.
If governments want to encourage all of their citizens to vote, then it’s time we modernize the voting process.","When was the last time you hailed a cab? Visited your banker? Found a date at a bar? Searched the shelves of a bookstore?

Almost every part of our lives has migrated online in some way. From getting a ride, to banking, to dating, to buying books, there are few activities still conducted entirely offline. That is, unless we’re talking about voting.

Voting in the United States, and almost every other country for that matter, is primarily done offline – in person and at a polling place, or sometimes by sending mail through the U.S. Postal Service. Any wonder that voter turnout in our presidential election last year was only 55 percent – the lowest rate since 1996?

In an era when many things can be done via a smartphone, it’s time we found a way to let us vote from the comfort of our homes, while we commute to work, or while we stand in line for lunch.

The answer may lie in a small Baltic nation with a population smaller than Hawaii.

Estonia has already been utilizing online voting for a decade. In that country’s last election, nearly one-third of Estonian citizens took advantage of this convenience and cast their ballots online.

The obvious question that arises about online voting is whether it is safe from tampering. If our country adopted this system, could some hacker or group of hackers override the wishes of American voters and change the outcome of the election for president and for other offices?

Estonia has taken steps to combat this legitimate concern. In the e-voting process there, voters use their government-issued ID and can cast their ballot as many times as they like, with only the last vote actually getting counted.

Furthermore, the process involves a cross-device verification method, meaning that a hacker or virus would need to access both the voter’s computer and mobile phone. Voters are also able to connect their phones to the electoral servers and verify how their vote was recorded.

These and other security measures have ensured that online elections remain fair and that voters remain anonymous in Estonia.

While you might think that online votes in Estonia come mostly from millennials who represent the youngest voters in the country, data from the e-voting system proved that nearly half of voters are 45 and over.

In our digital age, it’s not just the young, digital-natives who crave convenience – we have all grown accustomed to moving away from static, unengaging experiences that cut into our leisure time. When we want something, we want it to reach us wherever we are, not vice versa.

Plus, it’s not just convenience we crave. Participation in online polls shows that we genuinely love voting online. Storytelling platform Playbuzz, which provides interactive authoring tools like polls to publishers, reports that over 75 percent of outlets’ stories published in June via the platform incorporated a poll. Playbuzz also notes that polls are one of the most popular tools used by editorial teams worldwide.

Simply scroll through ESPN and you’ll find polls on the MLB All Star game, LeBron’s future, the NHL playoffs, and more. The same is true of VH1, Sky News, Time, and dozens of other online outlets.

Granted, interacting online with editorial content is more casual than voting, but this does show us that when a publisher offers us the opportunity to interact and share our opinion, we jump at the chance. Interacting online is the new normal in our society. So why should voting in elections for government officials be any different?

Not to mention, secure online voting means eliminating several problems that accompany in-person voting, such as limited hours at polling places, long lines and missing part of a workday.

Different generations have different habits of engagement. If governments want to encourage all of their citizens to vote, then it’s time we modernize the voting process. If we apply Estonia’s logic and process of online polls to elections worldwide, we could ensure a high voter turnout rate and make democracy more easily accessible.

Forcing all groups to conform to an outdated process simply no longer aligns with society’s daily habits. When governments invest resources in secure, virtual elections, more people will vote and results will better represent the majority of the population.",We can use our smartphones to elect our leaders – here’s how,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/can-use-our-smartphones-to-elect-our-leaders-here-s-how.html

Appel and Fuiava had left Honolulu on May 3 aboard Appel's 50-foot vessel the Sea Nymph for what was supposed to be an 18-day trip to Tahiti.

Storms flooded the engine and damaged the mast and sails so badly, they couldn't generate enough wind power to stay on course. They drifted aimlessly and sent unanswered distress calls for 98 consecutive days.

They'd run out of food for the dogs, and the woman began sharing their own, leaving their food supply 90 percent depleted by the time they were rescued.

The USS Ashland on Wednesday picked up the women, plus the dogs Zeus and Valentine, all four looking remarkably fit for having been lost at sea for nearly six months.

Appel told reporters on Friday that they were beginning to believe they were completely out of luck when they saw the U.S. Navy ship chugging toward them.

The hit HBO series went off the air in 2011 and Hines had just had dinner with show creator and star Larry David the night before the return of the show was announced.



""I saw on my phone that people were texting me saying, 'Yay! ""Curb"" is coming back,'"" the actress recalled to Fox News.

She quickly texted David, ""So, is 'Curb' coming back?'""

Her on-screen ex-husband said yes so Hines followed up, ""Am I in it?""

""[Larry] said, 'Yeah, if you can arrange your schedule around it.' And I said, 'Yeah I think I can.'""

Even though it had been six years since Hines had played the beauty David somehow managed to woo -- and then lose -- on the series based on David's life, the 52-year-old had no trouble slipping back into character.

President Trump is right: We should end the diversity lottery for immigration. It is an absurd system for randomly selecting who should come to the United States. The lottery system should instead be replaced with a merit-based system that actively seeks people who will help grow the American economy.

Instead of continuing liberal, politically correct immigration rules that emphasize what the left calls “diversity,” we need a system that focuses on an individual’s merit, work and achievement. What a person can contribute to America should be more important when making immigration decisions than whether he or she fits some political science mantra of diversity.

However, in light of the terrorist attacks in New York, Orlando, San Bernardino, Boston and elsewhere, closing the lottery loophole isn’t enough. We need to take far more decisive steps in improving and securing our immigration system.

First, we need to identify terrorists as enemy combatants.

Four steps to take when deciding if you should let someone who betrayed you back into your life.

FOX's Ashley Papa has more:

Betrayal by a loved one is one of the most painful experiences. If you're thinking of letting someone who betrayed you back into your life, counselor, David Essel says first you must forgive:

""If you don't do this you're going to mistrust them, you're going to look for problems when maybe there aren't any, the other big problem you run into is that if this relationship doesn't work out and you want to move on and you haven't forgiven them you're going to put the next person you date on the cross.""

Step two is to own your role in the dysfunction of the relationship. The third step is to have the betrayer write you an apology letter:

""So in other words if someone says i'm so sorry for cheating on you, i'm so sorry i stole money from you that's not enough. I went them to write down the specific things they did who they did them with and why. See, that means they're sincere about coming back in and earning back your trust.""

Fourth, Essel says if they stole something they must pay you back. If they don't do step three or four- let them go.

Chronic Lyme diseaseThis term is sometimes used to describe patients who have lingering symptoms of actual Lyme disease, something that occurs in up to 20 percent of Lyme cases.
Chronic Lyme disease is not an accepted medical diagnosis, and there’s no evidence that treating it—usually with long courses of IV antibiotics— helps alleviate symptoms.
Multiple chemical sensitivityLots of chemicals have been proven to be harmful to your health, like tobacco smoke and asbestos.","Imagine having recurrent physical symptoms that cause you discomfort, pain, and distress—then being told by the medical establishment that what you see and feel do not add up to a legitimate disease or syndrome.

That's the experience of countless people convinced they are suffering from a real illness—such as singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, who believes she has Morgellons disease, a questionable condition that makes people feel “fibers” or other objects poking out of their skin. With the recent release of the new book, Reckless Daughter: A Portrait of Joni Mitchell, her mysterious illness is once again in the spotlight.

You don’t have to look hard to find other accounts of Morgellons or similar illnesses that often get the side eye from doctors. But you do have to look hard for any medical or scientific evidence that these and other conditions truly exist. As a result, many sufferers are left with few options for treatment of real symptoms that can’t be explained. Here are 7 of these baffling conditions, and the cases for and against them.

Morgellons disease

The symptoms Mitchell described to the LA Times in 2010 sound agonizing: “Fibers in a variety of colors protrude out of my skin like mushrooms after a rainstorm: They cannot be forensically identified as animal, vegetable, or mineral. Morgellons is a slow, unpredictable killer—a terrorist disease: It will blow up one of your organs, leaving you in bed for a year.”

But when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tried to determine what causes such symptoms in the approximately four out of every 100,000 people who experience them, researchers were stumped. “No common underlying medical condition or infectious source was identified, similar to more commonly recognized conditions such as delusional infestation,"" study authors concluded in 2012.

CAN HOLDING IN A SNEEZE KILL YOU?

Indeed, Morgellons is often chocked up to delusions: Perhaps sufferers are actually dealing with a mental illness that conjures up feelings of being infected by parasites, called delusional parasitosis, which might account for the creepy-crawly sensations that people say they experience with Morgellons.

Chronic Lyme disease

This term is sometimes used to describe patients who have lingering symptoms of actual Lyme disease, something that occurs in up to 20 percent of Lyme cases. However, some doctors diagnose patients with something dubbed chronic Lyme disease when they were never infected with this tick-borne illness in the first place, yet they have unexplained Lyme–like symptoms including joint pain, fatigue, and muscle aches.

Chronic Lyme disease is not an accepted medical diagnosis, and there’s no evidence that treating it—usually with long courses of IV antibiotics— helps alleviate symptoms. The doctors who offer such treatments ""don’t typically follow the most commonly recommended treatments and the evidence-based guidelines,” Christina Nelson, MD, medical epidemiologist for the CDC told Health previously. “Most general practitioners and infectious disease physicians would not provide this type of care.”

Adrenal fatigue

Exhaustion, body aches, trouble sleeping, and undereye bags have lately been attributed to adrenal fatigue, but there’s no evidence that’s a thing. First described in 1998, the illness supposedly is based around the idea that the adrenal glands—which produce hormones that control metabolism and fight stress and are situated near the kidneys—stop working properly when the body is overtaxed by stress or illness.

Still, there’s no actual proof that taxing the body wears out the adrenal glands, and blaming symptoms on adrenal fatigue could delay treatment for what’s really wrong. ""Symptoms of fatigue, body aches, trouble sleeping, indigestion, and nervousness are nonspecific and could be due to a variety of other diseases, including sleep disorders, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and thyroid disease,"" Marilyn Tan, MD, an endocrinologist with Stanford Health Care and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Stanford School of Medicine told Health previously. ""To attribute all symptoms to a single diagnosis of 'adrenal fatigue' risks missing the detection of other treatable underlying diseases.""

Electromagnetic hypersensitivity

Sometimes jokingly referred to by skeptics as ""Wi-Fi allergies,"" EHS is supposedly triggered after a person is exposed to electromagnetic radiation, which comes from computers, cell phones, and other electronics. It's associated with fatigue, nausea, and heart palpitations. While the symptoms themselves are legit, there’s little evidence they’re actually caused by, say, sleeping in the same room as a Wi-Fi router. “Some research suggests that the physical complaints may be caused by fear and anxiety about having this condition—not the actual radiation,” Health’s medical editor Roshini Raj, MD, wrote previously.

Wind turbine syndrome

People thought to have wind turbine syndrome experience a range of general symptoms, like dizziness, nausea, trouble sleeping or breathing, and headaches. The one common denominator, sufferers insist, is that these health issues started when they began living near wind turbines—the large windmill-like contraptions that convert wind into energy and emit low-frequency sound waves.

FDA WARNS ON 'POT CURES CANCER' CLAIMS

First identified by pediatrician Nina Pierpont, WTS has gained the support of a handful of doctors who contribute opinions and anecdotal accounts of the syndrome to Dr. Pierpont’s website. So far, however, lab studies of those low-frequency noises, called infrasound, have been inconclusive. Dr. Pierpont has conducted just one study on the topic, which was small, done over the phone, and did not undergo peer review, Popular Science reported in October 2013.

Multiple chemical sensitivity

Lots of chemicals have been proven to be harmful to your health, like tobacco smoke and asbestos. And recent research suggests that exposure to certain everyday chemicals can increase your cancer risk later in life. But people who believe they have MCS say low levels of chemicals found in detergent, soap, ink, and other products has triggered chronic fatigue, memory problems, headaches, and rashes, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Often, these symptoms occur after a more severe but short-term chemical exposure, like a chemical spill.

“Multiple chemical sensitivity is under debate in the medical community at this time,” according to Johns Hopkins. “Some healthcare providers question whether it exists. Others acknowledge it as a medical disorder triggered by exposures to chemicals in the environment.”

Wilson’s syndrome

Also called Wilson’s temperature syndrome, this condition is supposedly a mild form of hypothyroidism, triggering a variety of symptoms attributed to thyroid dysfunction, such as a low body temperature. But when people who believe they have Wilson's undergo thyroid testing, their thyroid hormone levels are normal.

A doctor named E. Denis Wilson named this syndrome after himself and says it can be treated with a special thyroid hormone preparation. But the American Thyroid Association is not convinced. “The American Thyroid Association has found no scientific evidence supporting the existence of 'Wilson’s syndrome,'"" according to a statement. “The theory proposed to explain this condition is at odds with established facts about thyroid hormone.""

This means families who earn the median household income ($59,000 a year) will only pay taxes on $35,000 of their income, which translates into a $1,182 tax cut for these families.
The tax cut bill increases the current Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600 and provides a $300 credit for elderly parents and adult-dependents.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also drastically simplifies our tax system, which will enable Americans to save even more money.
The bill gets rid of many deductions and loopholes that shift much of the tax burden onto the American middle class.","The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that Republicans introduced Thursday represents a tremendous opportunity for the Congress and the President to take the U.S. economy to a new level of prosperity and improve the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans.

As I wrote earlier this week, the Trump effect has already brought gross domestic product (GDP) growth up to 3 percent for two straight quarters – which so-called experts insisted for months was nearly impossible.

At the same time, Pew Research Center reported on Tuesday that 82 percent of Americans now say they have either achieved their definition of the American Dream or are on their way to achieving it. The Washington Examiner points out that this is a stark contrast to 2014, when a similar CNN project found that 60 percent of Americans thought the American Dream was unattainable.

The tax relief and job creating provisions included in the Republican plan will continue to grow the GDP and help even more Americans realize their dreams.

If passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump, Americans will get to keep more of their hard-earned money. The Republican bill roughly doubles the standard deduction, increasing it from $12,000 to $24,000 for families and from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals. This means families who earn the median household income ($59,000 a year) will only pay taxes on $35,000 of their income, which translates into a $1,182 tax cut for these families.

Further, the bill includes a Family Credit, which expands tax credits for families with children, as well as those caring for older relatives. The tax cut bill increases the current Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600 and provides a $300 credit for elderly parents and adult-dependents. Keep in mind, these are not deductions, these are dollar-for-dollar tax credits.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also drastically simplifies our tax system, which will enable Americans to save even more money. The bill gets rid of many deductions and loopholes that shift much of the tax burden onto the American middle class. This streamlining will allow most Americans to file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard, and the savings families will experience from this simplification will be like an additional income tax relief.

Many Americans will also see their wages and job opportunities increase due to the enormous reductions in business taxes included in the bill.

The bill sets a 25 percent maximum tax rate for small businesses and other pass-through corporations. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, these businesses represent 99.7 percent of U.S. employers – and employ nearly half of the private sector workforce. Giving these small business owners the ability to keep more of the money their businesses earn will result in an explosion of investment and job creation. This will then lead to wage increases, as companies will once again have to compete for job candidates.

Additionally, the tax rate for corporations will be reduced from 35 percent down to 20 percent. This cut – the largest corporate tax cut in our nation’s history – will make America competitive with the rest of the developed world, making our country more attractive to large manufacturers and other multinational businesses. This is perfectly in line with President Trump’s America first principle on which he campaigned last year and will lead to more products around the world being labeled “Made in America.”

Finally, the GOP bill also reforms our outdated multinational tax system so that businesses will once again be encouraged to bring foreign earnings back to the United States, instead of investing them and creating jobs overseas.

The passage of this bill will be a defining moment for our country. It will cut through all the noise of Washington and show Americans they were right to elect Republicans to lead in the White House and Congress.

Over the next few weeks, the Democrats and the left-wing media will undoubtedly try to oppose this bill. They will come up with all sorts of reasons why they don’t support the bill, but what they are truly arguing against is lower taxes, more jobs, higher wages, and a simpler, fairer system. The American people will see that once again, the Left is trying to stand in the way of our country’s working class, who are finally starting to see their American dreams become a reality.

A new report says hackers tried for an all out blitz against the Democratic party during the lead up to the 2016 presidential election.

FOX's Jill Nado reports:

Associated Press is saying hackers tried to compromise Hillary Clinton's inner circle as well as 130 Democratic party employees, supporters and contractors.

It started with a one phishing email and soon, cyberattackers were able to get around security measures and penetrate the personal Gmail account of campaign chair John Podesta. They also got to the email of campaign manager Robby Mook and many others.

U.S. intelligence agencies have tied the cyberattacks to a group of hackers known as Fancy Bear, which is linked to the Kremlin.

The FDA issued warning letters to four companies that sell products containing cannabidiol (CBD) and claim the ingredient can treat or cure cancer, according to an FDA statement released Nov. 1.
Here are some of the claims made by the companies: The product ""combats tumor and cancer cells.""
""CBD makes cancer cells commit 'suicide' without killing other cells.""
And ""Non-psychoactive cannabinoids like CBD (cannabidiol) may be effective in treating tumors from cancer — including breast cancer.""","Medical marijuana may help with several health conditions, but it's certainly not a cure for cancer. Now, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is cracking down on companies that claim their cannabis products can get rid of cancer.

The FDA issued warning letters to four companies that sell products containing cannabidiol (CBD) and claim the ingredient can treat or cure cancer, according to an FDA statement released Nov. 1. CBD is a compound found in marijuana, but unlike another compound in the plant called tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD doesn't cause psychoactive effects.

CBD is sold in products such as oil drops, teas, capsules, syrups and lotions, the FDA says.

The four companies — Green Roads Health, Natural Alchemist, That's Natural! Marketing & Consulting, and Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises LLC — sold, in total, more than 25 different types of products with unsubstantiated medical claims, according to the FDA.

Here are some of the claims made by the companies: The product ""combats tumor and cancer cells."" ""CBD makes cancer cells commit 'suicide' without killing other cells."" ""CBD … [has] anti-proliferative properties that can inhibit cell division and growth in certain types of cancer, not allowing the tumor to grow."" And ""Non-psychoactive cannabinoids like CBD (cannabidiol) may be effective in treating tumors from cancer — including breast cancer.""

The FDA said in the statement that these products have not been proven to be safe or effective and that making unsubstantiated claims is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

""Substances that contain components of marijuana will be treated like any other products that make unproven claims to shrink cancer tumors,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in the statement. The FDA doesn't allow companies to market products ""with baseless claims,"" Gottlieb said.

""There are a growing number of effective therapies for many cancers,"" he added. ""When people are allowed to illegally market products that deliver no established benefit, they may steer patients away from products that have proven anti-tumor effects that could extend lives.""

The document, which appears on the CIA's website, highlights a former SS soldier who told spies he had regularly met with Hilter in Colombia. ""CITROEN [a CIA source] claimed to have contacted HITLER about once a month in Colombia on his trip from Maracaibo to that country as/an employee of the KNSM (Royal Dutch) Shipping Co. in Maracaibo,"" the document reads.

The document, three pages in length, suggests that Hitler may have worked as a shipping company employee, prior to potentially fleeing to Argentina. On the second page is a picture of the informant, Phillip Citroen, with a person he claims is Hitler in the mid-1950s.

“CIMELODY-3’s friend states that during the later part of September 1955, a Phillip Citroen, former German SS trooper, stated to him confidentially that Adolph Hitler (sic) is still alive,"" the documents state.

Hitler committed suicide by taking a cyanide capsule and shooting himself. His wife Eva Braun killed herself by swallowing a cyanide pill. His body was later discovered by Soviet soldiers and buried in an unmarked spot. A German court declared Hitler dead, but not until 1956, more than a decade after the war ended.

Despite the findings of the German court, rumors have abounded for years that Hitler survived and fled to South America. The discovery of Holocaust planner Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele — the doctor who carried out sick experiments on Auschwitz inmates — in Argentina and Brazil respectively has only added fuel to the rumors, according to a report in news.com.au, which is part of 21st Century Fox.

Eichmann was eventually captured and hanged by Israel for his crimes in 1961, but Mengele managed to avoid capture. He ultimately died, having drowned while swimming off the coast of Brazil in 1979.

""It was always mentioned, and it was always suspected,"" said his niece, Heather Coggins, who still lives not far from where he was killed.

Now, more than three decades later, authorities say, it's been confirmed.

A Georgia district attorney says Timothy Coggins was killed for ""socializing with a white female."" Prosecutor Ben Coker told a judge Wednesday that Coggins was dragged behind a truck through the woods, news outlets reported. Arrest warrants say he was stabbed and sliced to death and suffered ""severely disfiguring"" wounds.

A break in the cold case came in mid-October, when local and state law enforcement officials announced the arrests of five longtime local residents on charges stemming from the slaying. All five are white; two worked in law enforcement.

Spalding County Sheriff Darrell Dix was emphatic about the motive during an Oct. 13 news conference in Griffin, about 40 miles south of Atlanta.

""Based on the original evidence recovered in 1983 and new evidence and interviews, there is no doubt in the minds of all investigators involved that the crime was racially motivated, and that if the crime happened today it would be prosecuted as a hate crime,"" he said.

Two men are charged with murder: Frankie Gebhardt, 59, and Bill Moore Sr., 58. Arrest warrants accuse them of stabbing and slicing Coggins to death and giving him ""seriously disfiguring"" wounds.

Moore and Gebhardt were just a year or two older than the victim, and Heather Coggins says she believes her uncle was acquainted with them. But she said the rest of the family didn't know them.

""This is the first time we've heard their names and seen their faces,"" she said in a recent interview.

Three other suspects — Sandra Bunn, 58; her son Lamar Bunn; and 47-year-old Gregory Huffman — are charged with obstructing the investigation. Sandra Bunn worked as a Spalding County detention officer until her arrest, when the sheriff fired her. Huffman was also a detention officer and later a police officer in nearby Milner. He's charged with revealing the identity of a confidential informant who was being used against Gebhardt.

Officials haven't detailed the connections between the suspects, but court records show Sandra Bunn sued Gebhardt in 2003 to have him evicted from a property she owned. Gebhardt has been convicted in the past of aggravated assault and criminal damage, both felonies, along with multiple misdemeanors, records show.

Coker said he will seek indictments in December but hasn't decided whether to seek the death penalty against Gebhardt and Moore.

Heather Coggins was just 6 when her uncle was killed, but she still tears up at how his slaying wracked her large extended family, longtime residents of the community, with ""uncertainty, heartbreak, fear.""

She remembers her uncle as ""just a fun person. If anything, I remember just the joy, the playfulness of him."" He didn't finish high school and had no regular job but worked for his stepfather, a plumber and carpenter in Griffin.

He loved the R&B music of Frankie Beverly and loved to dance.

But his life ended in horrific violence.

A 1983 article in the Griffin Daily News said his body was found by hunters in a field not far from a highway in the Sunny Side community a few miles north of Griffin. He wasn't immediately identified.

""He had been worked over with a knife pretty well,"" an investigator told the newspaper — stab wounds in the back, punctured lungs and defensive wounds on his arm.

Heather Coggins said that when investigators passed around the unknown victim's photo to the local community, Timothy Coggins' own mother didn't recognize her dead son, but Heather's mother, the victim's oldest sister, said: ""No, that's Tim.""

His mother was burdened by his slaying until she died in February 2016. She called out his name on her death bed, Heather Coggins said.

""I really don't think my grandmother ever recovered from losing her son ... not because of his death, but because of the uncertainty of who did it,"" she said. ""She felt like justice wasn't done.""

In July, authorities announced that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had new information.

Seeking to bolster that new lead, the sheriff issued a July 24 news release, imploring witnesses to step up.

""We understand that over the years those suspected of being involved in the murder of Timothy Coggins have threatened and intimidated potential witnesses,"" he said. ""We believe that there are people with pertinent information regarding this case that are still out there and we are asking them to come forward.""

As witnesses did so, he said, they told investigators ""they had been living with this information since Coggins' death but had been afraid to come forward or had not spoken of it until now.""

Heather Coggins said the family won't rest easy until those responsible for killing him are convicted. But she said they are deeply grateful to the sheriff, the GBI and other officials who didn't give up on solving her uncle's killing.

""We're totally thankful that someone has been arrested,"" she said. ""We're grateful because that didn't happen for 34 years.""

Amidst all of this, President Trump should be prepared for new North Korean missile tests during his time in the region.","When President Trump visits Beijing on his Asian trip now in progress, China is expected to roll out the red carpet. But Chinese leaders are spooked. President Trump is the first American president to sanction a Chinese bank for helping North Korea evade U.S. and United Nations economic sanctions.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will no doubt flatter his American guest, hoping that President Trump prefers the image of a successful summit to a confrontation over sanctions. But President Trump should not fall for it.

With North Korea on the brink of being able to strike the U.S. with a nuclear missile, President Trump must increase pressure on Pyongyang and its enablers, especially Beijing.

China has responded well to U.S. pressure so far. For example, it issued a banking directive prohibiting financial transactions with North Koreans and another directive prohibiting North Korean businesses in China and joint ventures. But this is not enough.

China accounts for an estimated 90 percent of North Korean trade, giving it significant economic leverage. And according to the U.N., China imported $182 million of North Korean coal in August and September this year, despite its February pledge to stop the practice.

If Beijing cannot implement its own coal restriction, we should not trust that it will act against its own citizens who help North Korea evade economic sanctions. President Trump should tell Xi as much.

While the two leaders should project a cordial relationship in public, President Trump should warn Xi in private that Washington will move forward with robust sanctions targeting Chinese companies and banks that facilitate North Korea’s evasion of sanctions.

Chinese entities that strengthen North Korea’s economy by getting around sanctions undermine the American policy of financially isolating North Korea. That isolation is key to gaining leverage as a means to prevent a military conflict.

Xi knows what’s coming. The Trump administration has already sanctioned Chinese and Russian facilitators of North Korea’s sanctions evasion, and in September sanctioned 26 overseas representatives of North Korean banks.

These actions are a clear warning shot to Beijing that Washington is widely expected to target additional Chinese nationals and banks that play a key role in these illegal schemes.

The Trump administration should take a page from the Iran sanctions playbook and issue fines against Chinese banks for failing to identify North Korean transactions – similar to the $12 billion in fines issued from 2012 to 2015 against European banks for Iran sanctions violations.

President Trump is also visiting Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe solidified his supermajority in recent elections.

Abe declared North Korea as one of Japan’s two national crises. And in a sign that Washington fully backs Abe’s North Korea policy, President Trump will meet with families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. At minimum, the visit will shine a spotlight on Pyongyang’s abhorrent human rights record.

President Trump’s itinerary also includes South Korea. His relationship with President Moon Jae-In has not always been an easy one, because of differences in whether to confront or engage the North Korean regime of dictator Kim Jong Un. However, North Korea’s provocations have drawn the U.S. and South Korea closer.

U.S. military assistance has also strengthened ties with South Korea. Seoul has deployed a U.S.-supplied Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense system to defend against North Korea’s missile program. The North Korean human rights issue offers another area of commonality with Moon, who was a human rights lawyer.

If President Trump plays his cards right, he will discourage South Korea from drawing closer to Beijing. China already agreed to suspend its sanctions against South Korea in exchange for a commitment that Seoul will not deploy additional THAAD launchers, participate in a U.S. regional missile defense, or enter into a trilateral defense alliance with Japan. The China-South Korea détente could erode American leverage with Beijing.

More broadly, President Trump must seize the opportunity on this trip to build a multilateral coalition outside the U.N. of likeminded countries (South Korea, Japan, Australia, Britain, France and Germany) that commits to increasing pressure on North Korea.

This group of nations should focus on identifying additional networks ripe for coordinated sanctions actions. It should also target North Korean shipping by declaring that all vessels linked to North Korea can be inspected under U.N. and international law.

Amidst all of this, President Trump should be prepared for new North Korean missile tests during his time in the region. Kim Jong Un wants to remain in the spotlight.

But no matter what Pyongyang launches, Trump’s message must be consistent: denuclearization is America’s vision for the Korean Peninsula. The United States must not accept anything less, given North Korea’s egregious history of nuclear, chemical and missile proliferation.",Trump should confront China on North Korean nukes during his Asia trip,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/trump-should-confront-china-on-north-korean-nukes-during-his-asia-trip.html

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

So why do people with disabilities run with guides?
The Achilles athletes in wheelchairs or handcarts don’t need guides; they would be too fast for guides, anyway.
What’s it like to guide a disabled person for Achilles International in the New York City Marathon?
It’s not hard to understand why hundreds of able-bodied athletes will run this Sunday as guides for Achilles.","The Babylonian Talmud teaches: “Because you have greeted one who cannot see, you merit to be greeted by the One who cannot be seen.” Inspiring words that would be reason enough for me to serve as a guide runner for a blind athlete in Sunday’s New York City Marathon. But there are other reasons as well.

Sunday will be the sixth time in the last eight years that I’ve run the marathon in New York as a guide runner for runners with disabilities, always under the auspices of Achilles International. The mission of the organization is “to enable people with all types of disabilities to participate in mainstream running events in order to promote personal achievement.”

Achilles is the brainchild of Dick Traum, a wheelchair-bound athlete who competed in New York back when the marathon was a series of loops around Central Park. He wondered: What if there were facilities and a training program to aid athletes with disabilities from around the globe in their quest to run marathons?

Well, now all that exists.

Sunday morning, hundreds of athletes with every conceivable disability, from Manhattan to Mongolia, along with their able-bodied guides, will gather at the Achilles tent in the shadow of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.

The athletes include veterans who have lost limbs in battle, individuals born with disabilities, and others who have overcome the unimaginable to make it to the starting line in New York.

The athletes I guided in past years were: a deaf man from California; a South African survivor of a car accident that left him with a stroke and brain damage; a woman from New Jersey with scoliosis (a condition that causes curvature of the spine); a woman from North Carolina with severe GI tract issues; and a French cancer survivor in his early 70s.

The woman with scoliosis had the best line. “My doctor said I could only run two miles a day,” she told me. “I decided I’d do two weeks worth of running today.”

My wildest moment (so far): In 2010, the night before the race, I went into a drugstore and ran into the Chilean miner who had trained for New York by running laps while trapped underground for 69 days. I’d seen him the night before on Letterman.

Turned out he knew little about the “lore” of marathoning – Vaseline to avoid chafing; carrying snacks on the course; and insoles because his running shoes didn’t quite fit.

So we talked, through his interpreter, and shopped for half an hour.

We came out of the store and a crowd had gathered – he was something of a celebrity back then. He pointed back to me, as everybody was trying to get selfies and autographs, and shouted, “I love you, boy!”

My hardest experience as a guide came with my French runner. My fellow guide and I literally linked arms with him and walked him the length of the course. This was in 2014, when crosswinds on the Verrazano and on Manhattan side streets reached over 50 mph. I’ve never been so cold, but our guy made it.

So why do people with disabilities run with guides? New Yorkers (and their guests) are an aggressive lot, and it never hurts to have someone to keep you from getting jostled on the course. Also, in case of injury or inability to finish, the guide provides company and reassurance until help arrives.

The Achilles athletes in wheelchairs or handcarts don’t need guides; they would be too fast for guides, anyway.

Last year, a father pushed his son in a wheelchair the length of the race. Now that’s athleticism.

What’s it like to guide a disabled person for Achilles International in the New York City Marathon?

The closest comparison I can offer is the scenes in the film “A Hard Day’s Night,” where the London cops escorted the Beatles as they rushed past their fans from limo to hotel.

New Yorkers recognize the yellow Achilles T-shirts, and they go bonkers for the runners with disabilities.

The spectators may not know exactly what disability a given runner possesses, but they certainly understand – and applaud – the intense courage it takes for a person with disabilities to go 26.2 miles.

This year my blind runner comes from New Zealand, and a scrum of guides will surround him. One in front to clear the path, two on either side, and one in back. Projected finish time: 7 hours, 30 minutes.

But what’s the rush?

It’s not hard to understand why hundreds of able-bodied athletes will run this Sunday as guides for Achilles. Where else can you get the runner’s high and the helper’s high – all at the same time – and then get a medal as a reward for your efforts?

Where else can you help make someone’s impossible dream come true, with 2 million people cheering you on?

As Achilles International says on its website: “While our programs focus on running, the truth is, running is simply the tool for accomplishing our main objective: to bring hope, inspiration, and the joys of achievement to all.”

About 1,900 years ago, the Stoic philosopher Epictetus wrote, “God divided man into men that they might help one another.”

Whether you prefer Epictetus or the Talmud, it sure seems like running as a guide for a runner with a disability is the right thing to do.",Why I am running the New York City Marathon as a guide for a disabled runner,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/04/why-am-running-new-york-city-marathon-as-guide-for-disabled-runner.html

WHO SENT THE PHISHING EMAILS?","Nineteen thousand lines of raw data associated with the theft of emails from Hillary Clinton campaign staffers show how the hackers managed the election-shaking operation.

Minute-by-minute logs gathered by the cybersecurity company Secureworks and recently shared with The Associated Press suggest it took the hackers just over a week of work to zero in on and penetrate the personal Gmail account of campaign chairman John Podesta.

One outside expert who reviewed the data said it showed how even the well-defended Clinton campaign fell prey to phishing, a basic cyberespionage technique that uses bogus emails to harvest passwords.

""They were the most security-aware campaign that I'm aware of,"" said Markus Jakobsson, the chief scientist at email security company Agari. ""And yet this happened.""

Hillaryclinton.com emails were locked down using two-factor authentication, a technique that uses a second passcode to keep accounts secure. Other measures included the automatic deletion of most messages after 30 days and phishing drills for staff. Security awareness even followed the campaigners into the bathroom, where someone put a picture of a toothbrush under the words: ""You shouldn't share your passwords either.""

But hackers who began their break-in attempts on March 10, 2016, with random emails to obsolete hillaryclinton.com addresses quickly learned their way around the campaign's address book, first targeting senior staffers at work before switching to their Gmail inboxes, some of which had not been protected with two-factor authentication.

On March 19 the hackers appear to have broken into Podesta's personal inbox, setting the stage for weeks of embarrassing disclosures.

Overall, the AP documented well over 400 attempts to break into Clinton staffers and Democratic operatives between March and May of 2016 — an illustration of what Jakobsson said was a key principal behind most phishing attempts.

""If you try enough, sooner or later you'll be lucky,"" he said.

WHO SENT THE PHISHING EMAILS?

The AP's reporting has shown how the hackers who hit Podesta acted globally in close alignment with the Russian government's interests — backing assessments made by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian spies were responsible. Here's a review of the evidence:

The hackers worked business hours, Moscow time

They created nearly all their links from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Moscow time, according to AP's analysis of the data. They were busiest in the midday hours and took weekends off.

Russian rivals and global trouble spots dominate the targeted countries

At least 573 individuals or groups were targeted in the United States, which has been a focus of Russian spying since the Soviet era. Ukraine, where Russia is backing separatist rebels against the government in Kiev, came in second with 545 targets.

Other countries that were the focus of the operation were former Soviet state Georgia; Syria, where Russia has been backing the government in a bloody civil war; and Russia itself, where many government opponents were targeted. The AP has identified people in 116 countries whose accounts were targeted.

Weeks after the hack, a Trump adviser was told that emails were in Russian hands

In recently unsealed court documents, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser said he was told by a professor closely connected to the Russian government that the Kremlin had obtained thousands of emails with ""dirt"" about Clinton.

Experts who've examined the list say it's Russia

""It doesn't seem plausible that there is another country that would look to target the exact same set of people,"" said Secureworks senior security researcher Rafe Pilling.",Russia's hackers took only a week to pry into Clinton camp,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/03/russias-hackers-took-only-week-to-pry-into-clinton-camp.html

In the first week of December the case of the Christian baker Jack Phillips, who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, will be argued before the United States Supreme Court. It will be one of the most highly anticipated religious liberty cases to come before the high court. But, it also reflects one of the most highly debated issues within Christian churches: ""What does the Bible have to say about homosexuality? Is it condemned as a sin? Is it part of the human condition that was never properly understood? Or, is the Bible just not up to date?

I asked two pastors who hold different views on the issue to join me in studio in New York City to talk about this. Stan Mitchell, senior pastor of Gracepointe Church in Nashville, TN... and Shane Idleman, lead pastor of Westside Christian Fellowship in Lancaster, California. Pastor Idleman has received death threats over his traditional preaching on marriage. While Pastor Mitchell has seen his congregation dwindle in size once he began performing same sex marriages. Each is firm in their beliefs of what constitutes the Truth.

Researchers made the discovery after determining the sex of 95 woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) whose remains were found across different parts of Siberia. In all, 66 of the specimens (69 percent) were male, while just 29 (31 percent) were female, they found.

The woolly mammoth lifestyle may be the cause of this skewed sex ratio. Inexperienced male mammoths were more likely to travel alone, away from the herd, so perhaps it's no surprise that these males were more likely to stumble into danger and die as a result, the researchers said. [Image Gallery: Stunning Mammoth Unearthed]

But there is an upside to these pachyderms' untimely deaths: Being buried in a natural trap — such as a bog, crevice or lake — tended to preserve their remains for thousands of years, allowing researchers to discover and study them.

""Most bones, tusks and teeth from mammoths and other ice age animals haven't survived,"" study researcher Love Dalén, a professor of evolutionary genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, said in a statement. ""It is highly likely that the remains that are found in Siberia these days have been preserved because they have been buried, and thus protected from weathering.""

The discovery is part of a larger, long-term project researchers are undertaking to study the genomes of woolly mammoth populations. Some of the analyses required knowing the sex of the mammoths, and the results were unexpected, the researchers said.

""We were very surprised because there was no reason to expect a sex bias in the fossil record,"" lead study researcher Patrícia Pečnerová, a doctoral student of bioinformatics and genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, said in the statement. ""Since the ratio of females to males was likely balanced at birth, we had to consider explanations that involved better preservation of male remains.""

The findings suggest that, like modern elephants, woolly mammoths had matriarchal hierarchies. As such, mammoth herds of young and female mammoths were likely led by an experienced adult female, the researchers said. Male mammoths, also like modern elephants, likely lived in bachelor groups or spent time alone, engaging in risky behavior, they said.

""Without the benefit of living in a herd led by an experienced female, male mammoths may have had a higher risk of dying in natural traps,"" Dalén said.

This discovery — that seven of every 10 mammoths found in natural traps were male — sheds light on the socioecology and behavior of these extinct animals, the researchers said. It's also a reminder that uncovered specimens don't necessarily represent a random sample of a species, they noted.

The study was published online today (Nov. 2) in the journal Current Biology.

Fans on social media criticized the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star after he joked about picking up women at concentration camps in his opening monologue during Saturday night’s episode. Many people said the jokes were insensitive.

""I've always been obsessed with women, and I've often wondered if I'd grown up in Poland when Hitler came to power and was sent to a concentration camp, would I be checking women out in the camp? I think I would,"" David said in his monologue.

""However, there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp,” he added.

He added, ""I consistently strive to be a good Jewish representative. When people see me I want them to say, 'Oh, there goes a fine Jew for you!'""

The show also talked about Weinstein in its opening skit, where Alec Baldwin, portraying President Trump, said the producer was “an idiot.”

“What an idiot that Harvey Weinstein is,” Baldwin told Alex Moffat, who was playing Paul Manafort. “He could have gotten away with it all if only he had gotten himself elected president.”

A dram from the unopened bottle of “Macallan 1878” sold for the four-figure sum at a Swiss hotel in July – making it the priciest glass of single malt ever flogged.

But whiskey experts smelled a rat after news of the sale broke and Sandro Bernasconi, of The Waldhaus Hotel in St Moritz, called in investigators to examine the $300,000 bottle.

THIS BAR WAS JUST VOTED THE BEST IN THE WORLD

The high-end grog was sent off to be tested by boffins at Oxford University – with shocking results. Carbon dating showed the booze to be a near-worthless blended Scotch dated no earlier than 1970 – a hundred years younger than it was claimed.

The label was also riddled with mistakes, while the cork looked too new and the bottle was made of modern glass.

The unsuspecting victim of the scam was Chinese tourist Zhang Wei, 36, who has now had his cash refunded. Bernasconi flew to China to apologize and personally pay back the money.

The hotelier said: “When it comes to selling our customers some of the world’s rarest and oldest whiskeys, we felt it was our duty to ensure that our stock is 100 percent authentic and the real deal.”

PATRÓN RELEASES $7,500 BOTTLE OF TEQUILA

“That’s why we called in the investigators RW101. The result has been a big shock to the system and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill.”

The bottle was bought around 25 years ago by Bernasconi’s father when he was the manager of the hotel. It’s not yet known where the hotel got the bottle from or who was responsible for the fraud.

The eye-watering price paid for the seemingly rare vintage caused a stir among experts who questioned its authenticity. The label on the dark-colored glass bottle said the whiskey was distilled in 1878 and matured for 27 years.

It claimed to be “guaranteed absolutely pure by Roderick Kemp, proprietor, Macallan and Talisker Distilleries Ltd.”

MOVIE-GOER ATTEMPTS TO OPEN BEER WITH PEPPER SPRAY, LEAVES THEATER IN TEARS

But experts said the glass used for the bottle was similar to ones made in 2002 and “Kemp” apparently didn’t own Macallan and Talisker at the same time.And there was no trace of a company called “Macallan and Talisker Distilleries Ltd” in the whiskey industry records.

Bernasconi called in Fife-based Rare Whisky 101 (RW101,) one of the world’s leading authorities on rare whiskey.

Results from Oxford Uni’s Research Laboratory for Archaeology and The History of Art suggested a 95 percent probability the liquid was made between 1970 and 1972.

Other lab tests by Tatlock and Thomson showed the spirit was most likely a blended Scotch made of 60 percent malt and 40 percent grain.

Ken Grier from Macallan brand owner, Edrington, said: “We take this very seriously.”

“We praise the work that our partners, RW101, are doing to bring awareness of any fraud to light. We would urge consumers to buy from reputable sources at all times.”

RW101 co-founder David Robertson said it was hard to know how widespread fake whiskeys were.

He said: “We’ve noticed an increasing number of old, rare archive or antique bottles coming to market at auction and it’s difficult to know how prevalent this problem is.”

“We would implore that others in the market do what they can to identify any rogue bottles.”

“The more intelligence we can provide, the greater the chance we have to defeat the fakers and fraudsters who seek to dupe the unsuspecting rare whiskey consumer.”

He urged buyers to do their research before buying a bottle and insist on testing with older, pricier whiskeys.

Gardeners know that a landscape is much more than plants. The lushest foliage and flowers have limited appeal without other elements to act as a foil. Rocks and stones play a vital role, setting unpolished grainy textures against delicate plants, playing earthy tones against vivid floral displays, and adding weight, mass and a sense of solidity to a dynamic green scene. Enlist these heavy hitters to take your garden to the next level of loveliness.

Steady as a rock. The presence of rocks in a garden is calming and restful. Surrounded by seasonal changes of plants and weather, rocks stand firm. For some, this steadfastness promotes a meditative environment and a strong connection with nature on a spiritual level.

Creating a rock garden as a place for reflection is possible in even the smallest garden, using existing materials and virtually no water. Sitting in a quiet corner contemplating plants growing in harmony with rocks is a respite from the busy outside world.

Stones for sustainability. Rocks, stones and gravel cut down on areas used for lawns and water-hungry plants, substantially reducing water usage. “With our limited water resources and changing climate, sustainability is an underlying philosophy for most landscape designers,” says Janine Mendel, a landscape designer at Cultivart Landscape Design.

Local heroes. Mendel points out that many washed river stones for sale are from countries like Indonesia, and this contributes to erosion there. Buying exotic stone is really the reverse of sustainability, she says. Going local makes even more sense when you factor in the financial and environmental cost of transporting heavy materials long distances.

Aesthetically, local stones and rocks add a cohesive look, especially if there are already naturally occurring rock elements in your garden.

Supporting players. Rocks and stones enhance feature plants as an attractive edging for garden beds. If existing soil is poor, they form a raised bed that can be filled with a more fertile medium.

When planting around rocks, consider color, shape and size. Dark green backgrounds make light rocks stand out, while pale planting makes an ideal foil for dark rocks. Don’t forget that rocks absorb heat — ideal for warmth-loving plants. Don’t plant shrubs that will grow to hide them.

Smooth stones are a lovely accent for tiny succulents in a small garden. Plant a selection of quirky cactuses in a light potting mix with crushed pumice or gravel mulch for drainage. Decorate with a layer of pretty stones — they’ll help retain moisture, which means that less watering is required.

Rocks au naturel. “The placement of rocks in a contrived landscape should reflect how they’d occur in a natural environment. It’s quite a creative skill,” Mendel says.

Japanese “dry landscapes.” Rocks and stones are fundamental to Asian gardens. The Japanese concept of karesansui, meaning “dry landscape,” has taken off globally as a way to use small spaces, reduce water consumption and provide a calm environment. Raked into ripples, sand or fine gravel represents ocean waves, while rocks symbolize islands. Moss is sometimes included, but no other plants or trees.

Water on the rocks. The alliance of rocks and water is key to Asian garden philosophy. It affirms the yin-yang concept of balancing opposite and complementary natural forces. Water is mercurial, filled with light and motion, while rocks are constant and immovable. Together, they create balance and unity.

Bring tranquillity and harmony to your garden by positioning rocks near water, whether it’s a small pond, a stone vessel or a bubbling water feature.

Water also intensifies subtle colors, sharpens contrast, and makes rocks and stones mirrorlike. Dull, dry rocks reveal their full beauty and character when wet, so submerge them or let droplets splash from a water feature to make them shine.

Sculptural rocks. When it comes to garden sculpture, nature does it best. Wind, water, earthquakes and time shape rocks into astonishing artworks. If you’re lucky enough to have an amazing rock, position it prominently to reveal its most interesting face.

Note: Landscaping outlets sell naturally sculpted rocks. Also keep an eye on construction sites — you may be able to get permission to haul away excavated rocks. Before removing any rock from private or public land like a beach or preserve, check to make sure that it’s allowed.

Bold boulders. A boulder is a large rock worn smooth by water. Transporting massive boulders for landscaping is expensive, but using lightweight ceramic versions is one solution.

Stacking stones. Humans have built piles of rocks and stones for eons; dry stone walls date back to Neolithic times. Rock walls have survived in many areas, including England, Ireland, Scandinavia and South America. The Peruvian Inca city of Machu Picchu is made entirely of dry stone construction.

“Currently in Australia one of the trends is … stone used in walling and paving rather than as a more sculptural element,” Mendel says. Local stones and no adhesive chemicals make dry stone walls an eco-friendly addition to a garden.

Cairns occur all over the world. In some places, they are primitive stone stacks; in others, elaborate hive-like monuments. They often have religious, memorial or ceremonial significance, though many were built as navigation aids for travelers.

Building a cairn is an absorbing way to spend time in nature. Play “rock Lego” and plant feathery grasses, such as the variegated Japanese silver grass (Miscanthus sinensis ‘Variegata’) that wave in the wind as a contrast.

A cairn can be as simple as a tower of rocks in decreasing sizes. Ensure that your rocks have a stable seat, or use a little help from cement. Practice on small ones until you get the idea. When you feel confident, go bigger.

Choose a spot where it shows to best advantage and where surrounding plants enhance it.

A liking for lichen. Moss and lichen add color and texture to rocks, and they bring the impression of age. Their amazing colors often occur naturally and turn a nondescript rock into a special attraction.

I’ve used a “moss milkshake” with some success — and a good dash of patience. Make a thick sludge of buttermilk or yogurt and live moss (many nurseries sell tubs of moss, or you could collect it), and then paint it on rocks and stones in a shady place. Mist with water daily until it’s established. Pitted rocks are a better medium than smooth ones.

A dram from the unopened bottle of “Macallan 1878” sold for the four-figure sum at a Swiss hotel in July – making it the priciest glass of single malt ever flogged.

But whiskey experts smelled a rat after news of the sale broke and Sandro Bernasconi, of The Waldhaus Hotel in St Moritz, called in investigators to examine the $300,000 bottle.

THIS BAR WAS JUST VOTED THE BEST IN THE WORLD

The high-end grog was sent off to be tested by boffins at Oxford University – with shocking results. Carbon dating showed the booze to be a near-worthless blended Scotch dated no earlier than 1970 – a hundred years younger than it was claimed.

The label was also riddled with mistakes, while the cork looked too new and the bottle was made of modern glass.

The unsuspecting victim of the scam was Chinese tourist Zhang Wei, 36, who has now had his cash refunded. Bernasconi flew to China to apologize and personally pay back the money.

The hotelier said: “When it comes to selling our customers some of the world’s rarest and oldest whiskeys, we felt it was our duty to ensure that our stock is 100 percent authentic and the real deal.”

PATRÓN RELEASES $7,500 BOTTLE OF TEQUILA

“That’s why we called in the investigators RW101. The result has been a big shock to the system and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill.”

The bottle was bought around 25 years ago by Bernasconi’s father when he was the manager of the hotel. It’s not yet known where the hotel got the bottle from or who was responsible for the fraud.

The eye-watering price paid for the seemingly rare vintage caused a stir among experts who questioned its authenticity. The label on the dark-colored glass bottle said the whiskey was distilled in 1878 and matured for 27 years.

It claimed to be “guaranteed absolutely pure by Roderick Kemp, proprietor, Macallan and Talisker Distilleries Ltd.”

MOVIE-GOER ATTEMPTS TO OPEN BEER WITH PEPPER SPRAY, LEAVES THEATER IN TEARS

But experts said the glass used for the bottle was similar to ones made in 2002 and “Kemp” apparently didn’t own Macallan and Talisker at the same time.And there was no trace of a company called “Macallan and Talisker Distilleries Ltd” in the whiskey industry records.

Bernasconi called in Fife-based Rare Whisky 101 (RW101,) one of the world’s leading authorities on rare whiskey.

Results from Oxford Uni’s Research Laboratory for Archaeology and The History of Art suggested a 95 percent probability the liquid was made between 1970 and 1972.

Other lab tests by Tatlock and Thomson showed the spirit was most likely a blended Scotch made of 60 percent malt and 40 percent grain.

Ken Grier from Macallan brand owner, Edrington, said: “We take this very seriously.”

“We praise the work that our partners, RW101, are doing to bring awareness of any fraud to light. We would urge consumers to buy from reputable sources at all times.”

RW101 co-founder David Robertson said it was hard to know how widespread fake whiskeys were.

He said: “We’ve noticed an increasing number of old, rare archive or antique bottles coming to market at auction and it’s difficult to know how prevalent this problem is.”

“We would implore that others in the market do what they can to identify any rogue bottles.”

“The more intelligence we can provide, the greater the chance we have to defeat the fakers and fraudsters who seek to dupe the unsuspecting rare whiskey consumer.”

He urged buyers to do their research before buying a bottle and insist on testing with older, pricier whiskeys.

The publishing of the agreement this weekend follows former DNC interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile’s bombshell accusation Thursday that the party’s 2016 presidential primary contest between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders was rigged by the DNC to hand the nomination to Clinton.

Brazile, also a onetime Clinton confidante and CNN commentator, made the claims in an article in Politico while touting a new book.

The agreement, in the form of a memo obtained by NBC News, shows the DNC gave the Clinton campaign input on hiring and spending decisions in exchange for money to help the cash-strapped group, including an initial $1.2 million payment.

Hillary for America “personnel will be consulted and have joint authority over strategic decisions over the staffing, budget, expenditures, and general election related communications, data, technology, analytics, and research,"" the Aug. 26, 2015, memorandum from campaign manager Robby Mook to DNC chief executive Amy Dacey states in part. “This does not include any communications related to primary debates -- which will exclusively be controlled by the DNC.”

Clinton didn’t effectively secure the party nomination until July 2016, after an unexpectedly strong challenge from Sanders, an Independent who temporarily joined the Democratic Party to run for the White House.

The memorandum also attempts to argue that nothing in the joint-fundraising agreement “shall be construed to violate the DNC’s obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the nominating process” and acknowledges the group “may enter into similar agreements with other candidates.”

President Trump and other Republicans immediately seized on the book excerpts to validate their belief that Clinton had stolen the election from Sanders. In addition, Trump has suggested the FBI and Justice Department look into the matter.

“I know Donald Trump and Republicans would like to use Hillary Clinton as a whipping boy,” Liz Smith, who was a spokeswoman for Martin O’Malley, another 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, on Saturday told Fox News’ “America’s News Headquarters.” But she’s in our past. We are moving beyond her.”

Smith also said new DNC Chairman Tom Perez has acknowledged problems with the 2016 campaign and has vowed to fix them.

Trump tweeted Friday: “The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!,” “I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right.”

Brazile fired back on Twitter.

""Today’s lesson: Being quoted by Donald Trump means being MIS-quoted by Donald Trump. Stop trolling me,"" she tweeted with the hashtag #NeverSaidHillaryRiggedElection:

She also tweeted: ""Mr President, please -- go back to attacking me. It’s better than having my own words scrambled and spewed out by you.""

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ.
Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.","“The older my kids get, the more I realize how little control I have over them. My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

God can be trusted with the kids he has entrusted to us.",God’s given us our children. Let’s trust Him and let go of our anxiety,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/29/god-s-given-us-our-children-let-s-trust-him-and-let-go-our-anxiety.html

The educator replied: “Yes.”

Authorities met with the student Thursday who confirmed he had sexual intercourse with Lawson, his high school English teacher. The student gave Lawson’s name and age to authorities.

Lawson declined to give detectives a statement on Thursday, but confirmed she was being investigated due to the text messages sent following the sexual act, authorities said.

Hillsborough County Public Schools said Lawson resigned from her position and said they were fully cooperating with the investigation.

“We are deeply disappointed by these charges. The safety of our students is our top priority. We are working with law enforcement as they investigate. This employee has resigned her position with the district,” the district told ABC Action News.

When deputies arrived they found Donna Byrne riding her horse on the road and had an odor of alcohol, red watery eyes and was staggering, Fox 13 Tampa reported.

Officers did a sobriety test and said she gave breath samples that registered blood-alcohol level of .161 — twice Florida's legal limit of .08.

WHAT TWITTER'S 280-CHARACTER LIMIT COULD MEAN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND US POLITICS

Matt Tait, a senior cybersecurity fellow at the Robert Strauss Center, tweeted a series of satirical comments on the incident but warned that the employee involved could be in legal hot water.

“What if someone had hijacked the President's Twitter and issued policies for DHS or DOD that the department wasn't aware it had to implement?,” he tweeted.

“What if the Twitter employee had tweeted about some ongoing terror case and jeopardized it?,” he wrote, in another tweet.

TRUMP MAKE FIRST TWEETS AS PRESIDENT

“What if the Twitter employee tweeted a video of him assaulting a media organization or a political opponent? Imagine the damage to the dignity of the office,” Tait tweeted.

Tait also suggested that the rogue employee could face charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). “Going to be boring and say the Twitter employee who deleted Trump for 11 minutes should get an attorney and get ready for CFAA charges,” he tweeted.

Technologies such as artifical intelligence are being touted as a way for companies to gain visibility into their employees working practices. Questions will also inevitably be asked about Twitter’s employee vetting processes.

TRUMP'S TWITTER: COULD HACKERS WREAK HAVOC FROM THE WHITE HOUSE?

Twitter says that it is conducting a “full internal review” into the deactivation of the President’s Twitter account. When contacted by Fox News, Twitter declined to comment beyond its initial tweets.

The President himself addressed the situation early Friday. “My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact,” he tweeted.

Trump, who has more than 41 million followers on Twitter, turned his @realDonaldTrump account into a powerful political weapon during his run to the White House. Experts, however, have warned that hackers could potentially use the same account to wreak havoc.

Trump’s Twitter account has already been hacked, albeit briefly, in 2013, when an unknown attacker tweeted out an offensive lyric by rapper Lil’ Wayne. ""My Twitter has been seriously hacked---and we are looking for the perpetrators,"" tweeted Trump, in response to the incident.

Eager to forge a bond with Tokyo's crucial ally, Abe was one of the first world leaders to court President-elect Trump.
That bond was clear Sunday, as Trump and Abe exchanged glowing tweets about their game.
Trump dubbed Abe and pro golfer Hideki Matsuyama -- who accompanied the two leaders -- as ""wonderful people,"" while Abe called it a ""round of golf with a marvelous friend.""
When Trump hosted Abe in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this year, they played at one of Trump's golf courses.","President Donald Trump's five-nation Asia trip got off to a low-key start Sunday as he enjoyed a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The two leaders hit the links not long after a lunch of American-beef hamburgers, not long after Trump's arrival from Hawaii.

But the display of friendship from Abe will soon give way to high-stakes diplomacy. Still, the two men have struck up an easy rapport.

Their formal talks are set to begin Monday in Tokyo. Abe will be looking for a united front against North Korea and reassurances that the U.S. will stand by its treaty obligations to defend Japan if falls under attack.

Eager to forge a bond with Tokyo's crucial ally, Abe was one of the first world leaders to court President-elect Trump. He was the first to call Trump after the election, and rushed to New York days later to meet the president-elect and present him with a pricey, gold Honma golf driver.

The two men also met on the sidelines of an international summit in Italy this spring and White House officials said Trump has spoken with Abe by phone more than any world leader, aside from British Prime Minister Theresa May.

That bond was clear Sunday, as Trump and Abe exchanged glowing tweets about their game. Trump dubbed Abe and pro golfer Hideki Matsuyama -- who accompanied the two leaders -- as ""wonderful people,"" while Abe called it a ""round of golf with a marvelous friend.""

From the time Marine One landed on the Kasumigaseki Country Club's driving range, Abe rolled out little touches to make Trump feel welcome. He presented a hat that had a version of Trump's campaign theme, this time reading ""Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater.""

The two passed up the region's famed Kobe beef in favor of the American version, which is favored by Trump, a famed picky eater.

When Trump hosted Abe in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this year, they played at one of Trump's golf courses. For that outing, Trump brought along pro golfer Ernie Els, so this time Abe matched him by bringing along Matsuyama, whom Trump described on the plane ride to Asia as ""probably the greatest player in the history of Japan.""

Abe was behind the wheel of a golf cart as the two men were spotted moving from hole to hole, Trump in the passenger seat smiling and waving at those they passed.



""From the point of view of Abe administration, the personal chemistry that exists between the two leaders is seen as an asset,"" said Mireya Sollis, chair in Japan Studies for the Brookings Center for East Asia Policy Studies.

She said that the Japanese believe it is already ""seeing it pay off,"" including when Trump agreed to meet with the families of Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North Korean regime, an important issue for Tokyo.

Ever since Saudi Arabia delivered a lavish welcome on Trump's first international trip, leaders have tried to outdo themselves to impress the president, who has proven susceptible to flattery.

Before the game, Trump delivered a speech in which he hailed Japan as a ""crucial ally"" and warned adversaries not to test America's resolve.

""Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations,"" Trump told American service members at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo.

Though Trump did not mention North Korea by name during the speech, the spectre of its weapons program will loom large throughout Trump's five-nation Asia trip. The president warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the ""most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.""

""Together with our allies, America's warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one -- no dictator, no regime and no nation -- should underestimate, ever, American resolve,"" he told the troops.

And while there is worry in the region about Trump's unpredictable response to the threat posed by Kim Jong Un, Trump made clear he did not intend to tone down his bellicose rhetoric -- which included dubbing Kim Jong Un as ""Little Rocket Man"" -- even while in an Asian capital within reach of the North Korea dictator's missiles.

""There's been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach"" in dealing with the renegade regime in Pyongyang, he said, speaking to reporters on Air Force One.

Trump also said it is ""expected"" that he'll meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an upcoming summit in Vietnam.

The easy rapport with Japan could be strained if Trump takes an aggressive approach on trade or the two men disagree on the need for a diplomatic approach to the threat looming in Pyongyang.

During his campaign, Trump suggested Japan should acquire its own nuclear weapons to defend itself, hinted the U.S. might not come to the nation's defense, and accused Japan of ""killing us"" on trade. He has dropped that antagonist language almost entirely since the election, but tensions remain.

Japan was a chief proponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade deal Trump pulled out of.

Scott Seaman, a director for Asia of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultant organization, noted: ""everything is fine with Trump until you tell him no. So far, Abe hasn't told him no.""

For years teams and athletes dreaded appearing on the magazine's cover, for fear that a winning streak would snap or a spurt of superior play would halt.

But now, three years after a Sports Illustrated cover predicted that Houston would win the World Series in 2017, it has actually happened. The Astros defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 7 on Wednesday night -- and put to rest a curse that has plagued athletes for decades.

And the 2014 cover boy, George Springer, was named the Series' most valuable player.

Back when the 2014 cover appeared, Springer was only 24 and just making inroads into the organization. He struck out three times on the day the cover was released -- and Houston won just 70 games that season.

But on Wednesday night, Houston and Springer were celebrating a championship.

The curse dates to 1954 when Sports Illustrated put Milwaukee Braves star Eddie Matthews on its first-ever cover, the Houston Chronicle reported. Soon after the cover was released, the Braves’ nine-game winning streak ended and Matthews broke his hand.

Since then, the cover had become a figment in sports culture. Over the last two years, the New York Mets, Kevin Durant and even the Dodgers have felt the effect of the SI jinx.

The Dodgers were on the cover of the Aug. 22 edition of Sports Illustrated with the words “Best. Team. Ever?” across Justin Turner and Yasiel Puig.

In light of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, as well as director James Toback and actors Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Spacey, Baldwin admitted to hearing about the misconduct previously.

And he argued the tax-reform plan will be better, more coordinated.
“We did things differently this time because of the health care experience,” Ryan told Fox News.
“We have an active conversation with our members and a whole host of ideas on things to add to this bill,” Ryan said.
“And that’s one of the things that’s being discussed.”","House Speaker Paul Ryan expressed outrage Sunday about recent revelations that Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign cut a deal with the Democratic National Committee that effectively eliminated any potential primary challenger’s chances of winning the party nomination, saying, “this takes the cake.”

“We’ve all said the Clintons live above the law,” the Wisconsin Republican told “Fox News Sunday."" “But this takes the cake.”

The Clinton campaign in 2015 reportedly made a deal with the DNC to give the cash-strapped group money -- including a purported $1.2 million down payment -- in exchange for being able to have input over such key decisions as hiring, spending and strategic research.

The revelations came to light last week when former interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile, in Politico, highlighted the plan in excerpts from her upcoming book.

A copy of the joint-funding agreement, which other Democratic candidates, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also could have used, was published this weekend by NBC News.

Trump has suggested the FBI or the Justice Department investigate the matter.

Ryan on Sunday suggested the Federal Election Commission should investigate.

“You can understand why the Democrats are mad about this,” he also said. “They should be. I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Ryan, in the wide-ranging interview, also expressed optimism for the tax-reform plan that congressional Republicans released last week.

“I feel very good about it,” he said about the plan and its path to President Trump’s desk for signature.

Ryan said the GOP-controlled House is on track to pass the bill by Thanksgiving, with the GOP-controlled Senate to follow in about a week.

He also acknowledged that the House this past summer passed a measure to repeal and replace ObamaCare, only to have the effort fail in the Senate. And he argued the tax-reform plan will be better, more coordinated.

“We did things differently this time because of the health care experience,” Ryan told Fox News. “We worked for the Senate ahead of time, from the summer on, to put this bill together, to basically create a framework of this bill: House, Senate, and the White House, and launch this thing together, and be very coordinated.”

He also left the door open that a final version of the plan could indeed include ending the so-called individual mandate in ObamaCare, which requires Americans to purchase health-care insurance or face a tax penalty.

“We have an active conversation with our members and a whole host of ideas on things to add to this bill,” Ryan said. “And that’s one of the things that’s being discussed.”","Speaker Ryan says Clinton, DNC money deal 'takes the cake'",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/05/speaker-ryan-says-clinton-dnc-money-deal-takes-cake.html

“We are aware of the allegations and the subsequent investigation, and will respond if developments occur,” Netflix said in a statement.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office is conducting an investigation into Masterson, best known for playing Hyde on “That’s 70’s Show,” after four women accused him of rape in the early 2000s, the Huffington Post reported on Thursday.

DANNY MASTERSON RAPE ACCUSATIONS FROM FELLOW SCIENTOLOGISTS RESURFACE

One woman, who filed her accusation in 2004 to the Los Angeles Police Department, alleged that Masterson, 41, raped her while she was “passed out.” When she reportedly came to and realized what was happening, she claimed Masterson choked her until she passed out again. Both she and the actor were members of the Church of Scientology.

Three other women, also church members, reported their claims directly to the Church of Scientology.

The LAPD’s case was squashed at the time, however, after 50 Scientologists wrote affidavits denouncing the woman’s story, the Huffington Post reported.

As part of their probe, the district attorney’s office has compiled “compelling” and “overwhelming” evidence against the star including audiotapes, emails sent from Scientology members at the time of the alleged rapes, computer evidence and a handwritten letter Masterson sent threatening one of his alleged victims, the Huffington Post reported.

Masterson has reportedly not yet been charged with a crime.

On Oct. 17, Netflix announced the release date for the fourth season of “The Ranch,” long after news of the investigation was reported.

A senior official of Puigdemont's party, the center-right Democratic Party of Catalonia, said on Sunday that the party wanted Puigdemont to repeat as its candidate.
Puigdemont wrote in Dutch in his Twitter account on Saturday that he was ""prepared to fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the European arrest warrant issued by Spain.""
The poll predicts that pro-secession parties would win between 66-69 seats.
The grassroots group Catalan National Assembly has also called for a strike on Wednesday and a public protest on Saturday.","Brussels prosecutors said Sunday that ousted Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and four ex-regional ministers were taken into custody to start the process of their possible extradition to Spain.

The five presented themselves to federal police at around 9 a.m. local time, Brussels prosecutor's office spokesman Gilles Dejemeppe said. He said that they haven't been arrested and that Puigdemont and the four members of his disbanded Cabinet will be heard by an investigative judge later in the day.

The Belgian judge will have to decide within 24 hours what comes next for the five separatist politicians wanted in Spain on suspicion of rebellion for pushing through a declaration of independence for the northeastern Catalonia in violation of Spain's Constitution.

Dejemeppe said the judge's options range from ""refusal to execute the European arrest, arresting the people involved, releasing them on conditions or under bail."" He said if they are arrested then they will be sent to jail as the extradition process continues. Dejemeppe said that the entire process from arrest to extradition, could take more than 60 days.

That delay could give Puigdemont time to participate, albeit from afar and in largely a symbolic capacity, in the snap regional election called by Spain's government for Catalonia on Dec. 21.

A senior official of Puigdemont's party, the center-right Democratic Party of Catalonia, said on Sunday that the party wanted Puigdemont to repeat as its candidate. Spanish government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo has said that any politician can run in the election unless he or she has been convicted of a crime.

Puigdemont and the four ex-ministers fled to Belgium this past week after being removed from power by Spanish authorities as part of an extraordinary crackdown to quash the region's illegal secession claim.

A Spanish National Court judge issued warrants for the five absconded lawmakers on suspicion of five crimes, including rebellion, sedition and embezzlement, on Friday, a day after the same judge sent another eight former Catalan Cabinet members to jail without bail while her investigation continues. A ninth spent a night in jail and was freed after posting bail.

Puigdemont wrote in Dutch in his Twitter account on Saturday that he was ""prepared to fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the European arrest warrant issued by Spain.""

Puigdemont's lawyer in Brussels had previously said that his client plans to fight extradition to Spain without requesting political asylum.

Political forces in Catalonia are hurriedly jockeying for position to start a campaign that promises to be as bitter as it is decisive to Spain's worst institutional crisis in nearly four decades.

While pro-union parties try to rally support to win back control of the regional parliament in Barcelona, pro-secession parties are debating whether or not to form one grand coalition for the upcoming ballot.

Parties have until Tuesday to register as coalitions or they must run separately.

Catalan ex-regional president Artur Mas, the first leader to harness the political momentum for secession, told Catalan public television on Sunday that he backed a fusion of parties for the December vote. But, he said, the main goals must be to recover the self-rule of the region and the release of the jailed separatists, not another immediate attempt to culminate the independence drive.

""Under these exceptional circumstances that our country is going through, don't we have to substitute the normal and logical competition for the cooperation we all need?"" Mas said. ""If we add the issue of independence, we won't get as many people to support us.""

An opinion poll published by Barcelona's La Vanguardia newspaper Sunday forecasts a tight electoral race between parties for and against Catalonia ending century-old ties with the rest of Spain.

The poll predicts that pro-secession parties would win between 66-69 seats. They won 72 two years ago. Sixty-eight seats are needed for a majority.

Catalonia's Parliament defied Spanish authorities and voted in favor of a declaration of independence on Oct. 27. The next day, Spain's central government used extraordinary constitutional powers to fire Catalonia's government, take charge of its administrations, dissolve its regional parliament and call a regional election.

Despite fears that there would be massive resistance to the intervention, the takeover by Spanish authorities has gone smoothly.

Spain's Constitution says the nation is ""indivisible"" and that all matters of national sovereignty pertain to the country's parliament.

In all, Spanish prosecutors are investigating 20 regional politicians for rebellion and other crimes that could be punishable by up to 30 years in prison.

Another two leaders of pro-secession grassroots groups are also in jail while an investigation continues into suspicion of sedition.

Hundreds of pro-secession Catalans gathered in town squares across the region Sunday to put up posters in support of independence and to demand the release of the jailed separatists.

""People came today because we want to send a message to Europe that even if our president is still in Brussels and all our government now is in Madrid jailed, that the independence movement still didn't finish and people are still striving to get independence in a peaceful and democratic way,"" said 24-year-old protester Adria Ballester in Barcelona.

The grassroots group Catalan National Assembly has also called for a strike on Wednesday and a public protest on Saturday.

Fueled by questions of cultural identity and economic malaise, secessionist sentiment has skyrocketed to reach roughly half of the 7.5 million residents of Catalonia, a prosperous region that is proud of its Catalan language spoken along with Spanish.

Puigdemont and his fellow separatists claim that an illegal referendum on secession held on Oct. 1 that polled 43 percent of the electorate and failed to meet international standards gives them a mandate for independence.","Catalan ex-president Carles Puigdemont, 4 others in Belgian police custody",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/05/catalan-ex-president-carles-puigdemont-4-others-in-belgian-police-custody.html

A box made from a tree stump on which Abraham Lincoln purportedly gave one of his earliest political speeches was given to the Rochester Historical Preservation Society last week, the (Springfield) State Journal-Register reports.

Lincoln delivered a speech in the town in 1832, when he campaigned for the state House, according to the newspaper.

Terry Campbell of Green City, Missouri, gave the box to the society Friday on behalf of the Campbell family, the State Journal-Register said. The land where Lincoln spoke reportedly has been in the family for more than 130 years.

Campbell inherited the box after his father, Bill Campbell, died several years ago. They’d discussed donating it.

“He told me about the box and that Lincoln had stood on this stump to give his first political speech, and when he got done, members of the family cut the stump down and then built boards out of it to build a box,” Terry Campbell told the newspaper. “There were actually two boxes made out of the stump, both of them alike, and (my dad) had the one.”

The society’s president, John Runions, told the Journal-Register that the box is “a great link” to Lincoln for the small community outside the state capitol of Springfield.

“Once I got it, I knew what it was, and my dad was the same way,” Terry Campbell said of the object. “He didn’t use it for anything. He kept it on a shelf. We knew what it was and that was just kind of a heirloom that sat there and we looked at it.”

Houston St. has been host to many a famous artist and musician. Bob Dylan used the historic New York City space as a private recording studio in the 1960s and '70s.

Now, it's opening as a luxury rental in its coveted location near the West Village and SoHo.

The first floor was where Dylan recorded hits like “Idiot Wind,” and some of his rough recordings were even found tucked away in a closet when developers first started preparing to sell the building in 2014, according to the Daily News.

But times, they are a-changin', and the newly renovated building will have four full-floor lofts (that start at $12,500 a month).

Each loft has two bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths, and the $18,000-a-month penthouse includes a 750-square-foot rooftop garden.

David is also growing wary of being compared to President Trump.

A reporter asked the 70-year-old at the Television Critics Association summer press tour Wednesday if David saw any similarities between Trump and himself— as they've both been known for making some outrageous, attention-grabbing comments.

David quickly interjected, ""Well I don't consider myself a prick.""

Executive producer and ""Curb"" co-star Jeff Garlin chimed in, ""Our president is not funny; Larry is funny, so I don’t see the competition. One is sad and one helps you escape from the horribleness of the sad one.""

David, who played Sanders on ""Saturday Night Live,"" revealed he discovered he is distantly related to the Vermont senator on the TLC show ""Finding Your Roots."" The episode has not yet aired.

“They told me not to say anything, but you’re spilling the beans!” David exclaimed when the news broke during the panel. ""I was very happy about that... I thought there must have been some connection.""

Emanuel told Sanders to share a video of him doing a Sanders impression, but David disagreed.

“I said, ‘No, I’m not going to do that. That’s not me. I don’t care.’ Then I said, ‘You know, it would be a good thing for “Saturday Night Live,”’ not thinking in a million years [it would happen].”

HBO confirmed Cheryl Hines and recurring guests Richard Lewis, Bob Einstein, Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen will all return for the highly-anticipated ""Curb"" revival.
