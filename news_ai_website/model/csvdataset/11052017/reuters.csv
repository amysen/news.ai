“Kein Diktator, kein Regime, keine Nation sollte jemals die Entschlossenheit der Amerikaner unterschätzen”, sagte Trump am Sonntag nach seiner Ankunft in Japan beim Besuch des US- Luftwaffenstützpunkts Yokota bei Tokio. Der Konflikt mit Nordkorea ist eines der zentralen Themen von Trumps zwölftägiger Asien-Reise, auf der er auch Halt in Peking machen wird. Zuvor will er sich jedoch den Beistand von Japan und Südkorea sichern, um in dem Konflikt nicht nur mehr Druck auf Nordkorea ausüben zu können, sondern auch auf China - Nordkoreas wichtigstem Unterstützer.

Nach mehreren Raketen- und Atomtests Nordkoreas hatten sich die Spannungen in der Region sowie zwischen dem international isolierten Land und den USA verschärft. Auch die jüngste Teilnahme von US-Bombern an einer Militärübung in Südkorea trug dazu bei.

“Wir werden niemals nachgeben, niemals zaudern und niemals schwanken bei der Verteidigung unserer Freiheit”, sagte Trump vor Hunderten jubelnden amerikanischen und japanischen Soldaten in Tarnuniform. Er selbst trug eine Bomberjacke.

“NORDKOREA-PROBLEM MUSS GELÖST WERDEN”

Kurz zuvor hatte Trump vor Journalisten an Bord der Präsidentenmaschine Air Force One gesagt, Nordkorea sei “ein großes Problem für unser Land und die Welt, und wir wollen, dass es gelöst wird”. 25 Jahre lang sei der Umgang mit Nordkorea von einer “totalen Schwäche” geprägt gewesen. “Also gehen wir das auf eine sehr andere Art an.” Es werde bald eine Entscheidung darüber geben, ob Nordkorea offiziell auf eine Liste von Staaten gesetzt werde, die als Terrorismus-Unterstützer eingestuft würden. Sein Sicherheitsberater H. R. McMaster hatte bereits gesagt, bei dem Thema laufe die Zeit davon.

Trump setzt auch auf Russlands Präsident Wladimir Putin. “Wir wollen Putins Hilfe bei Nordkorea”, sagte er. Er gehe davon aus, dass er auf seiner Reise auch Putin treffen werde. Das erwarte wohl jeder.

Trumps Asienreise ist die längste eines amerikanischen Präsidenten seit George Bush im Jahr 1992. Neben Nordkorea stünde auch das Thema Wirtschaftsbeziehungen auf der Tagesordnung. Handel sei in der Region jahrelang “schlecht gehandhabt” worden, sagte er auf dem Flug nach Japan. Dort traf er mit Ministerpräsident Shinzo Abe zusammen. Zum Auftakt des Besuchs spielten die beiden zusammen mit dem Weltranglisten- Dritten Hideki Matsuyama eine Runde Golf. Dabei soll auch Nordkorea zur Sprache gekommen sein. Abe sah den Besuch als eine Möglichkeit an, die Bindungen zwischen den beiden Ländern zu festigen.

European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts.

Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries.

The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it.

Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package.

The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code.

Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business.

However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units.

Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs.

BLUNT INSTRUMENT

“Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

“I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee.

Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes.

As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018.

European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.

Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties.

“That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy.

He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.”

Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes.

The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law.

The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns.

The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week.

Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well.

There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.

It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said.

“You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?”

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

His father, Prince Talal, is considered one of the most vocal supporters of reform in the ruling Al Saud family, having pressed for a constitutional monarchy decades ago.",Future Saudi king tightens grip on power with arrest of Prince Alwaleed,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests/future-saudi-king-tightens-grip-on-power-with-arrest-of-prince-alwaleed-idUSKBN1D506P

French and German officials confirmed Le Maire would be in Berlin on Wednesday, when he will meet acting Finance Minister Peter Altmaier, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Le Maire is also due to see Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), and Cem Oezdemir, co-leader of the Greens party. Both are in discussions with Merkel’s conservatives on forming a coalition government.

France’s Emmanuel Macron has made euro zone reform a central goal of his five-year presidency. But any changes will require the support of Merkel and her new government, which is not expected to be in place before Christmas. Lindner has been critical of Macron’s idea to create a budget for the euro zone.

“We want to follow up on the president’s Sorbonne speech and exchange views on the future of the euro zone,” a French finance ministry official said, referring to a speech by Macron in September when he laid out his vision for EU reform.

While Le Maire’s visit - his first to Berlin since the German election - is about strengthening contacts with likely members of the new government, officials indicated that it would also be an opportunity to sound out Berlin on the Eurogroup presidency, a powerful position that will be elected next month.

Since it was created in 2005, the Eurogroup, which brings together the euro zone’s 19 finance ministers, has had only two presidents: Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who served from 2005 to 2013, and former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is due to step down in January.

The position involves chairing monthly meetings and driving policy around economic and monetary union, including ensuring that all member states stick to strict targets on deficits and debt. The post has been dubbed “Mr Euro”.

“NO NATURAL CANDIDATE”

Le Maire, 48, is regarded as sharp, ambitious and more than capable of leading the group. But some euro zone officials are wary about the presidency ending up in the hands of either Germany or France, the two largest economies in the single currency bloc and already dominant forces in policymaking.

A further complication for Le Maire is France’s poor record of meeting its own deficit targets over the past decade. German officials are not ruling out Le Maire, but they have also expressed a preference for giving the post to a smaller country.

Last week, one official in Berlin mentioned two possible alternatives: Pierre Gramegna of Luxembourg and Peter Kazimir of Slovakia. The official also floated the idea of extending Dijsselbloem, seen as a close ally of Berlin, even though he is not part of the new Dutch government.

“It is still quite unclear who will come forward,” the German official said when asked about the presidency. “At this stage there does not seem to be one candidate everyone is rallying behind. There is no natural candidate.”

The Eurogroup president will be chosen on Dec. 4, an EU official said last week, with the formal call for candidates opening in mid-November.

“It is not a done thing,” the German official said of Le Maire’s candidacy. “He will only apply if he gets the impression that he is the one.”

The talks in Berlin on Wednesday could be decisive in determining whether he does throw his hat into the ring.

If Le Maire were to get the job, it could have repercussions for other top euro zone jobs. Mario Draghi will end his term as president of the European Central Bank on Oct. 31, 2019, and Germany’s Jens Weidmann is already being mentioned as a potential successor.

Euro zone watchers say that if the French secure the presidency of the Eurogroup, it may be harder for them to argue against a German candidate taking over the ECB.

Still, as one senior French official told Reuters on condition of anonymity last month, Weidmann at the helm of the ECB “would be a problem for a lot of countries, not just for France”.",France's Le Maire heads to Berlin to test Eurogroup waters,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-germany-lemaire/frances-le-maire-heads-to-berlin-to-test-eurogroup-waters-idUKKBN1D50U8?il=0

The interior ministry said the attacks targeted a Shi‘ite Muslim mosque on Atlas Street in central Kirkuk and gave an initial casualty toll of one killed and 16 wounded.

It is the first such attack since the central government in Baghdad seized the oil-rich city last month from Kurdish forces, who had been controlling Kirkuk for three years.

The central government in Baghdad launched an offensive on Oct. 16 to recapture the city and other territories in northern Iraq claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurds, in retaliation for a referendum on Kurdish independence.

Iraqi security forces advanced on the city, forcing the Kurdish Peshmerga to withdraw. The retreat also allowed Baghdad to take control of all oil fields operated by the state-owned North Oil Company in Kirkuk’s northern province.

No group has claimed responsibility for Sunday’s attacks but the suicide bombings are a trademark of Islamic State militants.

Police sources said the two attacks happened in quick succession and said the death toll might rise because some of the wounded were in critical condition.

“It’s a crowded street and a place for street vendors. The terrorists wanted to kill large number of people,” said a Kirkuk police major.

Iraqi security officials have said Islamic State is likely to wage an insurgency in Iraq after their self-proclaimed caliphate all but collapsed and they were dislodged from large territories in the west and north on the country.

European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts.

Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries.

The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it.

Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package.

The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code.

Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business.

However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units.

Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs.

BLUNT INSTRUMENT

“Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

“I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee.

Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes.

As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018.

European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.

Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties.

“That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy.

He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.”

Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes.

The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law.

The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns.

The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week.

Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well.

There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.

It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said.

“You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?”

“I thought I was going to be fired,” recalled the former employee nearly 40 years later. But Shinzo Abe, now Japan’s prime minister, stayed on the job at Japan’s third-largest steelmaker for three years before entering politics in 1982.

Abe has called the steel industry the backbone of the nation. Kobe Steel, a 112-year-old company in south-central Japan’s Hyogo prefecture, has risen from wartime devastation and natural disaster but its past is littered with examples of corporate misconduct.

Its admission last month that workers had tampered with product specifications for at least a decade is the latest in a string of scandals that has battered Japan’s reputation as a manufacturing powerhouse.

Clients around the world, including top carmakers and airplane manufacturers, have been scrambling to check whether the safety or performance of their products have been compromised.

Workers, executives and shopowners in Kobe, a gritty, industrial city bordered by sloping hills where cattle are bred for the famed Kobe beef, said they were concerned but not surprised by the scandal.

Kobe Steel, which has apologized for the tampering, declined comment for this article.

“The corporate culture was to look the other way even while you saw what was going on,” said a retired employee who worked at the company’s flagship steel plant, Kobe Works - a symbol of the city’s quick recovery from a 1995 earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people. The company’s other main plant in the area is Kakogawa Works, in the nearby city of Kakogawa.

“They were supposed to be instilling a culture that paid attention when improprieties were discovered,” the former employee said. “In the end they didn’t create such a corporate culture. That’s management’s responsibility.”

The company initially said some workers had falsified data on contract specifications for a relatively small amount of aluminum and copper products, but it later admitted the problem had spread.

In 2006, Kobe Steel admitted falsifying soot-emissions data from the blast furnaces at Kobe Works and Kakogawa Works.

The latest scandal reflects “exactly the same set-up”, said Shoichi Tarumoto, who was then mayor of Kakogawa. “It looks like nothing has changed at Kobe Steel.”

PAST PROBLEMS

Kobe Steel has admitted taking part in bid-rigging for a bridge project in 2005, and failing to report income to tax authorities in 2008, 2011 and 2013. The company exceeded established limits for ground and water pollution in 2006.

Illegal political funding to candidates in local assembly elections in 2009 prompted the resignations of the then CEO and chairman. And last year Kobe Steel admitted a subsidiary falsified data on stainless-steel products.

A senior official in local government who has dealt with the company for years said: “Kobe Steel always scouts the backstreets for shortcuts. That’s their nature.”

Although its local dominance has waned, Kobe Steel remains one of only two Kobe-based companies, along with Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd (7012.T), that have revenues over 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) a year. The Kakogawa Works is that city’s biggest company, vital as a local taxpayer and employer.

More than a third of the Kobe Steel group’s 6,123 domestic customers are concentrated in Hyogo or neighboring Osaka, according to credit-research firm Teikoku Databank. More than half its customers are small and midsize Japanese companies.

The other clients are spread around the world and include top automobile manufacturers, airplane makers, railways and nearly any industry that uses steel, aluminum or copper in any form. [nL4N1N834X]

No safety issues have been found so far because of the tampering, but Kobe Steel has withdrawn its forecast for its first annual profit in three years. Whatever the eventual economic impact, the scandal is already affecting morale in Kobe city.

“If Kobe Steel suffers a blow, this is the area that will be most affected,” said Tsuyoshi Matsuda of Teikoku Databank’s Kobe office.

Kobe Steel acknowledges some customers have shifted orders to other suppliers. Major banks are instructing their Kobe area branches to keep close watch on the credit management at companies that do business with the steelmaker, bankers say.

“HEAVY MOOD”

The scandal “isn’t an open topic on the job,” said a worker in his 30s, finishing the night shift around 8 a.m. at Kobe Works, a hulking jumble of rusting pipes, risers and tanks.

“Nobody says it out loud, but I think people are worried,” he said. “It’s a heavy mood.”

Shinzaike, the local train station closest to Kobe Works, is home to several bar-restaurants that count the company’s employees among their best customers. Since the latest scandal erupted, business has dried up, traders said.

“Looks like they’re holding back from going drinking,” said a pub owner.

Reservations for year-end parties would normally be starting now, but there haven’t been any yet, he added.

Abe, who worked at both the Kobe and Kakogawa works, has called his years at Kobe Steel “the starting point of my adult life.”

Last year, according to media reports, he urged young people entering the workforce to follow his example of learning from mistakes at Kobe Steel.

“I got through it without incident,” he said. “I want you not to be discouraged by a few mistakes but rather do the best you can.”","Scandal-hit Kobe Steel has a 'look the other way' culture, they say in hometown",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1D5011-OCABS

A dirlo è Carlo Cottarelli, in occasione della presentazione del nuovo ‘Osservatorio sui conti pubblici italiani’ che dirigerà a titolo gratuito.

“Del 2012 in occasione delle stime semestrali il governo di turno ha sempre rivisto al ribasso l‘obiettivo del saldo primario. Se tutto va bene nel 2018 il saldo primario sarà del 2% contro il 5% che il governo prevedeva nel 2014” ha detto l‘ex-dirigente apicale del Fondo monetario internazionale.

Il saldo primario è dato dalla differenza tra entrate e spese pubbliche al netto della spesa per interessi, tallone d‘Achille italiano a causa dell‘elevato debito pubblico.

Un saldo primario del 4% in condizioni di crescita economica ‘normali’ serve per avere un calo annuo di tre punti percentuali del rapporto debito/Pil.

“In questo modo nei periodi in cui la crescita viene a mancare il debito rimane costante e non riprende a salire” ha spiegato Cottareli durante un incontro all‘Università Cattolica a cui fa capo il nuovo osservatorio. “La riduzione marginale del debito che vedremo quest‘anno e il prossimo non è sufficiente”.

Le stime del governo, dopo il 132% del 2016, vedono il rapporto debito/Pil al 131,6% a fine 2017 e al 130% a fine 2018.

Al governo attuale e a quello che uscirà dalle elezioni, Cottarelli, commissario per la spending review durante il governo Letta, raccomanda in tema di contenimento dei conti pubblici di evitare inversioni di tendenza in tema pensionistico.

“Sarebbe un grosso problema per i conti pubblici se si cominciasse già a disfare quello che è stato approvato alcuni anni fa con la riforma delle pensioni. Non vedo spazio per cambiare il meccanismo di indicizzazione dell‘età pensionabile alle aspettative di vita” ha spiegato.

In un recente incontro con i sindacati il governo, fatto salvo il principio dell‘adeguamento dell‘età pensionabile alle aspettative di vita, si è detto disponibile a discutere eccezioni per i lavoratori impiegati in attività gravose.

Sempre in tema di contenimento della spesa pubblica, Cottarelli chiede al governo di ragionare sulla moltiplicazone dei bonus vista ngli ultimi anni.

“Se si vuole influire sul basso tasso di fertilità italiano servono misure struttturali, non il bonus bebè”.

The size of the purge - 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers were detained by a newly created anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - raised questions about the stability and predictability of the Saudi government.

For foreigners, a major shock was the detention of flamboyant billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who as a big investor in top Western companies such as Citigroup (C.N) is known as the international face of Saudi business.

Local investors, meanwhile, worried about whether a sustained investigation into corruption could turn up scandals in the kingdom’s opaque business world, forcing people implicated to sell off their equity holdings.

But many bankers and analysts saw the purge, which replaced the head of the National Guard, as a power grab by Prince Mohammed, designed to remove any remaining obstacles to his authority and assure his eventual succession to the throne.

This, they said, could help the economy by making it easier for Prince Mohammed to pursue radical reforms that include slashing the state budget deficit, putting more women into employment, lifting a ban on women driving, and selling $300 billion of state assets.

“This is the latest act of concentration of power in Saudi,” said Hasnain Malik, global head of equity research at emerging markets investment bank Exotix.

”As unprecedented and controversial as it may be, this centralization might also be a necessary condition for pushing the austerity and transformation agenda, the benefits of which very few investors are pricing in.”

After initially tumbling as much as 2.2 percent on Sunday, the Saudi stock index .TASI rebounded to close slightly higher. Shares related to some of the detained people, such as Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, sank but most banks rose, a sign of economic optimism.

INSTABILITY

The purge may increase Prince Mohammed’s grassroots support by tackling corruption, a problem that has long plagued the economy.

“It’s a populist move that makes sense because a lot of the princes, businessmen and bureaucrats are corrupt, taking kickbacks and being involved in all kinds of shady deals,” said Bernard Haykel, professor of Near East studies at Princeton University.

A danger for financial markets, however, is that Prince Mohammed is shaking up business practices and ties that have lasted for decades, a move which could backfire if it triggers an exodus of money and wealthy individuals from the country.

“The fact that some of the country’s leading business people were arrested will scare the private sector and there might be even more capital flight than before. And most bureaucrats will now be terrified, perhaps justifiably,” Haykel said.

Many corporate executives expect Prince Mohammed to persuade or pressure rich Saudis to repatriate some of the billions of dollars which they are believed to have transferred overseas for safe-keeping, and which could now help to kick-start the development projects that he plans.

The corruption crackdown may be an initial step in this effort; the decree creating the committee gave it the right, pending the result of investigations, to seize assets at home or abroad and transfer them to the state Treasury.

James Dorsey, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, wrote that Prince Mohammed appeared to be reacting to growing opposition within the royal family and the military to his reforms and Riyadh’s military intervention in Yemen.

“It raises questions about the reform process that increasingly is based on a unilateral rather than a consensual rewriting of the kingdom’s social contract.”

For many people, however, a unilateral approach is seen as the best chance to push through the reforms. A chief economist at a big regional bank said Prince Mohammed’s main motive for acting was frustration that reforms were not moving fast enough.

The privatization program, for example, including the planned sale of 5 percent of national oil giant Saudi Aramco, has been discussed for many months with little action. Now the program may pick up.

“The message this should send to foreign investors is it’s unwise to bet against MbS,” said Sam Blatteis, chief executive of regional advisory firm The MENA Catalysts, using a common abbreviation of Prince Mohammed’s name.

“When he wants to get things done, he has proven that he can. This is not a consolidation of power, it’s an acceleration. The wheels of policy-making are moving faster.”",Saudi purge worries investors but may speed reforms,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests-economy/saudi-purge-worries-investors-but-may-speed-reforms-idINKBN1D50RN?il=0

But Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of the Revolutionary Guards who are in charge of Iran’s missile program, said: “Mr Trump has said many baseless things and told many lies and frequently falsely accused Iran and this one of those slanders,” Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.

“We do not have even the possibility to transfer missiles to Yemen. The missiles belong to them and they have increased their range,” Jafari added.

A Saudi-led coalition has launched thousands of air strikes against Houthi rebels and allied forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh who have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi territory over the course of a 2-1/2 year war.

Regional and Western sources have said Iran is sending advanced weapons and military advisers to the Houthi movement, stepping up support for its Shi‘ite ally in the country’s civil war.

“I thought I was going to be fired,” recalled the former employee nearly 40 years later. But Shinzo Abe, now Japan’s prime minister, stayed on the job at Japan’s third-largest steelmaker for three years before entering politics in 1982.

Abe has called the steel industry the backbone of the nation. Kobe Steel, a 112-year-old company in south-central Japan’s Hyogo prefecture, has risen from wartime devastation and natural disaster but its past is littered with examples of corporate misconduct.

Its admission last month that workers had tampered with product specifications for at least a decade is the latest in a string of scandals that has battered Japan’s reputation as a manufacturing powerhouse.

Clients around the world, including top carmakers and airplane manufacturers, have been scrambling to check whether the safety or performance of their products have been compromised.

Workers, executives and shopowners in Kobe, a gritty, industrial city bordered by sloping hills where cattle are bred for the famed Kobe beef, said they were concerned but not surprised by the scandal.

Kobe Steel, which has apologized for the tampering, declined comment for this article.

“The corporate culture was to look the other way even while you saw what was going on,” said a retired employee who worked at the company’s flagship steel plant, Kobe Works - a symbol of the city’s quick recovery from a 1995 earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people. The company’s other main plant in the area is Kakogawa Works, in the nearby city of Kakogawa.

“They were supposed to be instilling a culture that paid attention when improprieties were discovered,” the former employee said. “In the end they didn’t create such a corporate culture. That’s management’s responsibility.”

The company initially said some workers had falsified data on contract specifications for a relatively small amount of aluminum and copper products, but it later admitted the problem had spread.

In 2006, Kobe Steel admitted falsifying soot-emissions data from the blast furnaces at Kobe Works and Kakogawa Works.

The latest scandal reflects “exactly the same set-up”, said Shoichi Tarumoto, who was then mayor of Kakogawa. “It looks like nothing has changed at Kobe Steel.”

PAST PROBLEMS

Kobe Steel has admitted taking part in bid-rigging for a bridge project in 2005, and failing to report income to tax authorities in 2008, 2011 and 2013. The company exceeded established limits for ground and water pollution in 2006.

Illegal political funding to candidates in local assembly elections in 2009 prompted the resignations of the then CEO and chairman. And last year Kobe Steel admitted a subsidiary falsified data on stainless-steel products.

A senior official in local government who has dealt with the company for years said: “Kobe Steel always scouts the backstreets for shortcuts. That’s their nature.”

Although its local dominance has waned, Kobe Steel remains one of only two Kobe-based companies, along with Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd (7012.T), that have revenues over 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) a year. The Kakogawa Works is that city’s biggest company, vital as a local taxpayer and employer.

More than a third of the Kobe Steel group’s 6,123 domestic customers are concentrated in Hyogo or neighboring Osaka, according to credit-research firm Teikoku Databank. More than half its customers are small and midsize Japanese companies.

The other clients are spread around the world and include top automobile manufacturers, airplane makers, railways and nearly any industry that uses steel, aluminum or copper in any form. [nL4N1N834X]

No safety issues have been found so far because of the tampering, but Kobe Steel has withdrawn its forecast for its first annual profit in three years. Whatever the eventual economic impact, the scandal is already affecting morale in Kobe city.

“If Kobe Steel suffers a blow, this is the area that will be most affected,” said Tsuyoshi Matsuda of Teikoku Databank’s Kobe office.

Kobe Steel acknowledges some customers have shifted orders to other suppliers. Major banks are instructing their Kobe area branches to keep close watch on the credit management at companies that do business with the steelmaker, bankers say.

“HEAVY MOOD”

The scandal “isn’t an open topic on the job,” said a worker in his 30s, finishing the night shift around 8 a.m. at Kobe Works, a hulking jumble of rusting pipes, risers and tanks.

“Nobody says it out loud, but I think people are worried,” he said. “It’s a heavy mood.”

Shinzaike, the local train station closest to Kobe Works, is home to several bar-restaurants that count the company’s employees among their best customers. Since the latest scandal erupted, business has dried up, traders said.

“Looks like they’re holding back from going drinking,” said a pub owner.

Reservations for year-end parties would normally be starting now, but there haven’t been any yet, he added.

Abe, who worked at both the Kobe and Kakogawa works, has called his years at Kobe Steel “the starting point of my adult life.”

Last year, according to media reports, he urged young people entering the workforce to follow his example of learning from mistakes at Kobe Steel.

“I got through it without incident,” he said. “I want you not to be discouraged by a few mistakes but rather do the best you can.”","Scandal-hit Kobe Steel has a 'look the other way' culture, they say in hometown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kobe-steel-scandal-hometown/scandal-hit-kobe-steel-has-a-look-the-other-way-culture-they-say-in-hometown-idUSKBN1D5011

Along with Pashto, the language of the Pashtuns, Dari is named in the constitution as one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.","KABUL (Reuters) - The BBC is facing an angry reaction in Afghanistan after it changed the name of one of its local language Facebook pages to BBC Dari, the official name of the Afghan version of Persian or Farsi but one rejected by many local Persian speakers.

The Facebook page and other social media sites were bombarded by criticisms of the change. Many Persian speakers say the name Dari has been imposed historically by the traditionally dominant Pashto ethnic group as an implicit denial of Afghanistan’s place in the wider Persian-speaking world.

The reaction highlighted the sensitivity of linguistic issues in Afghanistan, a country with a mix of over 35 languages spoken by ethnic groups including Pashtuns, Tajiks and Hazaras as well as Uzbeks and Turkmen.

It also echoed some of the tensions around the government led by President Ashraf Ghani, which was formed after the disputed 2014 election and which is seen by many Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras as favoring his own Pashtun ethnicity.

While the Persian spoken in Afghanistan and neighboring Iran have distinct accents and numerous variations in vocabulary and usage, other essentials are the same, with the gap between the two sometimes compared to the differences between the French spoken in France and Canada.

“My language is Farsi,” said Mujib Rahman Rahimi, spokesman for Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, whose Jamiat-e-Islami party draws its support mainly from Tajiks.

“The time of betrayal of our language and culture is past. We will not allow anyone else to choose a name for our language,” he wrote on his personal Facebook page.

However not all reaction was negative and some other users supported the move, saying it reinforced Afghanistan’s national identity: “I am from Afghanistan, not Persia or the Persian race,” wrote one.

There was also no sign the reaction would harm the BBC’s ability to report or have major political repercussions in Afghanistan. Combined BBC services are estimated to reach about 6.6 million Afghans out of a total population of some 35 million, according to figures last year from the BBC Trust.

The head of the BBC’s Afghan service, Meena Baktash defended the use of the term Dari, noting that it was the official name of the language in Afghanistan.

She said the change was intended to link the Facebook page to the BBC Dari radio service, which was launched in 2003 and which, together with the BBC Pashto service, occupies an important place in the crowded local media landscape.

“There are absolutely no political and cultural reasons behind our decision,” she wrote in a statement on Facebook, which, as in other countries, has taken off in Afghanistan to become one of the main sources of news and comment.

Along with Pashto, the language of the Pashtuns, Dari is named in the constitution as one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.

But many Afghan Persian speakers say their language is the same as the one spoken in Iran and Tajikistan and say the name Dari was favoured by past Pashtun leaders as a means of distancing Afghanistan from the Persian cultural sphere.

“The division of the Farsi language into Dari, Farsi and Tajiki is contrary to the reality of our common language and the vast expanse of our common culture and civilization,” Abdul Hai Khurasani, a scholar and former aide to the late Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud wrote in a letter to the director general of the BBC World Service which he posted on Facebook.",BBC name change stirs language row in Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D50O3

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

Here is her account of what happened next:

Photographers help a Rohingya refugee to come out of Nad River as they cross the Myanmar-Bangladesh border in Palong Khali, near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, November 1, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File photo

”We were standing, looking out over paddy fields and grasslands – lots of water and one thin path leading to the border with Myanmar.

”In the distance we could see a huge group of people. But they weren’t moving. It was 4 o’clock in the afternoon with only two hours left of daylight. So we decided to move towards them.

”It took us about an hour along the muddy path, meeting border guards and persuading them to let us pass. Then we saw thousands of refugees just sitting there, with more Bangladeshi border guards telling us to go back.

”We could see something was going on behind the crowd. So we waited for an opportunity to move closer, and that’s when we saw them.

”The crowd was sitting on a riverbank and behind them, about three meters below, in the river itself, there were just hundreds of refugees coming across every minute. It was non-stop. There was no end to the people. People carrying babies. Elderly people being escorted through the water and mud, more than knee-deep. And we were just photographing everyone coming towards us.

”Then this woman appeared. She got to the point where she needed to get up to the footpath where we were. But she was just exhausted. She didn’t have anything left to get herself up. Two refugee men on her level were trying to push her up, which was when we reached out to help. Another Reuters photographer, Adnan Abidi, took a hand. Another photographer took another and I got her leg when she got within range. It was a case of dragging her.

”She lay there for a few minutes and then, I have no idea what happened to her. There were so many people around and it was chaos.

”We decided to get down into the river to get a different view. And it was so difficult – even for us who had some energy to spare. All the people around us had been walking for days. When I got back to the bank, I found I had nothing to hold onto, with two cameras weighing me down. That’s when two refugee men reached out with their hands and pulled me on to the bank. I kept saying ‘Thank You’, but they didn’t understand.

”It was overwhelming and made me think of the woman we had pulled out.

“You are there trying to do your job with a camera in your hand. And then your heart overrules your head. I had been in the camps, where everything was quite settled. But then I saw the real chaos and the refugees’ desperate situation. You hear about it. But seeing it is a completely different thing.”

Democratic Republic of Congo army spokesman for South Kivu province, Dieudonne Kasereka, said clashes had started after police came to disarm Colonel Abbas Kayonga, who was sacked on Thursday from his post overseeing anti-fraud efforts in local mines.

Kayonga, a former rebel from a group that had been disarmed and integrated into the Congolese military, gave himself up at the local base for the U.N. mission to Congo.

“He has just surrendered with 17 people at the base of the mission,” Kasereka said by telephone. Two army soldiers and three of Kanyonga’s bodyguards were killed in the fighting and two civilians were killed by stray bullets, he said.

Seventeen members of Kanyonga’s force surrendered to U.N. troops and nine others were captured by the army, Kasereka said, adding that soldiers found about a dozen heavy weapons at Kanyonga’s house.

Security has been deteriorating across Congo since the end of last year, when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down despite his mandate expiring.

Surging militia violence in the east, which has for decades been a tinderbox of ethnic rivalries fueled by the region’s mineral wealth, and in the formerly peaceful central Kasai region, have raised fears the country could slip back to the multi-faceted civil wars of the turn of the century.

Those wars killed hundreds of thousands directly in violence while millions of others are thought to have died from of hunger and disease.

South Kivu has rich deposits of gold, tin and coltan, used in mobile phones, which have long helped finance rebel groups and army officers.

The national electoral commission was expected to announce a date for the election to replace Kabila later on Sunday. Last month, it said the election cannot take place until April 2019, raising fears of an escalation in militia violence and civil disturbances.

U.S. envoy Nikki Haley said during a visit to meet with Kabila last month that the vote must happen in 2018 or it will lose international support.","Renegade colonel surrenders in eastern Congo after clashes, seven dead",https://www.reuters.com/article/congo-violence/renegade-colonel-surrenders-in-eastern-congo-after-clashes-7-dead-idINKBN1D50GN?il=0

While veteran State Department Asia hand Joseph Yun might be Washington’s best diplomatic hope for reducing the risk of a devastating war on the Korean peninsula, he serves an administration riven by divisions over how to handle Pyongyang.

On the other side, North Korea’s young leader, Kim Jong Un, shows little interest in negotiating either, at least not until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Despite the daunting obstacles, South Korean-born Yun has told colleagues and others he hopes his diplomatic efforts can lower the temperature in a dangerous nuclear stand-off, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former U.S. officials and South Korean diplomats.

Most were deeply skeptical about his chances.

“He’s such a dreamer,” a White House official said, with a note of sarcasm.

“We don’t think this is going anywhere,” said another U.S. official, although he suggested it was still worthwhile to keep engaging at some level with the North Koreans as long as Yun does not appear to be undermining President Donald Trump’s public rejection of direct negotiations.

Trump has told aides that his military threats will drive North Korea to capitulate and rein in its nuclear and missile programs, four White House officials said, a view not shared among most U.S. intelligence agencies.

Yun, however, is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korean officials at the United Nations and has a mandate to discuss issues beyond the release of U.S. citizens, a senior State Department official told Reuters this week. In June, he secured the release of U.S. student Otto Warmbier, who returned to the United States in a coma and died days later.

‘RUNNING OUT OF TIME’

Trump headed to Asia on Friday as a senior aide warned the world is “running out of time” on the North Korea crisis. Behind the scenes, Yun is trying to keep open a fragile line of communication that could be used to prevent any miscalculation by one side or the other from spiraling into military conflict.

Further aggravating tensions, two U.S. strategic bombers conducted drills over South Korea on Thursday. That followed word from South Korea’s spy agency that North Korea may be preparing another missile launch.

U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

In the midst of this is Yun, a soft-spoken, 32-year foreign service veteran who took on the job a year ago, near the end of the Obama administration.

He is grappling with Trump’s strident rhetoric as well as disagreement among the president’s top aides over whether saber-rattling will force Kim to capitulate and what the threshold for any military actions should be, according to several U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Concern about Yun’s difficulties has surfaced in Seoul, where he visits regularly and where Trump will travel next week on the second stop of his Asian tour.

Several South Korean officials expressed worry that Yun’s diplomatic efforts with North Korea lack any real underpinning of support from the White House.

“Things are clearly not easy for him,” one South Korean diplomat said. “Yun is precisely that person (to talk to North Korea), but Trump is killing the whole process.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters on Sept. 30 the United States was probing for a diplomatic opening, only to be slapped down by Trump, who told him via Twitter this was a waste of time.

At the same time, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who regularly briefs Trump on intelligence matters and is considered one of the most hawkish voices on North Korea in the president’s inner circle, has apparently gained stature.

Several officials familiar with those discussions say Pompeo is feeding Trump assessments that U.S. military threats will force Kim to bow to U.S. demands for nuclear disarmament, a position that some U.S. intelligence officers privately contest.

The CIA declined comment.

NORTH KOREAN NEGOTIATOR ‘SHOCKED’

A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Yun has become diplomatically “untethered,” not fully connected to a core U.S. approach that is emphasizing economic sanctions and the threat of military action rather than diplomacy.

The one tangible achievement of Yun’s diplomatic efforts in the past year was winning the release of 22-year-old Warmbier in secret talks with North Korean officials in Oslo and New York. Yun flew to Pyongyang in June to medically evacuate Warmbier.

When Choe Son Hui, head of the North Korean foreign ministry’s North America bureau, met Yun in Oslo, she was unaware of how serious Warmbier’s condition was, a source in Washington knowledgeable about the matter said.

KCNA/via REUTERS.

But once she learned about it she was “shocked” and Yun was summoned urgently to meet a North Korean diplomat in New York, which quickly led to Warmbier’s return home, the source said.

Warmbier’s death complicated Yun’s efforts as it contributed to a chilling of U.S.-North Korean contacts around that time, the State Department official said.

STUMBLING IN THE DARK

Despite Trump’s threats of military action against Pyongyang, the State Department official said Yun’s view was “the less you engage diplomatically, the more likely you are in the dark.”

Even so, Trump’s rhetoric has raised questions among allies, and possibly even in North Korea, about how serious, if at all, his administration is about diplomacy and how much of a mandate Yun may have to pursue it.

Trump “personalized” the conflict – deriding Kim as “Little Rocket Man” - against the advice of his national security and intelligence experts, some of whom warned it could be counterproductive, a senior national security official said.

Another official pointed out, however, that Trump, who in May said he would be honored to meet Kim, had not hurled any fresh insults at Kim in recent days, raising hopes for an altered approach.

A South Korean official in Seoul said it was necessary for Washington to have someone in contact with North Korea to help spur future negotiations if they are ever to take hold.

But Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, told Japan’s NHK television this week: “What we cannot afford to do is enter into these long, drawn-out negotiations that allow North Korea to use these negotiations as cover for continuing their nuclear and missile programs.”

Former U.S. negotiators sympathize with Yun, whose authority to negotiate has been undercut by the tug-of-war between a White House breathing fire and a State Department pushing a peaceful solution.

“Nobody doubted my authority,” said Wendy Sherman, one of the lead U.S. negotiators who achieved the 2015 deal under which

Iran agreed to restrain its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. “All of this undermines our ability to do the job.”

Robert Gallucci, who was chief U.S. negotiator during the North Korean nuclear crisis of 1994 and has had recent contact with Yun, said the envoy is “realistic about the challenges of negotiating in the current atmosphere, including the tone set by the president, but he believes in the mission even as his approach is guided by realism.”",'He's such a dreamer:' Skepticism dogs U.S. envoy's North Korean peace efforts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-diplomacy-insight/hes-such-a-dreamer-skepticism-dogs-u-s-envoys-north-korean-peace-efforts-idUSKBN1D32BL

Manafort, who ran Trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year, and associate Richard Gates earlier this week pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment by a federal grand jury.

The charges include conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. They are part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election in Trump’s favor and potential collusion by Trump associates.

In the Saturday court filing, Manafort offered to limit his travel to New York, Washington and Florida and pledged life insurance worth about $4.5 million as well as about $8 million in real estate assets, including a property on Fifth Avenue in New York that was identified by some media outlets as an apartment in Trump Tower.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said on Thursday that initial bail terms would remain in place and set a bail hearing for Monday to consider changes. On Friday, she suggested a potential May 7 trial date.

Manafort and Gates are under house arrest, under unsecured bonds of $10 million and $5 million, respectively, which means they do not have to post the bail unless they fail to show up for court or violate other conditions.

Prosecutors have argued there is a risk of flight and both men are subject to electronic monitoring.

As part of the indictment, the special counsel’s office is seeking forfeiture of four of Manafort’s properties in connection with money laundering charges.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on Saturday.

Manafort, 68, in the filing also explained why he had three different U.S. passports, a fact noted by prosecutors. Manafort’s lawyer, Kevin Downing, rejected suggestions that Manafort was a “Jason Bourne character” - referencing a fictitious, globe-trotting, rogue covert agent.

“The facts are much more mundane,” Downing wrote.

Manafort had two passports, including one for submitting to foreign governments to receive visas while traveling on the other, his lawyers said. He was issued a third passport because one had been lost and Manafort contacted passport services to advise them it was found.

Downing also wrote that funds Manafort had deposited in accounts on the island of Cyprus were legal and now had only “nominal” balances. Prosecutors said Manafort and Gates used numerous entities to transmit more than $18 million from Ukraine through Cyprus and eventually to the United States.

Federal prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday that Manafort’s financial assets were substantial, but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from $19 million to $136 million.

Florent Geroux piloted the four-year-old colt to a 2 1/4 lengths, wire-to-wire victory over hard-charging second place finisher Collected in front of a packed grandstand to win America’s richest race.

“(I thought) he was going too fast but when I saw him pulling away, it was an unbelievable feeling,” Gun Runner owner Ron Winchell said.

Up and coming three-year-old colt West Coast finished third with Arrogate fifth behind War Story.

Gun Runner’s Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen said he and jockey Geroux wanted to stick to the same game plan that propelled the striking chestnut horse to five wins in his last six starts.

“We wanted him away from the gates cleanly and into a nice rhythm,” said Asmussen, who now has six Breeders’ Cup wins, including two Classics, to his name.

“The confidence that Florent has in the horse, the way the horse has been training coming into this race, I think letting him be who he is has put him on this stage and made him undoubtedly the Horse of the Year.”

The 34th running of the Classic played out in front of 37,692 horseracing enthusiasts on a sunny and windy day at picturesque track in Southern California.

Arrogate had hoped to join 2000 and 2001 Classic champion Tiznow as the only other back-to-back winner of the race, but it was not to be.

“It’s just really disappointing to see him go out like that because we know how great he is. At the same time, he has given us the biggest thrills in racing and I just feel sorry for the horse.”

Arrogate jockey Mike Smith said he did not think Arrogate, who has lost three straight races in Del Mar, showed his best form on the oceanside racetrack, which is known for its tight corners and firm, fast turf.

On Thursday, the Bank added 25 basis points to borrowing costs, taking them to 0.50 percent, and many economists polled after the announcement have come around to thinking that Thursday’s hike was justified.

Unlike other major central banks, the Bank is facing inflation running well above target, due mainly to the fall in sterling after last year’s Brexit vote. But it expects inflation to peak at 3.2 percent in October. The Bank’s target is 2 percent.

Policymakers expect only “very gradual” further increases as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. Thursday’s hike will be followed by just two more quarter-point increases over the next three years, according to the assumptions that underpinned the Bank’s latest economic forecasts.

BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Friday the Bank’s signal that it may need to raise interest rates two more times is “not a promise”.

Economists in the Reuters poll, taken after Thursday’s announcement, took the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee at its word on gradual rate hikes. Their median forecast was for the next 25 basis-point rate increase not to come until the second quarter of 2019 - just after Britain is scheduled to leave the EU.

“Now that the MPC has taken the plunge on a rate rise, the question is whether this marks the beginning of a series of increases in borrowing costs, or if the Committee is now minded to stand pat for an extended period of time,” said Martin Beck, lead UK economist at Oxford Economics.

“We favour the latter prediction. It’s ‘one and done’ for now.”

Markets agreed: sterling GBP= extended its losses on Friday, slipping to a one-month low against the dollar as investors rushed to exit positions.

The U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have also taken a cautious approach as they attempt to wean their economies off massive stimulus programmes.

Bank Governor Mark Carney said Brexit talks were likely to be the biggest factor for the next BoE move, either up or down, yet none of the 51 economists polled had a cut in their forecasts and gave only a median 20 percent chance that Thursday’s decision would be reversed.

JUSTIFIED

In a Reuters poll taken ahead of the announcement, 34 of 48 economists said now was not the time for the central bank to be raising rates.

But in a reversal of largely the same sample, 27 of 46 said the Bank’s move was not a mistake, while 19 stuck to their original view.

“It was perfectly justified,” said Jacob Nell, chief UK economist at Morgan Stanley.

“Growth is running above potential and slack is being eroded, and once they had given that strong guidance in September and data in October came in stronger, it would have been much more of a shock and a surprise if it hadn’t delivered.”

Britain’s economy has slowed sharply this year as the jump in inflation has hurt household spending and the uncertainty about Brexit has weighed on investment by businesses.

A Reuters poll of economists last month showed that the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit has crept higher, and there was a 30 percent chance Britain would leave the EU without a trade deal when two-year divorce talks end in March 2019.

Prime Minister Theresa May faces a political balancing act as she tries to meet EU demands for more concrete pledges on Britain’s divorce bill without triggering a backlash from Brexit campaigners at home, some of whom would prefer that she walked away from the talks.","Bank of England hike was a 'one and done', next move not until second quarter 2019 - Reuters poll",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-boe-rates-poll/bank-of-england-hike-was-a-one-and-done-next-move-not-until-second-quarter-2019-reuters-poll-idUKKBN1D31IC

FILE PHOTO - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire attends a news conference about a report on French economy at the Bercy Finance ministry in Paris, France, September 14, 2017. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer

French and German officials confirmed Le Maire would be in Berlin on Wednesday, when he will meet acting Finance Minister Peter Altmaier, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Le Maire is also due to see Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), and Cem Oezdemir, co-leader of the Greens party. Both are in discussions with Merkel’s conservatives on forming a coalition government.

France’s Emmanuel Macron has made euro zone reform a central goal of his five-year presidency. But any changes will require the support of Merkel and her new government, which is not expected to be in place before Christmas. Lindner has been critical of Macron’s idea to create a budget for the euro zone.

“We want to follow up on the president’s Sorbonne speech and exchange views on the future of the euro zone,” a French finance ministry official said, referring to a speech by Macron in September when he laid out his vision for EU reform.

While Le Maire’s visit - his first to Berlin since the German election - is about strengthening contacts with likely members of the new government, officials indicated that it would also be an opportunity to sound out Berlin on the Eurogroup presidency, a powerful position that will be elected next month.

Since it was created in 2005, the Eurogroup, which brings together the euro zone’s 19 finance ministers, has had only two presidents: Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who served from 2005 to 2013, and former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is due to step down in January.

The position involves chairing monthly meetings and driving policy around economic and monetary union, including ensuring that all member states stick to strict targets on deficits and debt. The post has been dubbed “Mr Euro”.

“NO NATURAL CANDIDATE”

Le Maire, 48, is regarded as sharp, ambitious and more than capable of leading the group. But some euro zone officials are wary about the presidency ending up in the hands of either Germany or France, the two largest economies in the single currency bloc and already dominant forces in policymaking.

A further complication for Le Maire is France’s poor record of meeting its own deficit targets over the past decade. German officials are not ruling out Le Maire, but they have also expressed a preference for giving the post to a smaller country.

Last week, one official in Berlin mentioned two possible alternatives: Pierre Gramegna of Luxembourg and Peter Kazimir of Slovakia. The official also floated the idea of extending Dijsselbloem, seen as a close ally of Berlin, even though he is not part of the new Dutch government.

“It is still quite unclear who will come forward,” the German official said when asked about the presidency. “At this stage there does not seem to be one candidate everyone is rallying behind. There is no natural candidate.”

The Eurogroup president will be chosen on Dec. 4, an EU official said last week, with the formal call for candidates opening in mid-November.

“It is not a done thing,” the German official said of Le Maire’s candidacy. “He will only apply if he gets the impression that he is the one.”

The talks in Berlin on Wednesday could be decisive in determining whether he does throw his hat into the ring.

If Le Maire were to get the job, it could have repercussions for other top euro zone jobs. Mario Draghi will end his term as president of the European Central Bank on Oct. 31, 2019, and Germany’s Jens Weidmann is already being mentioned as a potential successor.

Euro zone watchers say that if the French secure the presidency of the Eurogroup, it may be harder for them to argue against a German candidate taking over the ECB.

Still, as one senior French official told Reuters on condition of anonymity last month, Weidmann at the helm of the ECB “would be a problem for a lot of countries, not just for France”.",France's Le Maire heads to Berlin to test Eurogroup waters,https://www.reuters.com/article/france-germany-lemaire/frances-le-maire-heads-to-berlin-to-test-eurogroup-waters-idINKBN1D50UM?il=0

T-Mobile, under charismatic CEO John Legere, keeps hitting home runs, already reporting it that added 1.3 million net customers in the third quarter - the 18th time in a row it has achieved the feat.

T-Mobile reported revenues in the third quarter that topped $10 billion for the first time, up 8 percent.

The picture for Deutsche Telekom group on Thursday is likely to be different, with analysts on average forecasting group revenues of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion) - a year-on-year gain of just 1.6 percent.

That would reflect barely positive growth in Telekom’s crowded and heavily regulated home market, where sales rose just 0.4 percent in the first half, and at its European holdings that were ahead by just 1.5 percent.

Deutsche Telekom, which has toyed with options for its U.S. business for years, put a brave face on the unraveling of the deal on Saturday night, saying T-Mobile would continue its successful growth strategy.

“We supported our American subsidiary to invest more than $40 billion over the last years, thus building a basis for strong growth in the upcoming years,” CEO Tim Hoettges said.

HOME AND AWAY

But some investors wonder whether the best years may now be behind T-Mobile, whose shares have risen ninefold from the low they hit after the global financial crisis to a peak of $68 in June.

“I’d just love them to sell it,” one UK-based fund manager who holds Deutsche Telekom stock said last week as reports surfaced that the T-Mobile-Sprint talks were in trouble.

At T-Mobile’s latest share price, Deutsche Telekom’s 64 percent stake would be worth $31 billion.

“There’s a tendency to run things for ever, sometimes, and then you end up selling at the wrong times,” the fund manager added.

Together, T-Mobile and Sprint would have had about 130 million customers, putting a merged entity a close third in the United States behind market leaders AT&T and Verizon.

Alone, T-Mobile has 70.7 million customers, requiring a lot more good quarters to close the gap on its own.

Lacking sufficient scale and running a mobile-first strategy, T-Mobile may face challenges if Sprint, controlled by Japan’s Softbank Group, revives its efforts to hook up with a U.S. cable firm, according to a top-10 Telekom shareholder.

An approach by Softbank chief Masayoshi Son was rebuffed in July by Charter Communications.

They also display the weaknesses, present and future, of the two leaders of the contending parties: Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister and Carles Puigdemont, president of Catalonia.

The declaration of independence made by Catalonia’s parliament a week ago was constitutionally illegal. Shots of huge pro-independence rallies obscure the fact that, in an opinion poll in the summer, 49.4 per cent opposed breaking away from Spain while 41.1 per cent supported it. Unionists have held their own large rallies and a new poll in El Mundo shows their parties with a slight polling lead in the December Catalan elections.

The parliamentary vote for independence – taken in a half-full chamber after the anti-independence parties left in protest – was swiftly followed by Rajoy, fully backed by his parliament and senate, ordering the parliament’s dissolution and the sacking of Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels. Nine of his colleagues in the Catalan leadership were accused in Spain’s high court on Thursday of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, eight of whom were detained in custody. Puigdemont has said he will return, but only if given guarantees of a fair trial.

Strong support in the rest of Spain for a hard line against Catalonian independence masks a longer-term problem for Rajoy and his country. The prime minister heads a minority government, unable to find a stable coalition partner. In July, Rajoy became the first serving prime minister to testify in court, denying allegations that he was complicit in a wide-ranging corruption scandal in his center-right Peoples’ Party, investigations of which have dragged on over the past two decades. Rajoy himself has not been charged.

Thus a national leader with a weakened base faces Puigdemont, a regional leader who has weakened his own base by flight. Puigdemont may not be the man to lead Catalonia to independence, and it may not presently be in the cards. But it will remain a strong current in Catalan politics and is indicative of the larger problems within the EU that threaten the integrity of the Union at least as much as Brexit.

In country after European country, the trend away from the center continues and presently grows. As the Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor observes, most nationalisms are not only championed by aggressively right-wing leaderships and parties mobilizing a largely working or lower middle-class electorate fed up with being left behind. “Another trend to watch ought to be the impatient regionalism of more metropolitan parts of Europe, frustrated by the backward politics of their nation-states,” writes Tharoor.

The rich defectors are led by Catalonia, Spain’s most productive region and the one with the strongest independence movement. Catalan separatists argued that paying less in taxes to the Spanish government would be an economic boon to the province. But others now show signs of wishing to join, or at least look at the entrance fees, of the wealthy breakaway club. Most surprising – since it is part of the relatively successful German economy – is the southern state of Bavaria: in July, a poll for the popular tabloid Bild showed one in three favors independence.

Last month, the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the two richest of Italy’s 20 regions, accounting between them for some 30 per cent of the nation’s GDP, voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy. The Liga party, strong in the area, had a policy of independence. That’s now moderated, but there’s growing dissatisfaction that the region’s taxes are poured into the much poorer, much less productive south. The division amounts to two separate economies, a problem which feeds northern separatism.

Even in Belgium, the administrative heart of the EU, the tensions are showing. The divided reaction to Puigdemont in Brussels – with a Flemish nationalist cabinet minister welcoming him, while the prime minister, from the French-speaking Walloon area showed a cold face – was a glimpse into the fractured politics of the Belgian state. The center has given away much of its power to the two main regions in an effort to avoid a complete split – and will be pressed by the richer Flemish region to do still more after national elections in 2019, to the point where the central state will cease to exist.

Scotland, whose devolved parliament is dominated by the Scottish nationalists, has seen a dimming of enthusiasm for independence as its offshore oil reserves and the income from them have ceased to promise a wealthy future, as even its own economic commission has admitted. A botched Brexit, however, could revive the movement among a population which voted decisively for remaining in the EU. France, where the economy is reviving, still has independence movements in the island of Corsica (where nationalists now control the regional assembly) and the western region of Brittany, where support is still a minority pursuit, but growing. (Brittany and Corsica have roughly average per capita GDPs for France; their independence movements are more cultural than economic – though all nationalist movements invoke some cultural difference, often rooted in centuries’ old histories.)

The EU cannot look on these movements with anything but disfavor and alarm. Though the rich breakaways would – as Catalonia does – wish to remain in the EU, a general exodus would face the union with its largest crisis yet. Were a region to succeed in forming a viable independent state, it would be required to apply for membership. Its application would not be considered until all legal and territorial issues had been settled with the country of which it had been a part – a process which might consume a decade until the application was successful.

The widespread distrust of mainstream politicians and central governments, and the conviction that local populists would do a better job, now takes a concrete and threatening form. Nationalism, which the EU had wished to see fade, even die, now instead revives, sometimes – as in Central Europe – in illiberal, even authoritarian, forms.

The EU is less and less seen as an ideal, a borderless federation-in-the-making. Its processes – remote, intricate and little understood – lose out when contrasted with the warmth and intimacy of a new-old country which can draw on its history and culture, keep out unwanted immigrants and restore pride and trust. Such is the promise of many of the new nationalisms: the EU can disapprove, but in its still-fragile state can do little except to hope that the nationalist tide will retreat. For the moment, it’s still rising.",Commentary: How the Catalonia vote threatens the EU,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-catalonia-commentary/commentary-how-the-catalonia-vote-threatens-the-eu-idUKKBN1D31U1

It is the first such attack since the central government in Baghdad seized the oil-rich city last month from Kurdish forces, who had been controlling Kirkuk for three years.

The central government in Baghdad launched an offensive on Oct. 16 to recapture the city and other territories in northern Iraq claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurds, in retaliation for a referendum on Kurdish independence.

Iraqi security forces advanced on the city, forcing the Kurdish Peshmerga to withdraw. The retreat also allowed Baghdad to take control of all oil fields operated by the state-owned North Oil Company in Kirkuk’s northern province.

No group has claimed responsibility for Sunday’s attacks but the suicide bombings are a trademark of Islamic State militants.

Police sources said the two attacks happened in quick succession and said the death toll might rise because some of the wounded were in critical condition.

“It’s a crowded street and a place for street vendors. The terrorists wanted to kill large number of people,” said a Kirkuk police major.

Hariri left Lebanon for Saudi Arabia on Friday and resigned on Saturday in a televised statement that took the Lebanese political establishment by surprise.

He cited an assassination plot against him and criticized the regional role of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah however Lebanon’s army said on Sunday it had not uncovered any plot.

The move has thrust Lebanon back into the arena of regional rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, an ally of Hariri, and Shi‘ite Muslim Iran, which backs Hezbollah.

President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, will wait to accept or reject Hariri’s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to explain his reasons, sources at the presidential palace said.

Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat cited unnamed sources close to Hariri as speculating that he would probably remain outside Lebanon because of the security threat against him.

Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh sought to calm fears the political turmoil unleashed by Hariri’s bid to resign would hit Lebanon’s already fragile economy, issuing a statement to reaffirm the stability of its currency, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar.

In Lebanon’s sectarian system the president must be a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shi‘ite. Hariri is Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

His father, Rafik al-Hariri, was prime minister after Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war and was assassinated in a car bombing in 2005.

A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted five Hezbollah members for the killing but the group denies any involvement.

Saudi media have published reports of a plot to assassinate Hariri in recent days, but all of Lebanon’s main security branches have said they have no information about such a plot.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Democratic Republic of Congo army spokesman for South Kivu province, Dieudonne Kasereka, said clashes had started after police came to disarm Colonel Abbas Kayonga, who was sacked on Thursday from his post overseeing anti-fraud efforts in local mines.

Kayonga, a former rebel from a group that had been disarmed and integrated into the Congolese military, gave himself up at the local base for the U.N. mission to Congo.

“He has just surrendered with 17 people at the base of the mission,” Kasereka said by telephone. Two army soldiers and three of Kanyonga’s bodyguards were killed in the fighting and two civilians were killed by stray bullets, he said.

Seventeen members of Kanyonga’s force surrendered to U.N. troops and nine others were captured by the army, Kasereka said, adding that soldiers found about a dozen heavy weapons at Kanyonga’s house.

Security has been deteriorating across Congo since the end of last year, when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down despite his mandate expiring.

Surging militia violence in the east, which has for decades been a tinderbox of ethnic rivalries fueled by the region’s mineral wealth, and in the formerly peaceful central Kasai region, have raised fears the country could slip back to the multi-faceted civil wars of the turn of the century.

Those wars killed hundreds of thousands directly in violence while millions of others are thought to have died from of hunger and disease.

South Kivu has rich deposits of gold, tin and coltan, used in mobile phones, which have long helped finance rebel groups and army officers.

The national electoral commission was expected to announce a date for the election to replace Kabila later on Sunday. Last month, it said the election cannot take place until April 2019, raising fears of an escalation in militia violence and civil disturbances.

U.S. envoy Nikki Haley said during a visit to meet with Kabila last month that the vote must happen in 2018 or it will lose international support.","Renegade colonel surrenders in eastern Congo after clashes, seven dead",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-congo-violence/renegade-colonel-surrenders-in-eastern-congo-after-clashes-seven-dead-idUKKBN1D50HE?il=0

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Pocos en las calles entendieron realmente el anuncio hecho esta semana por el impopular presidente izquierdista Nicolás Maduro de que buscaría refinanciar la fuerte carga de bonos de la nación petrolera de unos 60.000 millones de dólares, cerca de 2.000 dólares por habitante.

Pero varios venezolanos entrevistados por Reuters dijeron que esperan que cualquier acuerdo entre el Gobierno y sus acreedores extranjeros libere divisas para aumentar las importaciones de alimentos, medicinas y productos básicos que en la actualidad escasean.

“De repente funciona, para que mejore el país”, dijo Johny Vargas, un trabajador de la construcción de 53 años, quien sostuvo que a menudo sólo come dos veces al día porque su salario se diluye por los aumentos de los precios. “Todo está caro. No hay comida, no hay nada. Maduro no sirve, mira como está el país”.

Hasta ahora, el gobernante Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) ha priorizado los pagos de la deuda recortando las importaciones, agravando cuatro años de recesión y escasez.

Si se llega a una renegociación de deuda podría liberar más dinero en el corto plazo para que el Gobierno compre alimentos básicos y medicamentos, la principal demanda en las calles.

Pero Wall Street es escéptico, al igual que muchos venezolanos.

“No podemos tener una buena negociación. No tenemos la credibilidad como para sentarnos y pedir”, dijo Mayerling Delgado, una contadora de 35 años, refiriéndose a las tensas relaciones con las potencias occidentales e incluso con varios países latinoamericanos.

“Entonces, sí hay que pagar”, agregó en un tono resignado en una concurrida plaza de Caracas.

Expertos alertaron durante mucho tiempo que la deuda acumulada por el fallecido Hugo Chávez era insostenible e instaron al Gobierno de Maduro a que refinanciara sus pesados compromisos.

Pero llevar a cabo tal operación ahora es casi imposible debido al caos económico de Venezuela, la falta de tecnócratas en el Gobierno, y especialmente, las sanciones que prohíben a los bancos estadounidenses participar de nuevos acuerdos de deuda venezolana o negociarlos.

NO PAGAR, ¿ES PEOR?

La mayoría de los venezolanos se resisten a la idea de un incumplimiento de deuda, lo que desencadenaría demandas de los acreedores que buscan quedarse con activos como refinerías en Estados Unidos. Eso podría hundir a la nación miembro de la OPEP, de 30 millones de habitantes, en dificultades aún peores.

“Consistentemente la población mayoritaria percibe que un default es una acción negativa que puede complicar la economía del país”, dijo el economista Luis Vicente León, de la encuestadora local Datanálisis.

Pero como muchos analistas ven un incumplimiento de pagos como algo inevitable, dado al estado lamentable de las finanzas de Venezuela, algunos creen que sería mejor pasar el trago amargo.

The size of the purge - 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers were detained by a newly created anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - raised questions about the stability and predictability of the Saudi government.

For foreigners, a major shock was the detention of flamboyant billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who as a big investor in top Western companies such as Citigroup (C.N) is known as the international face of Saudi business.

Local investors, meanwhile, worried about whether a sustained investigation into corruption could turn up scandals in the kingdom’s opaque business world, forcing people implicated to sell off their equity holdings.

But many bankers and analysts saw the purge, which replaced the head of the National Guard, as a power grab by Prince Mohammed, designed to remove any remaining obstacles to his authority and assure his eventual succession to the throne.

This, they said, could help the economy by making it easier for Prince Mohammed to pursue radical reforms that include slashing the state budget deficit, putting more women into employment, lifting a ban on women driving, and selling $300 billion of state assets.

“This is the latest act of concentration of power in Saudi,” said Hasnain Malik, global head of equity research at emerging markets investment bank Exotix.

”As unprecedented and controversial as it may be, this centralisation might also be a necessary condition for pushing the austerity and transformation agenda, the benefits of which very few investors are pricing in.”

After initially tumbling as much as 2.2 percent on Sunday, the Saudi stock index .TASI rebounded to close slightly higher. Shares related to some of the detained people, such as Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, sank but most banks rose, a sign of economic optimism.

INSTABILITY

The purge may increase Prince Mohammed’s grassroots support by tackling corruption, a problem that has long plagued the economy.

“It’s a populist move that makes sense because a lot of the princes, businessmen and bureaucrats are corrupt, taking kickbacks and being involved in all kinds of shady deals,” said Bernard Haykel, professor of Near East studies at Princeton University.

A danger for financial markets, however, is that Prince Mohammed is shaking up business practices and ties that have lasted for decades, a move which could backfire if it triggers an exodus of money and wealthy individuals from the country.

“The fact that some of the country’s leading business people were arrested will scare the private sector and there might be even more capital flight than before. And most bureaucrats will now be terrified, perhaps justifiably,” Haykel said.

Many corporate executives expect Prince Mohammed to persuade or pressure rich Saudis to repatriate some of the billions of dollars which they are believed to have transferred overseas for safe-keeping, and which could now help to kick-start the development projects that he plans.

The corruption crackdown may be an initial step in this effort; the decree creating the committee gave it the right, pending the result of investigations, to seize assets at home or abroad and transfer them to the state Treasury.

James Dorsey, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, wrote that Prince Mohammed appeared to be reacting to growing opposition within the royal family and the military to his reforms and Riyadh’s military intervention in Yemen.

“It raises questions about the reform process that increasingly is based on a unilateral rather than a consensual rewriting of the kingdom’s social contract.”

For many people, however, a unilateral approach is seen as the best chance to push through the reforms. A chief economist at a big regional bank said Prince Mohammed’s main motive for acting was frustration that reforms were not moving fast enough.

The privatisation programme, for example, including the planned sale of 5 percent of national oil giant Saudi Aramco, has been discussed for many months with little action. Now the programme may pick up.

“The message this should send to foreign investors is it’s unwise to bet against MbS,” said Sam Blatteis, chief executive of regional advisory firm The MENA Catalysts, using a common abbreviation of Prince Mohammed’s name.

“When he wants to get things done, he has proven that he can. This is not a consolidation of power, it’s an acceleration. The wheels of policy-making are moving faster.”",Saudi purge worries investors but may speed reforms,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-arrests-economy/saudi-purge-worries-investors-but-may-speed-reforms-idUKKBN1D50RG?il=0

News about the initiative, first flagged a year ago, had been long anticipated as governments push for improvements in infrastructure that would encourage drivers to switch to electric cars.

IONITY, a joint venture of BMW AG (BMWG.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) with its Audi (NSUG.DE) and Porsche brands, plans to open 20 stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway and Austria. They will be 120 km (75 miles) apart and run in partnership with Tank & Rast [LINDOTA.UL], Circle K and OMV (OMVV.VI).

“The first pan-European HPC network plays an essential role in establishing a market for electric vehicles,” IONITY’s CEO Michael Hajesch said on Friday. He added that the fast-charging stations would also offer digital-payment capability.

IONITY is still in talks with charging station suppliers and a decision is expected soon, a spokeswoman said, declining to say how much the joint venture would invest.

Installing thousands of High-Power Charging (HPC) stations across the globe will require billions of dollars in investment and offer an opportunity to manufacturers. The car consortium’s new fast chargers will cost about 200,000 euros (£178,385) each, sources said previously.

Companies ranging from engineering conglomerates such as Siemens (SIEGn.DE) to small specialists like ChargePoint are all hoping for a slice of the pie.

IONITY will expand its network to 100 stations in 2018, each one enabling several drivers of different car brands to charge their vehicles at the same time.

Anxiety over whether battery-powered cars have the range to reach their destination is inhibiting some drivers from switching from petrol or diesel models.

But with U.S. all-electric challenger Tesla stealing a lead, established brands are teaming up to ensure that electric vehicles (EVs) can get quickly back on the road.

Each charging point will have a capacity of 350 kW, and will use an existing European standard, the Combined Charging System, to reduce charging times compared to existing systems.

A half-hour charge will give a Tesla driver about 270 km in extra driving range - roughly half the time it would take to get a similar boost at a 50 kW charge point that is now the industry standard.",Carmakers plan 400 Europe car charging stations by 2020,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-electricity-autos-charging/carmakers-plan-400-europe-car-charging-stations-by-2020-idUKKBN1D30GW

Uber and Waymo, rivals in the development of autonomous car technology, have been fighting in court since earlier this year about whether Uber benefited from trade secrets and other intellectual property allegedly stolen by former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski. Trial is set for early December.

U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup late on Thursday issued an order excluding Waymo’s damages expert, Michael Wagner, from the case and restricting use of financial evidence at trial and denying other relief, according to a docket entry.

The docket summarizes the decision, but the details are under seal until later on Friday.

University of Florida law professor Elizabeth Rowe said it was a setback for Waymo to have its damages expert excluded, but noted there were still ways to include the information, were the scope of the exclusion limited to the one person.

In a statement, Waymo said the company could still pursue full damages using “the same documents” relied upon by their expert.

Uber described the ruling on the expert as a sign of success, together with Alsup’s exclusion of Otto Trucking as a defendant in the case. Levandowski is the primary shareholder of Otto Trucking.

“Waymo’s case continues to shrink,” the ride-services company said in a statement.

Alsup recently agreed to Waymo’s request to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that Levandowski - the former head of Uber’s self-driving effort who was previously at Waymo - downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving Waymo to set up a self-driving truck startup company that Uber then acquired.

Waymo in settlement talks had sought at least $1 billion from Uber, which rejected that and other terms as non-starters, sources previously told Reuters.

First Secretary of State Damian Green said the claims by a former senior police officer in a Sunday newspaper were “completely untrue” and “political smears.”

“This story is completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source,” Green said in a statement on his Twitter page. The claims amount to “little more than an unscrupulous character assassination,” he said.

The Sunday Times reported on its front page that former Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Bob Quick alleged the material was discovered by officers during an inquiry into government leaks in 2008.

Quick, who was involved in the leak investigation, told the newspaper that officers had reported finding the “extreme” pornography on a parliamentary computer from Green’s office.

The claims against one of the prime minister’s closest allies risks deepening a growing sexual harassment scandal that led Britain’s defense minister Michael Fallon to resign last Wednesday.

Fallon said his behavior has “fallen short” of the standards expected by the British military.

May’s minority government is already struggling with divisions over Britain’s departure from the European Union.

Britain’s interior minister Amber Rudd said the issue would be investigated by the Cabinet Office on Monday and she denied the government was on the verge of collapse if Green resigned.

Rudd said Britain needed to address allegations of sexual harassment in the corridors of power.

“It is something that will take place, in terms of clearing out Westminster of that sort of behavior, and Westminster, including the government, will be better off after it,” she said.

Green, 61, has also denied a previous allegation that he made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.",Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid: sources,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-plans-record-tech-deal-with-qualcomm-bid-sources-idUSKBN1D324K?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan/File Photo

Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro-Russia former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich between 2006 and 2015 and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies, partnerships and bank accounts.

In a court filing on Thursday, Manafort defense lawyer Kevin Downing said the money laundering count, the most serious facing his client with a 20-year maximum sentence, was based on a “tenuous legal theory” tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former Ukrainian leader.

Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment.

The language of the filing and defiant statements Downing made outside the courthouse following Manafort’s arraignment on Monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges, the first to be made public from Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The Kremlin has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on Monday.

Downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant, according to an additional filing on Friday. Manafort’s Virginia home was raided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents over the summer.

The money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of “specified unlawful activity.” According to the Manafort indictment, the unlawful activity was his violation of the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA).

Though the money laundering statute includes FARA violations, Seattle tax lawyer John Colvin said the charge against Manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases.

“It doesn’t fit the normal paradigm” of money-laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking, Colvin said. “It seems like a stretch to me.”

FEW FARA PROSECUTIONS

Downing said in his Thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating FARA in the last 50 years, producing only one conviction.

By pointing out the lack of previous FARA prosecutions, former federal prosecutor Mark Lee, now a white-collar defense lawyer in Philadelphia, said Downing was likely trying to suggest Manafort may not even have known he was violating the law. The section cited by Mueller requires the FARA violation to be “knowing and willful.”

Successfully casting doubt on whether Manafort intentionally violated FARA could knock out the money laundering charge, Lee said.

“If you don’t have a (specific unlawful activity), you can’t by definition have a laundering,” said Lee.

Former federal prosecutor Michael Padula, now a Miami defense lawyer, said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to “promote” an ongoing criminal enterprise. That may be hard to show in the Manafort case, where the proceeds went to purchase real estate, expensive suits and Range Rovers for the conspirator’s personal use.

But other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding FARA would gain much traction.

“The idea that somebody of Mr. Manafort’s background and sophistication would not understand that, if he did what he is alleged to have done, he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government, is, I think, laughable,” said Chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter.

Several lawyers noted that, even without the money laundering counts, Mueller had strong charges based on the failure of Manafort and Gates to report their overseas accounts to the Internal Revenue Service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence. They also pointed out that Mueller could add more charges at a later date.

“It’s an argument, not a get out of jail free card,” said Padula of Downing’s money laundering defense. “He’s still got a tough road ahead of him.”",Manafort money laundering charge in Russia probe may face challenges,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort-analysis/manafort-money-laundering-charge-in-russia-probe-may-face-challenges-idUSKBN1D401W

“In the face of what he deemed immediate threats against his security and personal wellbeing, he has requested the protection of Chile,” the statement late on Saturday read.

Critics say socialist President Nicolas Maduro has turned the OPEC nation into a dictatorship by rigging elections and jailing dissenters. His supporters say the 54-year-old successor to late leader Hugo Chavez is resisting a U.S.-backed push to oust him.

Malong - the man who has led President Salva Kiir’s campaign against rebels - has been under house arrest since May after Kiir sacked him following a string of military resignations by senior generals alleging abuses and ethnic bias.

Malong had initially fled the capital Juba with a convoy of vehicles for his home state of Aweil following his dismissal - raising fears he might join opposition forces, before returning to the capital.

On Saturday, his wife Lucy Ayak told Reuters security officials arrived at their home late on Friday with “specific orders” from Kiir.

“They came carrying the order from the president and told General Malong that they had been ordered to disarm his bodyguards,” she said, adding that they also tried to take his phone and said his family members would not be allowed to visit.

“The government is thinking that General Malong might take the country back to war. The tension is still high ... we do not know if they might come back and arrest him by force if he resists.”

Residents in Juba told Reuters heavily-armed soldiers have blocked the main road leading to his house.

Media outlets from Juba also reported that a senior commander in the army who is allied with Malong has also defected with the aim of launching a rebellion.

May’s Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party are grappling with a slew of sexual harassment and abuse claims - many of them unsubstantiated - against British politicians.

The allegations have surfaced since the sexual abuse claims against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted women and men in British politics to share stories about alleged improper behavior.

One of May’s most loyal ministers, Michael Fallon, resigned as defense secretary on Wednesday. Fallon, who had admitted touching a radio presenter’s knee in 2002, said his past conduct had fallen below the required standard. He gave no details.

Separately on Saturday, a lawmaker from the Scottish National Party resigned from his cabinet post in the devolved Edinburgh administration after apologizing for what he described as “inappropriate” actions.

“Where I have believed myself to have been merely humorous or attempting to be friendly, my behavior might have made others uncomfortable or led them to question my intentions,” Mark McDonald, who represents Aberdeen Donside, said in a statement.

May set out the code of conduct for her party on Friday detailing standards and procedures expected of elected and appointed party members.

She lost her party’s majority in parliament with a botched bet on a snap election in June, so now has to rely on a small Northern Irish party to ensure she can pass legislation.

The elder Bush voted for Hillary Clinton, while his son voted for neither Trump nor his Democratic challenger, or ”none of the above,“ said Mark K. Updegrove, who wrote ”The Last Republicans” with the cooperation of the two Bushes. HarperCollins will publish the book on Nov. 14.

In an interview with the New York Times, Updegrove said the elder Bush, 93, who served as president from 1989 to 1993, had an instinctive dislike of Trump though he did not know him personally.

In an interview during the 2016 presidential campaign, George H.W. Bush told the author that Trump was a “blowhard,” driven by “a certain ego” and lacking a commitment to public service.

The younger Bush, 71, who served in the White House from 2001 to 2009, believed candidate Trump lacked both humility and a necessary understanding of the presidency, Updegrove said in previewing the book about the relationship between the Bushes, written with the cooperation of the father and son.

During the campaign, George W. Bush told the author that he feared he would turn out to be the last Republican elected president.

“At the time, I think he was concerned that Hillary Clinton would win,” Updegrove told the Times.

“But if you look at his values and those shared by his father and Ronald Reagan, they are very much in contrast to the values of the Republican Party today, in particular the platform that Donald Trump ran on, which is essentially protectionism and a certain xenophobia,” said Updegrove, a historian who has written several books about the presidency.

Updegrove could not be reached for further comment.

“The American people voted to elect an outsider who is capable of implementing real, positive, and needed change - instead of a lifelong politician beholden to special interests,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

”If they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won.”

Like many Americans, George W. Bush was surprised that Trump fared so well in last year’s Republican state primaries, where his brother Jeb, a former Florida governor, emerged as one of Trump’s most frequent targets.

During the campaign, the billionaire real estate developer, a political novice, promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington, a vow that extended to the Republican establishment, which the Bush family epitomized.

The book follows a rare speech by the younger Bush in which he delivered a sweeping yet thinly veiled critique of the Trump administration’s policies and the president’s blunt style.

The 43rd president decried “bullying and prejudice” in public life while defending open immigration and trade, two of the pillars of previous Republican administrations that have come under sustained attack by the new president.","Neither George Bush voted for Trump, book author tells New York Times",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-bush-book/neither-george-bush-voted-for-trump-book-author-tells-new-york-times-idUSKBN1D40TP

European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts.

Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries.

The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it.

Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package.

The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code.

Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business.

However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units.

Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs.

BLUNT INSTRUMENT

“Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

“I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee.

Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes.

As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018.

European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.

Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties.

“That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy.

He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.”

Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes.

The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law.

The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns.

The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week.

Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well.

There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.

It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said.

“You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?”

The 93-year-old Mugabe has held power in the southern African nation since independence from Britain in 1980 and consistently refused to anoint a successor. He argues that the ruling ZANU-PF party would choose his replacement if and when he decides to retire.

Grace Mugabe told a ZANU-PF rally in the second city of Bulawayo that the party would amend its constitution this month and the changes would be adopted at a special December congress to ensure that one of Mugabe’s two deputies would be a woman.

Allowing Mugabe to appoint a woman deputy could scuttle the presidential ambitions of Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who had been seen as a shoe-in to succeed Mugabe. Phelekezela Mphoko is the second Mugabe deputy, but lacks any political base.

Mnangagwa, nicknamed ‘Ngwena’ (Crocodile), has seen his political stock plummet in the last few months, on accusations by party rivals that he was plotting to get Mugabe to step down in his favor. He denies the accusation.

On Saturday Grace cranked up the pressure against Mnangagwa, calling him the “root cause of factionalism” that was gnawing at the ruling party. She also accused the vice president’s supporters of booing her while she gave her speech.

“Before that special congress, this November we need the constitution to be changed accordingly so that when we are going we will adopt the proposal that one of the vice presidents should be a woman,” Grace said in a speech broadcast on state TV.

“What if I get in (as vice president)? What’s wrong with that? Am I not in the party? If people know that I work hard and they want to work with me what is wrong with that?” Grace said.

A visibly angry Mugabe told the same rally that he and his wife were tired of constant insults from people who identified themselves as Mnangagwa’s supporters.","Mugabe set to appoint woman deputy, all eyes on wife",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D50AB-OZATP

At least Thomas Morel is hoping they will. He’s a 30-year-old former financier who saw how much Canadians liked the sport, or game, or pastime, or whatever axe-throwing might be.

“And I told myself, this is bound to work in Paris,” Morel said.

So he opened Les Cognees - French for “axes” or “hatchets” - where people can gather after work and pay to hurl heavy edged weapons around. What could go wrong?

Quite a lot, obviously, but safeguards are in place: no alcohol is served, the blades of the axes are blunted and security measures are read out to participants when they arrive.

And they are arriving. Morel’s venue is in the city’s north-east 18th district, a traditionally working-class neighborhood showing tentative signs of gentrification. On a typical day this week, it had attracted about 30 men and women in their mid-20s to mid-30s.

“It’s a real melting pot,” Morel said. “You get the young hipsters, you get companies on team-building, but you also get punks, you get mothers with children, you get families.”

DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement the 2020 nominating process would be “unquestionably fair and transparent.”

Perez made his comments after former DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile said in an opinion piece in Politico earlier this week that the nomination process had been “rigged” in Clinton’s favor after she signed a fundraising agreement with the DNC in 2015.

Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, beat Senator Bernie Sanders for the nomination but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump in November 2016.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, told CNN this week that Perez needed to assure Democrats, including supporters of Sanders, that the process was fair and she agreed that the 2016 nominating process was “rigged.”

Perez said he is “more committed than ever before to restoring voters’ faith in our democratic process because even the perception of impartiality or an unfair advantage undermines our ability to win. That is unacceptable.”

Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN this week he thought the debate schedule was “rigged.”

Perez said the party will “decide the debate schedule in advance, instead of negotiating it after all our candidates have entered the race” and “any and all joint fundraising agreements will be transparent.”

Leaked emails in 2016 suggested the party had actively favored Clinton over Sanders.

Former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook on Friday denied the nomination had been rigged in Clinton’s favor.

“Hillary Clinton won this primary with almost 4 million votes,” Mook told CNN. “The idea that the DNC could rig a contest frankly is laughable.”

Brazile, who replaced former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz last year after a furor over the contents of the leaked emails, also wrote she contemplated proposing to replace Clinton as the party’s 2016 presidential nominee, the Washington Post reported on Saturday.

The Post said she considered replacing Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden after Clinton fainted in September 2016.

In a soon-to-be published book, Brazile recounts deliberations as interim DNC chair whether to initiate the process of removing Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine, a Virginia senator, the Post reported, saying she ultimately did not seek to remove them.

DNC rules give the party’s chair the ability to call a special meeting to consider replacing a nominee in the event of the death, resignation or disability after a candidate has officially been nominated, but only the full DNC has the power to fill vacancies.

Fatou Bensouda said in a statement that there is a “reasonable basis to believe” war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed and that all sides in the conflict would be examined.

The prosecutor will focus on crimes allegedly committed since May 2003 on the territory of Afghanistan, and war crimes closely linked to the situation in Afghanistan allegedly committed since July 2002 on the territory of other states.

The prosecutor on Friday did not mention any specific parties to be investigated.

In a report last year, ICC prosecutors identified “potential cases” among three groups of alleged perpetrators: the Taliban and its affiliates, the Afghan authorities and members of the U.S. armed forces and Central Intelligence Agency.

There were preliminary grounds to believe U.S. forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan and at CIA detention facilities elsewhere in 2003 and 2004, it said.

The alleged atrocities took place in all 34 of Afghanistan’s provinces, with a smaller number of crimes alleged in Poland, Lithuania and Romania, where suspected members of the Taliban or Al Qaeda were held for questioning.

If authorized by the court’s judges, prosecutors will investigate “in an independent, impartial and objective way, crimes within the court’s jurisdiction allegedly committed by any party to the armed conflict.”

ULTIMATE FOCUS ON MOST SERIOUS CRIMES

“The ultimate focus will be upon those most responsible for the most serious crimes,” she said in the statement.

The ICC was established in 2002 as the world’s permanent court for prosecuting the most serious war crimes, including genocide.

It has the backing of the European Union and dozens of nations, but several of the world’s most powerful countries - notably the United States, Russia and China - never joined.

Former U.S. administrations first opposed the court’s establishment, citing fears that American service members would be targeted by politically-motivated prosecutions, but later backed ad hoc investigations.

A court of last resort, the ICC only steps in when a country’s government is found to be unwilling or unable to do so. ICC jurisdiction is limited to crimes committed on the territory of member states, or in cases referred to it by the U.N. Security Council, as happened with Sudan over alleged genocide in Darfur in 2005.

However, crimes committed on the soil of member states by soldiers of countries who are not members also fall under the court’s jurisdiction under international law.

If a state can show it has investigated and prosecuted the same crimes the ICC is looking into, it could avoid any case ending up in The Hague.

In a 2016 report on the preliminary examination of alleged crimes in Afghanistan, the prosecutor noted that while the U.S. Dept. of Justice has looked into allegations of ill treatment of CIA detainees in 2009-2011, the scope of the probe was limited and two cases did not result in a prosecution.",Prosecutor at war crimes court to seek investigation into Afghan conflict,https://www.reuters.com/article/icc-afghanistan/prosecutor-at-war-crimes-court-to-seek-investigation-into-afghan-conflict-idINKBN1D31GR

The deal would combine CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers and drugstore chains, with Aetna, one of the oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.

The companies have agreed that CVS will split its consideration for the deal between cash and CVS stock, a deal structure that would minimize tax liabilities for Aetna shareholders, the sources said.

A deal will probably value Aetna at significantly more than $200 per share, the sources said, adding that the companies will agree to an exact price closer to signing the deal in December.

The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Aetna declined to comment, while CVS did not respond to a request for comment.

Aetna shares rose as much as 6 percent on the news and ended trading up 2.7 percent on Friday at $176.99. They have risen over 10 percent since Oct. 26, when the Wall Street Journal first reported that CVS and Aetna were in merger talks.

CVS shares ended trading down 0.2 percent at $69.25, giving the company a market capitalization of $70 billion.

Healthcare consolidation has been a popular route for insurers and pharmacies, under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs.

Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers.

They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines in PBM formularies with low co-payments.

A tie-up with Aetna could give CVS more leverage in its price negotiations with drug makers.

The deal would follow years of major changes to the U.S. health insurance industry under former President Barack Obama, whose 2010 Affordable Care Act created new ground rules for how insurers operate and expanded insurance to 20 million more Americans.

Republican President Donald Trump has promised to turn back many of the Affordable Care Act’s facets, but Congress has not been able to agree on a repeal or a replacement. The lack of progress, along with Trump’s executive order to bring down healthcare costs, has created uncertainty for insurers as they head into 2018.","CVS, Aetna aim to finalize deal as early as December: sources",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs-health/cvs-aetna-aim-to-finalize-deal-as-early-as-december-sources-idUSKBN1D32A6

Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.","For the hundreds of thousands of marchers thronging the palace-lined streets of Barcelona on Sunday, there was only one answer to the question about where storied Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, really belonged. “Viva España,” they chanted, waving flags emblazoned with regal lions and banners that read “We are part of Spain!”

Just 36 hours earlier, the city had been filled with nearly as many rival activists − this time waving uni-starred flags, yelling “Viva la República Catalana!” to show their support for the Catalan Republic, the new, sovereign country theoretically created when Catalonia’s autonomous provincial government Friday controversially declared itself free of Spain.

In the time between the two marches, Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had dismissed Catalonia’s independence declaration as “null and void”; fired the Catalonia cabinet; dissolved Catalonia’s parliament; called new elections, and announced the central government was stepping in to oversee the regional authorities, which until Friday had held substantial powers of self-rule.

Rajoy’s action, declared Catalonia Vice President Oriol Junqueras, was a “coup d’état” directed by the “anti-democratic” prime minister in Madrid. “The president of the country is and will be Carles Puigdemont,” said Junqueras, referring to Catalonia’s regional president in a piece for the newspaper El Punt Avui. Junqueras is correct about one thing: a coup has indeed rattled this province. But the instigators aren't in Madrid. Despite appearing rigidly authoritarian, Rajoy has Spanish law, the courts, the national Senate, the king, and the 1978 constitution solidly backing his actions in lassoing runaway Catalonia back into Spain. It is not the Spanish government, but the separatists in Catalonia, where a July poll showed 41 percent wanted independence and 49 percent wanted to stay in Spain, who are undermining democracy in this land.

Junqueras, Puigdemont and their social media-savvy band of separatists, have leveraged historical grudges to create rancor and division, making a mockery of the very democracy they claim to desire by saying that it’s Spain, with elections, a healthy constitution, and a decentralized government, that is undemocratic.

Puigdemont, an avowed independence supporter and onetime-mayor of Girona, was an unelected appointee to the regional president’s seat in Jan. 2016, chosen by a parliamentary coalition that shared little but a desire for separatism. Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Filling their cabinet only with like-minded members, Puigdemont and Junqueras emphasized independence above all and promised a referendum on leaving Spain. However, Spain’s constitution, approved by 90 percent of Catalan voters in 1978, holds that the regions can only secede if all Spanish voters approve it. In spite of that, Puigdemont ignored Rajoy’s warnings and the Constitutional Court’s ruling that a vote on independence was unconstitutional and illegal.

For months, the separatist faction of the Barcelona-based government made misleading promises. An independent Catalonia would remain in the European Union, they said − even though the EU had said that declaring independence would effectively be resigning from the group. A report from the regional Ministry of Economy, headed by Junqueras, concluded that international investment would rise and wealthy Catalonia would remain economically viable despite warnings from major businesses that they’d move their headquarters, and perhaps relocate entirely if independence was declared.

Separatists riled up the populace with fervent rallies, where they claimed the national government in Madrid was robbing Catalonia, and depicting Catalans as victimized and oppressed. On Sept.7, the secessionist camp in parliament pushed through a bill on holding the referendum ignoring standard procedure, including discussion and advance notice it would be on the agenda. While 52 of the 135 parliamentarians left in disgust, the bill passed with 72 votes.

Puigdemont and Junqueras appeared to revel in the calls from Rajoy to drop the plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 1, perhaps realizing that any move from the national government would be seen as Goliath stomping on David. On that count, they were right. Instead of ignoring it, Madrid sent out national police to try to prevent the vote from taking place. The police were largely unsuccessful and their attempt short-lived, but the images of them battering doors, knocking down the elderly, dragging voters down stairs, pulling women by their hair and shooting at civilians with rubber bullets did more to alarm the world and rally support for the separatist call than any advertising campaign could have achieved. Later reports showed the number of injuries, initially thought to be over 800, had been exaggerated, as had some reports of victimization.

Missing in the dramatic imagery beamed worldwide was the fact that the disorganized vote was marred by more than violence: as Madrid tried to shut down voting stations, basic polling safeguards were overlooked and the Catalan government announced that regardless of registration, Catalans could cast ballots anywhere − creating the potential for repeat voting. Since voters had been warned by Madrid that the referendum was illegal, it was largely boycotted by those who wanted to stay in Spain; only some 2 million Catalans of 5 million-plus potential voters cast their ballots. Despite this low turnout and allegations of voter fraud, the Catalan government hailed the result as a 90 percent vote for independence.

After nearly four weeks of double-speak and canceled announcements about independence − during which over 1,000 businesses moved their headquarters outside Catalonia and tourism plummeted − Puigdemont referred the issue to the regional parliament, which held a secret ballot about it on Oct 27. Of the 135 parliamentarians, 70 wrote yes, 10 wrote no, and the rest stormed out. Many left Spanish flags on their empty chairs. Before the hour was out, Spain’s Senate in Madrid agreed to invoke the constitution’s never-before-used Article 155, giving Madrid the authority to suspend Catalonia’s government. Hours later, Rajoy announced that the central government was taking over.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Puigdemont slipped off to Brussels, where his Belgian lawyer says he will not return to Spain. Junqueras still wants to tackle the creation of his new republic, writing in a New York Times op-ed column published Wednesday that Catalonia would not retreat. “In a battle for self-determination and the recognition of rights, one does not win with the first punch,” he said.

It will be an uphill battle even in the unlikely event that the central government lets Junqueras stay in office. A new poll, just published in El Mundo, shows the number of Catalans supporting independence has dropped to 33 percent.

Government experts are to work on a “rule book” for the 2015 climate pact at the Nov. 6-17 annual meeting in Bonn, Germany. The accord seeks to end the fossil fuel era this century with a shift to wind, solar and other clean energies.

Trump once dismissed climate change as a Chinese hoax to harm the U.S. economy and said in June that he would pull out of the agreement and instead promote U.S. coal and oil. A formal U.S. withdrawal will take until 2020.

No other nation has followed his lead. U.S. influence is likely to wane compared to other big greenhouse emitters led by China, the European Union and India even though Washington will still have a place at the table in Bonn.

“The rest of the world, including all major emerging economies, has made it clear that it is committed to the Paris Agreement,” Maldives Environment Minister Thor Abraham, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (OASIS), told Reuters.

China, on track to beat its goal of a peak in carbon emissions in 2030, seems best placed to step up leadership of an agreement largely designed by Washington under former president Barack Obama, many delegates say.

The meeting “will be a great free advertisement for China,” one European environment minister said. And Beijing plans to launch a nationwide carbon market this year, albeit delayed from the first half.

“The results (in Bonn) will prove that this (Paris) process has certainly not stopped,” China’s top climate official, Xi Zhenhua, told a news conference last week. He expressed hopes that Washington will end up staying in the Paris pact.

Adding urgency, 2017 is set to be the second warmest on record, behind 2016, according to NASA. And 2017 has had weather extremes of hurricanes, floods and drought-fuelled wildfires.

Fiji will preside at the Bonn talks, the first small island nation to do so in more than two decades of U.N. climate negotiations. That may give OASIS, at risk from rising seas, unprecedented influence.

The Paris rule book, including details of how to measure and report emissions, is due to be in place by the end of 2018.

Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said governments will face a tougher test in coming years when they have to ratchet up national ambitions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The United Nations says average temperatures will rise about three degrees Celsius (5.4 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times by 2100 with existing policies, against a Paris goal of keeping them “well below” two degrees (3.6F), ideally 1.5 (2.7F).

And on Friday, U.S. scientists released a report saying it was “extremely likely” that human activities are the main source of warming, contradicting Trump’s views.

European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts.

Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries.

The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it.

Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package.

The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code.

Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business.

However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units.

Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs.

BLUNT INSTRUMENT

“Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

“I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee.

Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes.

As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018.

European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.

Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties.

“That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy.

He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.”

Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes.

The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law.

The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns.

The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week.

Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well.

There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.

It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said.

“You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?”

Saudi Arabia’s air defenses intercepted the missile,

bringing it down near the capital Riyadh’s airport on Saturday and it did not cause any casualties, state news agencies reported.

“A shot was just taken by Iran, in my opinion, at Saudi Arabia ... and our system knocked the missile out of the air” Trump told reporters on Air Force One en route to Tokyo.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.",Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-plans-record-tech-deal-with-qualcomm-bid-sources-idUSKBN1D324K

All are wanted by Madrid for actions related to the push for the region’s secession from Spain. Puigdemont has become the public face of that move for independence.

Other charges are the misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to the secessionist campaign, which has thrown Spain into a political crisis just as its economy has recovered from a sharp downturn and banking stress.

Madrid has taken over administrative control in Catalonia, until then an autonomous region, and called new elections on Dec 21.

Parties supporting Catalonia staying in Spain would divide seats but garner around 54 percent of the vote, the polls suggested.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium shortly after Madrid took control. On Sunday morning, Puigdemont and four of his former councillors presented themselves to police in Brussels.

A judge will hear the defendants case on Sunday afternoon and has until Monday morning to decide whether the formalities for the extradition request have been fulfilled.

According to a GAD3 survey of 1,233 people conducted between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 and published in La Vanguardia newspaper, pro-independence parties ERC, PDeCAT and CUP would take between 66 and 69 seats in the 135-seat parliament.

A second poll taken over the same period for the conservative newspaper La Razon echoed the GAD3 survey, showing pro-independence parties would capture the most votes though still fall just shy of a parliamentary majority with 65 seats.

Other seats would be generally divided between parties that support the region remaining as part of Spain, though they would run on separate tickets.

Voter participation, however, will rise to a record of 83 percent, the GAD3 poll showed.

POLITICIANS ON REMAND

Under the European arrest warrant system, the five defendants in Belgium can agree to an extradition order immediately or the judge can set bail or detain them. Belgian authorities have to inform their European counterparts if a European arrest warrant cannot be executed after 90 days.

On Saturday, Puigdemont - who PDeCAT said on Sunday would lead the party in the election - called for a united Catalan political front for independence from Spain and against the detention of his former members of government.

On Thursday, nine of his sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial.

One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was freed after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,035) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

According to the GAP3 survey, 59 percent believed legal action against Puigdemont was unjustified while 69.3 percent said the jailing of the Catalan politicians would give the independence cause a boost at the ballot box.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest the detentions.

The Catalonia issue has sent shockwaves across Europe, energizing regions with their own secessionist agenda while unnerving those fighting to keep the European Union from fracturing further.

Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon, a member of the Flemish nationalist and separatist party N-VA, criticized Spain’s handling of situation on Sunday, saying Madrid “went too far” in an interview with Belgian broadcaster VTM.

Madrid says the judiciary acts independently of the legislative arm of government while adding that Catalonia leaders acted outside the rule of law when organizing the vote and making the declaration of independence.

BACK TO THE START

A pro-secessionist rally in Barcelona on Sunday attracted just a few hundred people, a long way from the hundreds of thousands to join pro-independence marches in October. Many of those attending waved the regional flag and carried protest signs.

One protester, Antonia Aguilera, 63, said she was concerned the new elections would not be fair and would be manipulated by the Spanish government.

Her concerns echo the deep mistrust many Catalans have of politicians in Madrid that has deepened since the arrests and after the national police used truncheons and rubber bullets to thwart voting in the illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1.

“I‘m disgusted by it all. We knew they would react but not as strongly as they did,” she said, adding that she believed the pro-independence parties would win the December election.

Government experts are to work on a “rule book” for the 2015 climate pact at the Nov. 6-17 annual meeting in Bonn, Germany. The accord seeks to end the fossil fuel era this century with a shift to wind, solar and other clean energies.

Trump once dismissed climate change as a Chinese hoax to harm the U.S. economy and said in June that he would pull out of the agreement and instead promote U.S. coal and oil. A formal U.S. withdrawal will take until 2020.

No other nation has followed his lead. U.S. influence is likely to wane compared to other big greenhouse emitters led by China, the European Union and India even though Washington will still have a place at the table in Bonn.

“The rest of the world, including all major emerging economies, has made it clear that it is committed to the Paris Agreement,” Maldives Environment Minister Thor Abraham, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (OASIS), told Reuters.

China, on track to beat its goal of a peak in carbon emissions in 2030, seems best placed to step up leadership of an agreement largely designed by Washington under former president Barack Obama, many delegates say.

The meeting “will be a great free advertisement for China,” one European environment minister said. And Beijing plans to launch a nationwide carbon market this year, albeit delayed from the first half.

“The results (in Bonn) will prove that this (Paris) process has certainly not stopped,” China’s top climate official, Xi Zhenhua, told a news conference last week. He expressed hopes that Washington will end up staying in the Paris pact.

Adding urgency, 2017 is set to be the second warmest on record, behind 2016, according to NASA. And 2017 has had weather extremes of hurricanes, floods and drought-fuelled wildfires.

Fiji will preside at the Bonn talks, the first small island nation to do so in more than two decades of U.N. climate negotiations. That may give OASIS, at risk from rising seas, unprecedented influence.

The Paris rule book, including details of how to measure and report emissions, is due to be in place by the end of 2018.

Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said governments will face a tougher test in coming years when they have to ratchet up national ambitions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The United Nations says average temperatures will rise about three degrees Celsius (5.4 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times by 2100 with existing policies, against a Paris goal of keeping them “well below” two degrees (3.6F), ideally 1.5 (2.7F).

And on Friday, U.S. scientists released a report saying it was “extremely likely” that human activities are the main source of warming, contradicting Trump’s views.

DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement the 2020 nominating process would be “unquestionably fair and transparent.”

Perez made his comments after former DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile said in an opinion piece in Politico earlier this week that the nomination process had been “rigged” in Clinton’s favor after she signed a fundraising agreement with the DNC in 2015.

Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, beat Senator Bernie Sanders for the nomination but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump in November 2016.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, told CNN this week that Perez needed to assure Democrats, including supporters of Sanders, that the process was fair and she agreed that the 2016 nominating process was “rigged.”

Perez said he is “more committed than ever before to restoring voters’ faith in our democratic process because even the perception of impartiality or an unfair advantage undermines our ability to win. That is unacceptable.”

Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN this week he thought the debate schedule was “rigged.”

Perez said the party will “decide the debate schedule in advance, instead of negotiating it after all our candidates have entered the race” and “any and all joint fundraising agreements will be transparent.”

Leaked emails in 2016 suggested the party had actively favored Clinton over Sanders.

Former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook on Friday denied the nomination had been rigged in Clinton’s favor.

“Hillary Clinton won this primary with almost 4 million votes,” Mook told CNN. “The idea that the DNC could rig a contest frankly is laughable.”

Brazile, who replaced former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz last year after a furor over the contents of the leaked emails, also wrote she contemplated proposing to replace Clinton as the party’s 2016 presidential nominee, the Washington Post reported on Saturday.

The Post said she considered replacing Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden after Clinton fainted in September 2016.

In a soon-to-be published book, Brazile recounts deliberations as interim DNC chair whether to initiate the process of removing Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine, a Virginia senator, the Post reported, saying she ultimately did not seek to remove them.

DNC rules give the party’s chair the ability to call a special meeting to consider replacing a nominee in the event of the death, resignation or disability after a candidate has officially been nominated, but only the full DNC has the power to fill vacancies.

Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain and Canada issued a statement late on Friday critical of the detention of Ibrahim Metwaly, who was helping investigate the murder of Giulio Regeni. The PhD student’s body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital in 2016 showing signs of extensive torture.

An Egyptian Foreign Ministry statement said the German, Dutch and Italian ambassadors had been summoned and that procedures to summon the British and Canadian ambassadors were ongoing.

The ministry said the criticism from the five Western countries was ”a blatant and unacceptable interference in domestic affairs and the work of the judiciary.

“It is unfortunate that such a statement would be issued from countries that call for respecting rule of law and the principles of separation of powers,” it said.

Metwaly founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared four years ago.

He was taken by airport security in September while heading to Geneva to attend a U.N. conference on enforced disappearances, members of his group said.

They later said a state prosecutor had ordered his detention.

FILE PHOTO: Former Trump 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort leaves U.S. Federal Court after being arraigned on twelve federal charges in the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Washington, U.S. October 30, 2017. REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan/File Photo

Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro-Russia former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich between 2006 and 2015 and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies, partnerships and bank accounts.

In a court filing on Thursday, Manafort defense lawyer Kevin Downing said the money laundering count, the most serious facing his client with a 20-year maximum sentence, was based on a “tenuous legal theory” tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former Ukrainian leader.

Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment.

The language of the filing and defiant statements Downing made outside the courthouse following Manafort’s arraignment on Monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges, the first to be made public from Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The Kremlin has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on Monday.

Downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant, according to an additional filing on Friday. Manafort’s Virginia home was raided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents over the summer.

The money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of “specified unlawful activity.” According to the Manafort indictment, the unlawful activity was his violation of the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA).

Though the money laundering statute includes FARA violations, Seattle tax lawyer John Colvin said the charge against Manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases.

“It doesn’t fit the normal paradigm” of money-laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking, Colvin said. “It seems like a stretch to me.”

FEW FARA PROSECUTIONS

Downing said in his Thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating FARA in the last 50 years, producing only one conviction.

By pointing out the lack of previous FARA prosecutions, former federal prosecutor Mark Lee, now a white-collar defense lawyer in Philadelphia, said Downing was likely trying to suggest Manafort may not even have known he was violating the law. The section cited by Mueller requires the FARA violation to be “knowing and willful.”

Successfully casting doubt on whether Manafort intentionally violated FARA could knock out the money laundering charge, Lee said.

“If you don’t have a (specific unlawful activity), you can’t by definition have a laundering,” said Lee.

Former federal prosecutor Michael Padula, now a Miami defense lawyer, said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to “promote” an ongoing criminal enterprise. That may be hard to show in the Manafort case, where the proceeds went to purchase real estate, expensive suits and Range Rovers for the conspirator’s personal use.

But other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding FARA would gain much traction.

“The idea that somebody of Mr. Manafort’s background and sophistication would not understand that, if he did what he is alleged to have done, he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government, is, I think, laughable,” said Chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter.

Several lawyers noted that, even without the money laundering counts, Mueller had strong charges based on the failure of Manafort and Gates to report their overseas accounts to the Internal Revenue Service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence. They also pointed out that Mueller could add more charges at a later date.

“It’s an argument, not a get out of jail free card,” said Padula of Downing’s money laundering defense. “He’s still got a tough road ahead of him.”",Manafort money laundering charge in Russia probe may face challenges,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort-analysis/manafort-money-laundering-charge-in-russia-probe-may-face-challenges-idUSKBN1D401W?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

T-Mobile, under charismatic CEO John Legere, keeps hitting home runs, already reporting it that added 1.3 million net customers in the third quarter - the 18th time in a row it has achieved the feat.

T-Mobile reported revenues in the third quarter that topped $10 billion for the first time, up 8 percent.

The picture for Deutsche Telekom group on Thursday is likely to be different, with analysts on average forecasting group revenues of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion) - a year-on-year gain of just 1.6 percent.

That would reflect barely positive growth in Telekom’s crowded and heavily regulated home market, where sales rose just 0.4 percent in the first half, and at its European holdings that were ahead by just 1.5 percent.

Deutsche Telekom, which has toyed with options for its U.S. business for years, put a brave face on the unraveling of the deal on Saturday night, saying T-Mobile would continue its successful growth strategy.

“We supported our American subsidiary to invest more than $40 billion over the last years, thus building a basis for strong growth in the upcoming years,” CEO Tim Hoettges said.

Alone, T-Mobile has 70.7 million customers, requiring a lot more good quarters to close the gap on its own.

Lacking sufficient scale and running a mobile-first strategy, T-Mobile may face challenges if Sprint, controlled by Japan’s Softbank Group, revives its efforts to hook up with a U.S. cable firm, according to a top-10 Telekom shareholder.

An approach by Softbank chief Masayoshi Son was rebuffed in July by Charter Communications.

Rene Boucher, 59, of Bowling Green, Kentucky, was arrested and charged with one count of fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, the Kentucky State Police said in a statement on Saturday.

Paul and Boucher were acquaintances, said Jeremy Hodges, a state police spokesman, who declined to say what led to the incident.

Paul’s office said in a statement the former Republican presidential candidate “was blindsided and the victim of an assault. The assailant was arrested, and it is now a matter for the police. Senator Paul is fine.”

His office did not immediately respond to questions about the extent of any injuries the 54-year-old senator may have suffered or the circumstances of the incident.

Boucher was booked into the Warren County Regional Jail. He was released on Saturday after posting a $7,500 bond, Captain Chip Olney of the facility said by phone.

Boucher is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, Olney said. It was unclear if Boucher has an attorney, and he could not be reached for comment late on Saturday.

Paul, an ophthalmologist, dropped out of the race for president in February 2016 and successfully ran for re-election as a senator. In September, Paul opposed a partial repeal of healthcare reforms adopted under former Democratic President Barack Obama, angering President Donald Trump, a Republican.

The startup, which makes robots for the elderly, was the first Israeli investment for Toyota AI Ventures, a new $100 million fund investing in artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous mobility and data and cloud computing.

“We will see more involvement of Toyota in the Israeli market in the future,” said Jim Adler, managing director of California-based Toyota AI Ventures, which is part of the $1 billion Toyota Research Institute.

“There’s more in the pipeline,” he told Reuters during a visit to Israel, adding that technologies dealing with perception and prediction and planning were of particular interest to Toyota.

Perception technology enables a self-driving vehicle to understand the world around it while prediction and planning can help a car interpret situations such as whether a child at an intersection might try to cross at a red light.

“There’s a tremendous amount of innovation happening in Israel as cars become more produced by data,” said Adler, who is in the country meeting companies whose technologies interest Toyota.

Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Earlier this year Intel Corp bought autonomous vehicle firm Mobileye - one of Israel’s biggest tech companies - for $15.3 billion.

On Friday Germany’s Continental AG said it was buying Israel’s Argus Cyber Security, whose technology guards connected cars against hacking.

Toyota AI Ventures has made five investments and expects to invest in at least 20 companies worldwide.

Regarding its investment in Intuition Robotics - which plans to begin trials of its robots with older adults in their homes early next year - Adler said there were many common features between robotics and autonomous vehicles, which he referred to as “big robots with wheels”.

Japan’s population is aging, with 40 percent expected to be over 65 in 20 years, he said, and there will be demand for technologies that help the elderly stay in their homes, rather than have to move to assisted-living facilities.

“We think Toyota will have a role there,” he said.","Toyota seeks more investments in Israeli auto tech, robotics",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-tech-toyota/toyota-seeks-more-investments-in-israeli-auto-tech-robotics-idUKKBN1D50OI

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

His father, Prince Talal, is considered one of the most vocal supporters of reform in the ruling Al Saud family, having pressed for a constitutional monarchy decades ago.",Future Saudi king tightens grip on power with arrest of Prince Alwaleed,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-arrests/future-saudi-king-tightens-grip-on-power-with-arrest-of-prince-alwaleed-idUKKBN1D5078?il=0

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

All are wanted by Madrid for actions related to the push for the region’s secession from Spain. Puigdemont has become the public face of that move for independence.

Other charges are the misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to the secessionist campaign, which has thrown Spain into a political crisis just as its economy has recovered from a sharp downturn and banking stress.

Madrid has taken over administrative control in Catalonia, until then an autonomous region, and called new elections on Dec 21.

Two polls on Sunday suggested pro-Catalonia independence parties will together win December’s regional election although they may fall just short of a majority of seats in parliament needed to revive the secession campaign.

Parties supporting Catalonia staying in Spain would divide seats but garner around 54 percent of the vote, the polls suggested.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium shortly after Madrid took control. On Sunday morning, Puigdemont and four of his former councillors presented themselves to police in Brussels.

A judge will hear the defendants case on Sunday afternoon and has until Monday morning to decide whether the formalities for the extradition request have been fulfilled.

According to a GAD3 survey of 1,233 people conducted between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 and published in La Vanguardia newspaper, pro-independence parties ERC, PDeCAT and CUP would take between 66 and 69 seats in the 135-seat parliament.

A second poll taken over the same period for the conservative newspaper La Razon echoed the GAD3 survey, showing pro-independence parties would capture the most votes though still fall just shy of a parliamentary majority with 65 seats.

Other seats would be generally divided between parties that support the region remaining as part of Spain, though they would run on separate tickets.

Voter participation, however, will rise to a record of 83 percent, the GAD3 poll showed.

POLITICIANS ON REMAND

Under the European arrest warrant system, the five defendants in Belgium can agree to an extradition order immediately or the judge can set bail or detain them. Belgian authorities have to inform their European counterparts if a European arrest warrant cannot be executed after 90 days.

On Saturday, Puigdemont - who PDeCAT said on Sunday would lead the party in the election - called for a united Catalan political front for independence from Spain and against the detention of his former members of government.

On Thursday, nine of his sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial.

One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was freed after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,035) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

According to the GAP3 survey, 59 percent believed legal action against Puigdemont was unjustified while 69.3 percent said the jailing of the Catalan politicians would give the independence cause a boost at the ballot box.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest the detentions.

The Catalonia issue has sent shockwaves across Europe, energizing regions with their own secessionist agenda while unnerving those fighting to keep the European Union from fracturing further.

Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon, a member of the Flemish nationalist and separatist party N-VA, criticized Spain’s handling of situation on Sunday, saying Madrid “went too far” in an interview with Belgian broadcaster VTM.

Madrid says the judiciary acts independently of the legislative arm of government while adding that Catalonia leaders acted outside the rule of law when organizing the vote and making the declaration of independence.

BACK TO THE START

A pro-secessionist rally in Barcelona on Sunday attracted just a few hundred people, a long way from the hundreds of thousands to join pro-independence marches in October. Many of those attending waved the regional flag and carried protest signs.

One protester, Antonia Aguilera, 63, said she was concerned the new elections would not be fair and would be manipulated by the Spanish government.

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

His father, Prince Talal, is considered one of the most vocal supporters of reform in the ruling Al Saud family, having pressed for a constitutional monarchy decades ago.",Future Saudi king tightens grip on power with arrest of Prince Alwaleed,https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests/future-saudi-king-tightens-grip-on-power-with-arrest-of-prince-alwaleed-idINKBN1D506O

Since the start of October, at least 35 U.S. companies have cited currency “benefits” or “tailwinds” and “weaker dollar” for boosting quarterly earnings, compared with few mentions a year ago, and some see that extending to the fourth quarter, a Reuters analysis shows.

“The quarter was one where the dollar weakened over the course of the quarter, more so than analysts expected,” said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.

“That’s what’s in part been helping multinationals,” Carey Hall said. “They have seen some of the strongest results so far.”

The U.S. dollar index’s .DXY average in the third quarter fell from its year-ago level by about 2.5 percent, the weakest showing since 2014, Thomson Reuters data shows.

The index has recovered from its recent lows, but remains down about 7 percent for the year.

U.S.-based multinational companies can benefit the most from declines in the dollar, which make overseas sales more valuable when translated back into the U.S. currency.

Among companies citing a positive dollar impact were Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and other names in technology, which has the highest percentage of foreign sales within the S&P 500.

Others included Axalta Coating Systems Ltd (AXTA.N), W.R. Grace (GRA.N), Coca Cola Co (KO.N) and Xerox Corp (XRX.N), which said the third quarter was the first in 13 that a weaker dollar boosted the company’s earnings, by about 1 percentage point.

“And we’re expecting that to improve into Q4 based upon quarter-end rates,” Xerox Chief Financial Officer William Osbourn said in the company’s Oct. 26 conference call after it reported higher-than-expected results.

The weaker dollar “should help with the discounting pressure from the non-U.S. manufacturers, so that’s a good sign,” Harley-Davidson (HOG.N) Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told investors Oct. 17.

The dollar’s weakness has helped offset the impact of a trio of hurricanes that took a heavy toll on companies in the third quarter. If the benefit continues, it could help companies hit the 11.7 percent profit gains analysts have projected for the fourth quarter.

With results in from more than three-quarters of the S&P 500 companies, third-quarter profit growth is estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 4.3 percent three weeks ago, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Much of the improvement has come with stronger-than-expected technology results. Ninety percent of S&P technology index .SPLRCT names are beating earnings expectations, while 72 percent are surpassing estimates in the overall S&P 500, the data shows.

Materials companies’ earnings, which have benefited from higher commodity prices tied to the weaker dollar, have had a high percentage of beats as well.

Adding to the weaker dollar’s benefit has been better global economic strength, and that is also why multinational companies have performed better than others this earnings season, Carey Hall said.

S&P 500 companies with 50 percent or more of sales coming from outside the United States have estimated profit growth of 16.7 percent for the third quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for companies with less than 50 percent of non-U.S. sales, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Stocks of big multinationals also have outperformed, with the Dow Jones global titans index .DJGT up about 3.3 percent since Oct. 1. The small-cap Russell 2000 index is up just 0.2 percent since then.

European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts.

Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries.

The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it.

Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package.

The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code.

Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business.

However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units.

Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs.

BLUNT INSTRUMENT

“Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

“I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee.

Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes.

As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018.

European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.

Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties.

“That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy.

He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.”

Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes.

The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law.

The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns.

The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week.

Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well.

There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.

It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said.

“You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?”

England’s most prolific wicket-taker was the standout bowler for the touring side after they declared on 349 for six before the start of play on the second day of the two-day match.

Anderson finished with figures of 4-27 from 13 overs but his opening partner Stuart Broad struggled for rhythm ahead of the five-test series against Australia starting later this month.

Broad picked up one for 64 from 13 overs while Chris Woakes, who last season struggled with injuries, went wicketless in 15 overs.

”You could probably see from the first session that we were pretty rusty as bowlers,“ Anderson told reporters. ”We didn’t get it right. The point (of the warm-up match) is to try to get into the tour.

“We’ve got two first-class games coming up that we want to be fit for and get the cobwebs out.”

Western Australia were bowled out for 338 but kept batting to allow England a full day on the field.

Leg-spinner Mason Crane and pace bowler Craig Overton picked up two wickets each, boosting their hopes of making their debuts during the series. Jake Ball returned figures of 1-31.

England’s bowlers initially struggled to make an impact as Western Australia openers Josh Philippe and Jake Carder put on 80 runs for the first wicket. Overton dismissed Carder for 22 to break the stand.

The 20-year-old Philippe, who is yet to play a first-class match was impressive in his knock of 88, studded with 16 fours.

Repairing the damage wrought on the broadband system, including replacing steel-braid wires that the pesky parrots have gnawed, has already cost A$80,000 ($61,500), network builder NBN Co said on Friday.

The company estimates the bill could rise sharply as more damage is uncovered and more cables are rolled out in the national telecommunications infrastructure project, which is not due to be completed until around 2021.

“They are constantly sharpening their beaks and as a result will attack and tear apart anything they come across,” said NBN Co project manager Chedryian Bresland in a blog post on the company’s website on Friday.

“Unfortunately, they’ve developed a liking to our cables ... these birds are unstoppable when in a swarm.”

Yellow-crested cockatoos are prolific in Australia and well-known for their voracious appetites for everything from fruit crops to wooden window frames.

Much of the cable chomping has occurred in grain-growing regions in Australia’s southeast.

“It would have to be an acquired taste, because it’s not their usual style,” Gisela Kaplan, a professor in animal behavior at the University of New England, told Reuters.

“Cockatoos usually go for wood, or strip the bark off trees, They don’t usually go for cables. But it might be the color or the position of the cables that’s attracted them,” she said.

Asked in an interview with ITV television if Britain’s economy would take a hit if there is no Brexit deal. Carney said:

“In the short term, without question, if we have materially less access (to the EU’s single market) than we have now, this economy is going to need to reorient and during that period of time it will weigh on growth.”

Carney also said British business investment should be booming now, given the strength of the world economy and other factors, but that it was just growing instead.

This is because of the uncertainty about the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, he said.

The BoE on Thursday raised interest rates for the first time since 2007, before the start of the global financial crisis, but sterling fell sharply as the central bank also said it expected only “very gradual” rate rises ahead.

Britain’s economy has slowed sharply this year following the 2016 Brexit vote, but the BoE decided to raise rates in part because it believes that Brexit will create more inflation pressure due to lower migration and weaker investment.

Carney told ITV on Sunday that it was possible that in the event of a bad Brexit deal, the BoE would not be able to cut interest rates in future because of that inflationary pressure.

“The scenario you paint is not the most likely, by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a possibility,” he said.

Carney has come under political pressure from some supporters of the vote to leave the EU, who have been angered by his comments that Brexit is having a negative impact on the economy.",Bank of England's Carney sees slower growth without Brexit deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-carney/bank-of-englands-carney-sees-slower-growth-without-brexit-deal-idUKKBN1D50IE

T-Mobile, under charismatic CEO John Legere, keeps hitting home runs, already reporting it that added 1.3 million net customers in the third quarter - the 18th time in a row it has achieved the feat.

T-Mobile reported revenues in the third quarter that topped $10 billion for the first time, up 8 percent.

The picture for Deutsche Telekom group on Thursday is likely to be different, with analysts on average forecasting group revenues of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion) - a year-on-year gain of just 1.6 percent.

That would reflect barely positive growth in Telekom’s crowded and heavily regulated home market, where sales rose just 0.4 percent in the first half, and at its European holdings that were ahead by just 1.5 percent.

Deutsche Telekom, which has toyed with options for its U.S. business for years, put a brave face on the unraveling of the deal on Saturday night, saying T-Mobile would continue its successful growth strategy.

“We supported our American subsidiary to invest more than $40 billion over the last years, thus building a basis for strong growth in the upcoming years,” CEO Tim Hoettges said.

HOME AND AWAY

But some investors wonder whether the best years may now be behind T-Mobile, whose shares have risen ninefold from the low they hit after the global financial crisis to a peak of $68 in June.

“I’d just love them to sell it,” one UK-based fund manager who holds Deutsche Telekom stock said last week as reports surfaced that the T-Mobile-Sprint talks were in trouble.

At T-Mobile’s latest share price, Deutsche Telekom’s 64 percent stake would be worth $31 billion.

“There’s a tendency to run things for ever, sometimes, and then you end up selling at the wrong times,” the fund manager added.

Together, T-Mobile and Sprint would have had about 130 million customers, putting a merged entity a close third in the United States behind market leaders AT&T and Verizon.

Alone, T-Mobile has 70.7 million customers, requiring a lot more good quarters to close the gap on its own.

Lacking sufficient scale and running a mobile-first strategy, T-Mobile may face challenges if Sprint, controlled by Japan’s Softbank Group, revives its efforts to hook up with a U.S. cable firm, according to a top-10 Telekom shareholder.

An approach by Softbank chief Masayoshi Son was rebuffed in July by Charter Communications.

An agreement would see Merkel extend her 12-year spell at the helm of Europe’s largest economy, during which she has helped avoid a collapse of the euro zone and established her country as the bloc’s economic powerhouse.

Merkel must bring together the Greens, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and her own conservative bloc to secure a majority, with sticking points including immigration caps, whether to end coal production and increasing defense spending.

The poll published by German daily Bild put the Greens at 11 percent, up by one percentage point from a week earlier, while the FDP fell by the same amount to 10 percent.

Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian CSU sister party were stable at 31 percent while the Social Democrats, who have said they would not renew their ruling coalition with the conservatives, slipped by one percentage point to 21 percent.

Party leaders are slated to meet on Monday evening before the larger negotiating teams launch into more detailed talks.

The FDP leader, Christian Lindner, said in an interview published on Sunday his party did not fear new elections if the negotiations failed.

But a new vote could see more gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which surged into parliament last month after a campaign that channeled public anger at Merkel’s 2015 decision to leave Germany’s border open to migrants.

The euro-sceptic AfD was stable in Sunday’s survey at 12 percent while left-wing Die Linke rose by one percentage point to poll to 10 percent.

Polling firm Emnid interviewed 1,476 people between 26 and 30 October.

A separate survey, carried out by pollster INSA in Bavaria, put Merkel’s local ally, the CSU, at 37 percent, down from an already disappointing 38.9 percent at general elections on Sept. 24.

All are wanted by Madrid for actions related to the push for the region’s secession from Spain. Puigdemont has become the public face of that move for independence.

Other charges are the misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to the secessionist campaign, which has thrown Spain into a political crisis just as its economy has recovered from a sharp downturn and banking stress.

Madrid has taken over administrative control in Catalonia, until then an autonomous region, and called new elections on Dec 21.

Two polls on Sunday suggested pro-Catalonia independence parties will together win December’s regional election although they may fall just short of a majority of seats in parliament needed to revive the secession campaign.

Parties supporting Catalonia staying in Spain would divide seats but garner around 54 percent of the vote, the polls suggested.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium shortly after Madrid took control. On Sunday morning, Puigdemont and four of his former councillors presented themselves to police in Brussels.

A judge will hear the defendants case on Sunday afternoon and has until Monday morning to decide whether the formalities for the extradition request have been fulfilled.

According to a GAD3 survey of 1,233 people conducted between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 and published in La Vanguardia newspaper, pro-independence parties ERC, PDeCAT and CUP would take between 66 and 69 seats in the 135-seat parliament.

A second poll taken over the same period for the conservative newspaper La Razon echoed the GAD3 survey, showing pro-independence parties would capture the most votes though still fall just shy of a parliamentary majority with 65 seats.

Other seats would be generally divided between parties that support the region remaining as part of Spain, though they would run on separate tickets.

Voter participation, however, will rise to a record of 83 percent, the GAD3 poll showed.

POLITICIANS ON REMAND

Under the European arrest warrant system, the five defendants in Belgium can agree to an extradition order immediately or the judge can set bail or detain them. Belgian authorities have to inform their European counterparts if a European arrest warrant cannot be executed after 90 days.

On Saturday, Puigdemont - who PDeCAT said on Sunday would lead the party in the election - called for a united Catalan political front for independence from Spain and against the detention of his former members of government.

On Thursday, nine of his sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial.

One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was freed after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,035) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

According to the GAP3 survey, 59 percent believed legal action against Puigdemont was unjustified while 69.3 percent said the jailing of the Catalan politicians would give the independence cause a boost at the ballot box.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest the detentions.

The Catalonia issue has sent shockwaves across Europe, energizing regions with their own secessionist agenda while unnerving those fighting to keep the European Union from fracturing further.

Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon, a member of the Flemish nationalist and separatist party N-VA, criticized Spain’s handling of situation on Sunday, saying Madrid “went too far” in an interview with Belgian broadcaster VTM.

Madrid says the judiciary acts independently of the legislative arm of government while adding that Catalonia leaders acted outside the rule of law when organizing the vote and making the declaration of independence.

BACK TO THE START

A pro-secessionist rally in Barcelona on Sunday attracted just a few hundred people, a long way from the hundreds of thousands to join pro-independence marches in October. Many of those attending waved the regional flag and carried protest signs.

One protester, Antonia Aguilera, 63, said she was concerned the new elections would not be fair and would be manipulated by the Spanish government.

Her concerns echo the deep mistrust many Catalans have of politicians in Madrid that has deepened since the arrests and after the national police used truncheons and rubber bullets to thwart voting in the illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1.

“I‘m disgusted by it all. We knew they would react but not as strongly as they did,” she said, adding that she believed the pro-independence parties would win the December election.

A empresa de streaming de vídeo suspendeu no começo desta semana a produção da sexta e última temporada da série sobre política, na qual Spacey interpreta o presidente norte-americano Frank Underwood.

“A Netflix não se envolverá em mais nenhuma produção de House of Cards que tenha Kevin Spacey”, afirmou a empresa em comunicado no fim da sexta-feira.

O agente de Spacey rescindiu o contrato com ele na quinta-feira, e ainda não se sabe quem o representa.

A saída de Spacey não significa o fim da série, contudo: ”Embora continuemos uma investigação sobre as sérias acusações relacionadas ao comportamento de Kevin Spacey no set de House of Cards, ele já foi suspenso com efeito imediato”, disse em comunicado a Media Rights Capital, que produz o programa.

“A MRC, em parceria com a Netflix, continuará avaliando uma continuação criativa para a série durante o hiato”, anunciou..

Spacey, dono de uma bem-sucedida carreira no cinema, na televisão e no teatro, é mais um dos famosos acusados de má conduta sexual por pessoas que decidiram delatar celebridades, sendo a mais recente delas o produtor cinematográfico Harvey Weinstein.

Na semana passada, Spacey se desculpou com o ator Anthony Rapp, que o acusou de tentar seduzi-lo em 1986, quando Rapp tinha apenas 14 anos. A CNN informou na quinta-feira que oito ex-funcionários de House of Cards, que não foram identificados, acusaram Spacey de assédio sexual.

A Reuters não conseguiu confirmar independentemente as acuações.

Spacey, como parte de seu pedido de desculpas a Rapp, anunciou que é gay, o que causou revolta na comunidade LGBT e em demais círculos sociais, que o acusaram de desviar o foco das acusações feitas por Rapp.

Os representantes de Spacey disseram na quarta-feira que ele buscou avaliação e tratamento profissionais, sem dar mais detalhes sobre o tipo de terapia.

Após anunciar o tratamento, Spacey viu uma série de novas acusações contra ele surgirem por parte do ator mexicano Roberto Cavazos, que trabalhou no teatro de Londres quando Spacey era diretor artístico, de 2004 a 2015, e do produtor norte-americano Tony Montana.

A MRC afirmou em comunicado, na quinta-feira, que lidou com um incidente em 2012, quando um membro não identificado da série fez uma reclamação contra Kevin Spacey, que ações imediatas foram tomadas e o problema foi resolvido.

A decisão da Netflix de cortar laços com Spacey vai além de House of Cards. A empresa não lançará o filme “Gore”, que estava em pós-produção e foi produzido por Spacey. Nela, o ator interpreta o escritor falecido Gore Vidal.

Minutes after Sayfullo Saipov drove a truck down a bike path in the city on Tuesday, a Reuters team started collecting videos and images taken by bystanders during the deadly attack.

When news breaks, video and images captured by people on smartphones frequently drive news updates worldwide. At Reuters, social media producers in London, Mexico City, Beijing, Singapore, Amman and Gdynia, Poland, find, verify and get permission to distribute user-generated content to our news clients.

In images and video from Tuesday’s attack posted on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, we looked for clues and details to confirm the location, like the Chambers Street sign.

Reuters reviewed 36 videos and photographs depicting Tuesday’s incident – in real time – along with 12 more of the aftermath. Ultimately, we authenticated and cleared 10 pieces of content, including images of a school bus that was hit with children inside. We need to ensure the photograph was authentic, and that the faces of the children are not easily identifiable.

We managed to secure videos taken by two passersby who witnessed the destroyed school bus up close, moments after the crash, as well as video of victims on the ground before both witnesses were escorted away from the premises by police.

Reuters also used social media messaging to communicate with eyewitnesses who posted video or pictures, seeking accounts of what happened and consent to share their material. That is how we connected with Tawhid Kabir Xisan, who shot the 34-second video of the attacker.

Reuters has used similar newsgathering techniques since 2013. In recent months, we verified a photograph of La Vita Bella nursing home residents in waist-high water in Dickinson, Texas, during the flooding brought on by Hurricane Harvey in August.

After Mexico City was hit with a 7.1 magnitude earthquake, we checked to see that the timestamp on the user’s cellphone matched the minute of the earthquake when verifying a video showing the collapsing side walls of a high-rise government building.

Social media is a tool we use to augment our own reporting, often providing a more immediate and intimate view of news events. Unique images like the picture of Texas nursing home residents or the exact moment a building turns to rubble showcase the news value of social media in times when information and images are shared by more and more people.",Sorting through fast-moving information,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-backstory-new-york-attack/sorting-through-fast-moving-information-idUSKBN1D22NU

Since the start of October, at least 35 U.S. companies have cited currency “benefits” or “tailwinds” and “weaker dollar” for boosting quarterly earnings, compared with few mentions a year ago, and some see that extending to the fourth quarter, a Reuters analysis shows.

“The quarter was one where the dollar weakened over the course of the quarter, more so than analysts expected,” said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.

“That’s what’s in part been helping multinationals,” Carey Hall said. “They have seen some of the strongest results so far.”

The U.S. dollar index’s .DXY average in the third quarter fell from its year-ago level by about 2.5 percent, the weakest showing since 2014, Thomson Reuters data shows.

The index has recovered from its recent lows, but remains down about 7 percent for the year.

U.S.-based multinational companies can benefit the most from declines in the dollar, which make overseas sales more valuable when translated back into the U.S. currency.

Among companies citing a positive dollar impact were Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and other names in technology, which has the highest percentage of foreign sales within the S&P 500.

Others included Axalta Coating Systems Ltd (AXTA.N), W.R. Grace (GRA.N), Coca Cola Co (KO.N) and Xerox Corp (XRX.N), which said the third quarter was the first in 13 that a weaker dollar boosted the company’s earnings, by about 1 percentage point.

“And we’re expecting that to improve into Q4 based upon quarter-end rates,” Xerox Chief Financial Officer William Osbourn said in the company’s Oct. 26 conference call after it reported higher-than-expected results.

The weaker dollar “should help with the discounting pressure from the non-U.S. manufacturers, so that’s a good sign,” Harley-Davidson (HOG.N) Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told investors Oct. 17.

The dollar’s weakness has helped offset the impact of a trio of hurricanes that took a heavy toll on companies in the third quarter. If the benefit continues, it could help companies hit the 11.7 percent profit gains analysts have projected for the fourth quarter.

With results in from more than three-quarters of the S&P 500 companies, third-quarter profit growth is estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 4.3 percent three weeks ago, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Much of the improvement has come with stronger-than-expected technology results. Ninety percent of S&P technology index .SPLRCT names are beating earnings expectations, while 72 percent are surpassing estimates in the overall S&P 500, the data shows.

Materials companies’ earnings, which have benefited from higher commodity prices tied to the weaker dollar, have had a high percentage of beats as well.

Adding to the weaker dollar’s benefit has been better global economic strength, and that is also why multinational companies have performed better than others this earnings season, Carey Hall said.

S&P 500 companies with 50 percent or more of sales coming from outside the United States have estimated profit growth of 16.7 percent for the third quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for companies with less than 50 percent of non-U.S. sales, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Stocks of big multinationals also have outperformed, with the Dow Jones global titans index .DJGT up about 3.3 percent since Oct. 1. The small-cap Russell 2000 index is up just 0.2 percent since then.

“It’s not so much the dollar is a windfall for them; it’s no longer a headwind, so that’s positive, and outlooks for companies have been generally upbeat,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York.",U.S. dollar enters center stage for earnings,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/u-s-dollar-enters-center-stage-for-earnings-idUSKBN1D32CQ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

First Secretary of State Damian Green said the claims by a former senior police officer in a Sunday newspaper were “completely untrue” and “political smears.”

“This story is completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source,” Green said in a statement on his Twitter page. The claims amount to “little more than an unscrupulous character assassination,” he said.

The Sunday Times reported on its front page that former Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Bob Quick alleged the material was discovered by officers during an inquiry into government leaks in 2008.

Quick, who was involved in the leak investigation, told the newspaper that officers had reported finding the “extreme” pornography on a parliamentary computer from Green’s office.

The claims against one of the prime minister’s closest allies risks deepening a growing sexual harassment scandal that led Britain’s defense minister Michael Fallon to resign last Wednesday.

Fallon said his behavior has “fallen short” of the standards expected by the British military.

May’s minority government is already struggling with divisions over Britain’s departure from the European Union.

Britain’s interior minister Amber Rudd said the issue would be investigated by the Cabinet Office on Monday and she denied the government was on the verge of collapse if Green resigned.

Rudd said Britain needed to address allegations of sexual harassment in the corridors of power.

“It is something that will take place, in terms of clearing out Westminster of that sort of behavior, and Westminster, including the government, will be better off after it,” she said.

Green, 61, has also denied a previous allegation that he made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman.

He said it was not true that he had touched the woman’s knee and told her that his “wife was very understanding” during a meeting in a pub in which the pair discussed her career aspirations and gossiped about sexual affairs in parliament.",PM May's deputy denies report pornography was found on office computer,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-green/pm-mays-deputy-denies-report-pornography-was-found-on-office-computer-idUSKBN1D50J6

Trump kicked off a 12-day Asian trip and is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.

He told reporters on Air Force One en route to Asia that North Korea would figure prominently in discussions, and also singled out trade, which he said had been “badly handled” in the region for years.

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

A top aide said last week Trump intends to tell Asian leaders the world is “running out of time” in dealing with the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.

“No dictator, no regime, no nation should ever underestimate American resolve,” Trump told hundreds of cheering U.S. and Japanese troops in camouflage uniforms gathered at Yokota Air Base, just west of Tokyo, soon after he arrived.

“Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it?” said Trump, who wore a bomber jacket as he addressed the troops.

North Korea’s recent actions, including several missiles that flew over Japan and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test, have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Recent drills over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have further heightened tensions.

“We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defense of our freedom,” Trump said.

He told reporters earlier on Air Force One that a decision would be made soon on whether to add reclusive North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Trump said his administration planned to take a different approach after years of what he termed “total weakness.”

“It’s a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved.”

In an apparent attempt to distinguish between North Korea’s leadership and ordinary people, he said he thought North Koreans were “great people.”

“And I hope it all works out for everybody.”

GOLF DIPLOMACY

Abe told reporters before Trump’s arrival that he welcomed the visit as a chance to deepen bilateral ties by building on the “friendship and trust” between the two leaders, fostered by several meetings that included a round of golf in Florida earlier this year.

“I hope we will be able to have thorough discussions about international issues, including North Korea,” he said.

Trump and Abe greeted each other with a handshake at a golf course to be used during the 2020 Olympic Games, changing clothes and heading out to play after what media said was a lunch of hamburgers. In an allusion to a Trump campaign slogan, they signed caps that said “Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.”

They discussed North Korea and trade while playing nine holes with Hideki Matsuyama, the world no. 3 pro golfer.

A senior White House official said the two leaders have developed a close bond since Trump took office in January.

“Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people!” Trump tweeted. For his part, Abe took to Twitter to say he played golf “with a marvellous friend (President Donald J. Trump) full of spirited conversation.”

The two leaders and their wives later dined on grilled Japanese premium beef at an upscale restaurant.

In brief pre-dinner remarks, Trump said U.S.-Japan ties were closer than ever. But he added: “We’ll have dinner tonight. I think we’ll insult everybody by continuing to talk about trade.”

Trump also said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, the longest Asian tour by any U.S. leader since George H.W. Bush in 1992.

“I think it’s expected that we will meet,” he said. “We want Putin’s help on North Korea.”

Trump wants a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before he visits Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Separately, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed that “now is the time to apply firm pressure on North Korea,” Kono told reporters.

A senior U.S. State Department official traveling with Tillerson said the pressure was having an effect.

“I think we have a better chance now than we’ve had in the last couple of decades to solve this problem because the most important thing is to have the international community completely united in order to really choke off the lifeline for North Korea. It’s got to be the way,” the official said.

TRADE TALKS

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to policies more favorable to the United States, a point Trump emphasized.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where Trump will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.

“One of the things we’re going to be very focused on is trade because trade has not been done well for 25 years by the United States with this part of the world, with any part of the world,” he said on Air Force One.

“We’re going to be discussing reciprocal trade. Fair, free but reciprocal,” he said.","Trump in Japan stresses unity on North Korea; talks trade, too",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D501N-OCATP

Democratic Republic of Congo army spokesman for South Kivu province, Dieudonne Kasereka, said clashes had started after police came to disarm Colonel Abbas Kayonga, who was sacked on Thursday from his post overseeing anti-fraud efforts in local mines.

Kayonga, a former rebel from a group that had been disarmed and integrated into the Congolese military, gave himself up at the local base for the U.N. mission to Congo.

“He has just surrendered with 17 people at the base of the mission,” Kasereka said by telephone. Two army soldiers and three of Kanyonga’s bodyguards were killed in the fighting and two civilians were killed by stray bullets, he said.

Seventeen members of Kanyonga’s force surrendered to U.N. troops and nine others were captured by the army, Kasereka said, adding that soldiers found about a dozen heavy weapons at Kanyonga’s house.

Security has been deteriorating across Congo since the end of last year, when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down despite his mandate expiring.

Surging militia violence in the east, which has for decades been a tinderbox of ethnic rivalries fueled by the region’s mineral wealth, and in the formerly peaceful central Kasai region, have raised fears the country could slip back to the multi-faceted civil wars of the turn of the century.

Those wars killed hundreds of thousands directly in violence while millions of others are thought to have died from of hunger and disease.

South Kivu has rich deposits of gold, tin and coltan, used in mobile phones, which have long helped finance rebel groups and army officers.

The national electoral commission was expected to announce a date for the election to replace Kabila later on Sunday. Last month, it said the election cannot take place until April 2019, raising fears of an escalation in militia violence and civil disturbances.

U.S. envoy Nikki Haley said during a visit to meet with Kabila last month that the vote must happen in 2018 or it will lose international support.","Renegade colonel surrenders in eastern Congo after clashes, seven dead",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-violence/renegade-colonel-surrenders-in-eastern-congo-after-clashes-seven-dead-idUSKBN1D50HT?il=0

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said King, an American, was suffering from “dangerous” heart disease and kidney problems.

“His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,” Mujahid said in a statement.

“We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,” he said.

The U.S. State Department called for the immediate and unconditional release of King and other hostages.

King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital.

Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken.

The Taliban statement came around two weeks after Pakistani troops rescued Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlan Coleman from an area near the Afghan border. They had been held by the Haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012.

Earlier this year, the Taliban released a video of King and Weeks showing them pleading with their governments to release Taliban prisoners in turn for their freedom.

All are wanted by Madrid for actions related to the push for the region’s secession from Spain. Puigdemont has become the public face of that move for independence.

Other charges are the misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to the secessionist campaign, which has thrown Spain into a political crisis just as its economy has recovered from a sharp downturn and banking stress.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium shortly after Madrid took control. On Sunday morning, Puigdemont and four of his former councillors presented themselves to police in Brussels.

A judge will hear the defendants case on Sunday afternoon and has until Monday morning to decide whether the formalities for the extradition request have been fulfilled.

According to a GAD3 survey of 1,233 people conducted between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 and published in La Vanguardia newspaper, pro-independence parties ERC, PDeCAT and CUP would take between 66 and 69 seats in the 135-seat parliament.

A second poll taken over the same period for the conservative newspaper La Razon echoed the GAD3 survey, showing pro-independence parties would capture the most votes though still fall just shy of a parliamentary majority with 65 seats.

Other seats would be generally divided between parties that support the region remaining as part of Spain, though they would run on separate tickets.

Voter participation, however, will rise to a record of 83 percent, the GAD3 poll showed.

POLITICIANS ON REMAND

Under the European arrest warrant system, the five defendants in Belgium can agree to an extradition order immediately or the judge can set bail or detain them. Belgian authorities have to inform their European counterparts if a European arrest warrant cannot be executed after 90 days.

On Saturday, Puigdemont - who PDeCAT said on Sunday would lead the party in the election - called for a united Catalan political front for independence from Spain and against the detention of his former members of government.

On Thursday, nine of his sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial.

One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was freed after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,035) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

According to the GAP3 survey, 59 percent believed legal action against Puigdemont was unjustified while 69.3 percent said the jailing of the Catalan politicians would give the independence cause a boost at the ballot box.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest the detentions.

The Catalonia issue has sent shockwaves across Europe, energizing regions with their own secessionist agenda while unnerving those fighting to keep the European Union from fracturing further.

Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon, a member of the Flemish nationalist and separatist party N-VA, criticized Spain’s handling of situation on Sunday, saying Madrid “went too far” in an interview with Belgian broadcaster VTM.

Madrid says the judiciary acts independently of the legislative arm of government while adding that Catalonia leaders acted outside the rule of law when organizing the vote and making the declaration of independence.

BACK TO THE START

A pro-secessionist rally in Barcelona on Sunday attracted just a few hundred people, a long way from the hundreds of thousands to join pro-independence marches in October. Many of those attending waved the regional flag and carried protest signs.

One protester, Antonia Aguilera, 63, said she was concerned the new elections would not be fair and would be manipulated by the Spanish government.

Her concerns echo the deep mistrust many Catalans have of politicians in Madrid that has deepened since the arrests and after the national police used truncheons and rubber bullets to thwart voting in the illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1.

“I‘m disgusted by it all. We knew they would react but not as strongly as they did,” she said, adding that she believed the pro-independence parties would win the December election.

“And then we’ll be back where we started.”","Sacked Catalonia leader turns himself in, polls show independence strength",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D50CS-OCATP

The size of the purge - 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers were detained by a newly created anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - raised questions about the stability and predictability of the Saudi government.

For foreigners, a major shock was the detention of flamboyant billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who as a big investor in top Western companies such as Citigroup (C.N) is known as the international face of Saudi business.

Local investors, meanwhile, worried about whether a sustained investigation into corruption could turn up scandals in the kingdom’s opaque business world, forcing people implicated to sell off their equity holdings.

But many bankers and analysts saw the purge, which replaced the head of the National Guard, as a power grab by Prince Mohammed, designed to remove any remaining obstacles to his authority and assure his eventual succession to the throne.

This, they said, could help the economy by making it easier for Prince Mohammed to pursue radical reforms that include slashing the state budget deficit, putting more women into employment, lifting a ban on women driving, and selling $300 billion of state assets.

“This is the latest act of concentration of power in Saudi,” said Hasnain Malik, global head of equity research at emerging markets investment bank Exotix.

”As unprecedented and controversial as it may be, this centralization might also be a necessary condition for pushing the austerity and transformation agenda, the benefits of which very few investors are pricing in.”

After initially tumbling as much as 2.2 percent on Sunday, the Saudi stock index .TASI rebounded to close slightly higher. Shares related to some of the detained people, such as Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, sank but most banks rose, a sign of economic optimism.

INSTABILITY

The purge may increase Prince Mohammed’s grassroots support by tackling corruption, a problem that has long plagued the economy.

“It’s a populist move that makes sense because a lot of the princes, businessmen and bureaucrats are corrupt, taking kickbacks and being involved in all kinds of shady deals,” said Bernard Haykel, professor of Near East studies at Princeton University.

A danger for financial markets, however, is that Prince Mohammed is shaking up business practices and ties that have lasted for decades, a move which could backfire if it triggers an exodus of money and wealthy individuals from the country.

“The fact that some of the country’s leading business people were arrested will scare the private sector and there might be even more capital flight than before. And most bureaucrats will now be terrified, perhaps justifiably,” Haykel said.

Many corporate executives expect Prince Mohammed to persuade or pressure rich Saudis to repatriate some of the billions of dollars which they are believed to have transferred overseas for safe-keeping, and which could now help to kick-start the development projects that he plans.

The corruption crackdown may be an initial step in this effort; the decree creating the committee gave it the right, pending the result of investigations, to seize assets at home or abroad and transfer them to the state Treasury.

James Dorsey, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, wrote that Prince Mohammed appeared to be reacting to growing opposition within the royal family and the military to his reforms and Riyadh’s military intervention in Yemen.

“It raises questions about the reform process that increasingly is based on a unilateral rather than a consensual rewriting of the kingdom’s social contract.”

For many people, however, a unilateral approach is seen as the best chance to push through the reforms. A chief economist at a big regional bank said Prince Mohammed’s main motive for acting was frustration that reforms were not moving fast enough.

The privatization program, for example, including the planned sale of 5 percent of national oil giant Saudi Aramco, has been discussed for many months with little action. Now the program may pick up.

“The message this should send to foreign investors is it’s unwise to bet against MbS,” said Sam Blatteis, chief executive of regional advisory firm The MENA Catalysts, using a common abbreviation of Prince Mohammed’s name.

“When he wants to get things done, he has proven that he can. This is not a consolidation of power, it’s an acceleration. The wheels of policy-making are moving faster.”",Saudi purge worries investors but may speed reforms,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests-economy/saudi-purge-worries-investors-but-may-speed-reforms-idUSKBN1D50RN?il=0

Gold is considered an essential part of weddings in India, second-biggest consumer of the metal in the world after China, and it is a popular gift on such occasions.

“The wedding season has started. In the next few weeks, there are many wedding dates, which will boost demand,” said Kumar Jain, a Mumbai-based jeweller.

Dealers in India were charging a premium of up to $3 an ounce this week over official domestic prices, unchanged from last week. The domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax.

“Gold imports by (jewellery) export houses have fallen sharply in the last few weeks. That’s why the market is in premium, despite moderate demand,” said a dealer with a private bank in Mumbai.

In October, India tightened gold import norms for jewellery exporters by restricting them from importing the yellow metal only for export purposes and not for selling in the domestic market.

Meanwhile, in China, the market for the precious metal remained quiet, with premiums of $5 to $9 an ounce being charged over benchmark rates, as against the $6.50 to $10 range in the previous week.

Benchmark spot gold was on track to register a small weekly gain, hovering around the $1,275.00 level as of 0919 GMT on Friday, but still below Thursday’s mark of $1,284.10, highest in nearly two weeks.

“Dips below the $1,270 level (toward the beginning of the week) spurred some buying, but the upside, (around the $1,280 level) limited purchases,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.

Premiums in Hong Kong remained more or less unchanged from last week, in the 60 cents to $1.20 range.

“Premiums are quite low, and except for periodic large sales, the market is quiet,” said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner of J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong.

In Singapore, premiums rose to 70-90 cents from the 50 cents last week.

“There has been interest from two segments, the wholesalers and high net worth individuals, so it is still strong,” said Loh Mun Chun, Director, Private Wealth at GoldSilver Central in Singapore.

“The wholesalers need to buy ... to produce jewellery, especially with some spillover demand coming from the Diwali and Dhanterras festivals, while the high net worth individuals ... buy to diversify their portfolio and they have the money.”

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Liverpool’s Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah maintained his rich goalscoring form by netting twice as Juergen Klopp’s side punished a woeful West Ham display to move sixth, level on 19 points with Chelsea who host Manchester United on Sunday, and Arsenal.

Salah took his tally to seven, one fewer than Premier League top scorer Harry Kane, and was joined on the scoresheet for Liverpool by Joel Matip and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

“The result feels good,” said Klopp, who had started forward Sadio Mane despite the Senegalese having only returned to full training on Thursday after a month out with a hamstring injury.

“We changed our approach, it was a counter-attacking lineup to use our speed from the deep.”

Manuel Lanzini had briefly dragged West Ham into the game at 2-1, but they finished being booed off for the second home match in a row.

The result left them precariously perched above the relegation zone and sent Bilic into the international break with question marks hanging over his future.

“I‘m definitely not a broken man,” said Bilic, whose side will enter the drop zone if Everton beat Watford on Sunday.

“I‘m very strong. But the situation for West Ham is not good.”

Remarkably, Burnley are also level-pegging on 19 points with Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool as Sam Vokes pounced late on for Sean Dyche’s side against Southampton.

They are seventh, having already won three league matches on the road this campaign compared to one in the whole of last season.

“I am delighted to be where we are but there are a lot of challenges coming our way and the group know we will have to work hard for every point we get,” Dyche, who has been linked with the vacant Everton manager’s job, told the BBC.

“We still have to fight for every chance we get but we are willing to do the graft.”

The group, which refers to itself simply as Islamic State, is a rival to the larger al Shabaab force, which is linked to Islamic State’s rival al Qaeda and once controlled much of Somalia.

The United States has occasionally carried out strikes against al Shabaab militants in Somalia, which retains a strong presence in parts of the south and center and carries out gun and bomb attacks.

The al Shabaab group aims to drive out the peacekeepers, topple Somalia’s Western-backed government and impose its strict version of Islam on the Horn of Africa state.

More than 350 people were killed in twin bombings in the Somali capital Mogadishu last month, the deadliest attack in the country’s history.

The IMF approved a $666 million, three-year extended credit facility in June for Cameroon, which has been hit hard by the global decline in crude prices. Economic growth came in at 4.5 percent last year.

In a statement at the end of a 10-day review mission, the IMF said that it had reached an agreement with the government on economic and financial policy ahead of the first review of the programme, which is expected in mid-December.

“The economic programme of the country remains on the right track despite the difficult context. All the quantitative benchmarks established in the programme...have been fulfilled,” said mission head Corinne Delechat.

The government has been forced to concentrate resources on combating Islamist Boko Haram militants along its northwestern border with Nigeria. It has also faced unrest in two predominantly English-speaking provinces since late last year.

The measures -- which freeze the assets of the officials and bar them from visiting Canada -- were enacted through a new law giving the government the right to penalize those it says are guilty of human rights violations, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Among those targeted are Alexander Bastrykin, Russia’s top investigator and a close aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States blacklisted him in January 2017, citing Magnitsky’s death.

“Today’s announcement sends a clear message that Canada will take action against individuals who have profited from acts of significant corruption or who have been involved in gross violations of human rights,” said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

Moscow said last month it would retaliate if Canada banned individuals under the new law.

The Russian embassy in Ottawa later issued a statement denouncing the sanctions as “absolutely pointless and reprehensible”.

Canada has repeatedly condemned Moscow over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and imposed sanctions along with other Western nations.

The United States adopted a law in 2012 freezing any U.S. assets of Russian investigators and prosecutors said to have been involved in the detention of Magnitsky. In retaliation, Moscow barred Americans from adopting Russian children.

The startup, which makes robots for the elderly, was the first Israeli investment for Toyota AI Ventures, a new $100 million fund investing in artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous mobility and data and cloud computing.

“We will see more involvement of Toyota in the Israeli market in the future,” said Jim Adler, managing director of California-based Toyota AI Ventures, which is part of the $1 billion Toyota Research Institute.

“There’s more in the pipeline,” he told Reuters during a visit to Israel, adding that technologies dealing with perception and prediction and planning were of particular interest to Toyota.

Perception technology enables a self-driving vehicle to understand the world around it while prediction and planning can help a car interpret situations such as whether a child at an intersection might try to cross at a red light.

“There’s a tremendous amount of innovation happening in Israel as cars become more produced by data,” said Adler, who is in the country meeting companies whose technologies interest Toyota.

Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Earlier this year Intel Corp bought autonomous vehicle firm Mobileye - one of Israel’s biggest tech companies - for $15.3 billion.

On Friday Germany’s Continental AG said it was buying Israel’s Argus Cyber Security, whose technology guards connected cars against hacking.

Toyota AI Ventures has made five investments and expects to invest in at least 20 companies worldwide.

Regarding its investment in Intuition Robotics - which plans to begin trials of its robots with older adults in their homes early next year - Adler said there were many common features between robotics and autonomous vehicles, which he referred to as “big robots with wheels”.

Japan’s population is aging, with 40 percent expected to be over 65 in 20 years, he said, and there will be demand for technologies that help the elderly stay in their homes, rather than have to move to assisted-living facilities.

“We think Toyota will have a role there,” he said.","Toyota seeks more investments in Israeli auto tech, robotics",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-tech-toyota/toyota-seeks-more-investments-in-israeli-auto-tech-robotics-idUSKBN1D50OI

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

His father, Prince Talal, is considered one of the most vocal supporters of reform in the ruling Al Saud family, having pressed for a constitutional monarchy decades ago.",Future Saudi king tightens grip on power with arrest of Prince Alwaleed,https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests/future-saudi-king-tightens-grip-on-power-with-arrest-of-prince-alwaleed-idINKBN1D506O?il=0

The interior ministry said the attacks targeted a Shi‘ite Muslim mosque on Atlas Street in central Kirkuk and gave an initial casualty toll of one killed and 16 wounded.

It is the first such attack since the central government in Baghdad seized the oil-rich city last month from Kurdish forces, who had been controlling Kirkuk for three years.

The central government in Baghdad launched an offensive on Oct. 16 to recapture the city and other territories in northern Iraq claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurds, in retaliation for a referendum on Kurdish independence.

Iraqi security forces advanced on the city, forcing the Kurdish Peshmerga to withdraw. The retreat also allowed Baghdad to take control of all oil fields operated by the state-owned North Oil Company in Kirkuk’s northern province.

No group has claimed responsibility for Sunday’s attacks but the suicide bombings are a trademark of Islamic State militants.

Police sources said the two attacks happened in quick succession and said the death toll might rise because some of the wounded were in critical condition.

“It’s a crowded street and a place for street vendors. The terrorists wanted to kill large number of people,” said a Kirkuk police major.

Iraqi security officials have said Islamic State is likely to wage an insurgency in Iraq after their self-proclaimed caliphate all but collapsed and they were dislodged from large territories in the west and north on the country.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said if there is consensus at the next GST council meeting due over Nov. 9 to Nov. 10, the government would take the necessary steps to help traders and strengthen the country’s economy.

A panel of ministers last month recommended reducing tax rates for small businesses and traders and raising the minimum revenue threshold for companies that need to pay tax, local media reported.

The launch in July of the long-awaited GST, which transformed India’s 29 states into a single customs union, has left thousands of small and medium-sized firms at the bottom of the supply chain short of working capital.

Modi is facing criticism for the disruption to the economy caused by the roll-out of GST and the shock removal of higher-value bills from circulation last year. As a result of these issues India’s economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in four years this fiscal year, a Reuters poll found.

Modi’s comments came days after India jumped about 30 places to 100th on the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business” rankings, reflecting reforms in accessing credit, power supply and the protection of minority investors.

Modi said he expected India’s ranking to improve next year when the GST and other reforms were considered.

“There are many other reforms that have already happened but need gestation and stabilization time before they are taken into account by the World Bank,” Modi said.

He added that there were other reforms on which India and the World Bank would need to find common ground.

Modi said along with manufacturing, India was also pushing for faster progress in developing infrastructure and was working to improve the investment climate.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics. Several firms have cut back space and host planemaker Airbus is halving staff attendance and slashing catering, insiders said.",Jetmakers hunt for new growth as order binge fizzles out,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airshow-paris/jetmakers-hunt-for-new-growth-as-order-binge-fizzles-out-idUSKBN1961WV

Sandra, who was already well practised in a circus trick involving a shaving brush, was given a paintbrush and she quickly adapted her skills to the canvas.

Richter said that unlike many elephants in Thailand that are thought to be forced to paint, Sandra does it by herself when she is in the mood.

“I only help her with changing the brushes and putting them into paints but she does the rest by herself more or less. I praise her by saying ‘oh this is really good, or not so good’,” Richter said. “We have been together for 40 years so this is a family connection.”

Sandra arrived as a baby elephant at the circus where Richter grew up, as a seventh generation member of an acrobat family.

They also display the weaknesses, present and future, of the two leaders of the contending parties: Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister and Carles Puigdemont, president of Catalonia.

Supporters of the Spanish government call for the imprisonment of sacked Catalonian President Carles Puigdemont at a rally in Madrid, Spain, October 28, 2017. REUTERS/Sergio Perez

The declaration of independence made by Catalonia’s parliament a week ago was constitutionally illegal. Shots of huge pro-independence rallies obscure the fact that, in an opinion poll in the summer, 49.4 per cent opposed breaking away from Spain while 41.1 per cent supported it. Unionists have held their own large rallies and a new poll in El Mundo shows their parties with a slight polling lead in the December Catalan elections.

The parliamentary vote for independence – taken in a half-full chamber after the anti-independence parties left in protest – was swiftly followed by Rajoy, fully backed by his parliament and senate, ordering the parliament’s dissolution and the sacking of Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels. Nine of his colleagues in the Catalan leadership were accused in Spain’s high court on Thursday of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, eight of whom were detained in custody. Puigdemont has said he will return, but only if given guarantees of a fair trial.

Strong support in the rest of Spain for a hard line against Catalonian independence masks a longer-term problem for Rajoy and his country. The prime minister heads a minority government, unable to find a stable coalition partner. In July, Rajoy became the first serving prime minister to testify in court, denying allegations that he was complicit in a wide-ranging corruption scandal in his center-right Peoples’ Party, investigations of which have dragged on over the past two decades. Rajoy himself has not been charged.

Thus a national leader with a weakened base faces Puigdemont, a regional leader who has weakened his own base by flight. Puigdemont may not be the man to lead Catalonia to independence, and it may not presently be in the cards. But it will remain a strong current in Catalan politics and is indicative of the larger problems within the EU that threaten the integrity of the Union at least as much as Brexit.

In country after European country, the trend away from the center continues and presently grows. As the Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor observes, most nationalisms are not only championed by aggressively right-wing leaderships and parties mobilizing a largely working or lower middle-class electorate fed up with being left behind. “Another trend to watch ought to be the impatient regionalism of more metropolitan parts of Europe, frustrated by the backward politics of their nation-states,” writes Tharoor.

The rich defectors are led by Catalonia, Spain’s most productive region and the one with the strongest independence movement. Catalan separatists argued that paying less in taxes to the Spanish government would be an economic boon to the province. But others now show signs of wishing to join, or at least look at the entrance fees, of the wealthy breakaway club. Most surprising – since it is part of the relatively successful German economy – is the southern state of Bavaria: in July, a poll for the popular tabloid Bild showed one in three favors independence.

Last month, the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the two richest of Italy’s 20 regions, accounting between them for some 30 per cent of the nation’s GDP, voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy. The Liga party, strong in the area, had a policy of independence. That’s now moderated, but there’s growing dissatisfaction that the region’s taxes are poured into the much poorer, much less productive south. The division amounts to two separate economies, a problem which feeds northern separatism.

Even in Belgium, the administrative heart of the EU, the tensions are showing. The divided reaction to Puigdemont in Brussels – with a Flemish nationalist cabinet minister welcoming him, while the prime minister, from the French-speaking Walloon area showed a cold face – was a glimpse into the fractured politics of the Belgian state. The center has given away much of its power to the two main regions in an effort to avoid a complete split – and will be pressed by the richer Flemish region to do still more after national elections in 2019, to the point where the central state will cease to exist.

Scotland, whose devolved parliament is dominated by the Scottish nationalists, has seen a dimming of enthusiasm for independence as its offshore oil reserves and the income from them have ceased to promise a wealthy future, as even its own economic commission has admitted. A botched Brexit, however, could revive the movement among a population which voted decisively for remaining in the EU. France, where the economy is reviving, still has independence movements in the island of Corsica (where nationalists now control the regional assembly) and the western region of Brittany, where support is still a minority pursuit, but growing. (Brittany and Corsica have roughly average per capita GDPs for France; their independence movements are more cultural than economic – though all nationalist movements invoke some cultural difference, often rooted in centuries’ old histories.)

The EU cannot look on these movements with anything but disfavor and alarm. Though the rich breakaways would – as Catalonia does – wish to remain in the EU, a general exodus would face the union with its largest crisis yet. Were a region to succeed in forming a viable independent state, it would be required to apply for membership. Its application would not be considered until all legal and territorial issues had been settled with the country of which it had been a part – a process which might consume a decade until the application was successful.

The widespread distrust of mainstream politicians and central governments, and the conviction that local populists would do a better job, now takes a concrete and threatening form. Nationalism, which the EU had wished to see fade, even die, now instead revives, sometimes – as in Central Europe – in illiberal, even authoritarian, forms.

The EU is less and less seen as an ideal, a borderless federation-in-the-making. Its processes – remote, intricate and little understood – lose out when contrasted with the warmth and intimacy of a new-old country which can draw on its history and culture, keep out unwanted immigrants and restore pride and trust. Such is the promise of many of the new nationalisms: the EU can disapprove, but in its still-fragile state can do little except to hope that the nationalist tide will retreat. For the moment, it’s still rising.",Commentary: How the Catalonia vote threatens the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-catalonia-commentary/commentary-how-the-catalonia-vote-threatens-the-eu-idUSKBN1D31U1

The sanctions regime “threatens and impedes the enjoyment by the people of DPRK of their human rights in all sectors”, it said.

The call for an immediate end to the sanctions comes as U.S. President Donald Trump sets off on a trip to Asia - including China, South Korea and Japan - looking for help to pressure North Korea to stand down from the nuclear crisis.

The global community has been ramping up the pressure on the isolated country after it conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test so far, on Sept. 3.

Last month the United States unilaterally imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities over what it called serious human rights abuses, including forced labor.

In September the U.N. Security Council strengthened its sanctions, including export bans as well as asset freezes and travel bans on various officials,

North Korea’s response follows a U.N. expert last month saying international sanctions may be hurting key economic sectors and hampering the human rights of Pyongyang’s citizens.

The sanctions meant that “some unprincipled countries have blocked the delivery of medical equipment and medicines”, the North Korean mission said on Friday, with the supplies destined for children and mothers in the country.

“I‘m looking forward to next year.”

It was the ninth win in a row for Goerges, who hit 21 winners compared to her opponent’s 18 during the one hour 20-minute match.

Their comments contradict media statements by McKinsey that it ceased work with the firm, local consultancy Trillian, in March 2016 -- after due diligence by external consultants showed the links to the Gupta family, accused by South Africa’s anti-corruption watchdog of siphoning public funds.

McKinsey, which says it never signed a separate contract with Trillian, also ignored warnings by senior staff in South Africa not to partner Trillian in a deal to advise state utility Eskom which is being investigated for fraud, the sources said. The senior staff were troubled by Eskom’s demand that Trillian must be involved in the deal despite having little experience.

It then took a year for McKinsey to act on calls for an internal inquiry into the relationship with Trillian, the sources said.

Two of McKinsey’s global directors -- Europe-based Pal Erik Sjatil and Africa chief Georges Desvaux -- and South African office head Saf Yeboah-Amankwah told concerned partners the situation was “under control”, three former McKinsey employees said.

Six sources with direct knowledge of the matter -- four former McKinsey employees and two current employees -- said there was no investigation until July 2017. McKinsey declined to comment on this allegation.

Sjatil and Desvaux were on McKinsey’s Shareholder Council, its highest leadership body.

Sjatil, Desvaux and Yeboah-Amankwah declined to comment for this story. Eskom, McKinsey and Trillian have denied wrongdoing.

The sources’ disclosures are the first indication that McKinsey’s work with Trillian on the 1.6 billion rand (£86 million) contract to turn around Eskom continued until July of that year -- when Eskom canceled the deal.

Asked about the sources’ comments, McKinsey told Reuters by email on Thursday: “McKinsey never had a supplier development partnership with Trillian. We terminated our discussions in March 2016 and notified the client and Trillian.”

HOPES FOR A “SOLUTION”

Eskom had told McKinsey it must use Trillian as a partner to secure the “turnaround” contract under a black empowerment program, but by July it had become clear that McKinsey would not sign a formal contract with it.

Four people involved in the contract with Eskom said McKinsey’s work with Trillian continued until then, with one saying “the team hoped a solution could be found right up until Eskom cut ties.”

McKinsey and Trillian had wanted to extend their advisory partnership at Eskom for four years in a deal that could earn them $700 million (£535.5 million), according to documents setting out the firms’ cooperation plans seen by Reuters.

Sources at McKinsey confirmed the documents’ authenticity. Asked about the documents, a McKinsey spokesman did not deny they were genuine.

McKinsey said in its email to Reuters that Eskom knew Trillian would not be McKinsey’s partner and added: ”Any questions about why Trillian remained at Eskom (after March 2016) and what they did, should be directed to Eskom.

The disclosures are likely to form part of an investigation launched by South Africa’s parliamentary committee on public enterprises into whether McKinsey knowingly let funds from Eskom be diverted to a Gupta-linked company as a way of securing the deal, a source close to the committee said.

Trillian was owned at the time by Salim Essa, a business partner of the Guptas and of the president’s son, Duduzane Zuma.

McKinsey’s global risk committee, a vetting body, gave the partnership with Trillian initial approval, pending due diligence, but senior managers in Johannesburg did not inform the committee fully about how Trillian hid its ownership and why costs for Eskom were unusually high, three former partners said.

In the end, McKinsey launched a full internal investigation into its handling of the partnership with Trillian in July this year, after local media published a letter from a senior McKinsey manager dated Feb. 16, 2016 asking Eskom to pay Trillian as a McKinsey subcontractor.

McKinsey said the letter “inaccurately characterized” the relationship with Trillian. The manager has since left the firm.

McKinsey said on Oct. 17 the preliminary findings of the inquiry, approved by global head Dominic Barton, found “violations of our professional standards” but did not uncover any corruption.

In its email on Thursday, McKinsey did not comment directly on the timing of its internal inquiry, directing Reuters instead to its Oct. 17 statement.",Exclusive: McKinsey worked with South African firm after learning of Gupta links - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1D31RO-OZABS

The Seattle-based company said the Vancouver expansion has been in the works for some time and is not related to the hotly contested race by cities across North America to land the e-commerce company’s $5 billion HQ2.

“These will be largely software engineering, tech and non-tech jobs, and they’ll be contributing to products that are used globally,” Jesse Dougherty, general manager for the Vancouver office, told reporters.

The Vancouver expansion comes as companies in the United States have struggled to secure visas in a timely fashion to import foreign workers to fill highly skilled and technical jobs.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it tougher for skilled foreigners to work in the United States, challenging visa applications more regularly than at nearly any point under former U.S. President Barack Obama.

La rete di distributori di carburanti e gli asset nella raffinazione sono stati venduti ad Api (Anonima Petroli Italiana); in questa joint venture Erg aveva il 51% e Total il 49%.

Total, inoltre, ha messo fine alla joint venture con Erg nei lubrificanti, comprando il 51% che faceva capo alla società italiana.

Creata nel 2010, TotalErg è il quarto operatore nella distribuzione di carburanti in Italia. Un mercato che Total giudica “frammentato” e in cui, pertanto, “le prospettive di profittabilità non sono all‘altezza delle attese del gruppo, malgrado gli sforzi degli azionisti”.

In una nota, Erg ricorda che il perimetro dell‘operazione comprende circa 2.600 stazioni di servizio della rete, il polo logistico di Roma e il 25,16% della raffineria di Trecate.

Nel comunicato che annuncia l‘operazione, Total sottolinea che “il mercato dei lubrificanti offre prospettive di crescita soddisfacenti”.

L‘importo complessivo che Erg incasserà per l‘equity value dalla transazione è pari a 273 milioni. Cifra che comprende i dividendi straordinari distribuiti da TotalErg per complessivi 71 milioni e una componente differita di 36 milioni, regolata da un ‘vendor loan agreement’ con scadenza a cinque anni e mezzo, sottoscritto con Api.

Commentando l‘operazione, l‘AD di Erg, Luca Bettonte, spiega che la cessione è “coerente con la nostra strategia e il nostro ruolo di produttori di energia verde, ci permette di rafforzare ulteriormente la capacità finanziaria al fine di proseguire il nostro percorso di crescita nelle rinnovabili”.

Il gruppo francese resta presente in Italia nella distribuzione di carburanti attraverso AS24, la rete dedicata ai mezzi pesanti, e nel segmento del rifornimento agli aerei.

Api, tramite un comunicato, afferma che dopo l‘acquisizione disporrà di oltre 5.000 punti vendita e raggiungerà un fatturato aggregato di circa 6 miliardi di euro.

“L‘acquisizione ci consente di raggiungere la dimensione produttiva, logistica e commerciale necessarie per perseguire la nostra strategia di sviluppo che ha al centro il cliente”, commenta il presidente di Api, Ugo Brachetti Peretti. “Vogliamo essere al fianco degli italiani ovunque avranno bisogno di energia e servizi per muoversi, con un‘offerta sempre più ampia, innovativa e vantaggiosa”.

Nell‘operazione, Erg è stata assistita da Hsbc (financial advisor), DLA Piper (legal advisor) ed Ernst & Young (accounting & tax).

UniCredit è stata financial advisor di Api. Ubi Banca e Banco Bpm hanno sostenuto Api come joint financial advisor nella definizione della capital structure del gruppo e nella strutturazione del finanziamento. Lo studio Bonelli Erede ha assistito Api come legal advisor.

Hariri left Lebanon for Saudi Arabia on Friday and resigned on Saturday in a televised statement that took the Lebanese political establishment by surprise.

He cited an assassination plot against him and criticized the regional role of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah however Lebanon’s army said on Sunday it had not uncovered any plot.

The move has thrust Lebanon back into the arena of regional rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, an ally of Hariri, and Shi‘ite Muslim Iran, which backs Hezbollah.

President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, will wait to accept or reject Hariri’s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to explain his reasons, sources at the presidential palace said.

Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat cited unnamed sources close to Hariri as speculating that he would probably remain outside Lebanon because of the security threat against him.

Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh sought to calm fears the political turmoil unleashed by Hariri’s bid to resign would hit Lebanon’s already fragile economy, issuing a statement to reaffirm the stability of its currency, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar.

In Lebanon’s sectarian system the president must be a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shi‘ite. Hariri is Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

His father, Rafik al-Hariri, was prime minister after Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war and was assassinated in a car bombing in 2005.

A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted five Hezbollah members for the killing but the group denies any involvement.

Saudi media have published reports of a plot to assassinate Hariri in recent days, but all of Lebanon’s main security branches have said they have no information about such a plot.

A Saudi minister said on Saturday that Hariri’s personal security detail had “confirmed information” about the plot. Thamer al-Sabhan said in an interview with a Lebanese TV station on Saturday that there are “threats against the prime minister and the Kingdom is keen for his security”.

FILE PHOTO - Berkshire Hathaway shareholders walk by a video screen at the company's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. on May 4, 2013. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo

Berkshire on Friday said it lost $3 billion before taxes, or $1.95 billion after-tax, from the disasters, leaving its Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance units with underwriting losses for the year.

Insurance typically accounts for about one-fourth of Berkshire’s overall profit. Berkshire has roughly 90 businesses in such sectors as chemicals, energy, food and retail and industrial products. It also owns the BNSF railroad.

Jim Shanahan, a senior analyst at Edward Jones & Co, said the disaster losses were higher than he had expected, given how pricing pressures had caused Berkshire to retrench from some business, but said shareholders should remain comfortable with the company over the long term.

Overall net income fell to $4.07 billion, or $2,473 per Class A share (BRKa.N), from $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per share, a year earlier.

Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses and which Buffett says better reflects company performance, fell 29 percent to $3.44 billion, or $2,094 per Class A share, from $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share a year earlier.

That missed analysts’ average operating profit forecast of $2,402.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s diversification helped cushion the earnings decline, as profit rose at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, while “improving economic conditions” helped boost shipping and profit at BNSF.

A better economy may also have persuaded more people to buy cars and trucks, as higher financing activity at the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealership unit helped boost pre-tax retail profit by 22 percent.

Book value per Class A share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 2.5 percent in the quarter to $187,435, and was up 8.9 percent from January to September.

Berkshire also ended September with $109.3 billion of cash and equivalents, more than five times the $20 billion minimum Buffett has said he prefers, and investors are waiting to see what he does with it.

Buffett, 87, has run Berkshire since 1965, and investors have remained confident in his leadership, as the company’s share price has risen 15 percent this year.

The Class A shares closed Friday down $2,963.99, or 1 percent, at $280,470.01, while Class B shares (BRKb.N) fell $1.34, or 0.7 percent, to $187.27. Both were about 2 percent below their Oct. 24 record highs.

FULL-YEAR UNDERWRITING LOSS LIKELY

Berkshire lost $1.44 billion from insurance underwriting in the quarter and $1.73 billion from January to September, putting it on pace for its first full-year underwriting loss since 2002.

It had even eked out a small underwriting profit in 2005, the year of Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita and Dennis.

But investment income from insurance operations cushioned the blow, rising 23 percent in the quarter to $1.04 billion.

Other insurers and reinsurers, such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N), American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S), also suffered larger quarterly storm losses, and like Berkshire are hoping to boost rates.

Berkshire’s results also reflected an accounting charge tied to its January agreement to assume many of AIG’s policies in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront.

But that and other premiums that Berkshire receives before paying claims have helped boost its insurance “float” to $113 billion, giving Buffett more money to invest.

Shanahan, who rates Berkshire a “buy,” said he was encouraged at how Geico is adding market share, reflected in a 16.5 percent jump in premiums and 9.9 percent year-over-year growth in policies.

Some of Berkshire’s cash hoard will eventually be used to buy 80 percent of Pilot Flying J, the largest U.S. truck stop operator. Buffett announced that investment on Oct. 3.

Berkshire also owns shares in dozens of companies including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), and has a 26.7 percent stake in food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O).","Hurricanes, earthquake drag down third-quarter profit at Buffett's Berkshire",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-hatha-results/hurricanes-earthquake-drag-down-third-quarter-profit-at-buffetts-berkshire-idUSKBN1D32F4?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The “bromance” is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trump’s visit starting on Wednesday. Xi has grown more powerful since their last meeting, while Trump is under a political cloud after his former campaign manager was indicted in an intensifying investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Chinese experts say Beijing has learned to manage Trump, a real-estate mogul who had never held elective office before becoming president, and whose administration in its first 10 months has been turbulent.

“China has an objective view of him. We’re going to make him feel comfortable,” said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. “He may end up being re-elected. We need to look at this from a long-term perspective, and not view him as an ‘other’ or a joke.”

Trump clearly respects Xi.

In a congratulatory phone call, Trump hailed the “extraordinary elevation” of Xi, whose political thoughts were enshrined in the Communist Party’s constitution last month during a congress marking the start of his second term.

Aboard Air Force One on his way to Asia, Trump cited record stock market levels, low unemployment and Islamic State “virtually defeated in the Middle East” as evidence of his own success.

“(Xi) knows that and he respects that,” Trump said, adding trade is still an irritant in ties.

“I think he’s viewing us as very, very strong and also very friendly. Look we have to do better with trade with China because it’s a one way street right now. It has been for many years. And we will.”

‘STATE-PLUS’

China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said Trump will receive a “state visit-plus” experience in Beijing.

It’s unclear what the “plus” means. Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details. The protocol will let Trump “rejoice in grandiosity”, important to keeping relations stable, said Teng Jianqun, head of American Studies at Foreign Ministry think-tank China Institute for International Studies.

“We must seize upon his special characteristics, such as liking instant gratification, and set up some things that bring immediate results,” he said.

On the commercial front, that means a slew of deals - and worries among some in the U.S. business community that the transactional Trump will be placated by a handful of contract wins instead of resolving long-standing complaints over discriminatory Chinese policies and market access restrictions. [L4N1N304G]

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told reporters on Friday that China would “create a good atmosphere” with informal activities for the two presidents, so they have ample time to talk about important issues.

Zheng said that at the April summit, Trump and his wife Melania had extended an “extremely warm, friendly and thoughtful” reception to Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan. “The Chinese people demand that courtesy be repaid in kind,” he said.

Trump is a popular figure for many in China, who admire his business acumen; he is not the divisive figure he is in the United States and its allies in Europe and elsewhere.

The WeChat account of the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily marked China’s announcement of his visit with a picture of a beaming Trump and the headline “Trump’s coming!”

STARK CONTRAST

A contrast between the two presidents was set at the start of the year.

Days ahead of Trump taking office, Xi was the keynote speaker at the World Economic Forum in Davos, offering a vigorous defense of globalization. Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership his first week in office, distancing America from its Asian allies.

One Beijing-based Western diplomat said Xi’s strong and confident vision for China contrasts with perceptions that Trump often seems to pick arguments.

But not with China. Trump in office put aside his grievances about China’s trade and currency practices, aired vociferously during the campaign, to get China behind his strategy of punishing sanctions on North Korea for its escalating missile and nuclear tests.

And Beijing accommodated him when he grew frustrated.

Days after Trump’s Sept. 4 tweet that the United States was considering “stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,” Beijing ordered North Korean companies operating within its borders to shut down, banned its exports of textiles and reduced China’s oil exports to the North.

But with North Korea occupying most of the Trump administration’s attention in Asia, China’s construction of military facilities on artificial islands in disputed waters of the South China Sea has seemingly fallen off the radar. Beijing does still get irritated about U.S. navy “freedom of navigation” patrols there, which have continued under Trump.

“Trump is very popular with the (Chinese) military,” said a Chinese official with ties to the military, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It’s great for China that the United States is in chaos. It means we don’t have to worry about them challenging us.”

Trump’s 12-day trip to Asia – the longest by a U.S. president in a quarter-century - will give him a chance to reassure friends and allies in the region, who have expressed uncertainty about his “America First” policies.

Tillerson has already signaled the limits of Washington’s patience with China.

Ahead of a trip to India last month, Tillerson said that “China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly, at times undermining the international, rules-based order,“ and he criticized China for its “predatory economics” and its ”provocative actions in the South China Sea”.

At last month’s party congress, Xi laid out a vision for a prosperous and assertive China taking a bigger place on the global stage.

The congress left China with “greater confidence and lung power, more unhurried in its dealings with the United States,” Wang Wen, president of Renmin University’s Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, wrote in a front page commentary on Friday in the overseas edition of the People’s Daily.","Riding high, Xi looks to soothe Trump as U.S. pressures China",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-trump-asia-china-relationship/riding-high-xi-looks-to-soothe-trump-as-u-s-pressures-china-idUKKBN1D502O

ROMA/MILANO, 3 novembre (Reuters) - Piaggio Aerospace dovrà assicurare la totale separazione tra il ramo jet privati che intende vendere a un consorzio cinese e il business militare, nonché reinvestire i proventi della vendita soprattutto nel programma del drone P2HH.

Sono due punti contenuti nel decreto del Presidente del Consiglio, adottato su proposta della ministra della Difesa Roberta Pinotti, dopo che Mubadala, il fondo sovrano di Abu Dhabi proprietario del gruppo italiano, ha notificato all‘esecutivo il progetto di vendita del ramo di azienda che produce il jet executive P180 nell‘ambito delle procedure previste per il golden power nel settore difesa.

Ad acquisire il ramo d‘azienda sarebbe infatti PAC-Investments, società con sede in Lussemburgo supportata da investitori cinesi sia privati che governativi, si legge nel documento.

Il decreto prevede che Piaggio Aerospace e Mubadala adottino “misure di tutela e di protezione, attive e passive, concernenti ogni elemento, di natura materiale o immateriale, con particolare riguardo ai diritti di proprietà industriale, al know-how, alle informazioni riservate, relativi ai programmi militari”, come quelli dei droni P1HH e P2HH e del velivolo multiruolo MPA.

Qualcomm, which has been fighting a legal battle on many fronts with Apple Inc, said revenue from areas other than smartphones was more than $3 billion in its latest fiscal year, up more than 25 percent from last year.

Revenue from Qualcomm’s chip unit, which supplies both Android smartphone makers and Apple, rose 13 percent in the latest quarter. Licensing revenue, which includes royalties mostly from Apple, sank 36 percent.

Reuters reported earlier this week that Apple would drop the Qualcomm’s chips altogether from its iPhones and iPads from next year, the latest salvo in a longstanding dispute between the two companies.

Apple sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and of refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm also sued some Apple contract manufacturers in April over royalty payments and is trying to ban the sale of iPhones in China.

“We really try to compartmentalize our engagement with Apple ... (and) we do have a lot of engagement with the company and we do speak in our engage on a daily basis with them across multiple areas,” Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told analysts on a conference call.

Qualcomm continues to exclude from its forecast revenue related to the sale of Apple products by the iPhone maker’s contract manufacturers as well as the another licensee in dispute.

It forecast current-quarter revenue of $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion and adjusted earnings of 88 cents to 95 cents per share.

Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.90 billion and a profit of 90 cents per share, per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

While Qualcomm and Apple would be better off with each other, Qualcomm will do just fine even if that’s not the case, Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said.

Qualcomm also reported better-than expected profit and sales for the fourth quarter, despite earnings tumbling nearly 90 percent due to a $778 million charge related to a fine imposed by the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission for anti-trust violations.

The company' adjusted earnings of 92 cents per share beat estimates of 81 cents. Revenue fell 4.5 percent to $5.91 billion, but topped estimates of $5.80 billion. (bit.ly/2z5MwMB)

French and German officials confirmed Le Maire would be in Berlin on Wednesday, when he will meet acting Finance Minister Peter Altmaier, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Le Maire is also due to see Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), and Cem Oezdemir, co-leader of the Greens party. Both are in discussions with Merkel’s conservatives on forming a coalition government.

France’s Emmanuel Macron has made euro zone reform a central goal of his five-year presidency. But any changes will require the support of Merkel and her new government, which is not expected to be in place before Christmas. Lindner has been critical of Macron’s idea to create a budget for the euro zone.

“We want to follow up on the president’s Sorbonne speech and exchange views on the future of the euro zone,” a French finance ministry official said, referring to a speech by Macron in September when he laid out his vision for EU reform.

While Le Maire’s visit - his first to Berlin since the German election - is about strengthening contacts with likely members of the new government, officials indicated that it would also be an opportunity to sound out Berlin on the Eurogroup presidency, a powerful position that will be elected next month.

Since it was created in 2005, the Eurogroup, which brings together the euro zone’s 19 finance ministers, has had only two presidents: Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who served from 2005 to 2013, and former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is due to step down in January.

The position involves chairing monthly meetings and driving policy around economic and monetary union, including ensuring that all member states stick to strict targets on deficits and debt. The post has been dubbed “Mr Euro”.

“NO NATURAL CANDIDATE”

Le Maire, 48, is regarded as sharp, ambitious and more than capable of leading the group. But some euro zone officials are wary about the presidency ending up in the hands of either Germany or France, the two largest economies in the single currency bloc and already dominant forces in policymaking.

A further complication for Le Maire is France’s poor record of meeting its own deficit targets over the past decade. German officials are not ruling out Le Maire, but they have also expressed a preference for giving the post to a smaller country.

Last week, one official in Berlin mentioned two possible alternatives: Pierre Gramegna of Luxembourg and Peter Kazimir of Slovakia. The official also floated the idea of extending Dijsselbloem, seen as a close ally of Berlin, even though he is not part of the new Dutch government.

“It is still quite unclear who will come forward,” the German official said when asked about the presidency. “At this stage there does not seem to be one candidate everyone is rallying behind. There is no natural candidate.”

The Eurogroup president will be chosen on Dec. 4, an EU official said last week, with the formal call for candidates opening in mid-November.

“It is not a done thing,” the German official said of Le Maire’s candidacy. “He will only apply if he gets the impression that he is the one.”

The talks in Berlin on Wednesday could be decisive in determining whether he does throw his hat into the ring.

If Le Maire were to get the job, it could have repercussions for other top euro zone jobs. Mario Draghi will end his term as president of the European Central Bank on Oct. 31, 2019, and Germany’s Jens Weidmann is already being mentioned as a potential successor.

Euro zone watchers say that if the French secure the presidency of the Eurogroup, it may be harder for them to argue against a German candidate taking over the ECB.

Still, as one senior French official told Reuters on condition of anonymity last month, Weidmann at the helm of the ECB “would be a problem for a lot of countries, not just for France”.",France's Le Maire heads to Berlin to test Eurogroup waters,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-germany-lemaire/frances-le-maire-heads-to-berlin-to-test-eurogroup-waters-idUKKBN1D50U8

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.","Maersk says unable to ship Qatar bound cargo from UAE, seeks alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-shipping/maersk-says-unable-to-ship-qatar-bound-cargo-from-uae-seeks-alternatives-idUSKBN18X1YS

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

FILE PHOTO: An overall view of the assembly line where the BMW X4 is made at the BMW manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina March 28, 2014. REUTERS/Chris Keane/File Photo

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

Lonmin, not for the first time, is facing an uncertain future after its shares lost 30 percent on Friday when it delayed annual financial results due this month pending the conclusion of a business review.

The company said it had adequate liquidity to fund it through a review that could include the sale of assets, job cuts and the renegotiation of loan agreements.

There has also been speculation about a deal to combine with fellow South African miner Sibanye-Stillwater (SGLJ.J)

The latest crisis comes after Lonmin said in September that South Africa’s mines ministry had informed it of failure to meet some of its social and labour obligations, but it did not think its operating licence was in jeopardy.

South African mining companies must comply with a number of social and labour regulations, including providing proper housing, to help a mostly black labour force that was exploited and ill-treated under apartheid.

Lonmin has fallen short here before. A probe into the police killing of 34 miners in 2012 during a violent wildcat strike at its Marikana mine found Lonmin had failed in its pledge to build 5,500 houses, with only three erected.

On Monday, the company plans to show how it is now meeting its social and labour obligations, an added cost in a tough environment for all platinum producers.

According to South Africa’s Chamber of Mines, 65 percent of the country’s platinum operations are loss-making as the industry grapples with soaring costs and depressed prices.

Those that are performing well - such as African Rainbow Minerals (ARIJ.J) and Implats’ Two Rivers JV and Anglo American Platinum’s (AMSJ.J) Mogalakwena mine - are mechanised, shielding them from steeply rising wage costs and giving them productivity boosts.

Lonmin several years ago abandoned a failed and costly attempt at mechanisation in the face of an unforgiving geology - one of many missteps that have cost it in the long run.

On a range of fronts, Lonmin is battling. It posted a first-half operating loss of $181 million(£138 million), knocked by a fall in production and rising costs.

The company last month agreed a pre-emptive loan covenant waiver for the period from September 30, 2017 to March 30, 2018. The waiver was to prevent a breach and allow the company to acquire the Pandora JV from Amplats and Northern Platinum (NHMJ.J).

The loans comprise a $150 million term loan and revolving credit facilities totalling $70.8 million from international banks. The loans are committed until May 2019, with a one year extension option.",Lonmin to showcase social projects after share price meltdown,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-lonmin-crisis/lonmin-to-showcase-social-projects-after-share-price-meltdown-idUKKBN1D50U6

Gold is considered an essential part of weddings in India, second-biggest consumer of the metal in the world after China, and it is a popular gift on such occasions.

“The wedding season has started. In the next few weeks, there are many wedding dates, which will boost demand,” said Kumar Jain, a Mumbai-based jeweller.

Dealers in India were charging a premium of up to $3 an ounce this week over official domestic prices, unchanged from last week. The domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax.

“Gold imports by (jewellery) export houses have fallen sharply in the last few weeks. That’s why the market is in premium, despite moderate demand,” said a dealer with a private bank in Mumbai.

In October, India tightened gold import norms for jewellery exporters by restricting them from importing the yellow metal only for export purposes and not for selling in the domestic market.

Meanwhile, in China, the market for the precious metal remained quiet, with premiums of $5 to $9 an ounce being charged over benchmark rates, as against the $6.50 to $10 range in the previous week.

Benchmark spot gold was on track to register a small weekly gain, hovering around the $1,275.00 level as of 0919 GMT on Friday, but still below Thursday’s mark of $1,284.10, highest in nearly two weeks. [GOL/]

“Dips below the $1,270 level (toward the beginning of the week) spurred some buying, but the upside, (around the $1,280 level) limited purchases,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.

Premiums in Hong Kong remained more or less unchanged from last week, in the 60 cents to $1.20 range.

“Premiums are quite low, and except for periodic large sales, the market is quiet,” said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner of J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong.

In Singapore, premiums rose to 70-90 cents from the 50 cents last week.

“There has been interest from two segments, the wholesalers and high net worth individuals, so it is still strong,” said Loh Mun Chun, Director, Private Wealth at GoldSilver Central in Singapore.

“The wholesalers need to buy ... to produce jewellery, especially with some spillover demand coming from the Diwali and Dhanterras festivals, while the high net worth individuals ... buy to diversify their portfolio and they have the money.”

T-Mobile, under charismatic CEO John Legere, keeps hitting home runs, already reporting it that added 1.3 million net customers in the third quarter - the 18th time in a row it has achieved the feat.

T-Mobile reported revenues in the third quarter that topped $10 billion for the first time, up 8 percent.

The picture for Deutsche Telekom group on Thursday is likely to be different, with analysts on average forecasting group revenues of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion) - a year-on-year gain of just 1.6 percent.

That would reflect barely positive growth in Telekom’s crowded and heavily regulated home market, where sales rose just 0.4 percent in the first half, and at its European holdings that were ahead by just 1.5 percent.

Deutsche Telekom, which has toyed with options for its U.S. business for years, put a brave face on the unraveling of the deal on Saturday night, saying T-Mobile would continue its successful growth strategy.

“We supported our American subsidiary to invest more than $40 billion over the last years, thus building a basis for strong growth in the upcoming years,” CEO Tim Hoettges said.

HOME AND AWAY

But some investors wonder whether the best years may now be behind T-Mobile, whose shares have risen ninefold from the low they hit after the global financial crisis to a peak of $68 in June.

“I’d just love them to sell it,” one UK-based fund manager who holds Deutsche Telekom stock said last week as reports surfaced that the T-Mobile-Sprint talks were in trouble.

At T-Mobile’s latest share price, Deutsche Telekom’s 64 percent stake would be worth $31 billion.

“There’s a tendency to run things for ever, sometimes, and then you end up selling at the wrong times,” the fund manager added.

Together, T-Mobile and Sprint would have had about 130 million customers, putting a merged entity a close third in the United States behind market leaders AT&T and Verizon.

Alone, T-Mobile has 70.7 million customers, requiring a lot more good quarters to close the gap on its own.

Lacking sufficient scale and running a mobile-first strategy, T-Mobile may face challenges if Sprint, controlled by Japan’s Softbank Group, revives its efforts to hook up with a U.S. cable firm, according to a top-10 Telekom shareholder.

An approach by Softbank chief Masayoshi Son was rebuffed in July by Charter Communications.

For many foreigners, Prince Alwaleed - whose net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion - is the face of Saudi business, appearing frequently on international television and in articles on his investments and lifestyle.

A 2013 Forbes magazine profile described his marble-filled, 420-room Riyadh palace, a private Boeing 747 equipped with a throne, and his 120-acre resort on the edge of the Saudi capital with five homes, five artificial lakes and a mini-Grand Canyon.

He is also known for his outspoken views on politics - making headlines in 2015 when he called Donald Trump a “disgrace” on Twitter during the U.S. election campaign.

Prince Alwaleed’s investments, current and future, may now be in doubt after he was detained in an investigation by a new Saudi anti-corruption body.

“There will be questions on what this all means,” said a senior executive at a European financial institution, who visited Riyadh late last month to attend a big international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination.

“People will be looking at any kind of international holdings of the people who have been arrested, to see what will be the impact.”

Aside from a stake in Citigroup, Prince Alwaleed, 62, owns significant stakes in Twitter, ride-hailing firm Lyft and Time Warner.

His investment firm Kingdom Holding - whose share price plunged 10 percent on Sunday in response to news of his detention - recently bought about half of a 31.1 percent stake in Saudi lender Banque Saudi Fransi from France’s Credit Agricole.

FINANCE MINISTER‘S SON

Prince Alwaleed’s father was the kingdom’s finance minister during the 1960s. Prince Alwaleed formed Kingdom Holding in 1979, initially pouring money into real estate in Riyadh; in the 1990s he ventured into Wall Street, investing heavily in Citigroup.

He had a close relationship with former Citigroup Chief Executive Sanford “Sandy” Weill, and has nurtured close ties with other Wall Street leaders including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

Prince Alwaleed increased his stake in Citigroup at the height of the global financial crisis a decade ago and he has held on to the stake, saying as recently as last month that he was very happy with the investment.

“He’s always been a colourful and unofficial public face of Saudi Arabia, though he has never been a key decision-maker in the kingdom,” a Gulf-based businessman said.

During the U.S. election campaign, Prince Alwaleed demanded that Trump withdraw from the election campaign after the candidate pledged to ban Muslims’ entry into the United States.

Trump responded by tweeting that the Saudi prince wanted to control “our politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it after I get elected.”

After Trump’s election victory, Prince Alwaleed said whatever their past differences, America had spoken, and he congratulated Trump on his victory.

The startup, which makes robots for the elderly, was the first Israeli investment for Toyota AI Ventures, a new $100 million fund investing in artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous mobility and data and cloud computing.

“We will see more involvement of Toyota in the Israeli market in the future,” said Jim Adler, managing director of California-based Toyota AI Ventures, which is part of the $1 billion Toyota Research Institute.

“There’s more in the pipeline,” he told Reuters during a visit to Israel, adding that technologies dealing with perception and prediction and planning were of particular interest to Toyota.

Perception technology enables a self-driving vehicle to understand the world around it while prediction and planning can help a car interpret situations such as whether a child at an intersection might try to cross at a red light.

“There’s a tremendous amount of innovation happening in Israel as cars become more produced by data,” said Adler, who is in the country meeting companies whose technologies interest Toyota.

Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Earlier this year Intel Corp bought autonomous vehicle firm Mobileye - one of Israel’s biggest tech companies - for $15.3 billion.

On Friday Germany’s Continental AG said it was buying Israel’s Argus Cyber Security, whose technology guards connected cars against hacking.

Toyota AI Ventures has made five investments and expects to invest in at least 20 companies worldwide.

Regarding its investment in Intuition Robotics - which plans to begin trials of its robots with older adults in their homes early next year - Adler said there were many common features between robotics and autonomous vehicles, which he referred to as “big robots with wheels”.

Japan’s population is aging, with 40 percent expected to be over 65 in 20 years, he said, and there will be demand for technologies that help the elderly stay in their homes, rather than have to move to assisted-living facilities.

“We think Toyota will have a role there,” he said.","Toyota seeks more investments in Israeli auto tech, robotics",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1D50OI-OCATC

ティラーソン米国務長官が中東を歴訪した目的はただ２つ。イランに対抗する地域的枠組みにイラクを取り込むこと、そしてカタールに対する禁輸措置を終了するようサウジアラビアを説得することだった。１０月２７日、米国はこの３年間、ＩＳ打倒を最優先する中東政策をとってきたが、問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。写真はティラーソン米国務長官。カタールで２４日代表撮影（２０１７年 ロイター）だが、どちらも不首尾に終わった。過激派組織「イスラム国（ＩＳ）」が事実上の首都としていたシリアのラッカが陥落し、ようやく戦塵は収まりつつある。米国政府とその主導による有志連合が中東地域にとどまらず広範囲で収めた大きな成功だ。実際の戦闘の大半は現地勢力によって担われたとはいえ、米国による支援がなければ、依然としてＩＳがこの地域に広大な占領地を維持していたのはほぼ確実だ。ＩＳが２０１４年に劇的な勝利を重ねたことで、特にイラク、サウジアラビア両国政府はひどく混乱した。だが、ＩＳが窮地に追い詰められた今、どちらの政府も米国にあれこれ指図されることを快く思っていない。トランプ政権、オバマ政権のどちらも認めたくないかもしれないが、実はこの３年間、両政権とも中東政策に関しては似たようなアプローチをとっている。「ＩＳ最優先」と呼ばれることもあるが、中東地域のその他すべての利害よりも、ＩＳ打倒を優先してきたのである。これは理にかなったアプローチで、結果的に大きな成功を収めた。問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。核となる行動規範がないため、ただでさえ矛盾を抱えるアプローチが完全に崩壊してしまうリスクが顕在化している。いくつかの面で、そのリスクはすでに現実のものとなっている。米国政府と、シーア派主導でイランと同盟関係にあるイラク政府、またイラク領内のさまざまなクルド人政治組織との関係はこれまでも常にギクシャクしていたが、イスラム国の脅威が減るなかで、急速に悪化しつつある。９月にはクルド地域の独立を問う住民投票が行われたが、イラク政府はその直後、クルド地域の都市キルクーク周辺の石油資源が豊富な地域に進出した。クルド人勢力とイラク政府軍のあいだで衝突も相次いだ。中東のそれ以外の地域では、スンニ派・シーア派間の歴史的なライバル関係が複雑化の様相を強めている。シリアでは、アサド政権を救おうというイラン、ロシアの企図が実質的に成功した。米国政府はこれを、安定性の確保とＩＳに対する反撃のための代償として容認しているように見える。その一方で、サウジアラビアに対しては、イエメンにおいてイラン政府と同盟関係にあるフーシ派の掃討を進めることを事実上黙認している。ＩＳの弱体化に伴い、トランプ政権は現在、イランへの対抗を米中東政策全般における最優先課題とすることを明らかに望んでいる。これまでのところ、それを最も明瞭に示しているのは、トランプ大統領が１０月１３日に前政権が交渉したイラン核合意を承認しないと発表したことである。その後まもなく、米国がテロ支援組織に指定しているイラン革命防衛隊に対する新たな制裁が発表された。だが対イランに関しては、米国政府がＩＳに対して結成したような広範囲かつ一枚岩の有志連合を生み出す現実的なチャンスはほとんどない。イラン政府に対するアプローチとして何が最善なのか、米国の同盟諸国のあいだには依然として深い溝があり、欧州諸国は、ロシアも中国も署名している核合意を破棄することについて、気が進まない姿勢を明らかにしている。湾岸諸国は、統一的な連合とはとうてい言いがたい状態にある。サウジアラビア、アラブ首長国連邦が支持する対カタール禁輸措置は継続されており、これら３カ国すべてに重要な軍事基地を持つ米国は居心地の悪い立場に置かれている。米国政府がこの状況を修復する能力はきわめて限定されているように思われる。１０月２７日、米国はこの３年間、ＩＳ打倒を最優先する中東政策をとってきたが、問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。写真はティラーソン米国務長官。サウジアラビアの首都リヤドで２２日代表撮影（２０１７年 ロイター）カタールの近隣諸国は、同国がムスリム同胞団などの組織を支援していることに怒っており、この対立は米国政府が仲裁できる領域を超えてしまっている可能性がある。しかしそれはともかく、ティラーソン氏が、中東歴訪のもう１つの目的であるイラク政府の立場を反イランに転向させるのに成功する可能性は、さらに低かった。ＩＳ打倒に関して、イラク政府は、米国政府やクルド人勢力に頼るのと少なくとも同じ程度に、イランの支援を受けたシーア派民兵に依存していた。ティラーソン氏がシーア派民兵に対し、イランに帰国するよう求めたことは、ひどく不合理な要求と受け止められた可能性がある。何しろ、その構成員の多くはシーア派イラク国民だからである。ティラーソン氏の訪問は、オバマ政権以来高まっていた言説をさらに補強してしまうリスクがある。つまり、従来の友好国・敵対国双方に対して同じように、米国の支配力・影響力がいっそう低下している、というものだ。しかもこれら諸国では、今やプーチン大統領率いるロシアに接近するという選択肢さえあるという感覚が強まっている。遠く１９世紀末以来、米国の信頼できる同盟国であったトルコは、エルドアン大統領のもとで、ますます反米的な意識を強めている。エジプトの軍事政権も、引き続き米国から大量の支援を受けているとはいえ、独自性を主張することにますます熱心になっている。イスラエルとの関係においては、オバマ政権時代よりトランプ政権の方がわずかに改善されているかもしれないが、それでもここ数十年に比べればかなり疎遠になっている。イスラエル・パレスチナ間の紛争に関する「２国家共存」案について、トランプ氏は曖昧なシグナルを送っている。米国大使館をテルアビブからエルサレムに移転させることを提案する一方で、今年前半には、イスラエルが提供したＩＳに関する機密情報をロシア外相に漏らしたことが報道され、イスラエル側を動揺させている。イスラエルはイランの影響力拡大とトランプ政権の予測しにくさに懸念を抱いており、特に湾岸諸国との独自の地域外交努力を強めていくことになろう。ＩＳに対する有志連合の取り組みがほぼ成功を収めるのと同時進行で、このような状況が生じているのは逆説的である。その有志連合は、米国に深く依存していたのだし、このような有志連合をまさにこのような形でまとめ上げることは、恐らく他のどの国にもできなかっただろう。米国政府は、かつてのイラクに対する単独主義的な武力介入とは対照的に、対ＩＳにおいては域内諸勢力と協力し、彼らを介在させることに大きな努力を注ぎ、それが顕著な効果を発揮することになったのである。米国の軍事的な支援は今後も続くだろう。ＩＳは完全に消滅したわけではなく、攻撃を続けるだろう。リビアやアフガニスタンの一部におけるように、新たに安全な潜伏地を確保するかもしれない。アルカイダに刺激された武装勢力に対するより広範囲の戦いは確実に続くだろうし、多くの場合は、米国による軍事的な支援・協調を伴うことだろう。だが、１０年以上にわたる戦争が失敗に終わったとみられる今、中東再編という試みに向けた米国の熱意は冷めていくかもしれない。そして、仮に米国の熱意が維持されるとしても、中東の諸勢力の側で、米国の声に耳を傾けようという気持ちがうせてしまう可能性はある。＊筆者はロイターのコラムニスト。元ロイターの防衛担当記者で、現在はシンクタンク「Project for Study of the 21st Century（ＰＳ２１）」を立ち上げ、理事を務める。＊本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。（翻訳：エァクレーレン）＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。,"［２７日 ロイター］ -

だが、どちらも不首尾に終わった。

過激派組織「イスラム国（ＩＳ）」が事実上の首都としていたシリアのラッカが陥落し、ようやく戦塵は収まりつつある。米国政府とその主導による有志連合が中東地域にとどまらず広範囲で収めた大きな成功だ。

実際の戦闘の大半は現地勢力によって担われたとはいえ、米国による支援がなければ、依然としてＩＳがこの地域に広大な占領地を維持していたのはほぼ確実だ。ＩＳが２０１４年に劇的な勝利を重ねたことで、特にイラク、サウジアラビア両国政府はひどく混乱した。だが、ＩＳが窮地に追い詰められた今、どちらの政府も米国にあれこれ指図されることを快く思っていない。

トランプ政権、オバマ政権のどちらも認めたくないかもしれないが、実はこの３年間、両政権とも中東政策に関しては似たようなアプローチをとっている。「ＩＳ最優先」と呼ばれることもあるが、中東地域のその他すべての利害よりも、ＩＳ打倒を優先してきたのである。これは理にかなったアプローチで、結果的に大きな成功を収めた。

問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。核となる行動規範がないため、ただでさえ矛盾を抱えるアプローチが完全に崩壊してしまうリスクが顕在化している。

いくつかの面で、そのリスクはすでに現実のものとなっている。

米国政府と、シーア派主導でイランと同盟関係にあるイラク政府、またイラク領内のさまざまなクルド人政治組織との関係はこれまでも常にギクシャクしていたが、イスラム国の脅威が減るなかで、急速に悪化しつつある。９月にはクルド地域の独立を問う住民投票が行われたが、イラク政府はその直後、クルド地域の都市キルクーク周辺の石油資源が豊富な地域に進出した。クルド人勢力とイラク政府軍のあいだで衝突も相次いだ。

中東のそれ以外の地域では、スンニ派・シーア派間の歴史的なライバル関係が複雑化の様相を強めている。

シリアでは、アサド政権を救おうというイラン、ロシアの企図が実質的に成功した。米国政府はこれを、安定性の確保とＩＳに対する反撃のための代償として容認しているように見える。その一方で、サウジアラビアに対しては、イエメンにおいてイラン政府と同盟関係にあるフーシ派の掃討を進めることを事実上黙認している。

ＩＳの弱体化に伴い、トランプ政権は現在、イランへの対抗を米中東政策全般における最優先課題とすることを明らかに望んでいる。

これまでのところ、それを最も明瞭に示しているのは、トランプ大統領が１０月１３日に前政権が交渉したイラン核合意を承認しないと発表したことである。その後まもなく、米国がテロ支援組織に指定しているイラン革命防衛隊に対する新たな制裁が発表された。

だが対イランに関しては、米国政府がＩＳに対して結成したような広範囲かつ一枚岩の有志連合を生み出す現実的なチャンスはほとんどない。イラン政府に対するアプローチとして何が最善なのか、米国の同盟諸国のあいだには依然として深い溝があり、欧州諸国は、ロシアも中国も署名している核合意を破棄することについて、気が進まない姿勢を明らかにしている。

湾岸諸国は、統一的な連合とはとうてい言いがたい状態にある。サウジアラビア、アラブ首長国連邦が支持する対カタール禁輸措置は継続されており、これら３カ国すべてに重要な軍事基地を持つ米国は居心地の悪い立場に置かれている。米国政府がこの状況を修復する能力はきわめて限定されているように思われる。

カタールの近隣諸国は、同国がムスリム同胞団などの組織を支援していることに怒っており、この対立は米国政府が仲裁できる領域を超えてしまっている可能性がある。

しかしそれはともかく、ティラーソン氏が、中東歴訪のもう１つの目的であるイラク政府の立場を反イランに転向させるのに成功する可能性は、さらに低かった。

ＩＳ打倒に関して、イラク政府は、米国政府やクルド人勢力に頼るのと少なくとも同じ程度に、イランの支援を受けたシーア派民兵に依存していた。ティラーソン氏がシーア派民兵に対し、イランに帰国するよう求めたことは、ひどく不合理な要求と受け止められた可能性がある。何しろ、その構成員の多くはシーア派イラク国民だからである。

ティラーソン氏の訪問は、オバマ政権以来高まっていた言説をさらに補強してしまうリスクがある。つまり、従来の友好国・敵対国双方に対して同じように、米国の支配力・影響力がいっそう低下している、というものだ。

しかもこれら諸国では、今やプーチン大統領率いるロシアに接近するという選択肢さえあるという感覚が強まっている。遠く１９世紀末以来、米国の信頼できる同盟国であったトルコは、エルドアン大統領のもとで、ますます反米的な意識を強めている。エジプトの軍事政権も、引き続き米国から大量の支援を受けているとはいえ、独自性を主張することにますます熱心になっている。

イスラエルとの関係においては、オバマ政権時代よりトランプ政権の方がわずかに改善されているかもしれないが、それでもここ数十年に比べればかなり疎遠になっている。イスラエル・パレスチナ間の紛争に関する「２国家共存」案について、トランプ氏は曖昧なシグナルを送っている。

米国大使館をテルアビブからエルサレムに移転させることを提案する一方で、今年前半には、イスラエルが提供したＩＳに関する機密情報をロシア外相に漏らしたことが報道され、イスラエル側を動揺させている。イスラエルはイランの影響力拡大とトランプ政権の予測しにくさに懸念を抱いており、特に湾岸諸国との独自の地域外交努力を強めていくことになろう。

ＩＳに対する有志連合の取り組みがほぼ成功を収めるのと同時進行で、このような状況が生じているのは逆説的である。その有志連合は、米国に深く依存していたのだし、このような有志連合をまさにこのような形でまとめ上げることは、恐らく他のどの国にもできなかっただろう。

米国政府は、かつてのイラクに対する単独主義的な武力介入とは対照的に、対ＩＳにおいては域内諸勢力と協力し、彼らを介在させることに大きな努力を注ぎ、それが顕著な効果を発揮することになったのである。

米国の軍事的な支援は今後も続くだろう。ＩＳは完全に消滅したわけではなく、攻撃を続けるだろう。リビアやアフガニスタンの一部におけるように、新たに安全な潜伏地を確保するかもしれない。アルカイダに刺激された武装勢力に対するより広範囲の戦いは確実に続くだろうし、多くの場合は、米国による軍事的な支援・協調を伴うことだろう。

だが、１０年以上にわたる戦争が失敗に終わったとみられる今、中東再編という試みに向けた米国の熱意は冷めていくかもしれない。そして、仮に米国の熱意が維持されるとしても、中東の諸勢力の側で、米国の声に耳を傾けようという気持ちがうせてしまう可能性はある。

European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts.

Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries.

The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it.

Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package.

The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code.

Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business.

However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units.

Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs.

BLUNT INSTRUMENT

“Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

“I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee.

Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes.

As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018.

European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.

Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties.

“That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy.

He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.”

Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes.

The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law.

The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns.

The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week.

Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well.

There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.

It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said.

“You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?”

Researchers said on Thursday these orangutans boast genetic, skeletal and tooth differences from the two other species of orangutan, meriting recognition as a unique third species. That would bring to seven the number of great ape species worldwide aside from people, alongside Africa’s eastern and western gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos.

Scientists are worried about the future of the newly identified species, one of humankind’s closest relatives. They have labeled the species the Tapanuli orangutan, with the scientific name Pongo tapanuliensis.

“There are no more than 800 individuals remaining across three fragmented forest areas,” said conservation biologist Matthew Nowak of the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme.

In addition to threats like hunting by humans, Nowak said, “Significant areas of the Tapanuli orangutan’s range are seriously threatened by habitat conversion for small-scale agriculture, mining exploration and exploitation, a large-scale hydroelectric scheme, geothermal development and agricultural plantations.”

Orangutan means “person of the forest” in the Indonesian and Malay languages, and it is the world’s biggest arboreal mammal. Orangutans are adapted to living in trees, with their arms longer than their legs. They live more solitary lives than other great apes, sleeping and eating fruit in the forest canopy and swinging from branch to branch.

“It’s pretty exciting to be able to describe a new great ape species in this day and age,” said University of Zurich evolutionary geneticist Michael Krützen, adding that most great apes species are listed as endangered or critically endangered.

“We must do everything possible to protect the habitats in which these magnificent animals occur, not only because of them, but also because of all the other animal and plant species that we can protect at the same time.”

Orangutans long were considered a single species, but were recognized as having two species in 1996, one in Sumatra and one in Borneo.

The new species lives south of what was the known range for Sumatran orangutans. This population was unknown to scientists until two decades ago. In addition to genetic differences from the other species, the researchers said the skeleton of a Tapanuli orangutan that died after being wounded by villagers showed differences in tooth and skull shape.

Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.","(Reuters) - Communications chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) is planning to unveil a bid for smartphone chip supplier Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) by Monday, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, an attempt to create a roughly $200-billion company through the biggest technology acquisition ever.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California.

Japan has fared better following the U.S. election than might have been expected. Abe rushed to meet Trump soon after he won and has since maintained close contact. The result has been a better rapport than most world leaders enjoy with the disrupter-in-chief. And despite Trump’s hatred of trade imbalances, his transactional worldview, and radical suggestions during the campaign about Asian security, America has recommitted to the longstanding alliance.

The latest face-to-face talks are likely to focus on the threat across the Sea of Japan. That makes sense: both men take a similarly dim view of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. And Tokyo fears being surprised by a U.S. strike, which could have unpredictable consequences.

Abe mostly likes the economic status quo, though. Maintaining it will be a challenge given Trump’s instincts, and the $57 billion trade surplus Japan ran last year with the United States. Tokyo does not want a bilateral trade deal forcing down the gap by opening up sensitive markets such as rice. It prefers bigger pacts, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which it has helped stitch back together after the U.S. withdrawal. Any pressure to strengthen the yen, now comfortably weak at 114 per dollar, would also be worrying. It could derail a lengthening upturn in growth.

As Takuji Okubo of Japan Macro Advisors notes, Abe already has successfully separated the “potentially thorny trade issues” from the top political relationship. These are now being handled separately by Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy PM Taro Aso.

The arrangement turns such matters into slower-burn, more technocratic issues. That has been yielding small wins for both sides: most recently on persimmons and potatoes, for example.

The Facebook page and other social media sites were bombarded by criticisms of the change. Many Persian speakers say the name Dari has been imposed historically by the traditionally dominant Pashto ethnic group as an implicit denial of Afghanistan’s place in the wider Persian-speaking world.

The reaction highlighted the sensitivity of linguistic issues in Afghanistan, a country with a mix of over 35 languages spoken by ethnic groups including Pashtuns, Tajiks and Hazaras as well as Uzbeks and Turkmen.

It also echoed some of the tensions around the government led by President Ashraf Ghani, which was formed after the disputed 2014 election and which is seen by many Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras as favouring his own Pashtun ethnicity.

While the Persian spoken in Afghanistan and neighbouring Iran have distinct accents and numerous variations in vocabulary and usage, other essentials are the same, with the gap between the two sometimes compared to the differences between the French spoken in France and Canada.

“My language is Farsi,” said Mujib Rahman Rahimi, spokesman for Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, whose Jamiat-e-Islami party draws its support mainly from Tajiks.

“The time of betrayal of our language and culture is past. We will not allow anyone else to choose a name for our language,” he wrote on his personal Facebook page.

However not all reaction was negative and some other users supported the move, saying it reinforced Afghanistan’s national identity: “I am from Afghanistan, not Persia or the Persian race,” wrote one.

There was also no sign the reaction would harm the BBC’s ability to report or have major political repercussions in Afghanistan. Combined BBC services are estimated to reach about 6.6 million Afghans out of a total population of some 35 million, according to figures last year from the BBC Trust.

The head of the BBC’s Afghan service, Meena Baktash defended the use of the term Dari, noting that it was the official name of the language in Afghanistan.

She said the change was intended to link the Facebook page to the BBC Dari radio service, which was launched in 2003 and which, together with the BBC Pashto service, occupies an important place in the crowded local media landscape.

“There are absolutely no political and cultural reasons behind our decision,” she wrote in a statement on Facebook, which, as in other countries, has taken off in Afghanistan to become one of the main sources of news and comment.

Along with Pashto, the language of the Pashtuns, Dari is named in the constitution as one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.

But many Afghan Persian speakers say their language is the same as the one spoken in Iran and Tajikistan and say the name Dari was favoured by past Pashtun leaders as a means of distancing Afghanistan from the Persian cultural sphere.

“The division of the Farsi language into Dari, Farsi and Tajiki is contrary to the reality of our common language and the vast expanse of our common culture and civilization,” Abdul Hai Khurasani, a scholar and former aide to the late Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud wrote in a letter to the director general of the BBC World Service which he posted on Facebook.",BBC name change stirs language row in Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-bbc/bbc-name-change-stirs-language-row-in-afghanistan-idINKBN1D50NT

全球最大网上零售商亚马逊（Amazon）上周公布第三季业绩后股价强势创新高，创办人贝索斯（Jeff Bezos）身家突破九百亿美元，超越微软创办人盖茨（Bill Gates）成为世界首富。

企业市值有上有落，首富易角不足为奇，贝索斯今年七月亦曾短暂登上这个宝座，惟席未坐暖已因亚马逊股价回落而迅速让位，盖茨首富名号失而复得。随着亚马逊近期在股市表现神勇，微软相形失色，贝索斯这次相信可以在全球第一富豪之位多坐一会。

Trump hailed the “good chemistry” of the sunny summit in Florida and predicted “lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away.”

The “bromance” is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trump’s visit starting on Wednesday. Xi has grown more powerful since their last meeting, while Trump is under a political cloud after his former campaign manager was indicted in an intensifying investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Chinese experts say Beijing has learned to manage Trump, a real-estate mogul who had never held elective office before becoming president, and whose administration in its first 10 months has been turbulent.

“China has an objective view of him. We’re going to make him feel comfortable,” said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. “He may end up being re-elected. We need to look at this from a long-term perspective, and not view him as an ‘other’ or a joke.”

Trump clearly respects Xi.

In a congratulatory phone call, Trump hailed the “extraordinary elevation” of Xi, whose political thoughts were enshrined in the Communist Party’s constitution last month during a congress marking the start of his second term.

Aboard Air Force One on his way to Asia, Trump cited record stock market levels, low unemployment and Islamic State “virtually defeated in the Middle East” as evidence of his own success.

“(Xi) knows that and he respects that,” Trump said, adding trade is still an irritant in ties.

“I think he’s viewing us as very, very strong and also very friendly. Look we have to do better with trade with China because it’s a one way street right now. It has been for many years. And we will.”

‘STATE-PLUS’

China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said Trump will receive a “state visit-plus” experience in Beijing.

It’s unclear what the “plus” means. Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details. The protocol will let Trump “rejoice in grandiosity”, important to keeping relations stable, said Teng Jianqun, head of American Studies at Foreign Ministry think-tank China Institute for International Studies.

“We must seize upon his special characteristics, such as liking instant gratification, and set up some things that bring immediate results,” he said.

On the commercial front, that means a slew of deals - and worries among some in the U.S. business community that the transactional Trump will be placated by a handful of contract wins instead of resolving long-standing complaints over discriminatory Chinese policies and market access restrictions. [L4N1N304G]

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told reporters on Friday that China would “create a good atmosphere” with informal activities for the two presidents, so they have ample time to talk about important issues.

Zheng said that at the April summit, Trump and his wife Melania had extended an “extremely warm, friendly and thoughtful” reception to Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan. “The Chinese people demand that courtesy be repaid in kind,” he said.

Trump is a popular figure for many in China, who admire his business acumen; he is not the divisive figure he is in the United States and its allies in Europe and elsewhere.

The WeChat account of the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily marked China’s announcement of his visit with a picture of a beaming Trump and the headline “Trump’s coming!”

STARK CONTRAST

A contrast between the two presidents was set at the start of the year.

Days ahead of Trump taking office, Xi was the keynote speaker at the World Economic Forum in Davos, offering a vigorous defense of globalization. Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership his first week in office, distancing America from its Asian allies.

One Beijing-based Western diplomat said Xi’s strong and confident vision for China contrasts with perceptions that Trump often seems to pick arguments.

But not with China. Trump in office put aside his grievances about China’s trade and currency practices, aired vociferously during the campaign, to get China behind his strategy of punishing sanctions on North Korea for its escalating missile and nuclear tests.

And Beijing accommodated him when he grew frustrated.

Days after Trump’s Sept. 4 tweet that the United States was considering “stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,” Beijing ordered North Korean companies operating within its borders to shut down, banned its exports of textiles and reduced China’s oil exports to the North.

But with North Korea occupying most of the Trump administration’s attention in Asia, China’s construction of military facilities on artificial islands in disputed waters of the South China Sea has seemingly fallen off the radar. Beijing does still get irritated about U.S. navy “freedom of navigation” patrols there, which have continued under Trump.

“Trump is very popular with the (Chinese) military,” said a Chinese official with ties to the military, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It’s great for China that the United States is in chaos. It means we don’t have to worry about them challenging us.”

Trump’s 12-day trip to Asia – the longest by a U.S. president in a quarter-century - will give him a chance to reassure friends and allies in the region, who have expressed uncertainty about his “America First” policies.

Tillerson has already signaled the limits of Washington’s patience with China.

Ahead of a trip to India last month, Tillerson said that “China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly, at times undermining the international, rules-based order,“ and he criticized China for its “predatory economics” and its ”provocative actions in the South China Sea”.

At last month’s party congress, Xi laid out a vision for a prosperous and assertive China taking a bigger place on the global stage.

The congress left China with “greater confidence and lung power, more unhurried in its dealings with the United States,” Wang Wen, president of Renmin University’s Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, wrote in a front page commentary on Friday in the overseas edition of the People’s Daily.","Riding high, Xi looks to soothe Trump as U.S. pressures China",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia-china-relationship/riding-high-xi-looks-to-soothe-trump-as-u-s-pressures-china-idUSKBN1D502M

Puigdemont viajou para a Bélgica pouco após Madri tomar o controle do governo regional da Catalunha. Ele é acusado de diversas ações ligadas ao movimento pró-secessão, incluindo rebelião, sedição, uso indevido de recursos públicos, desobediência e violação de confiança em relação à campanha separatista.

O ex-líder da Catalunha se apresentou à polícia em meio à divulgação de duas pesquisas neste domingo sugerindo que os partidos pró-independência devem juntos conquistar a maior parte dos assentos nas eleições regionais de dezembro, embora possam obter menos que a maioria necessária para ressuscitar a campanha separatista.

Partidos a favor de que a Catalunha continue sendo parte da Espanha devem dividir assentos, reunindo cerca de 54 por cento dos votos, apontaram os levantamentos.

O primeiro-ministro espanhol, Mariano Rajoy, convocou para 21 de dezembro as eleições depois de demitir o governo anterior e decretar administração direta sobre a região autônoma, reagindo à declaração unilateral de independência por parte de parlamentares catalães, no dia 27 de outubro.

O esforços para reconhecimento da independência da Catalunha conduziram a Espanha para a pior crise política desde o retorno à democracia quatro décadas atrás, com o sentimento pró-secessão na região fomentando o nacionalismo em todo o país.

Conforme levantamento da GAD3, realizado com 1.233 pessoas entre 30 de outubro e 3 de novembro e publicada no jornal La Vanguardia, os partidos pró-independência ERC, PDECat e CUP conquistariam entre 66 e 69 das 135 cadeiras do parlamento.

Uma segunda pesquisa realizada no mesmo período para o jornal conservador La Razón mostrou os mesmos resultados apresentados pela GAD3, com os partidos pró-independência obtendo a maior parte dos votos, embora ainda não sejam a maioria com 65 assentos.

A participação dos eleitores aumentaria para um recorde de 83 por cento, mostrou a pesquisa GAD3.

POLÍTICOS DETIDOS

No sábado, Puigdemont, que o PDECat disse neste domingo que lideraria o partido na votação de dezembro, pediu uma frente política catalã unida para as eleições.

Na quinta-feira, nove membros do seu gabinete destituído do poder tiveram pedido de prisão preventiva decretado pela Corte Superior da Espanha em meio a investigações e potencial julgamento.

Um deles, Santi Vila, foi libertado após pagar uma fiança de 50 mil euros na sexta-feira. Os outros oito podem permanecer sob custódia por até quatro anos.

Ainda segundo o levantamento da GAP3, 59 por cento dos entrevistados consideram a ação judicial contra Puigdemont injustificável, enquanto 69,3 por cento disseram que a prisão de políticos catalães daria força ao movimento pró-independência nas urnas.

Grupos cívicos na Catalunha que tiveram os líderes detidos no mês passado, convocaram uma greve geral para 8 de novembro e uma manifestação em massa no dia 11 para protestar contra as prisões.

Uma protesto em Barcelona neste domingo, contudo, atraiu poucas centenas de participantes, bem menos que as milhares de pessoas que se juntaram às marchas de outubro.",Ex-líder da Catalunha se entrega à polícia; pesquisas apontam mais assentos para separatistas em eleição,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idBRKBN1D50U0-OBRWD

About 3,000 people had been evacuated and housed in temporary shelters as nearly 80 percent of Penang was hit by typhoon-like winds and heavy rain, its chief minister Lim Guan Eng said in a statement.

He said floodwaters had risen to 3-4 meters (10-12 feet). Lim also warned in a Facebook post that more rain was expected and advised residents to stay at home.

Troops fanned out in Penang to rescue stranded flood victims and also to clear blocked routes and clean up.

Hundreds of trees were toppled and roads were submerged in Penang’s historic capital of George Town, leaving many areas largely paralyzed. The Malaysian state news agency said five people had been killed due to the floods.

“We remain fearful that there may still be untoward incidents because of the strong winds, the like of which have never been experienced before, and flash floods might recur,” Lim told reporters in Penang earlier on Sunday, according to Bernama.

The Southeast Asian nation’s meteorological service forecast stormy weather continuing in Penang as well as the neighboring northern states of Kedah and Perlis.","Flash floods kill five in Malaysia, army deploys to rescue thousands of displaced",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-malaysia-floods/flash-floods-kill-five-in-malaysia-army-deploys-to-rescue-thousands-of-displaced-idUKKBN1D5089?il=0

Hariri left Lebanon for Saudi Arabia on Friday and resigned on Saturday in a televised statement that took the Lebanese political establishment by surprise.

He cited an assassination plot against him and criticized the regional role of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah however Lebanon’s army said on Sunday it had not uncovered any plot.

The move has thrust Lebanon back into the arena of regional rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, an ally of Hariri, and Shi‘ite Muslim Iran, which backs Hezbollah.

President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, will wait to accept or reject Hariri’s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to explain his reasons, sources at the presidential palace said.

Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat cited unnamed sources close to Hariri as speculating that he would probably remain outside Lebanon because of the security threat against him.

Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh sought to calm fears the political turmoil unleashed by Hariri’s bid to resign would hit Lebanon’s already fragile economy, issuing a statement to reaffirm the stability of its currency, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar.

In Lebanon’s sectarian system the president must be a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shi‘ite. Hariri is Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

His father, Rafik al-Hariri, was prime minister after Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war and was assassinated in a car bombing in 2005.

A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted five Hezbollah members for the killing but the group denies any involvement.

Saudi media have published reports of a plot to assassinate Hariri in recent days, but all of Lebanon’s main security branches have said they have no information about such a plot.

A Saudi minister said on Saturday that Hariri’s personal security detail had “confirmed information” about the plot. Thamer al-Sabhan said in an interview with a Lebanese TV station on Saturday that there are “threats against the prime minister and the Kingdom is keen for his security”.

T-Mobile, under charismatic CEO John Legere, keeps hitting home runs, already reporting it that added 1.3 million net customers in the third quarter - the 18th time in a row it has achieved the feat.

T-Mobile reported revenues in the third quarter that topped $10 billion for the first time, up 8 percent.

The picture for Deutsche Telekom group on Thursday is likely to be different, with analysts on average forecasting group revenues of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion) - a year-on-year gain of just 1.6 percent.

That would reflect barely positive growth in Telekom’s crowded and heavily regulated home market, where sales rose just 0.4 percent in the first half, and at its European holdings that were ahead by just 1.5 percent.

Deutsche Telekom, which has toyed with options for its U.S. business for years, put a brave face on the unraveling of the deal on Saturday night, saying T-Mobile would continue its successful growth strategy.

“We supported our American subsidiary to invest more than $40 billion over the last years, thus building a basis for strong growth in the upcoming years,” CEO Tim Hoettges said.

HOME AND AWAY

But some investors wonder whether the best years may now be behind T-Mobile, whose shares have risen ninefold from the low they hit after the global financial crisis to a peak of $68 in June.

“I’d just love them to sell it,” one UK-based fund manager who holds Deutsche Telekom stock said last week as reports surfaced that the T-Mobile-Sprint talks were in trouble.

At T-Mobile’s latest share price, Deutsche Telekom’s 64 percent stake would be worth $31 billion.

“There’s a tendency to run things for ever, sometimes, and then you end up selling at the wrong times,” the fund manager added.

Together, T-Mobile and Sprint would have had about 130 million customers, putting a merged entity a close third in the United States behind market leaders AT&T and Verizon.

Alone, T-Mobile has 70.7 million customers, requiring a lot more good quarters to close the gap on its own.

Lacking sufficient scale and running a mobile-first strategy, T-Mobile may face challenges if Sprint, controlled by Japan’s Softbank Group, revives its efforts to hook up with a U.S. cable firm, according to a top-10 Telekom shareholder.

An approach by Softbank chief Masayoshi Son was rebuffed in July by Charter Communications.

Sandra, who was already well practised in a circus trick involving a shaving brush, was given a paintbrush and she quickly adapted her skills to the canvas.

Richter said that unlike many elephants in Thailand that are thought to be forced to paint, Sandra does it by herself when she is in the mood.

“I only help her with changing the brushes and putting them into paints but she does the rest by herself more or less. I praise her by saying ‘oh this is really good, or not so good’,” Richter said. “We have been together for 40 years so this is a family connection.”

Sandra arrived as a baby elephant at the circus where Richter grew up, as a seventh generation member of an acrobat family.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

T-Mobile, under charismatic CEO John Legere, keeps hitting home runs, already reporting it that added 1.3 million net customers in the third quarter - the 18th time in a row it has achieved the feat.

T-Mobile reported revenues in the third quarter that topped $10 billion for the first time, up 8 percent.

The picture for Deutsche Telekom group on Thursday is likely to be different, with analysts on average forecasting group revenues of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion) - a year-on-year gain of just 1.6 percent.

That would reflect barely positive growth in Telekom’s crowded and heavily regulated home market, where sales rose just 0.4 percent in the first half, and at its European holdings that were ahead by just 1.5 percent.

Deutsche Telekom, which has toyed with options for its U.S. business for years, put a brave face on the unraveling of the deal on Saturday night, saying T-Mobile would continue its successful growth strategy.

“We supported our American subsidiary to invest more than $40 billion over the last years, thus building a basis for strong growth in the upcoming years,” CEO Tim Hoettges said.

HOME AND AWAY

But some investors wonder whether the best years may now be behind T-Mobile, whose shares have risen ninefold from the low they hit after the global financial crisis to a peak of $68 in June.

“I’d just love them to sell it,” one UK-based fund manager who holds Deutsche Telekom stock said last week as reports surfaced that the T-Mobile-Sprint talks were in trouble.

At T-Mobile’s latest share price, Deutsche Telekom’s 64 percent stake would be worth $31 billion.

“There’s a tendency to run things for ever, sometimes, and then you end up selling at the wrong times,” the fund manager added.

Together, T-Mobile and Sprint would have had about 130 million customers, putting a merged entity a close third in the United States behind market leaders AT&T and Verizon.

Alone, T-Mobile has 70.7 million customers, requiring a lot more good quarters to close the gap on its own.

Lacking sufficient scale and running a mobile-first strategy, T-Mobile may face challenges if Sprint, controlled by Japan’s Softbank Group, revives its efforts to hook up with a U.S. cable firm, according to a top-10 Telekom shareholder.

An approach by Softbank chief Masayoshi Son was rebuffed in July by Charter Communications.

High-yield, or so-called “junk”, bonds are on a tear that puts even record-busting stock markets in the shade. Last week, the yield on the Merrill Lynch global high-yield bond index fell below 5 percent for the first time ever. The European index yields barely 2 percent.

To put that into context, European junk bonds yield less than 10-year U.S. Treasuries trading around 2.35 percent.

If there’s evidence of irrational exuberance anywhere in financial markets, this may be it. And if that’s the case, this will be where the first tremors of a broader market earthquake will likely be felt.

There’s a case to be made that high-yield bonds of firms with sub-investment grade credit ratings are in a sweet spot right now. Economic and company earnings growth are running at the fastest pace in years, yet subdued inflation means the global shift towards tighter monetary policy can be glacial.

Put together, it’s a backdrop against which both stocks and fixed income can do well. Corporate bonds, which offer a higher rate of return than sovereign debt, can do well also.

Within that universe, high-yield paper is doing even better. Ratings agency Moody’s said this week that defaults among U.S. non-financial junk-rated companies fell to a three-year low in the third quarter.

So no surprise, perhaps, that the yield on Merrill Lynch’s global high yield index dipped below 5 percent last week and European junk yields threatened to go below 2 percent.

But it’s precisely this supercharged run that should be ringing the alarm bells for investors. A selloff in high yield could hit stock markets hard.

With stocks around the world higher than they’ve ever been, it’s easy to forget that there was a 20 percent drawdown from mid-2015 to early 2016, a correction that dovetailed with a collapse of the junk bond market.

Historically, the correlation between junk bonds and stocks is nearly always positive, but had shown signs of breaking down through 2014 and early 2015, just before junk bonds and stocks began to slide.

A plunge in oil prices decimated the U.S. high-yield market, which is dominated by energy companies. The yield on Merrill’s global high-yield index jumped to nearly 10 percent in February 2016 from under 6 percent the previous May.

Investors pulled $46 billion out of high-yield bond funds in those 10 months, according to data provider EPFR, during which time MSCI’s world stock index fell 21 percent.

To put that outflow into context, the net inflow into global junk bond funds since January 2010 stands at $64 billion, EPFR figures show.

The correlation between junk bonds and equities is breaking down again. Last month, it fell to 0.18, its lowest in three years. A move back up towards historical norms and average levels would imply the two asset classes rising or falling together at a much closer speed.

Given the lofty heights both markets find themselves at now, investors will be asking whether a correction of, say, 10-20 percent is more likely than a further 10-20 percent increase.

Junk-rated companies are certainly taking advantage of the current sweet spot to borrow at these unprecedented low rates. They’ve issued $366 billion of debt so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, up 35 percent on last year’s total.

But with interest rates rising in the United States and Britain - albeit at the most glacial pace imaginable - that may also be about to level off.

Apple announced plans in February 2015 to build the facility in a rural location in the west of Ireland to take advantage of green energy sources nearby, but the project has faced a two-year delay due to planning objections.

“Absolutely, yes,” Graf told fans and reporters ahead of Sunday’s WTA Elite Trophy singles final in Zhuhai.

“I think a lot of it is determined on her drive and if that is what she wants to do.”

Graf won 22 grand slam singles titles which was eclipsed by Williams in January.

Holi is an annual festival that marks the onset of spring. For festival goers, it also represents a time of forgiveness, renewed friendship and the triumph of good over evil. The celebration is often referred to as the ‘holiday of color,” which is exactly where the problem lies.

“Throwing of (powder or liquid) colors on each other is the hallmark of this festival,” lead author Dr. Shikha Gupta of the Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences in New Delhi said in an email.

Traditionally, Holi colors were made from natural sources, including berries, flowers, spices and other plants, according to India’s National Council of Science Museums.

Manufacture of the powders and liquids is poorly regulated, however, and testing has found the modern versions to contain substances such as malachite green, a suspected carcinogen, rhodamine and gentian violet, Gupta’s team writes online October 20 in the journal Eye. Other common contaminants include lead oxide, copper sulfate, mercury sulfite and mold, the authors note.

These contaminants, through contact with skin, respiratory tract or eyes, can cause complications, the authors write.

For their study, Gupta and colleagues assessed 13 patients complaining of eye pain, the sensation of a foreign particle or excessive redness and eye tearing. All patients had recently attended a Holi festival celebration.

Among these patients’ diagnoses were punctate keratopathy, an inflammation of the cornea, and epithelial defect, a form of eye irritation caused by a scratch, foreign bodies or chemical exposure.

The researchers concluded that punctate keratopathy and epithelial defect specifically were directly related to patients’ exposure to the toxic chemicals ubiquitous in Holi colored-powder compounds.

“These powdered alkaline substances are dangerous because at first you don’t feel them,” said Dr. Andrea Thau, a recent president of the American Optometric Association who wasn’t involved in the study.

“If not irrigated from the eye as quickly as possible, these particles gradually create more and more damage, destroying and disrupting the outer cells of the cornea,” she told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.

“In some patients, the effect is transient,” Gupta said. “Some patients heal in yet another two weeks, but some others may take three months to completely heal and have normal ocular surface.”

Although rooted in Indian tradition, Holi is widely celebrated around the world including in North America, South America and Europe. And Holi is not the only time these potentially toxic powders serve as a main feature in celebratory events.

Color runs - a type of non-traditional road race that celebrates health, happiness and camaraderie among participants - are increasing in popularity. Competitors adorn themselves in vibrant, color-powdered t-shirts. Spectators also throw powder as runners pass by - powders engineered from a potentially similar hazardous formula associated with those used during Holi festival.

More research is needed to establish a cause-and-effect relationship, Gupta said. However, every year “there is a spurt in the number of patients presenting with Holi color-related injury to the emergency department during the time of Holi festival.”

Holi powder remains unregulated in most areas of the world, the authors say. They call for “government imposed bans on prohibition of manufacturing, sale and use of these chemicals” to be made mandatory.

In the meantime, specialists recommend increasing community awareness and emphasizing the health risks associated with Holi colored-powder and strategies for protecting oneself.

“Wear sunglasses, swim goggles and/or a hat with a brim,” Thau advised. “This will allow participants to enjoy the beauty of the festival without exposing them to the danger of these substances.”

Few on the streets of capital Caracas really understood unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro’s announcement this week that he would seek to refinance the oil-rich nation’s heavy bond burden of $60 billion - or about $2,000 per person.

But those interviewed by Reuters said they were hoping any deals between the government and its multiple foreign creditors would free up foreign currency to increase imports of scarce food, medicine, and basic products.

“Maybe it will work, and improve the country,” said Johny Vargas, 53, a construction worker who says he often only eats twice a day because his salary is gobbled up by price increases.

“Everything is so expensive. There’s no food, nothing. Maduro’s useless. Look at the bad state we’re in.”

Up to now, Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party has prioritized debt payments by slashing imports, compounding four years of recession and shortages on the shelves.

Should a debt renegotiation be reached, it could free more money in the short-term for the government to bring in basic foods and medicines.

But Wall Street is skeptical, and so are many Venezuelans.

“We can’t have strong negotiations. We don’t have the credibility to sit down and make requests,” said 35 year-old accountant Mayerling Delgado, referring to Venezuela’s increasingly fraught relations with many other countries.

“So we have to pay,” she added in a resigned tone, in a busy Caracas plaza.

Experts have long warned that debt accrued under late leader Hugo Chavez was unsustainable, and urged Maduro’s government to refinance its debt load.

But pursuing such an operation now is near impossible given Venezuela’s economic mess, a dearth of technocrats in the government, and, especially, sanctions that bar U.S. banks from participating in or negotiating new Venezuelan debt deals.

NOT PAYING IS WORSE?

Most Venezuelans balk at the idea of a default, which would trigger lawsuits by creditors seeking to seize assets such as refineries in the United States. That could plunge the OPEC nation of 30 million people into even worse hardship.

“The majority of the population has consistently perceived a default as a negative move that could hurt the country’s economy,” said economist Luis Vicente Leon of pollster Datanalisis.

But with many analysts viewing a default as ultimately unavoidable given the parlous state of Venezuela’s coffers, some said it might be better to bite the bullet.

“What’s the science behind paying when you’ve already lost? It’s not what we as Venezuelans want ... but there’s no other way out, unfortunately,” said beautician Harlee Tovitto, 42. She plans to emigrate to neighboring Colombia soon because she can no longer afford clothes or insurance for her three children.

Amid a deepening spat with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, some Venezuelans think Caracas would find a way out of its bond mess if it weren’t for the U.S. sanctions.

“If Venezuela has always paid its debt ... why can’t they refinance?,” said Rafael Moreno, 30, a lawyer and former Chavez supporter who now says he does not back either the government or opposition.","Unversed in debt details, Venezuelans desperate for any relief",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-bonds-reaction/unversed-in-debt-details-venezuelans-desperate-for-any-relief-idUSKBN1D40GV

TV3 via REUTERS TV

All are wanted by Madrid for actions related to the push for the region’s secession from Spain. Puigdemont has become the public face of that move for independence.

Other charges are the misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to the secessionist campaign, which has thrown Spain into a political crisis just as its economy has recovered from a sharp downturn and banking stress.

Madrid has taken over administrative control in Catalonia, until then an autonomous region, and called new elections on Dec 21.

Two polls on Sunday suggested pro-Catalonia independence parties will together win December’s regional election although they may fall just short of a majority of seats in parliament needed to revive the secession campaign.

Parties supporting Catalonia staying in Spain would divide seats but garner around 54 percent of the vote, the polls suggested.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium shortly after Madrid took control. On Sunday morning, Puigdemont and four of his former councillors presented themselves to police in Brussels.

A judge will hear the defendants case on Sunday afternoon and has until Monday morning to decide whether the formalities for the extradition request have been fulfilled.

According to a GAD3 survey of 1,233 people conducted between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 and published in La Vanguardia newspaper, pro-independence parties ERC, PDeCAT and CUP would take between 66 and 69 seats in the 135-seat parliament.

A second poll taken over the same period for the conservative newspaper La Razon echoed the GAD3 survey, showing pro-independence parties would capture the most votes though still fall just shy of a parliamentary majority with 65 seats.

Other seats would be generally divided between parties that support the region remaining as part of Spain, though they would run on separate tickets.

Voter participation, however, will rise to a record of 83 percent, the GAD3 poll showed.

POLITICIANS ON REMAND

Under the European arrest warrant system, the five defendants in Belgium can agree to an extradition order immediately or the judge can set bail or detain them. Belgian authorities have to inform their European counterparts if a European arrest warrant cannot be executed after 90 days.

On Saturday, Puigdemont - who PDeCAT said on Sunday would lead the party in the election - called for a united Catalan political front for independence from Spain and against the detention of his former members of government.

On Thursday, nine of his sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial.

One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was freed after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,035) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

According to the GAP3 survey, 59 percent believed legal action against Puigdemont was unjustified while 69.3 percent said the jailing of the Catalan politicians would give the independence cause a boost at the ballot box.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest the detentions.

The Catalonia issue has sent shockwaves across Europe, energizing regions with their own secessionist agenda while unnerving those fighting to keep the European Union from fracturing further.

Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon, a member of the Flemish nationalist and separatist party N-VA, criticized Spain’s handling of situation on Sunday, saying Madrid “went too far” in an interview with Belgian broadcaster VTM.

Madrid says the judiciary acts independently of the legislative arm of government while adding that Catalonia leaders acted outside the rule of law when organizing the vote and making the declaration of independence.

BACK TO THE START

A pro-secessionist rally in Barcelona on Sunday attracted just a few hundred people, a long way from the hundreds of thousands to join pro-independence marches in October. Many of those attending waved the regional flag and carried protest signs.

One protester, Antonia Aguilera, 63, said she was concerned the new elections would not be fair and would be manipulated by the Spanish government.

Her concerns echo the deep mistrust many Catalans have of politicians in Madrid that has deepened since the arrests and after the national police used truncheons and rubber bullets to thwart voting in the illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1.

“I‘m disgusted by it all. We knew they would react but not as strongly as they did,” she said, adding that she believed the pro-independence parties would win the December election.

“And then we’ll be back where we started.”","Sacked Catalonia leader turns himself in, polls show independence strength",https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia/sacked-catalonia-leader-turns-himself-in-polls-show-independence-strength-idINKBN1D50PY

Tottenham Hotspur rode their luck before South Korean forward Son Heung-min earned them a 1-0 victory over bottom club Crystal Palace to consolidate their place in the Premier League’s top four on Sunday.

Mauricio Pochettino’s side, fresh from beating European champions Real Madrid in midweek, found Palace a difficult nut to crack at Wembley and could have been behind before Son curled in the winner midway through the second half.

Despite not being at their best, however, Tottenham remained in third position with 23 points having won five of their last six league games. They are behind Manchester United on goal difference before their clash at fourth-placed Chelsea later.

“No point in beating Real Madrid on Wednesday if you can’t win at home at the weekend,” Tottenham defender Eric Dier said.

“We knew it would be difficult today with players missing but we wanted to keep the momentum going.”

Palace have four points from 11 games but could count themselves unfortunate as Scott Dann was twice denied by Tottenham’s debutant keeper Paulo Gazzaniga while Wilfried Zaha wasted a great chance shortly before Spurs scored.

Gazzaniga also saved well from former Tottenham player Andros Townsend early in the second half while Son could have given a nervy Tottenham breathing space but dragged a good chance wide.

Tottenham were without Dele Alli, scorer of two goals in the 3-1 victory over Real, while keeper Hugo Lloris and his deputy Michel Vorm were both unable to start, handing a first appearance to Argentina’s Gazzaniga.

The 25-year-old grabbed his chance, making crucial saves to earn the man-of-the-match vote.

Tottenham dominated the first half without being able to break down a stubborn Palace side and they were grateful to Gazzaniga who saved well from Dann’s header.

The second half was more open and Palace grew in confidence after Townsend took advantage of a defensive mistake to force another great save from the home keeper.

Tottenham began to commit players forward and Zaha should have punished them when he was clean through but, after going round a poorly-positioned Gazzaniga, he shot wide with the goal at his mercy.

It proved a costly miss for Roy Hodgson’s side.

A few minutes later a clever Tottenham move ended up with Harry Kane playing in Danny Rose whose shot was blocked. The ball ended up with Son on the edge of a crowded area and he curled a delightful shot past Julian Speroni.

The size of the purge - 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers were detained by a newly created anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - raised questions about the stability and predictability of the Saudi government.

For foreigners, a major shock was the detention of flamboyant billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who as a big investor in top Western companies such as Citigroup (C.N) is known as the international face of Saudi business.

Local investors, meanwhile, worried about whether a sustained investigation into corruption could turn up scandals in the kingdom’s opaque business world, forcing people implicated to sell off their equity holdings.

But many bankers and analysts saw the purge, which replaced the head of the National Guard, as a power grab by Prince Mohammed, designed to remove any remaining obstacles to his authority and assure his eventual succession to the throne.

This, they said, could help the economy by making it easier for Prince Mohammed to pursue radical reforms that include slashing the state budget deficit, putting more women into employment, lifting a ban on women driving, and selling $300 billion of state assets.

“This is the latest act of concentration of power in Saudi,” said Hasnain Malik, global head of equity research at emerging markets investment bank Exotix.

”As unprecedented and controversial as it may be, this centralization might also be a necessary condition for pushing the austerity and transformation agenda, the benefits of which very few investors are pricing in.”

After initially tumbling as much as 2.2 percent on Sunday, the Saudi stock index .TASI rebounded to close slightly higher. Shares related to some of the detained people, such as Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, sank but most banks rose, a sign of economic optimism.

INSTABILITY

The purge may increase Prince Mohammed’s grassroots support by tackling corruption, a problem that has long plagued the economy.

“It’s a populist move that makes sense because a lot of the princes, businessmen and bureaucrats are corrupt, taking kickbacks and being involved in all kinds of shady deals,” said Bernard Haykel, professor of Near East studies at Princeton University.

A danger for financial markets, however, is that Prince Mohammed is shaking up business practices and ties that have lasted for decades, a move which could backfire if it triggers an exodus of money and wealthy individuals from the country.

“The fact that some of the country’s leading business people were arrested will scare the private sector and there might be even more capital flight than before. And most bureaucrats will now be terrified, perhaps justifiably,” Haykel said.

Many corporate executives expect Prince Mohammed to persuade or pressure rich Saudis to repatriate some of the billions of dollars which they are believed to have transferred overseas for safe-keeping, and which could now help to kick-start the development projects that he plans.

The corruption crackdown may be an initial step in this effort; the decree creating the committee gave it the right, pending the result of investigations, to seize assets at home or abroad and transfer them to the state Treasury.

James Dorsey, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, wrote that Prince Mohammed appeared to be reacting to growing opposition within the royal family and the military to his reforms and Riyadh’s military intervention in Yemen.

“It raises questions about the reform process that increasingly is based on a unilateral rather than a consensual rewriting of the kingdom’s social contract.”

For many people, however, a unilateral approach is seen as the best chance to push through the reforms. A chief economist at a big regional bank said Prince Mohammed’s main motive for acting was frustration that reforms were not moving fast enough.

The privatization program, for example, including the planned sale of 5 percent of national oil giant Saudi Aramco, has been discussed for many months with little action. Now the program may pick up.

“The message this should send to foreign investors is it’s unwise to bet against MbS,” said Sam Blatteis, chief executive of regional advisory firm The MENA Catalysts, using a common abbreviation of Prince Mohammed’s name.

“When he wants to get things done, he has proven that he can. This is not a consolidation of power, it’s an acceleration. The wheels of policy-making are moving faster.”",Saudi purge worries investors but may speed reforms,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests-economy/saudi-purge-worries-investors-but-may-speed-reforms-idUKKBN1D50RN

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

(SOUNDBITE) (English) MIGRANT FROM SIERRA LEONE, BUBA, SAYING: ""Let me say it's a chance of luck. If you are lucky you make it. If you are unlucky they will karabouche you because there's plenty of ships."" Slang for the various forces trying to stop the boats, the karabouche are accused of jailing migrants and then asking for money in order to free them. Some migrants say they have also suffered abuse while in detention. (SOUNDBITE) (English) MIGRANT FROM NIGERIA, AMBU, SAYING: ""So every morning they would bring us out and beat us, flog us, with diverse type of punishment for we to call for our money. They gave food to call our people. While calling our people they would be beating us so we would cry so our people would hear our voice and know that, yes, we are suffering there."" Italy has led European Union efforts to stop the flow of migrants from Libya to Europe. That has seen a twenty percent drop in arrivals in Italy this year, down to just over 100,000. But many charities say the EU plan isn't working. (SOUNDBITE) (English) MSF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS OFFICER ONBOARD THE SHIP AQUARIUS, NOOR CORNELISSEN SAYING: ""You really have this sense of people being kicked around from one place to the next and unable to escape out of that. Doesn't matter how much ransom they are paying, doesn't matter who they are meeting along the journey.

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he raised the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to sell about 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest initial public offer ever.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition among New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment.

NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also received some government support for its bid, although that has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

While Trump’s tweet named the New York Stock Exchange, it did not mention rival Nasdaq Inc, which is also vying for the Aramco listing.

“Generally, public servants should be impartial, not give preferential treatment to anyone, and avoid endorsements,” said Scott Amey, general counsel for the government ethics watchdog Project on Government Oversight in Washington. “We have already seen violations in this administration, and it doesn’t help that the president isn’t leading by example.”

Nasdaq replied to Trump in a tweet, saying it agreed the United States was the “best destination for global companies” but that Aramco belongs on Nasdaq “with the 5 most valuable operating companies in the world.”

AWAITING A DECISION

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials say they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA. Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has been an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

Still, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. Saudi leaders welcomed him warmly during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against their nation’s diplomatic archrival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

“President Trump’s tweet indicates that, from the White House’s perspective at least, a public listing of Aramco is not as dead as some recent reports indicated,” said Bob McNally, president of Washington-based energy market and policy consultant Rapidan Energy Group.

“The tweet suggests the White House believes Saudi Arabia may be approaching a decision on where to list and wishes to either claim credit or push a possibly wavering Saudi Arabia for a New York listing,” McNally added.

Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock. The prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings, including IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.",Trump backs New York in bourses' battle for Saudi Aramco listing,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-aramco/trump-backs-new-york-in-bourses-battle-for-saudi-aramco-listing-idUSKBN1D40IL

Archbishop Socrates Villegas, president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, was speaking as the church launched a new prayer campaign to “heal the nation and stop the killings” in the country.

Philippine Catholic bishops have been stepping up opposition to killings blamed on a government crack down on drugs.

They are now asking the faithful to pray with the rosary for 33 days until Dec. 8, an important Catholic feast of the Immaculate Conception.

The new campaign follows the 40-day ringing of church bells and lighting of candles for thousands of people killed in President Rodrigo Duterte’s 16-month war on drugs.

More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police called self-defense after armed suspects resisted arrest. Critics dispute that and say executions are taking place, with zero accountability, allegations the police reject.

In a mass for families of victims of drug-related killings, Villegas said that if the killings continue “a curse awaits a nation that kills its own people”.

Symbolically, the mass was held at the Catholic shrine of Mary Queen of Peace which stands on the site where nuns stopped soldiers from attacking mutineers who overthrew dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.

“Why do we applaud the killings?,” Villegas said in his homily. “We chose violence instead of peace. We chose lies instead of truth. We chose to laugh at obscenities instead of correcting these. We chose to be silent than to be involved.”

Human rights lawyers, politicians, civil society groups and opponents of the president joined the families of victims in a religious procession after the mass to the “People Power” monument, where they held a cultural show.

Harry Roque, presidential spokesman, said the government welcomed “constructive dissent” after hundreds joined the religious activity condemning the killings.

“We reiterate that this administration does not - and will never - condone extrajudicial and vigilante killings,” Roque, a human rights lawyer, said in a statement, adding police have been investigating more than 2,200 killings with drug-related motives.

“Accountability is essential to good government. The president himself made a clear stance that any violation committed by the police during operations would be dealt with accordingly.”

Statistics Canada on Friday reported a net gain of 35,300 jobs - all of them due to a boost in full-time positions - but added the jobless rate had edged up to 6.3 percent as more people sought work.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 15,000 extra jobs and predicted the unemployment rate would stay at 6.2 percent.

The Bank of Canada, citing the need to remove monetary stimulus as the economy strengthened, raised interest rates in July and September and said it would closely review data before deciding whether to hike again.

Average hourly wages were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the strongest year-over-year increase since April 2016.

“Most importantly, we saw a little bit more acceleration in wages ... the labor data does support tighter (monetary) policy at some point next year and perhaps sooner than later,” said Andrew Kelvin, a senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

The Bank of Canada said last week various measures of wage growth remained below their historical averages.

The Canadian dollar quickly rose to C$1.2728 against the greenback, or 78.57 U.S. cents, up from C$1.2829, or 77.95 U.S. cents before the report was released.

Statscan said full-time employment jumped by 88,700 jobs while part-time positions dipped by 53,400.

On a year-over-year basis, employment rose by 308,100, or 1.7 percent, while the six-month average for employment growth was 29,700 jobs, up from 24,300 in September.

Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the Bank of Canada would be “mildly encouraged” by the increase in year-over-year wage growth.

“But I think they need to see more evidence before they can consider raising rates again,” he said in a phone interview.

Separate trade data for September was much gloomier, possibly tempering the central bank’s enthusiasm for a third rate hike in quick succession.

Statscan said the trade deficit remained at C$3.18 billion ($2.50 billion) as imports and exports dropped for a fourth consecutive month.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a shortfall of C$3.00 billion. Since Statscan started compiling trade data in 1946, exports and imports never both declined for four months in a row.

“I thought I was going to be fired,” recalled the former employee nearly 40 years later. But Shinzo Abe, now Japan’s prime minister, stayed on the job at Japan’s third-largest steelmaker for three years before entering politics in 1982.

Abe has called the steel industry the backbone of the nation. Kobe Steel, a 112-year-old company in south-central Japan’s Hyogo prefecture, has risen from wartime devastation and natural disaster but its past is littered with examples of corporate misconduct.

Its admission last month that workers had tampered with product specifications for at least a decade is the latest in a string of scandals that has battered Japan’s reputation as a manufacturing powerhouse.

Clients around the world, including top carmakers and airplane manufacturers, have been scrambling to check whether the safety or performance of their products have been compromised.

Workers, executives and shopowners in Kobe, a gritty, industrial city bordered by sloping hills where cattle are bred for the famed Kobe beef, said they were concerned but not surprised by the scandal.

Kobe Steel, which has apologized for the tampering, declined comment for this article.

“The corporate culture was to look the other way even while you saw what was going on,” said a retired employee who worked at the company’s flagship steel plant, Kobe Works - a symbol of the city’s quick recovery from a 1995 earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people. The company’s other main plant in the area is Kakogawa Works, in the nearby city of Kakogawa.

“They were supposed to be instilling a culture that paid attention when improprieties were discovered,” the former employee said. “In the end they didn’t create such a corporate culture. That’s management’s responsibility.”

The company initially said some workers had falsified data on contract specifications for a relatively small amount of aluminum and copper products, but it later admitted the problem had spread.

In 2006, Kobe Steel admitted falsifying soot-emissions data from the blast furnaces at Kobe Works and Kakogawa Works.

The latest scandal reflects “exactly the same set-up”, said Shoichi Tarumoto, who was then mayor of Kakogawa. “It looks like nothing has changed at Kobe Steel.”

PAST PROBLEMS

Kobe Steel has admitted taking part in bid-rigging for a bridge project in 2005, and failing to report income to tax authorities in 2008, 2011 and 2013. The company exceeded established limits for ground and water pollution in 2006.

Illegal political funding to candidates in local assembly elections in 2009 prompted the resignations of the then CEO and chairman. And last year Kobe Steel admitted a subsidiary falsified data on stainless-steel products.

A senior official in local government who has dealt with the company for years said: “Kobe Steel always scouts the backstreets for shortcuts. That’s their nature.”

Although its local dominance has waned, Kobe Steel remains one of only two Kobe-based companies, along with Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd (7012.T), that have revenues over 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) a year. The Kakogawa Works is that city’s biggest company, vital as a local taxpayer and employer.

More than a third of the Kobe Steel group’s 6,123 domestic customers are concentrated in Hyogo or neighboring Osaka, according to credit-research firm Teikoku Databank. More than half its customers are small and midsize Japanese companies.

The other clients are spread around the world and include top automobile manufacturers, airplane makers, railways and nearly any industry that uses steel, aluminum or copper in any form. [nL4N1N834X]

No safety issues have been found so far because of the tampering, but Kobe Steel has withdrawn its forecast for its first annual profit in three years. Whatever the eventual economic impact, the scandal is already affecting morale in Kobe city.

“If Kobe Steel suffers a blow, this is the area that will be most affected,” said Tsuyoshi Matsuda of Teikoku Databank’s Kobe office.

Kobe Steel acknowledges some customers have shifted orders to other suppliers. Major banks are instructing their Kobe area branches to keep close watch on the credit management at companies that do business with the steelmaker, bankers say.

“HEAVY MOOD”

The scandal “isn’t an open topic on the job,” said a worker in his 30s, finishing the night shift around 8 a.m. at Kobe Works, a hulking jumble of rusting pipes, risers and tanks.

“Nobody says it out loud, but I think people are worried,” he said. “It’s a heavy mood.”

Shinzaike, the local train station closest to Kobe Works, is home to several bar-restaurants that count the company’s employees among their best customers. Since the latest scandal erupted, business has dried up, traders said.

“Looks like they’re holding back from going drinking,” said a pub owner.

Reservations for year-end parties would normally be starting now, but there haven’t been any yet, he added.

Abe, who worked at both the Kobe and Kakogawa works, has called his years at Kobe Steel “the starting point of my adult life.”

Last year, according to media reports, he urged young people entering the workforce to follow his example of learning from mistakes at Kobe Steel.

“I got through it without incident,” he said. “I want you not to be discouraged by a few mistakes but rather do the best you can.”","Scandal-hit Kobe Steel has a 'look the other way' culture, they say in hometown",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-kobe-steel-scandal-hometown/scandal-hit-kobe-steel-has-a-look-the-other-way-culture-they-say-in-hometown-idUKKBN1D500I

The Seattle-based company said the Vancouver expansion has been in the works for some time and is not related to the hotly contested race by cities across North America to land the e-commerce company’s $5 billion HQ2.

“These will be largely software engineering, tech and non-tech jobs, and they’ll be contributing to products that are used globally,” Jesse Dougherty, general manager for the Vancouver office, told reporters.

The Vancouver expansion comes as companies in the United States have struggled to secure visas in a timely fashion to import foreign workers to fill highly skilled and technical jobs.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it tougher for skilled foreigners to work in the United States, challenging visa applications more regularly than at nearly any point under former U.S. President Barack Obama.

Amazon officials did not answer questions on whether the new office was in response to difficulties bringing foreign talent to its U.S. offices.

“Amazon likes to hire the smartest people we can find, and so Vancouver certainly is a place where we like to get that growth,” said Dougherty.

Canada launched a fast-track visa program for highly skilled workers in June, as it seeks to take advantage of a tougher immigration environment in the United States.

Government experts are to work on a “rule book” for the 2015 climate pact at the Nov. 6-17 annual meeting in Bonn, Germany. The accord seeks to end the fossil fuel era this century with a shift to wind, solar and other clean energies.

Trump once dismissed climate change as a Chinese hoax to harm the U.S. economy and said in June that he would pull out of the agreement and instead promote U.S. coal and oil. A formal U.S. withdrawal will take until 2020.

No other nation has followed his lead. U.S. influence is likely to wane compared to other big greenhouse emitters led by China, the European Union and India even though Washington will still have a place at the table in Bonn.

“The rest of the world, including all major emerging economies, has made it clear that it is committed to the Paris Agreement,” Maldives Environment Minister Thor Abraham, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (OASIS), told Reuters.

China, on track to beat its goal of a peak in carbon emissions in 2030, seems best placed to step up leadership of an agreement largely designed by Washington under former president Barack Obama, many delegates say.

The meeting “will be a great free advertisement for China,” one European environment minister said. And Beijing plans to launch a nationwide carbon market this year, albeit delayed from the first half.

“The results (in Bonn) will prove that this (Paris) process has certainly not stopped,” China’s top climate official, Xi Zhenhua, told a news conference last week. He expressed hopes that Washington will end up staying in the Paris pact.

Adding urgency, 2017 is set to be the second warmest on record, behind 2016, according to NASA. And 2017 has had weather extremes of hurricanes, floods and drought-fuelled wildfires.

Fiji will preside at the Bonn talks, the first small island nation to do so in more than two decades of U.N. climate negotiations. That may give OASIS, at risk from rising seas, unprecedented influence.

The Paris rule book, including details of how to measure and report emissions, is due to be in place by the end of 2018.

Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said governments will face a tougher test in coming years when they have to ratchet up national ambitions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The United Nations says average temperatures will rise about three degrees Celsius (5.4 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times by 2100 with existing policies, against a Paris goal of keeping them “well below” two degrees (3.6F), ideally 1.5 (2.7F).

And on Friday, U.S. scientists released a report saying it was “extremely likely” that human activities are the main source of warming, contradicting Trump’s views.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange sent a letter of enquiry to elevator maker SJEC Corp, Qihoo 360’s listing vehicle, requesting more information about the software maker’s business model, financial details and restructuring history, SJEC said in a statement on Saturday.

The scrutiny came a day after SJEC (601313.SS) said it would acquire Qihoo 360 through an asset swap and injection which would allow the formerly New York-listed software firm to list on China’s A-share market. Qihoo 360 was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in July 2016.

The deal, which requires approval from regulators, is being watched as a litmus test for whether Beijing is relaxing curbs it imposed last year on A-share backdoor listings by overseas-listed Chinese companies.

Chinese regulators have increased their scrutiny of company disclosures since the 2015 stock market crash as part of efforts to better protect small investors.

In the letter of enquiry, which was published through an exchange filing, the Shanghai Stock Exchange asks how Qihoo 360 arrived at the conclusion that it controls 94.8 percent of China’s PC anti-virus software market with monthly active users averaging over 500 million.

“Please disclose the data sources and methodology, and indicate if there were redundant calculations or dormant users.”

Regulators also sought explanations for why Qihoo 360’s earnings rose so rapidly during the first half of this year. The company reported one billion yuan in net profit during the January-June period, exceeding its full-year total of 744.4 million yuan in 2016.

The exchange also asked about the basis and rationale for Qihoo’s forecast that its profit would surge over 70 percent to 3.8 billion yuan in 2019, from an expected 2.2 billion yuan this year.

In addition, the exchange raised questions about whether, after frequent restructuring over the past three years, Qihoo 360’s ownership structure was sufficiently clear to qualify for a listing.

Reached by telephone, SJEC said there was no one available to answer questions regarding the statement over the weekend.

La empresa, Southern Nevada Donor Services, ofrecía a las familias afligidas una forma de eliminar los elevados gastos funerarios: incineración gratuita a cambio de donar los órganos del cuerpo de tus seres queridos para “estudios médicos avanzados”.

Fuera del almacén de Southern Nevada, las circunstancias distaban de ser reconfortantes. En otoño de 2015, los vecinos comenzaron a quejarse sobre un misterioso hedor y unas cajas ensangrentadas en un contenedor de basura. Ese diciembre, según muestras de los registros sanitarios locales, alguien había contactado con las autoridades para informar de actividades extrañas en el patio.

Los inspectores sanitarios encontraron a un hombre vestido con bata médica que sujetaba una manguera de jardinería. Estaba, al sol del mediodía, derritiendo el hielo del torso de un hombre congelado.

Mientras el hombre rociaba los restos, “trozos de tejidos y sangre caían por el desagüe”, rezaba el informe de uno de los inspectores. El riachuelo pasaba por delante de las tiendas y se estancaba cerca de una escuela técnica.

Southern Nevada, descubrieron los inspectores, son “comerciantes de cuerpos”, una compañía que adquiere cadáveres, los disecciona y los vende en piezas, con ánimo de lucro, a investigadores médicos, academias médicas y otros compradores. El torso tumbado en la camilla lo estaba preparando para una de estas ventas.

Cada año, miles de estadounidenses donan sus cuerpos con la creencia de que contribuyen a la ciencia. De hecho, muchos contribuyen involuntariamente con la materia prima de un amplio mercado nacional no regulado.

Los comerciantes de cuerpos también son conocidos como “bancos de tejidos no-trasplantables”. Son diferentes del sector de trasplante de órganos y tejidos que el gobierno de EEUU regula minuciosamente. Vender corazones, riñones y tendones para su trasplante es ilegal. Pero ninguna ley federal rige la venta de cadáveres o partes del cuerpo para su uso en investigación o educación. Pocas leyes estatales plantean supervisión al respecto y casi cualquier persona, independientemente de su experiencia, puede diseccionar y vender fragmentos de un cuerpo humano.

“La situación actual es la ley de la selva”, dijo Angela McArthur, que dirige el programa de donación de cuerpos en la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Médica de Minnesota y ha presidido la comisión de donación anatómica de su estado. “Vemos problemas similares a lo que vimos con los ladrones de tumbas de hace siglos” indicó, refiriéndose a la práctica del siglo XIX de obtener cadáveres con un procedimiento que violaba la dignidad de los fallecidos.

“Creo que cualquier cosa que diga se queda corta” dijo McArthur. “Lo que están haciendo es sacar provecho de la venta de humanos”.

El modelo de negocio de esta industria depende del acceso a una gran cantidad de cuerpos, a menudo procedentes de población pobre. A cambio de un cuerpo, los comerciantes suelen cremar una parte del donante sin cobrar. Al ofrecer la cremación gratuita, dicen algunos veteranos del sector, los intermediarios atraen a las familias de bajos ingresos que son más vulnerables. Muchos han agotado sus ahorros pagando el tratamiento médico de un ser querido y no pueden permitirse un funeral tradicional.

“Las personas con medios económicos tienen la oportunidad de debatir las cuestiones morales, éticas y espirituales sobre qué método elegir”, dijo Dawn Vander Kolk, un trabajador social de cuidados paliativos de Illinois. “Pero quienes no tienen dinero, pueden terminar con una opción de último recurso: la donación de cadáveres”.

La escasa normativa supone escasas consecuencias cuando los cuerpos son maltratados. En el caso de Southern Nevada, las autoridades descubrieron que podían hacer poco, más allá de una pequeña citación por contaminación a uno de los trabajadores involucrados. El operario de Southern Nevada Joe Collazo, quien no fue citado, dijo que lamentaba el incidente. También dijo que la industria se beneficiaría si hubiera más supervisión que ofrezca tranquilidad a los donantes, intermediarios e investigadores.

“Siendo honesto contigo, creo que tendría que existir una regulación”, expresó Collazo. “Hay una zona gris demasiado amplia”.

“UN GRAN MERCADO DE CADÁVERES”

Los cuerpos donados desempeñan un papel esencial en la educación médica, la formación y la investigación. Los cadáveres y partes del cuerpo se utilizan para enseñar a estudiantes de medicina, médicos, enfermeras y dentistas. Los cirujanos dicen que ningún maniquí o simulación virtual puede reproducir la respuesta táctil y la experiencia emocional que aporta practicar con partes del cuerpo humano. Los médicos de urgencias, por ejemplo, usan cabezas y torsos humanos para aprender cómo insertar tubos de respiración.

Los investigadores dependen de partes del cuerpo donadas para desarrollar nuevos instrumentos quirúrgicos, técnicas e implantes; y para crear nuevos medicamentos y tratamientos para enfermedades.

“La necesidad de cuerpos humanos es absolutamente vital”, dijo el médico de Chicago Armand Krikorian, expresidente de la Federación Estadounidense de Investigación Médica. Citó una reciente cura potencial para la diabetes tipo 1 desarrollada mediante el estudio del páncreas de los donantes. “Es un tipo de tratamiento que nunca habría salido a la luz si no hubiéramos recibido la donación de un cuerpo entero”, dijo

Pese al importante papel de la industria en la medicina, no existe un registro nacional del comercio de cuerpos. Muchos pueden operar casi en el anonimato, firmando acuerdos silenciosamente para obtener cadáveres y vender sus partes.

“Existe un extenso mercado para los cuerpos de los fallecidos” dijo Ray Madoff, un profesor de la Facultad de Derecho de Boston College que estudia cómo tratan a los muertos las leyes estadounidenses. “Sabemos muy poco sobre quién adquiere estos cuerpos y qué hacen con ellos”, añadió.

En la mayoría de los estados, cualquier persona puede comprar legalmente piezas de un cuerpo. Como se detalla en otro reportaje, un comerciante de Tennessee vendió a Reuters una columna cervical y dos cabezas humanas después de un breve intercambio de correos.

A través de entrevistas y registros públicos, Reuters identificó a Sourthern Nevada y otros 33 activos en todo Estados Unidos durante los últimos cinco años. Veinticinco de los 34 negocios eran empresas con ánimo de lucro. Solo en tres años, una de las empresas con ánimo de lucro ganó al menos 12,5 millones de dólares gracias al negocio de partes de cuerpos, como muestra otro artículo de Reuters.

Debido a que solo cuatro estados siguen de cerca las donaciones y las ventas, la amplitud del mercado de piezas de cuerpos humanos sigue siendo desconocida. Pero los datos obtenidos bajo las leyes de registro público de Nueva York, Virginia, Oklahoma y Florida, proporcionan una imagen de conjunto. Reuters calculó que desde 2011 hasta 2015, los comercios privados recibieron al menos 50.000 cuerpos y distribuyeron más de 182.000 partes humanas.

Las autorizaciones de Florida y Virginia dan una idea de cómo se usaron algunas de esas piezas: un envío en 2013 a un seminario de formación ortopédica de Florida incluyó 27 hombros. Un envío de 2015 a una sesión sobre el síndrome del túnel carpiano en Virginia incluyó cinco brazos.

Al igual que con otros productos, los precios de los cuerpos y las piezas de estos fluctúan según las condiciones del mercado. En general, un comerciante puede vender un cuerpo humano donado por alrededor de 3.000 a 5.000 dólares, aunque los precios a veces superan los 10.000 dólares. Pero los comerciantes normalmente dividen el cadáver en seis partes para satisfacer las necesidades del cliente. Los documentos internos de siete de estos negocios recogen un rango de precios para las partes del cuerpo: 3.575 dólares para un torso con piernas; 500 dólares por cabeza; 350 dólares por un pie; 300 dólares por columna vertebral.

Los negocios de cuerpos se han entrelazado con la industria funeraria estadounidense. Reuters identificó a 62 agentes funerarios que han llegado a acuerdos comerciales de beneficio mutuo con los comerciantes. Las funerarias brindan a los intermediarios acceso a posibles donantes. A cambio, los comerciantes de cuerpos pagan los honorarios a los funerarios, que van de 300 dólares a 1.430 dólares, de acuerdo con los libros contables y los registros judiciales.

Estos pagos generan ingresos para los agentes funerarios de aquellas familias que de otra forma no podrían permitirse una simple incineración. Pero tales relaciones provocan posibles conflictos de interés al crear un incentivo para las funerarias que alientan a los familiares en duelo a que consideren la donación del cuerpo, a veces sin una comprensión total sobre qué podría pasar con los restos.

“Algunos directores de las funerarias piensan: ‘La cremación ya no paga las facturas, así que déjame ver si puedo ayudar a estas personas a recoger partes corporales’” dijo Steve Palmer, un trabajador funerario miembro de la junta directiva de la National Funeral Directors Association. “Simplemente creo que las familias que donan los cadáveres de sus seres queridos tendrían dudas al respecto si supieran esto”, dijo.

Algunos embalsamadores han hecho que la donación del cuerpo forme parte de sus propios negocios. En Oklahoma, dos propietarios de funerarias invirtieron 650.000 dólares en una startup de comercio de cuerpos. En Colorado, una familia que controlaba una funeraria también dirigía una empresa que disecaba y distribuía piezas de cadáveres desde el mismo edificio.

Cuando se dona un cuerpo, pocos estados establecen normativas que controlen el desmembramiento o el uso de este, u ofrecen derechos sobre los familiares más cercanos del donante. Los cuerpos y las piezas se pueden comprar, vender y alquilar, una y otra vez. Como resultado, puede ser difícil rastrear qué sucede con los cuerpos de los donantes, y mucho menos garantizar que se les trate con dignidad.

En 2004, un comité de salud federal pidió sin éxito al gobierno de EEUU que regulara la industria. Desde entonces, Reuters ha descubierto que más de 2.357 partes del cuerpo obtenidas por comerciantes de al menos 1.638 personas han sido maltratadas, abusadas o profanadas en todo Estados Unidos.

Estos datos, basados en una revisión de registros judiciales, policiales, y de documentos internos de los negocios de cuerpos, seguramente estén subestimados, dada la falta de supervisión. Incluyen instancias en las que los cuerpos fueron utilizados sin el consentimiento del donante o el familiar más cercano; los donantes fueron engañados acerca de cómo se usarían los cuerpos; los cuerpos fueron desmembrados por motosierras en lugar de instrumentos médicos; las partes del cuerpo se almacenaron en condiciones insalubres y se descompusieron; o los cuerpos fueron desechados en incineradores de desechos médicos en lugar de ser incinerados adecuadamente.

“MATERIAS PRIMAS GRATUITAS”

Los negocios de cuerpos varían en tamaño, desde pequeñas empresas familiares hasta empresas nacionales con oficinas en varios estados. También varían en experiencia.

Garland Shreves, quien fundó el negocio de Phoenix Research for Life en 2009, dijo que invirtió más de 2 millones de dólares en procedimientos de control de calidad y equipos médicos, incluidos 265.000 dólares en una máquina de rayos X para escanear cadáveres en busca de implantes quirúrgicos.

Pero otros comerciantes han lanzado sus negocios por menos de 100.000 dólares, según indican registros corporativos internos y entrevistas. A menudo, los mayores gastos de capital son una furgoneta de carga y un conjunto de congeladores. Algunos negocios han ahorrado dinero utilizando motosierras para desmembrar los cadáveres en lugar de sierras quirúrgicas.

Los negocios también pueden reducir gastos al renunciar a los meticulosos procedimientos de control de calidad y a la formación solicitada por una organización nacional de referencia, la Asociación Estadounidense de Bancos de Tejidos.

Aun así, un tercio de los 34 negocios identificados por Reuters se declaraban en bancarrota o no pagaban sus impuestos, de acuerdo con documentos judiciales. Cuando las empresas que fracasan en la industria reducen gastos para ahorrar dinero, las consecuencias para las familias de los donantes pueden ser emocionalmente desgarradoras.

“UN ÚLTIMO GESTO DESINTERESADO”

Harold Dillard trabajaba con su hermano alicatando bañeras y encimeras de cocina en Albuquerque, Nuevo México. Le diagnosticaron cáncer terminal en 2009, el día después a Acción de Gracias.

“Tenía 56 años, era joven, activo, sano, tenía una vida genial y una noche, ¡bam!”, dijo su hija, Farrah Fasold. “Quería hacer un último gesto desinteresado antes de morir, por lo que donó su cuerpo”

Mientras su padre agonizaba, dijo Fasold, los trabajadores de Bio Care, negocio de cuerpos de Albuquerque, le visitaron a él y a su hija, y les dieron un discurso sincero: el generoso regalo de su cuerpo a la ciencia beneficiaría a estudiantes de medicina, médicos e investigadores. Fasold indicó que Bio Care les dio varias posibilidades, incluida que el cuerpo de su padre se usara para entrenar a los cirujanos en técnicas de reemplazo de rodilla.

La visión que tenía Fasold de Bio Care cambió en poco tiempo. Pasaron algunas semanas más de las prometidas hasta que recibieron lo que dijeron que eran los restos cremados de su padre. Una vez con ellos, sospechó que no eran sus cenizas porque parecían arena. Estaba en lo correcto.

En abril de 2010, las autoridades informaron a Fasold de que la cabeza de su padre se encontraba entre las partes corporales descubiertas en un incinerador médico. También supo, por primera vez, que Bio Care estaba dentro del negocio de la venta de partes del cuerpo.

“Estaba completamente histérica”, dijo. “Nunca nos habríamos apuntado si nos hubieran dicho algo sobre vender partes del cuerpo, de ninguna manera. Eso no es lo que mi padre quería en absoluto”.

Dentro del almacén de Bio Care, las autoridades apuntaron que encontraron al menos 127 partes del cuerpo pertenecientes a 45 personas.

El propietario de Bio Care, Paul Montano, fue acusado de fraude. De acuerdo con la declaración jurada de la policía, Montano negó haber abusado de los cuerpos y dijo a los agentes que dirigía Bio Care con “cinco empleados voluntarios”, incluido su padre. No quiso responder a las peticiones de comentarios.

Los fiscales retiraron más adelante los cargos contra Montano porque dijeron que no podían demostrar el engaño ni ningún otro delito. Ninguna otra ley estatal regulaba el tratamiento de los cuerpos donados o protegía a los familiares.

Confundida e indignada, Fasold habló por teléfono con Kari Brandenburg, el fiscal del distrito en el condado de Bernalillo. Fasold grabó parte de la llamada.

“Lo que ha sucedido es horrible, pero la ley de Nuevo México no dice nada sobre este tipo de actividad”, le dijo Brandeburg a Fasold. El fiscal expresó que, aunque Montano era quizás “el peor empresario del mundo”, sus errores se debieron, en parte, a acuerdos que fracasaron.

“Entonces”, respondió Fasold, “como otras personas incumplieron sus acuerdos, ¿está bien que siga adelante, corte el cuerpo de mi padre y lo incinere?”

”No, no está bien“, respondió el fiscal. ”Pero no lo convierte en un crimen“. No existe ninguna ley que diga que eso esté mal”.

En una entrevista reciente, Brandenburg dijo que él también se sintió frustrado al descubrir que ninguna ley protege a personas como Fasold y su padre. “Fue escandaloso”, dijo el exfiscal. “Estas familias han quedado profundamente heridas, devastadas”.

Las autoridades terminaron por recuperar las otras partes del cuerpo del padre de Fasold y se las devolvieron para que las pudiera incinerar correctamente. Algunas piezas habían sido descubiertas en bañeras en el incinerador y otras en las instalaciones de Bio Care.

EL TORSO CONGELADO

El incidente de 2015 en las afueras de Las Vegas que involucró al torso congelado provenía de una asociación entre un negocio de cuerpos y una funeraria.

Tanto el negocio, Southern Nevada Donor Services, y la funeraria, Valley Cremation and Burial, tenían problemas financieros. Valley acordó permitir que Southern Nevada diseccionara y prepara los cadáveres y las partes el cuerpo en su funeraria. Los restos y los documentos relacionados se mantendrían en el almacén de Valley, en un parque industrial a pocos kilómetros de distancia.

El dueño de Southern Nevada, Joe Collazo, tenía una década de experiencia vendiendo partes del cuerpo. Los registros judiciales muestran que también cumplió casi dos años en prisión a finales de la década de 1990 por falsificación. Y que un exempleado lo demandó por el robo de partes del cuerpo donadas valoradas en 75.000 dólares y la venta de las mismas a un cliente en Turquía.

Collazo defendió que su condena por falsificación es irrelevante y que la acusación de robo es falsa. Su negocio siguió las mejores prácticas de la industria, dijo, y prestó importantes servicios públicos a la comunidad médica.

Funcionarios locales y estatales informaron de que encontraron otras señales preocupantes, más allá del torso, en las instalaciones de almacenaje. Estas incluían una sierra mecánica ensangrentada que suelen usar trabajadores de la construcción y partes corporales con moho dentro de un congelador desconectado.

Valley ya no está en el negocio, y el dueño murió, según los registros estatales. Southern Nevada también se disolvió, dejando una estela de deudas y partes corporales profanadas.","En el mercado de los cuerpos humanos, casi cualquiera puede vender muertos",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idESKBN1CZ1KL-OESEN

Seehofer will zunächst bei den Jamaika-Gesprächen in Berlin für Klarheit und eine stabile Regierung mit CSU-Beteiligung sorgen.

French and German officials confirmed Le Maire would be in Berlin on Wednesday, when he will meet acting Finance Minister Peter Altmaier, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Le Maire is also due to see Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), and Cem Oezdemir, co-leader of the Greens party. Both are in discussions with Merkel’s conservatives on forming a coalition government.

France’s Emmanuel Macron has made euro zone reform a central goal of his five-year presidency. But any changes will require the support of Merkel and her new government, which is not expected to be in place before Christmas. Lindner has been critical of Macron’s idea to create a budget for the euro zone.

“We want to follow up on the president’s Sorbonne speech and exchange views on the future of the euro zone,” a French finance ministry official said, referring to a speech by Macron in September when he laid out his vision for EU reform.

While Le Maire’s visit - his first to Berlin since the German election - is about strengthening contacts with likely members of the new government, officials indicated that it would also be an opportunity to sound out Berlin on the Eurogroup presidency, a powerful position that will be elected next month.

Since it was created in 2005, the Eurogroup, which brings together the euro zone’s 19 finance ministers, has had only two presidents: Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who served from 2005 to 2013, and former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is due to step down in January.

The position involves chairing monthly meetings and driving policy around economic and monetary union, including ensuring that all member states stick to strict targets on deficits and debt. The post has been dubbed “Mr Euro”.

“NO NATURAL CANDIDATE”

Le Maire, 48, is regarded as sharp, ambitious and more than capable of leading the group. But some euro zone officials are wary about the presidency ending up in the hands of either Germany or France, the two largest economies in the single currency bloc and already dominant forces in policymaking.

A further complication for Le Maire is France’s poor record of meeting its own deficit targets over the past decade. German officials are not ruling out Le Maire, but they have also expressed a preference for giving the post to a smaller country.

Last week, one official in Berlin mentioned two possible alternatives: Pierre Gramegna of Luxembourg and Peter Kazimir of Slovakia. The official also floated the idea of extending Dijsselbloem, seen as a close ally of Berlin, even though he is not part of the new Dutch government.

“It is still quite unclear who will come forward,” the German official said when asked about the presidency. “At this stage there does not seem to be one candidate everyone is rallying behind. There is no natural candidate.”

The Eurogroup president will be chosen on Dec. 4, an EU official said last week, with the formal call for candidates opening in mid-November.

“It is not a done thing,” the German official said of Le Maire’s candidacy. “He will only apply if he gets the impression that he is the one.”

The talks in Berlin on Wednesday could be decisive in determining whether he does throw his hat into the ring.

If Le Maire were to get the job, it could have repercussions for other top euro zone jobs. Mario Draghi will end his term as president of the European Central Bank on Oct. 31, 2019, and Germany’s Jens Weidmann is already being mentioned as a potential successor.

Euro zone watchers say that if the French secure the presidency of the Eurogroup, it may be harder for them to argue against a German candidate taking over the ECB.

Still, as one senior French official told Reuters on condition of anonymity last month, Weidmann at the helm of the ECB “would be a problem for a lot of countries, not just for France”.",France's Le Maire heads to Berlin to test Eurogroup waters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-germany-lemaire/frances-le-maire-heads-to-berlin-to-test-eurogroup-waters-idINKBN1D50UA?il=0

Four soldiers from each nation were killed when a joint patrol was attacked on Oct. 4 by dozens of militants with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.

The incident drew attention to the little-known U.S. military presence in Niger at a time when many Americans are weary of U.S. involvement in conflicts abroad and Nigeriens are chafing at the growing presence of foreign troops on their soil.

The United States has 800 soldiers operating in the largely desert West African nation, more than France, which has 4,000 in the wider Sahel trying to tackle Islamist militancy. The main U.S. base in Africa is in Djibouti, which supports about 4,000 personnel.

A Pentagon investigation into the incident, led by a two-star general from U.S. Africa Command, may take weeks. The Pentagon says it has not settled on any final version of events.

Through interviews in Niger’s capital Niamey and Washington, Reuters has tried to piece together the events of Oct. 3 to Oct. 6, when the last U.S. soldier’s body was recovered.

Accounts by Nigerien and American officials differ over the mission’s objectives, and whether and how they may have changed.

The one consistent thread is that they appear to have been woefully unprepared for their enemy.

“CONSIDERED SAFE”

U.S. and Niger officials agree that on Oct. 3, 12 U.S. Special Forces and 30 Nigeriens left Niamey and headed north to the Mali border. Twenty six similar patrols had taken place in the area in the past six months without enemy contact, the Pentagon said.

After that, the stories of the two sides diverge.

“It was an intelligence mission but also a mission of an operational nature,” Niger Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum told Reuters in an interview. “It was in a zone that was considered safe, not enemy territory.”

Specifically, the mission aimed to detain and question a suspected recruiter for Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, an Islamic State affiliate, according to a senior Nigerien security source with knowledge of the operation and two mid-level government sources, all of whom declined to be named.

The senior source said the mission was thought low enough risk that they had no armored vehicles or body armor.

U.S. officials vehemently contradict this account.

“The service members involved in this unfortunate incident were unequivocally not directed to do a ‘kill or capture mission’. They were on a reconnaissance mission,” the Pentagon said in statement sent to Reuters on Thursday. It said it would provide more details once the investigation is complete.

All three Nigerien sources said the target was a mid-ranking commander called Doundou Chefou who was recruiting disgruntled youths from the Fulani ethnic group along Niger-Mali border.

Chefou commanded Islamic State fighters affiliated to the movement led by an Arabic-speaking north African called Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, the Nigerien sources said.

According to the senior Nigerien security official, the team initially sought Chefou out near a remote border village on Oct. 3. They found a militant camp there but no fighters, he said.

After that, Nigerien intelligence officials on the team received fresh orders from their headquarters to pursue him in the village of Tongo Tongo, so they stayed the night nearby, the official said.

Three U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while it is true the team was given an additional task mid-mission, it was never in pursuit of a militant.

SECOND TEAM

The U.S. officials said their soldiers were asked to work with the Nigerien troops to be on standby to help a second U.S. military team whose mission was indeed to pursue a militant. That mission was called off, however. It is unclear when or why.

“Did the mission change? That’s one of the questions being asked. I can’t tell you definitively the answer to that question,” General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last month.

The U.S. officials said the first team was asked to gather intelligence on the militant. The Americans could do this under U.S. military rules of engagement that allow American forces to accompany partner forces only when the chances of enemy contact are “unlikely.”

Asked about the existence of a second mission, none of the Nigerien sources were aware of it.

U.S. and Nigerien officials agree the team was ambushed after they met local leaders in Tongo Tongo on Oct. 4.

One of the Nigerien government sources said the militants first came with just a few gunmen with AK47s on motorbikes to slow them down, and later brought out heavier 12.7mm machine guns, sniper rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.

That might explain why the team took an hour to call for help - one of the issues that has most disturbed senior Pentagon officials - because the initial attack may have only involved light arms.

A few minutes after the team called for air support, a surveillance drone appeared, providing a live feed, but it took another hour before French military aircraft arrived. They were unable to drop bombs because of how close the fighting was, diplomatic sources have said.

One U.S. official said at least some of the four U.S. soldiers killed were then separated from the convoy. They included Sergeant La David T. Johnson, whose body was not recovered for two days. It is unclear why.

U.S. PRESENCE LIKELY TO GROW

It is unlikely the United States will back away from Niger because of its central location in the Sahel and because of the proliferation of militant groups around it, including Nigeria’s Islamic State-linked Boko Haram and al-Qaeda affiliates.

Several current and former U.S. officials with Africa experience said they expected U.S. military focus on the Sahel to grow, not decrease.

Retired general Donald Bolduc, who led U.S. special operations in Africa until June, said the military should retain a small “footprint” in Africa but needed more intelligence and surveillance resources and medical and air support.

While the most assets have gone to the Middle East and Afghanistan, “there needs to be ... a different perspective on how we allocate the resources between theaters,” he said.

He expressed surprise at the idea that the unit which was ambushed had been redirected to focus on a militant leader.

Senior militant leaders are normally well protected, Bolduc said, with rings of security guards and layers of militants who communicate with one another via radio.

“I‘m as confused about it as you are,” he said. “That’s not how it’s done. ... The resources and planning didn’t seem to be there for that kind of operation.”","A month on, U.S., Niger still disagree on what happened on fatal mission",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D408J-OZATP

Untersucht werden solle die historische Entwicklung von der Reichsbank über die Bank deutscher Länder bis hin zur frühen Bundesbank, teilte die Notenbank am Freitag in Frankfurt mit. Es existierten dazu zwar einzelne Studien. Eine umfassende Aufarbeitung stehe aber noch aus. Anführen sollen das Forschungsprojekt Albrecht Ritschl, Leiter der wirtschaftshistorischen Fakultät an der London School of Economics, und Magnus Brechtken, stellvertretender Direktor des Instituts für Zeitgeschichte in München.

“Es geht nicht alleine darum, dass wir trockene Geschichtsforschung betreiben”, sagte Ritschl. Das Projekt sei Teil eines gesellschaftlichen Prozesses, wie eine neue Generation über diese Vergangenheit streite. Brechtken zufolge soll unter anderem untersucht werden, wie sich die Karrieren und Weltbilder der Inhaber von Schlüsselpositionen in der Geldpolitik von den 20er Jahren bis in die 60er Jahre hinein entwickelt haben.

Konkreter Untersuchungszeitraum ist die Zeit nach der Hyperinflation ab 1923/1924, dem Amtsantritt des damaligen Reichsbank-Präsidenten Hjalmar Schacht, bis ins Jahr 1969. Damals war mit Karl Blessing der letzte Bundesbank-Präsident aus dem Amt geschieden, der noch zum engen Mitarbeiterzirkel um Schacht gehört hatte.

Democratic Republic of Congo army spokesman for South Kivu province, Dieudonne Kasereka, said clashes had started after police came to disarm Colonel Abbas Kayonga, who was sacked on Thursday from his post overseeing anti-fraud efforts in local mines.

Kayonga, a former rebel from a group that had been disarmed and integrated into the Congolese military, gave himself up at the local base for the U.N. mission to Congo.

“He has just surrendered with 17 people at the base of the mission,” Kasereka said by telephone. Two army soldiers and three of Kanyonga’s bodyguards were killed in the fighting and two civilians were killed by stray bullets, he said.

Seventeen members of Kanyonga’s force surrendered to U.N. troops and nine others were captured by the army, Kasereka said, adding that soldiers found about a dozen heavy weapons at Kanyonga’s house.

Security has been deteriorating across Congo since the end of last year, when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down despite his mandate expiring.

Surging militia violence in the east, which has for decades been a tinderbox of ethnic rivalries fueled by the region’s mineral wealth, and in the formerly peaceful central Kasai region, have raised fears the country could slip back to the multi-faceted civil wars of the turn of the century.

Those wars killed hundreds of thousands directly in violence while millions of others are thought to have died from of hunger and disease.

South Kivu has rich deposits of gold, tin and coltan, used in mobile phones, which have long helped finance rebel groups and army officers.

The national electoral commission was expected to announce a date for the election to replace Kabila later on Sunday. Last month, it said the election cannot take place until April 2019, raising fears of an escalation in militia violence and civil disturbances.

U.S. envoy Nikki Haley said during a visit to meet with Kabila last month that the vote must happen in 2018 or it will lose international support.","Renegade colonel surrenders in eastern Congo after clashes, seven dead",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D50HC-OZATP

1/ FED COMES ALIVE

The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected next week to announce plans to begin unwinding its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in its latest step toward monetary policy normalization nearly a decade after the global financial crisis. A larger question looms, however, over whether the Fed resumes interest rate hikes later this year.

While the Fed and most economists see the U.S. economy continuing to plod along in slow-growth mode, the bulk of data describing the economy’s health has surprised to the downside for months as measured by Citigroup’s U.S. Economic Surprise Index. Persistently weak readings of inflation have been a particular conundrum for policymakers vexed by an inability to coax consumer price pressures upward toward their annual growth target of 2 percent. In the last month, however, the margin of downside surprises has narrowed substantially and this week witnessed the first upside surprise on an inflation reading since the spring. Interest rate futures have responded accordingly, and expectations for a December rate hike have risen so far in September. The chance of a quarter-point increase to 1.25 to 1.50 percent in December has climbed to roughly 50 percent from 31 percent in early September, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

2/ BOOM-BUST OR BOOM-BOOM?

Stocks hovering around record highs during the second-longest bull market in history have for months led to concerns about an overheated market. But on one measure the rally may have some justification. The Boom-Bust Barometer, an indicator of economic health and momentum, shows that stocks have “a far healthier fundamental foundation than most perceive,” according to James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group.

The barometer - which measures a spot price of a range of industrials such as copper, steel and lead scrap, divided by unemployment claims, according to Yardeni Research - has been rising steadily with the S&P since the trough in 2009. Paulsen said the market was not necessarily as extended as people think. While investors were primarily concerned about the Fed “taking the punch bowl away,” they should take greater note of a weaker dollar and lower bond yields since year-end, he said.

Boom Bust barometer:

3/ SCORCHED BY STERLING

The British pound has just posted its best week since 2009 as a sharp reassessment of the Bank of England’s interest projections sen those with large bearish bets scrambling to cover. On Thursday, the Bank of England doubled down on its new warning that official interest rates are likely to rise soon. Sharp moves in the currency have a serious impact on all UK assets which have been in thrall to the pound since last year’s shock outcome in the Brexit referendum.

Sterling’s rally dealt a blow to UK bluechip stocks with the FTSE 100 slipping more than 2 percent in thre last week while yields on short-dated gilts rose to their highest since the Brexit vote. Global fund managers are more “underweight” the UK than any other asset class or geography relative to historical allocations, according to the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of portfolio managers. Sharp, sustained strength in sterling will change the calculus significantly going into the final quarter of the year.

4/ BITCOIN IN THE BALANCE

After a vertiginous ascent to record highs just below $5,000 early in the month, bitcoin plunged as much as 40 percent in the 12 following days, dipping below $3,000 on Friday. A combination of fears of a crackdown in China, worries that its prise rise had been too sudden, and a warning from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that bitcoin was a “fraud” and was set to “blow up” drove the sell-off, and hundreds of copycat cryptocurrencies that have sprung up and surged in value in recent months tumbled along with it. But after rumours of Chinese exchange shut-downs were confirmed, traders seem to be getting a case of the “buy the rumour sell the facts”. Bitcoin bounced 20 percent in four hours, and other cryptocurrencies also followed. Focus will now turn to other regulators to see whether they too will take steps to curb trading - no evidence of this has been seen so far. Has the crypto-bubble really burst, or was this just a temporary blip?

5/ KIWI SHAKE-UP

As they head into national elections on Sept. 23, New Zealand’s markets are facing major political uncertainty for the first time in a decade and bracing for a shake-up of monetary and economic policy. Opinion polls show the main opposition Labour party has once again grabbed the lead from the incumbent National party. Labour’s platform includes not just a reduction in net immigration but also a change to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) mandate, by ending its sole focus on inflation and adding an employment goal. And if the Nationals do form a government, they are likely to have to seek support from the minor New Zealand First Party, which also wants changes to the RBNZ’s mandate. The kiwi NZD= has tumbled from a two-year high of $0.7557 it hit in July, when a Nationals victory was expected, as the polls have turned. It is still up about 4 percent against the U.S. dollar so far in 2017, but the uncertainty around a Labour win – both on expectations of monetary policy being less hawkish on inflation and slower immigration softening growth - could weigh on both the currency and the quite richly valued stock market .NZ50. The stock index is up 12.8 percent this year and trades at a PE of above 17.

T-Mobile, under charismatic CEO John Legere, keeps hitting home runs, already reporting it that added 1.3 million net customers in the third quarter - the 18th time in a row it has achieved the feat.

T-Mobile reported revenues in the third quarter that topped $10 billion for the first time, up 8 percent.

The picture for Deutsche Telekom group on Thursday is likely to be different, with analysts on average forecasting group revenues of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion) - a year-on-year gain of just 1.6 percent.

That would reflect barely positive growth in Telekom’s crowded and heavily regulated home market, where sales rose just 0.4 percent in the first half, and at its European holdings that were ahead by just 1.5 percent.

Deutsche Telekom, which has toyed with options for its U.S. business for years, put a brave face on the unraveling of the deal on Saturday night, saying T-Mobile would continue its successful growth strategy.

“We supported our American subsidiary to invest more than $40 billion over the last years, thus building a basis for strong growth in the upcoming years,” CEO Tim Hoettges said.

HOME AND AWAY

But some investors wonder whether the best years may now be behind T-Mobile, whose shares have risen ninefold from the low they hit after the global financial crisis to a peak of $68 in June.

“I’d just love them to sell it,” one UK-based fund manager who holds Deutsche Telekom stock said last week as reports surfaced that the T-Mobile-Sprint talks were in trouble.

At T-Mobile’s latest share price, Deutsche Telekom’s 64 percent stake would be worth $31 billion.

“There’s a tendency to run things for ever, sometimes, and then you end up selling at the wrong times,” the fund manager added.

Together, T-Mobile and Sprint would have had about 130 million customers, putting a merged entity a close third in the United States behind market leaders AT&T and Verizon.

Alone, T-Mobile has 70.7 million customers, requiring a lot more good quarters to close the gap on its own.

Lacking sufficient scale and running a mobile-first strategy, T-Mobile may face challenges if Sprint, controlled by Japan’s Softbank Group, revives its efforts to hook up with a U.S. cable firm, according to a top-10 Telekom shareholder.

An approach by Softbank chief Masayoshi Son was rebuffed in July by Charter Communications.

Trump kicked off a 12-day Asian trip and is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.

He told reporters on Air Force One en route to Asia that North Korea would figure prominently in discussions, and also singled out trade, which he said had been “badly handled” in the region for years.

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

A top aide said last week Trump intends to tell Asian leaders the world is “running out of time” in dealing with the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.

“No dictator, no regime, no nation should ever underestimate American resolve,” Trump told hundreds of cheering U.S. and Japanese troops in camouflage uniforms gathered at Yokota Air Base, just west of Tokyo, soon after he arrived.

“Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it?” said Trump, who wore a bomber jacket as he addressed the troops.

North Korea’s recent actions, including several missiles that flew over Japan and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test, have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Recent drills over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have further heightened tensions.

“We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defense of our freedom,” Trump said.

He told reporters earlier on Air Force One that a decision would be made soon on whether to add reclusive North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Trump said his administration planned to take a different approach after years of what he termed “total weakness.”

“It’s a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved.”

In an apparent attempt to distinguish between North Korea’s leadership and ordinary people, he said he thought North Koreans were “great people.”

“And I hope it all works out for everybody.”

GOLF DIPLOMACY

Abe told reporters before Trump’s arrival that he welcomed the visit as a chance to deepen bilateral ties by building on the “friendship and trust” between the two leaders, fostered by several meetings that included a round of golf in Florida earlier this year.

“I hope we will be able to have thorough discussions about international issues, including North Korea,” he said.

Trump and Abe greeted each other with a handshake at a golf course to be used during the 2020 Olympic Games, changing clothes and heading out to play after what media said was a lunch of hamburgers. In an allusion to a Trump campaign slogan, they signed caps that said “Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.”

They discussed North Korea and trade while playing nine holes with Hideki Matsuyama, the world no. 3 pro golfer.

A senior White House official said the two leaders have developed a close bond since Trump took office in January.

“Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people!” Trump tweeted. For his part, Abe took to Twitter to say he played golf “with a marvellous friend (President Donald J. Trump) full of spirited conversation.”

The two leaders and their wives later dined on grilled Japanese premium beef at an upscale restaurant.

In brief pre-dinner remarks, Trump said U.S.-Japan ties were closer than ever. But he added: “We’ll have dinner tonight. I think we’ll insult everybody by continuing to talk about trade.”

Trump also said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, the longest Asian tour by any U.S. leader since George H.W. Bush in 1992.

“I think it’s expected that we will meet,” he said. “We want Putin’s help on North Korea.”

Trump wants a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before he visits Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Separately, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed that “now is the time to apply firm pressure on North Korea,” Kono told reporters.

A senior U.S. State Department official traveling with Tillerson said the pressure was having an effect.

“I think we have a better chance now than we’ve had in the last couple of decades to solve this problem because the most important thing is to have the international community completely united in order to really choke off the lifeline for North Korea. It’s got to be the way,” the official said.

TRADE TALKS

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to policies more favorable to the United States, a point Trump emphasized.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where Trump will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.

“One of the things we’re going to be very focused on is trade because trade has not been done well for 25 years by the United States with this part of the world, with any part of the world,” he said on Air Force One.

“We’re going to be discussing reciprocal trade. Fair, free but reciprocal,” he said.","Trump in Japan stresses unity on North Korea; talks trade, too",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia-japan-northkorea/trump-in-japan-stresses-unity-on-north-korea-talks-trade-too-idUSKBN1D501N

First Secretary of State Damian Green said the claims by a former senior police officer in a Sunday newspaper were “completely untrue” and “political smears.”

“This story is completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source,” Green said in a statement on his Twitter page. The claims amount to “little more than an unscrupulous character assassination,” he said.

The Sunday Times reported on its front page that former Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Bob Quick alleged the material was discovered by officers during an inquiry into government leaks in 2008.

Quick, who was involved in the leak investigation, told the newspaper that officers had reported finding the “extreme” pornography on a parliamentary computer from Green’s office.

The claims against one of the prime minister’s closest allies risks deepening a growing sexual harassment scandal that led Britain’s defense minister Michael Fallon to resign last Wednesday.

Fallon said his behavior has “fallen short” of the standards expected by the British military.

May’s minority government is already struggling with divisions over Britain’s departure from the European Union.

Britain’s interior minister Amber Rudd said the issue would be investigated by the Cabinet Office on Monday and she denied the government was on the verge of collapse if Green resigned.

Rudd said Britain needed to address allegations of sexual harassment in the corridors of power.

“It is something that will take place, in terms of clearing out Westminster of that sort of behavior, and Westminster, including the government, will be better off after it,” she said.

Green, 61, has also denied a previous allegation that he made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman.

He said it was not true that he had touched the woman’s knee and told her that his “wife was very understanding” during a meeting in a pub in which the pair discussed her career aspirations and gossiped about sexual affairs in parliament.",PM May's deputy denies report pornography was found on office computer,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-green/mays-deputy-denies-report-pornography-was-found-on-office-computer-idUKKBN1D50J8

The streaming company suspended production earlier this week of the upcoming sixth and final season of the political intrigue drama, in which Spacey plays U.S. president Frank Underwood.

“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of ‘House of Cards’ that includes Kevin Spacey,” the company said in a statement late on Friday.

Spacey’s publicist cut ties with him on Thursday and it was not known who currently represents him.

His departure may not mean the end of the show, however.

“While we continue the ongoing investigation into the serious allegations concerning Kevin Spacey’s behavior on the set of ‘House of Cards,’ he has been suspended, effective immediately,” Media Rights Capital, the company that produces the show, said in a statement.

“MRC, in partnership with Netflix, will continue to evaluate a creative path forward for the program during the hiatus,” it said.

The Netflix statement also said the company will work with MRC to determine the show’s future.

Spacey, who has had a successful career in film, television and theater, is one of several big names in the entertainment business to be accused of sexual misconduct by people coming forward in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey

Weinstein.

Spacey apologized last weekend to actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. CNN reported on Thursday that eight current and former employees of “House of Cards,” who were not identified, alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the accusations.

Spacey, as part of his apology to Rapp, announced he was gay, which angered many in the LGBT community and beyond who saw his announcement as an effort to divert attention from the accusation by Rapp.

Spacey has sought evaluation and treatment, his representatives said in a statement on Wednesday, without providing details on the nature of the treatment.

The announcement that he would seek treatment followed harassment allegations against him this week by Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who worked in the London theater where Spacey was artistic director from 2004-2015, and U.S. filmmaker Tony Montana.

MRC said in a statement on Thursday it had handled one incident in 2012 in which a crew member it did not identify “shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey” and that immediate action had been taken and the issue was resolved.

It said Spacey had “willingly participated in a training process” and that it was not aware of any complaints since then involving the actor.

Netflix’s move to cut ties with Spacey went beyond “House of Cards.”

The company will not release the film “Gore,” which was in post-production and was produced by Spacey, its statement said.

The Confederation of British Industry’s monthly indicator of output for manufacturers, retailers and services companies remained at +11, its joint lowest level since June.

“Growth in the economy has remained relatively stable, although the pace of growth was a little slower than expected, particularly for retailers and manufacturers,” CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.

Britain’s economy slowed sharply in the first half of 2017 although it picked up a bit of pace in the third quarter.

The Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade on Thursday as it moved to head off what it sees as the inflationary impact of Brexit, even as it said economy will probably remain stuck in a slow gear over the next three years.

Output expectations for the next three months fell to +12 from +18 in September, the weakest reading since January.

The CBI said it expected growth to remain modest as inflation eats further into household spending power in late 2017 and early 2018 and uncertainty about Brexit dampens business investment next year.

Trump kicked off a 12-day Asian trip and is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.

He told reporters on Air Force One en route to Asia that North Korea would figure prominently in discussions, and also singled out trade, which he said had been “badly handled” in the region for years.

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

A top aide said last week Trump intends to tell Asian leaders the world is “running out of time” in dealing with the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.

“No dictator, no regime, no nation should ever underestimate American resolve,” Trump told hundreds of cheering U.S. and Japanese troops in camouflage uniforms gathered at Yokota Air Base, just west of Tokyo, soon after he arrived.

“Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it?” said Trump, who wore a bomber jacket as he addressed the troops.

North Korea’s recent actions, including several missiles that flew over Japan and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test, have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Recent drills over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have further heightened tensions.

“We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defense of our freedom,” Trump said.

He told reporters earlier on Air Force One that a decision would be made soon on whether to add reclusive North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Trump said his administration planned to take a different approach after years of what he termed “total weakness.”

“It’s a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved.”

In an apparent attempt to distinguish between North Korea’s leadership and ordinary people, he said he thought North Koreans were “great people.”

“And I hope it all works out for everybody.”

GOLF DIPLOMACY

Abe told reporters before Trump’s arrival that he welcomed the visit as a chance to deepen bilateral ties by building on the “friendship and trust” between the two leaders, fostered by several meetings that included a round of golf in Florida earlier this year.

“I hope we will be able to have thorough discussions about international issues, including North Korea,” he said.

Trump and Abe greeted each other with a handshake at a golf course to be used during the 2020 Olympic Games, changing clothes and heading out to play after what media said was a lunch of hamburgers. In an allusion to a Trump campaign slogan, they signed caps that said “Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.”

They discussed North Korea and trade while playing nine holes with Hideki Matsuyama, the world no. 3 pro golfer.

A senior White House official said the two leaders have developed a close bond since Trump took office in January.

“Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people!” Trump tweeted. For his part, Abe took to Twitter to say he played golf “with a marvellous friend (President Donald J. Trump) full of spirited conversation.”

The two leaders and their wives later dined on grilled Japanese premium beef at an upscale restaurant.

In brief pre-dinner remarks, Trump said U.S.-Japan ties were closer than ever. But he added: “We’ll have dinner tonight. I think we’ll insult everybody by continuing to talk about trade.”

Trump also said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, the longest Asian tour by any U.S. leader since George H.W. Bush in 1992.

“I think it’s expected that we will meet,” he said. “We want Putin’s help on North Korea.”

Trump wants a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before he visits Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Separately, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed that “now is the time to apply firm pressure on North Korea,” Kono told reporters.

A senior U.S. State Department official traveling with Tillerson said the pressure was having an effect.

“I think we have a better chance now than we’ve had in the last couple of decades to solve this problem because the most important thing is to have the international community completely united in order to really choke off the lifeline for North Korea. It’s got to be the way,” the official said.

TRADE TALKS

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to policies more favorable to the United States, a point Trump emphasized.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where Trump will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.

“One of the things we’re going to be very focused on is trade because trade has not been done well for 25 years by the United States with this part of the world, with any part of the world,” he said on Air Force One.

“We’re going to be discussing reciprocal trade. Fair, free but reciprocal,” he said.","Trump in Japan stresses unity on North Korea; talks trade, too",https://www.reuters.com/article/trump-asia-japan/trump-in-japan-stresses-unity-on-north-korea-talks-trade-too-idINKBN1D502U

“I thought I was going to be fired,” recalled the former employee nearly 40 years later. But Shinzo Abe, now Japan’s prime minister, stayed on the job at Japan’s third-largest steelmaker for three years before entering politics in 1982.

Abe has called the steel industry the backbone of the nation. Kobe Steel, a 112-year-old company in south-central Japan’s Hyogo prefecture, has risen from wartime devastation and natural disaster but its past is littered with examples of corporate misconduct.

Its admission last month that workers had tampered with product specifications for at least a decade is the latest in a string of scandals that has battered Japan’s reputation as a manufacturing powerhouse.

Clients around the world, including top carmakers and airplane manufacturers, have been scrambling to check whether the safety or performance of their products have been compromised.

Workers, executives and shopowners in Kobe, a gritty, industrial city bordered by sloping hills where cattle are bred for the famed Kobe beef, said they were concerned but not surprised by the scandal.

Kobe Steel, which has apologized for the tampering, declined comment for this article.

“The corporate culture was to look the other way even while you saw what was going on,” said a retired employee who worked at the company’s flagship steel plant, Kobe Works - a symbol of the city’s quick recovery from a 1995 earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people. The company’s other main plant in the area is Kakogawa Works, in the nearby city of Kakogawa.

“They were supposed to be instilling a culture that paid attention when improprieties were discovered,” the former employee said. “In the end they didn’t create such a corporate culture. That’s management’s responsibility.”

The company initially said some workers had falsified data on contract specifications for a relatively small amount of aluminum and copper products, but it later admitted the problem had spread.

In 2006, Kobe Steel admitted falsifying soot-emissions data from the blast furnaces at Kobe Works and Kakogawa Works.

The latest scandal reflects “exactly the same set-up”, said Shoichi Tarumoto, who was then mayor of Kakogawa. “It looks like nothing has changed at Kobe Steel.”

PAST PROBLEMS

Kobe Steel has admitted taking part in bid-rigging for a bridge project in 2005, and failing to report income to tax authorities in 2008, 2011 and 2013. The company exceeded established limits for ground and water pollution in 2006.

Illegal political funding to candidates in local assembly elections in 2009 prompted the resignations of the then CEO and chairman. And last year Kobe Steel admitted a subsidiary falsified data on stainless-steel products.

A senior official in local government who has dealt with the company for years said: “Kobe Steel always scouts the backstreets for shortcuts. That’s their nature.”

Although its local dominance has waned, Kobe Steel remains one of only two Kobe-based companies, along with Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd (7012.T), that have revenues over 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) a year. The Kakogawa Works is that city’s biggest company, vital as a local taxpayer and employer.

More than a third of the Kobe Steel group’s 6,123 domestic customers are concentrated in Hyogo or neighboring Osaka, according to credit-research firm Teikoku Databank. More than half its customers are small and midsize Japanese companies.

The other clients are spread around the world and include top automobile manufacturers, airplane makers, railways and nearly any industry that uses steel, aluminum or copper in any form. [nL4N1N834X]

No safety issues have been found so far because of the tampering, but Kobe Steel has withdrawn its forecast for its first annual profit in three years. Whatever the eventual economic impact, the scandal is already affecting morale in Kobe city.

“If Kobe Steel suffers a blow, this is the area that will be most affected,” said Tsuyoshi Matsuda of Teikoku Databank’s Kobe office.

Kobe Steel acknowledges some customers have shifted orders to other suppliers. Major banks are instructing their Kobe area branches to keep close watch on the credit management at companies that do business with the steelmaker, bankers say.

“HEAVY MOOD”

The scandal “isn’t an open topic on the job,” said a worker in his 30s, finishing the night shift around 8 a.m. at Kobe Works, a hulking jumble of rusting pipes, risers and tanks.

“Nobody says it out loud, but I think people are worried,” he said. “It’s a heavy mood.”

Shinzaike, the local train station closest to Kobe Works, is home to several bar-restaurants that count the company’s employees among their best customers. Since the latest scandal erupted, business has dried up, traders said.

“Looks like they’re holding back from going drinking,” said a pub owner.

Reservations for year-end parties would normally be starting now, but there haven’t been any yet, he added.

Abe, who worked at both the Kobe and Kakogawa works, has called his years at Kobe Steel “the starting point of my adult life.”

Last year, according to media reports, he urged young people entering the workforce to follow his example of learning from mistakes at Kobe Steel.

“I got through it without incident,” he said. “I want you not to be discouraged by a few mistakes but rather do the best you can.”","Scandal-hit Kobe Steel has a 'look the other way' culture, they say in hometown",https://www.reuters.com/article/kobe-steel-scandal-hometown/scandal-hit-kobe-steel-has-a-look-the-other-way-culture-they-say-in-hometown-idINKBN1D505W

UEFA’s Nations League starts next September and features four divisions of national teams, replacing friendlies with competitive fixtures.

While the format has yet to be tested, the idea of a similar style of competition has already been under consideration at CONCACAF, which governs the sport in North and Central America and the Caribbean.

With UEFA’s competition set to fill the international dates left for friendly games, teams in other confederations will find it difficult to get windows for games against European nations.

Responding to reports that UEFA was talking with other confederations, the global governing body said it was directly involved in the discussions.

“FIFA has been always involved from the beginning in the process. Thanks to the cooperative atmosphere FIFA will continue to have constructive discussions about the next steps together with UEFA and the other confederations,” the global governing body said in a statement.

UEFA said it had begun the process of consultation with all concerned bodies.

”UEFA can confirm that it has initiated discussions regarding the evolution of the UEFA Nations League. These constructive discussions involve our national associations, European football stakeholders, all confederations and of course FIFA, with whom we have a very good relationship.

“We have included them in discussions on this topic since the start. No decisions have been made at this time,” it said in a statement.

CONCACAF did not respond to a request for comment but in April their president Victor Montagliani told Reuters that the body was well on the way to creating its own version of UEFA’s competition.

“There has been overwhelming acceptance that it is a great idea and the way we need to go. There are a few formats that we have looked at and we have had various members coming back with ideas,” he said.

“What people need to realize is that the world of friendlies is going to change, with Europe changing to the Nations League, it is going to get harder to get friendlies,” said Montagliani who believes that will be no great loss.

While discussions are at a relatively early stage, one of the ideas that has been floated in media reports is for regional ‘leagues’ with a mini-tournament involving the winners from across the world.

Such mini-tournaments could also be held for teams from the lower divisions from different confederations, creating a sort of ‘minnows World Cup’.",FIFA and confederations look at expanding UEFA's Nations League,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1D50CO-OZASP

Typhoon Damrey, the 12th major storm to hit Vietnam this year, made landfall on Saturday with winds of up to 90 km/h (56 mph) that damaged more than 40,000 homes, knocked down electricity poles and uprooted trees.

The communist state’s Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention said 27 people were now counted dead and 22 were missing. It said 626 houses had collapsed entirely in a trail of destruction that has forced the evacuation of more than 30,000 people.

Heavy rain and high winds lashed the coastal strip on Sunday. Some streets in the ancient capital of Hue were waist deep in water while in the old trading town of Hoi An, another popular tourist attraction, people boated in the streets.

“This is the worst it has been for many years. The waters rose very fast,” said Nguyen Thi Thuan, 64, sitting on one chair and with her feet on another as waters lapped around and into her clothes shop.

The national disaster agency forecast that rain would last until Tuesday and that flooding could worsen.

Battle tanks were mobilized to help with rescue efforts in Nha Trang, which bore the brunt of the typhoon.

Danang, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit is taking place this week, is around 500 km (310 miles) to the north of Nha Trang. It also suffered.

A gateway proclaiming “Welcome to Danang” collapsed in the storm.

“I call all officials, soldiers and citizens of Danang city to come together and try their best to clean up after the rains and welcome delegates to APEC,” Huynh Duc Tho, chairman of Danang City’s people committee said in a message to the city.

Danang will host U.S. President Donald Trump from Nov. 10, as well as China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and counterparts from other APEC members.

The storm moved from the coastal area into a key coffee-growing region of the world’s biggest producer of robusta coffee beans. The typhoon had damaged some coffee trees at the start of the harvest season, farm officials said. But farmers in Daklak, the heart of the region, said the damage was limited.

The government said on Saturday more than 40,000 hectares of crops had been damaged, including sugar cane, rice fields and rubber plantations.

T-Mobile, under charismatic CEO John Legere, keeps hitting home runs, already reporting it that added 1.3 million net customers in the third quarter - the 18th time in a row it has achieved the feat.

T-Mobile reported revenues in the third quarter that topped $10 billion for the first time, up 8 percent.

The picture for Deutsche Telekom group on Thursday is likely to be different, with analysts on average forecasting group revenues of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion) - a year-on-year gain of just 1.6 percent.

That would reflect barely positive growth in Telekom’s crowded and heavily regulated home market, where sales rose just 0.4 percent in the first half, and at its European holdings that were ahead by just 1.5 percent.

Deutsche Telekom, which has toyed with options for its U.S. business for years, put a brave face on the unraveling of the deal on Saturday night, saying T-Mobile would continue its successful growth strategy.

“We supported our American subsidiary to invest more than $40 billion over the last years, thus building a basis for strong growth in the upcoming years,” CEO Tim Hoettges said.

HOME AND AWAY

But some investors wonder whether the best years may now be behind T-Mobile, whose shares have risen ninefold from the low they hit after the global financial crisis to a peak of $68 in June.

“I’d just love them to sell it,” one UK-based fund manager who holds Deutsche Telekom stock said last week as reports surfaced that the T-Mobile-Sprint talks were in trouble.

At T-Mobile’s latest share price, Deutsche Telekom’s 64 percent stake would be worth $31 billion.

“There’s a tendency to run things for ever, sometimes, and then you end up selling at the wrong times,” the fund manager added.

Together, T-Mobile and Sprint would have had about 130 million customers, putting a merged entity a close third in the United States behind market leaders AT&T and Verizon.

Alone, T-Mobile has 70.7 million customers, requiring a lot more good quarters to close the gap on its own.

Lacking sufficient scale and running a mobile-first strategy, T-Mobile may face challenges if Sprint, controlled by Japan’s Softbank Group, revives its efforts to hook up with a U.S. cable firm, according to a top-10 Telekom shareholder.

An approach by Softbank chief Masayoshi Son was rebuffed in July by Charter Communications.

Use of social media and mobile instant messaging services has exploded in Afghanistan over recent years. Social media users and civil rights groups reacted with outrage to initial reports of the move and the letter sent by telecoms regulator ATRA was widely shared on social media.

Some media reports, citing unidentified sources, said the move had been ordered by the National Directorate for Security to thwart the use of the encrypted messaging services by the Taliban and other insurgent groups.

It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports.

The acting minister for telecommunications, Shahzad Aryobee, posted a message on Facebook saying that the telecoms regulator had been ordered to put a gradual block on the services to improve their functioning after complaints had been received.

“The government is committed to freedom of speech and knows that it is a basic civil right for our people,” he wrote.

The letter by telecoms regulator ATRA, dated Nov. 1 and signed by an official of the regulator, directed internet companies to block Telegram and Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) WhatsApp services “without delay” for a period of 20 days.

However, the service worked normally this week and still appeared to be working normally on Saturday on both state-owned operator Salaam and private service providers.

On Friday, there were reports of interruptions but it was not clear whether they were caused by a deliberate shutdown or by the unrelated issues with WhatsApp services that were experienced in several countries.

Mobile phone services have been one of the big success stories in Afghanistan since the Taliban were ousted from power by a U.S.-led campaign in 2001, but there are also frequent complaints from users about quality and coverage.

WhatsApp and similar services, including Facebook Messenger and Viber, are widely used by Afghan politicians and members of the government as well as by the Taliban, which has a sophisticated social media operation of its own.

The movement’s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, wrote to reporters this week giving his Viber number “in case WhatsApp is not working”.","Afghanistan moves to block WhatsApp, Telegram messaging services",https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-internet/afghanistan-moves-to-block-whatsapp-telegram-messaging-services-idINKBN1D4072

All are wanted by Madrid for actions related to the push for the region’s secession from Spain. Puigdemont has become the public face of that move for independence.

Other charges are the misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to the secessionist campaign, which has thrown Spain into a political crisis just as its economy has recovered from a sharp downturn and banking stress.

Madrid has taken over administrative control in Catalonia, until then an autonomous region, and called new elections on Dec 21.

Two polls on Sunday suggested pro-Catalonia independence parties will together win December’s regional election although they may fall just short of a majority of seats in parliament needed to revive the secession campaign.

Parties supporting Catalonia staying in Spain would divide seats but garner around 54 percent of the vote, the polls suggested.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium shortly after Madrid took control. On Sunday morning, Puigdemont and four of his former councillors presented themselves to police in Brussels.

A judge will hear the defendants case on Sunday afternoon and has until Monday morning to decide whether the formalities for the extradition request have been fulfilled.

According to a GAD3 survey of 1,233 people conducted between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 and published in La Vanguardia newspaper, pro-independence parties ERC, PDeCAT and CUP would take between 66 and 69 seats in the 135-seat parliament.

A second poll taken over the same period for the conservative newspaper La Razon echoed the GAD3 survey, showing pro-independence parties would capture the most votes though still fall just shy of a parliamentary majority with 65 seats.

Other seats would be generally divided between parties that support the region remaining as part of Spain, though they would run on separate tickets.

Voter participation, however, will rise to a record of 83 percent, the GAD3 poll showed.

POLITICIANS ON REMAND

Under the European arrest warrant system, the five defendants in Belgium can agree to an extradition order immediately or the judge can set bail or detain them. Belgian authorities have to inform their European counterparts if a European arrest warrant cannot be executed after 90 days.

On Saturday, Puigdemont - who PDeCAT said on Sunday would lead the party in the election - called for a united Catalan political front for independence from Spain and against the detention of his former members of government.

On Thursday, nine of his sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial.

One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was freed after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,035) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

According to the GAP3 survey, 59 percent believed legal action against Puigdemont was unjustified while 69.3 percent said the jailing of the Catalan politicians would give the independence cause a boost at the ballot box.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest the detentions.

The Catalonia issue has sent shockwaves across Europe, energizing regions with their own secessionist agenda while unnerving those fighting to keep the European Union from fracturing further.

Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon, a member of the Flemish nationalist and separatist party N-VA, criticized Spain’s handling of situation on Sunday, saying Madrid “went too far” in an interview with Belgian broadcaster VTM.

Madrid says the judiciary acts independently of the legislative arm of government while adding that Catalonia leaders acted outside the rule of law when organizing the vote and making the declaration of independence.

BACK TO THE START

A pro-secessionist rally in Barcelona on Sunday attracted just a few hundred people, a long way from the hundreds of thousands to join pro-independence marches in October. Many of those attending waved the regional flag and carried protest signs.

One protester, Antonia Aguilera, 63, said she was concerned the new elections would not be fair and would be manipulated by the Spanish government.

The region has been without a government since January, when a decade-long power-sharing agreement between the Democratic Unionist Party and Irish nationalist group Sinn Fein ended amid a financial scandal. Attempts to forge a new deal were scuppered by Sinn Fein’s demands for legal protections for the Irish language, the main tongue of 0.2 percent of the population. The party has been emboldened by UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to form an alliance with the DUP to preserve her majority at Westminster.

The stalemate is bad news for Northern Ireland’s economy. It is already one of the least productive in the developed world according to PwC data, and is reliant on fiscal transfers from London for roughly 30 percent of government income. It will now rely on Westminster to pass a budget, and, if there is no truce, to rule directly. The status of 1 billion pounds of additional funding promised to the DUP as a quid pro quo for propping up Theresa May’s government is now in question, delaying infrastructure projects. The parties’ ambitions to lower the region’s corporate tax rate may be shelved too, reducing its ability to compete with the low-tax Republic of Ireland.

Economic strains will have political consequences. The province’s dismal economy will be particularly stark when compared with the Republic of Ireland. It is already on track to grow more than four times faster this year than the 1.2 percent forecast for Northern Ireland according to EY data. An abrupt exit from the EU could further hurt Northern Ireland, if it means the return of a hard border with the Republic.

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he raised the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to sell about 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest initial public offer ever.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition among New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment.

NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also received some government support for its bid, although that has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

While Trump’s tweet named the New York Stock Exchange, it did not mention rival Nasdaq Inc, which is also vying for the Aramco listing.

“Generally, public servants should be impartial, not give preferential treatment to anyone, and avoid endorsements,” said Scott Amey, general counsel for the government ethics watchdog Project on Government Oversight in Washington. “We have already seen violations in this administration, and it doesn’t help that the president isn’t leading by example.”

Nasdaq replied to Trump in a tweet, saying it agreed the United States was the “best destination for global companies” but that Aramco belongs on Nasdaq “with the 5 most valuable operating companies in the world.”

AWAITING A DECISION

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials say they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA. Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has been an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

Still, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. Saudi leaders welcomed him warmly during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against their nation’s diplomatic archrival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

“President Trump’s tweet indicates that, from the White House’s perspective at least, a public listing of Aramco is not as dead as some recent reports indicated,” said Bob McNally, president of Washington-based energy market and policy consultant Rapidan Energy Group.

“The tweet suggests the White House believes Saudi Arabia may be approaching a decision on where to list and wishes to either claim credit or push a possibly wavering Saudi Arabia for a New York listing,” McNally added.

Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock. The prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings, including IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.",Trump backs New York in bourses' battle for Saudi Aramco listing,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1D40IL-OCABS

European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts.

Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries.

The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it.

Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package.

The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code.

Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business.

However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units.

Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs.

BLUNT INSTRUMENT

“Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

“I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee.

Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes.

As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018.

European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.

Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties.

“That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy.

He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.”

Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes.

The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law.

The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns.

The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week.

Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well.

There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.

It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said.

“You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?”

Reuters requests for comment from Weinstein’s representative and his lawyer were not immediately answered.

New York City Police Department Deputy Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told a news conference that the alleged victim “put forth a credible and detailed narrative.”

“We have an actual case here,” Boyce said. He said the police department became aware of the accusation on October 25.

Boyce said it was a seven-year-old case and “we have to move forward gathering evidence.”

Boyce said that because Weinstein was out of state the police department would need a court-ordered warrant for any arrest.

More than 50 women have claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them over the past three decades. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

Boyce said police had spoken to the woman and “we found corroboration along the way.”

He said the NYPD was working on the case with the Manhattan district attorney’s office.

Lonmin, not for the first time, is facing an uncertain future after its shares lost 30 percent on Friday when it delayed annual financial results due this month pending the conclusion of a business review.

The company said it had adequate liquidity to fund it through a review that could include the sale of assets, job cuts and the renegotiation of loan agreements.

There has also been speculation about a deal to combine with fellow South African miner Sibanye-Stillwater (SGLJ.J)

Lonmin, one of the world’s top platinum producers, has been in the doldrums for years due to low prices and soaring costs and has been to shareholders for rights issues to shore up its balance sheet three times since 2009.

Investors have not been rewarded for their support. Lonmin’s share price the past five years is down 97 percent.

Monday’s ceremony will be held at Lonmin’s plush conference centre and game farm, a location that sets it up for a potential public relations “own goal” as the trade union Solidarity has urged the company to sell as it moves to cut over 1,100 jobs.

“It is insensitive to retrench mine workers ... whilst enjoying the luxury of a game farm,” Lonmin General Secretary Gideon du Plessis said.

It will at least offer Chief Executive Ben Magara a platform to deliver his first public comments since Friday’s meltdown.

SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS

The latest crisis comes after Lonmin said in September that South Africa’s mines ministry had informed it of failure to meet some of its social and labour obligations, but it did not think its operating licence was in jeopardy.

South African mining companies must comply with a number of social and labour regulations, including providing proper housing, to help a mostly black labour force that was exploited and ill-treated under apartheid.

Lonmin has fallen short here before. A probe into the police killing of 34 miners in 2012 during a violent wildcat strike at its Marikana mine found Lonmin had failed in its pledge to build 5,500 houses, with only three erected.

On Monday, the company plans to show how it is now meeting its social and labour obligations, an added cost in a tough environment for all platinum producers.

According to South Africa’s Chamber of Mines, 65 percent of the country’s platinum operations are loss-making as the industry grapples with soaring costs and depressed prices.

Those that are performing well - such as African Rainbow Minerals (ARIJ.J) and Implats’ Two Rivers JV and Anglo American Platinum’s (AMSJ.J) Mogalakwena mine - are mechanised, shielding them from steeply rising wage costs and giving them productivity boosts.

Lonmin several years ago abandoned a failed and costly attempt at mechanisation in the face of an unforgiving geology - one of many missteps that have cost it in the long run.

On a range of fronts, Lonmin is battling. It posted a first-half operating loss of $181 million(£138 million), knocked by a fall in production and rising costs.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

Starring Brannagh as eccentric detective Hercule Poirot, the film premiered in London on Thursday and features a star-studded cast, including Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and “The Force Awakens” star Daisy Ridley.

“Previous film versions have been romps and they’ve been wonderful, but it felt like with this group of actors it could get a little more dark and a little more emotional, and surprise and divert in a different way,” Brannagh told Reuters at the film’s premiere.

A ‘whodunit’ tale, the film follows Brannagh’s detective as he seeks to unmask a murderer among the passengers on board the glamorous train, trapped by an avalanche in mountainous terrain in southern Europe.

Christie, who died in 1976 aged 85, is cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the bestselling novelist of all time.

Over 30 feature films have been based on her work, including a 1974 version of “Murder on the Orient Express,” that saw Ingrid Bergman win an Academy Award for her performance.

Despite a rich pedigree in print, film and television, Brannagh’s film represents something of a cinematic resurrection for Christie’s work, with the most recent previous cinematic adaptation being 1985’s “Ordeal by Innocence.”

“It’s been 30 years, I guess, since we’ve had a proper cinema film,” said James Prichard, Christie’s great grandson and CEO of Agatha Christie Ltd., the company which manages the rights to her works.

“I’d love to say that it was a strategy, that we held it back and refused to allow it, but actually we kind of went out of fashion for a bit, certainly on the big screen.”

“Murder on the Orient Express,” is the first in an upcoming slew of new film and television adaptations of Agatha Christie properties, which include a production of “Witness for the Prosecution,” directed by and starring Oscar-winner Ben Affleck.

So, will Christie’s Poirot go the way of modern-day cinematic heavyweights, superheroes like Spider-Man or Iron Man, and spawn a franchise?

“I think Ken’s been fantastic, and I think the idea of this being a one-off Ken Poirot would be sad, so I’d love to see him do more,” Prichard said.

To thousands of foreign dignitaries, journalists and his own subjects, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to return the kingdom his family has ruled since 1932 to the more moderate society that prevailed before the siege of the Grand Mosque 38 years ago. He may need the global financial community’s help to make it happen.

Saudi has doled out money to global institutions for decades, hoping to generate income for its monarchy. Now the crown prince is turning the tables. At the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, the heir to the throne exhorted global entrepreneurs, business leaders and money managers to put some of their treasure to work in the kingdom. A precondition for that should be that Saudi modernizes, improving the role of women and establishing a more just criminal justice system.

The pitch is sinking in. “The opening up of Saudi Arabia - to try to take things back to before 1979 - is brave, it’s bold,“ Richard Branson said at the so-called ”Davos in the desert“ hosted by the country’s Public Investment Fund last week. The Virgin Group founder is considering backing tourism enterprises along Saudi Arabia’s unspoiled coastline on the Red Sea. ”Young people want it, the women want it and I think most sensible men want it too.”

Nobody seems to want it more than the crown prince, who at 32 is closer in age to more of his subjects than his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz. Reforming the economy is existential for the House of Saud. If the country cannot provide a hopeful vision for the 33 million people – just under two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30 - the current king could very well be the last. Balancing Islamic traditions and foreign innovations and money – without a bloody revolution – is a demanding transfiguration.

This is why the crown prince’s reference to 1979 was huge – not just because it came during a panel led by a female American journalist. “We will not spend 30 years of our lives dealing with extremist ideologies. We will destroy them today and immediately,” he said to thunderous applause. “Saudi was not like this before 1979. Saudi Arabia and the entire region went through a revival after 1979. All we are doing is going back to what we were: a moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world.”

Some history helps to understand the importance of that statement. Just a few weeks short of 38 years ago, armed religious militants stormed and occupied the Grand Mosque of Mecca – the holiest place in the Muslim world – and demanded the overthrow of the royal family. The siege lasted for two weeks and was resolved with the assistance of French commandos who converted to Islam so they could enter the mosque, according to Lawrence Wright’s account in the “The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11.”

Following the siege, and public beheadings of 63 rebels, King Khalid bin Abdulaziz doubled down on religion. He expanded the role of conservative religious clerics in Saudi life and allowed Wahhabi leaders to impose sweeping restrictions on cinemas, musical performances and the mingling of genders, among other things. Last week, the crown prince effectively called the last 38 years lost.

The prince must move cautiously enough to accommodate hard-liners, but fast enough to keep his youthful people from rebelling against Saudi’s income inequality. Already the country’s religious police have seen their powers curtailed, and in September the government said it would relax the prohibition on women driving. Though attendees of the conference, arriving in chauffeur-driven Mercedes, applauded talk about making Saudi moderate again it’s not evident they reflect the will of the masses.

That explains NEOM – the city on the Red Sea that the crown prince promised to build from scratch with $500 billion of oil booty. NEOM’s laws and rules will be different from Saudi Arabia’s and determined by the entrepreneurs who populate it, the crown prince says. Though that may not include lifting the prohibition on alcohol, or removing the death penalty for cases of homosexuality or blasphemy, it appears to be a way for him to offer an alternative to the more conservative lifestyle that has governed Saudi since 1979.

NEOM will need global validation - and money. The Vision Fund, in which the kingdom has said it would invest $45 billion alongside SoftBank and others, has already stepped up, pledging to take a stake in the Saudi Electric Co, a utility that will help power NEOM. Though it’s an odd way to channel some of the state’s own money back into the country, bringing along foreign investors could be seen as a validation of the kingdom’s plan.

The crown prince, in an interview, denied that there is any quid pro quo for global investors, like SoftBank, to reinvest funds into Saudi Arabia. “We don’t want to squeeze investors. If we cannot offer good opportunities in Saudi that means no one would come,” he said. “We think we really have great opportunities in Saudi Arabia. We want to shape it and to invest in it ourselves and also to allow people all over the world to invest in it.”

His charms are having an effect. BlackRock and Blackstone Group, with whom the kingdom has invested $20 billion in a fund dedicated to infrastructure, are opening offices in Riyadh, the crown prince told Breakingviews. That should be a sign that their leaders, Larry Fink and Steve Schwarzman, respectively, believe in the crown prince. But there is a flip side to this.

Should the crown prince fail to dismantle the gender apartheid of his predecessors the money managers – and indeed other investors like SoftBank or Branson’s Virgin - could find themselves needing to explain to their own shareholders and customers why they are invested in the kingdom. With the two Wall Street firms alone commanding $6 trillion of assets, that’s a pretty strong incentive for them to help keep the crown prince to his word.",Breakingviews - Cox: Saudi crown prince revealed his magic number,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-investment-breakingviewsbreakin/breakingviews-cox-saudi-crown-prince-revealed-his-magic-number-idUSKBN1D21WW

Trump kicked off a 12-day Asian trip and is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.

He told reporters on Air Force One en route to Asia that North Korea would figure prominently in discussions, and also singled out trade, which he said had been “badly handled” in the region for years.

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

A top aide said last week Trump intends to tell Asian leaders the world is “running out of time” in dealing with the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.

“No dictator, no regime, no nation should ever underestimate American resolve,” Trump told hundreds of cheering U.S. and Japanese troops in camouflage uniforms gathered at Yokota Air Base, just west of Tokyo, soon after he arrived.

“Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it?” said Trump, who wore a bomber jacket as he addressed the troops.

North Korea’s recent actions, including several missiles that flew over Japan and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test, have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Recent drills over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have further heightened tensions.

“We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defense of our freedom,” Trump said.

He told reporters earlier on Air Force One that a decision would be made soon on whether to add reclusive North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Trump said his administration planned to take a different approach after years of what he termed “total weakness.”

“It’s a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved.”

In an apparent attempt to distinguish between North Korea’s leadership and ordinary people, he said he thought North Koreans were “great people.”

“And I hope it all works out for everybody.”

GOLF DIPLOMACY

Abe told reporters before Trump’s arrival that he welcomed the visit as a chance to deepen bilateral ties by building on the “friendship and trust” between the two leaders, fostered by several meetings that included a round of golf in Florida earlier this year.

“I hope we will be able to have thorough discussions about international issues, including North Korea,” he said.

Trump and Abe greeted each other with a handshake at a golf course to be used during the 2020 Olympic Games, changing clothes and heading out to play after what media said was a lunch of hamburgers. In an allusion to a Trump campaign slogan, they signed caps that said “Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.”

They discussed North Korea and trade while playing nine holes with Hideki Matsuyama, the world no. 3 pro golfer.

A senior White House official said the two leaders have developed a close bond since Trump took office in January.

“Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people!” Trump tweeted. For his part, Abe took to Twitter to say he played golf “with a marvellous friend (President Donald J. Trump) full of spirited conversation.”

The two leaders and their wives later dined on grilled Japanese premium beef at an upscale restaurant.

In brief pre-dinner remarks, Trump said U.S.-Japan ties were closer than ever. But he added: “We’ll have dinner tonight. I think we’ll insult everybody by continuing to talk about trade.”

Trump also said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, the longest Asian tour by any U.S. leader since George H.W. Bush in 1992.

“I think it’s expected that we will meet,” he said. “We want Putin’s help on North Korea.”

Trump wants a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before he visits Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Separately, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed that “now is the time to apply firm pressure on North Korea,” Kono told reporters.

A senior U.S. State Department official traveling with Tillerson said the pressure was having an effect.

“I think we have a better chance now than we’ve had in the last couple of decades to solve this problem because the most important thing is to have the international community completely united in order to really choke off the lifeline for North Korea. It’s got to be the way,” the official said.

TRADE TALKS

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to policies more favorable to the United States, a point Trump emphasized.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where Trump will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.

“One of the things we’re going to be very focused on is trade because trade has not been done well for 25 years by the United States with this part of the world, with any part of the world,” he said on Air Force One.

“We’re going to be discussing reciprocal trade. Fair, free but reciprocal,” he said.","Trump in Japan stresses unity on North Korea; talks trade, too",https://www.reuters.com/article/trump-asia-japan/trump-in-japan-stresses-unity-on-north-korea-talks-trade-too-idINKBN1D502U?il=0

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Also seen is Manafort's wife Kathleen (L). REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan

Manafort, who ran Trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year, and associate Richard Gates earlier this week pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment by a federal grand jury.

The charges include conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. They are part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election in Trump’s favor and potential collusion by Trump associates.

In the Saturday court filing, Manafort offered to limit his travel to New York, Washington and Florida and pledged life insurance worth about $4.5 million as well as about $8 million in real estate assets, including a property on Fifth Avenue in New York that was identified by some media outlets as an apartment in Trump Tower.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said on Thursday that initial bail terms would remain in place and set a bail hearing for Monday to consider changes. On Friday, she suggested a potential May 7 trial date.

Manafort and Gates are under house arrest, under unsecured bonds of $10 million and $5 million, respectively, which means they do not have to post the bail unless they fail to show up for court or violate other conditions.

Prosecutors have argued there is a risk of flight and both men are subject to electronic monitoring.

As part of the indictment, the special counsel’s office is seeking forfeiture of four of Manafort’s properties in connection with money laundering charges.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on Saturday.

Manafort, 68, in the filing also explained why he had three different U.S. passports, a fact noted by prosecutors. Manafort’s lawyer, Kevin Downing, rejected suggestions that Manafort was a “Jason Bourne character” - referencing a fictitious, globe-trotting, rogue covert agent.

“The facts are much more mundane,” Downing wrote.

Manafort had two passports, including one for submitting to foreign governments to receive visas while traveling on the other, his lawyers said. He was issued a third passport because one had been lost and Manafort contacted passport services to advise them it was found.

Downing also wrote that funds Manafort had deposited in accounts on the island of Cyprus were legal and now had only “nominal” balances. Prosecutors said Manafort and Gates used numerous entities to transmit more than $18 million from Ukraine through Cyprus and eventually to the United States.

Federal prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday that Manafort’s financial assets were substantial, but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from $19 million to $136 million.

O exame de Guerrero deu positivo para um estimulante após a partida Argentina-Peru em 15 de outubro e recebeu uma suspensão preliminar de 30 dias, informou a Federação peruana de Futebol na sexta-feira.

Com a proibição é quase certo que ele não participe da primeira partida contra a Nova Zelândia, em Wellington, em 11 de novembro e a partida de retorno em Lima, quatro dias depois. O vencedor garantirá um lugar na Copa do Mundo do próximo ano na Rússia.

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

French and German officials confirmed Le Maire would be in Berlin on Wednesday, when he will meet acting Finance Minister Peter Altmaier, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Le Maire is also due to see Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), and Cem Oezdemir, co-leader of the Greens party. Both are in discussions with Merkel’s conservatives on forming a coalition government.

France’s Emmanuel Macron has made euro zone reform a central goal of his five-year presidency. But any changes will require the support of Merkel and her new government, which is not expected to be in place before Christmas. Lindner has been critical of Macron’s idea to create a budget for the euro zone.

“We want to follow up on the president’s Sorbonne speech and exchange views on the future of the euro zone,” a French finance ministry official said, referring to a speech by Macron in September when he laid out his vision for EU reform.

While Le Maire’s visit - his first to Berlin since the German election - is about strengthening contacts with likely members of the new government, officials indicated that it would also be an opportunity to sound out Berlin on the Eurogroup presidency, a powerful position that will be elected next month.

Since it was created in 2005, the Eurogroup, which brings together the euro zone’s 19 finance ministers, has had only two presidents: Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who served from 2005 to 2013, and former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is due to step down in January.

The position involves chairing monthly meetings and driving policy around economic and monetary union, including ensuring that all member states stick to strict targets on deficits and debt. The post has been dubbed “Mr Euro”.

“NO NATURAL CANDIDATE”

Le Maire, 48, is regarded as sharp, ambitious and more than capable of leading the group. But some euro zone officials are wary about the presidency ending up in the hands of either Germany or France, the two largest economies in the single currency bloc and already dominant forces in policymaking.

A further complication for Le Maire is France’s poor record of meeting its own deficit targets over the past decade. German officials are not ruling out Le Maire, but they have also expressed a preference for giving the post to a smaller country.

Last week, one official in Berlin mentioned two possible alternatives: Pierre Gramegna of Luxembourg and Peter Kazimir of Slovakia. The official also floated the idea of extending Dijsselbloem, seen as a close ally of Berlin, even though he is not part of the new Dutch government.

“It is still quite unclear who will come forward,” the German official said when asked about the presidency. “At this stage there does not seem to be one candidate everyone is rallying behind. There is no natural candidate.”

The Eurogroup president will be chosen on Dec. 4, an EU official said last week, with the formal call for candidates opening in mid-November.

“It is not a done thing,” the German official said of Le Maire’s candidacy. “He will only apply if he gets the impression that he is the one.”

The talks in Berlin on Wednesday could be decisive in determining whether he does throw his hat into the ring.

If Le Maire were to get the job, it could have repercussions for other top euro zone jobs. Mario Draghi will end his term as president of the European Central Bank on Oct. 31, 2019, and Germany’s Jens Weidmann is already being mentioned as a potential successor.

Euro zone watchers say that if the French secure the presidency of the Eurogroup, it may be harder for them to argue against a German candidate taking over the ECB.

Still, as one senior French official told Reuters on condition of anonymity last month, Weidmann at the helm of the ECB “would be a problem for a lot of countries, not just for France”.",France's Le Maire heads to Berlin to test Eurogroup waters,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D50U8

O piloto de 36 anos tinha se aposentado na temporada passada, mas foi chamado de volta pela equipe de Williams após Valtteri Bottas ir para a Mercedes diante da surpreendente aposentadoria do campeão mundial de 2016, Nico Rosberg.

Após uma despedida emocionante no Brasil no ano passado, Massa voltou no cockpit alguns meses depois.

“Como sabem, no ano passado eu decidi anunciar minha aposentadoria na Fórmula 1, mas, devido ao pedido de Williams, eu decidi fazer outra temporada”, disse o ex-piloto da Ferrari em mensagem de vídeo publicada nas mídias sociais.

“Mas esta vez será a minha última corrida no Brasil da Fórmula 1 e minha última corrida em Abu Dhabi”, acrescentou, agradecendo a sua família, fãs e patrocinadores e deixando claro que ele não está se aposentando totalmente de competições.

“Eu realmente espero que você possa me apoiar no próximo ano ou talvez no futuro em outras em outras categorias”, disse ele.

A Williams ainda não anunciou sua equipe de 2018, com vários candidatos, incluindo Robert Kubica da Polônia. O novato canadense Lance Stroll certamente continuará.

Puigdemont viajou para a Bélgica pouco após Madri tomar o controle do governo regional da Catalunha. Ele é acusado de diversas ações ligadas ao movimento pró-secessão, incluindo rebelião, sedição, uso indevido de recursos públicos, desobediência e violação de confiança em relação à campanha separatista.

O ex-líder da Catalunha se apresentou à polícia em meio à divulgação de duas pesquisas neste domingo sugerindo que os partidos pró-independência devem juntos conquistar a maior parte dos assentos nas eleições regionais de dezembro, embora possam obter menos que a maioria necessária para ressuscitar a campanha separatista.

Partidos a favor de que a Catalunha continue sendo parte da Espanha devem dividir assentos, reunindo cerca de 54 por cento dos votos, apontaram os levantamentos.

O primeiro-ministro espanhol, Mariano Rajoy, convocou para 21 de dezembro as eleições depois de demitir o governo anterior e decretar administração direta sobre a região autônoma, reagindo à declaração unilateral de independência por parte de parlamentares catalães, no dia 27 de outubro.

O esforços para reconhecimento da independência da Catalunha conduziram a Espanha para a pior crise política desde o retorno à democracia quatro décadas atrás, com o sentimento pró-secessão na região fomentando o nacionalismo em todo o país.

Conforme levantamento da GAD3, realizado com 1.233 pessoas entre 30 de outubro e 3 de novembro e publicada no jornal La Vanguardia, os partidos pró-independência ERC, PDECat e CUP conquistariam entre 66 e 69 das 135 cadeiras do parlamento.

Uma segunda pesquisa realizada no mesmo período para o jornal conservador La Razón mostrou os mesmos resultados apresentados pela GAD3, com os partidos pró-independência obtendo a maior parte dos votos, embora ainda não sejam a maioria com 65 assentos.

A participação dos eleitores aumentaria para um recorde de 83 por cento, mostrou a pesquisa GAD3.

POLÍTICOS DETIDOS

No sábado, Puigdemont, que o PDECat disse neste domingo que lideraria o partido na votação de dezembro, pediu uma frente política catalã unida para as eleições.

Na quinta-feira, nove membros do seu gabinete destituído do poder tiveram pedido de prisão preventiva decretado pela Corte Superior da Espanha em meio a investigações e potencial julgamento.

Um deles, Santi Vila, foi libertado após pagar uma fiança de 50 mil euros na sexta-feira. Os outros oito podem permanecer sob custódia por até quatro anos.

Ainda segundo o levantamento da GAP3, 59 por cento dos entrevistados consideram a ação judicial contra Puigdemont injustificável, enquanto 69,3 por cento disseram que a prisão de políticos catalães daria força ao movimento pró-independência nas urnas.

Grupos cívicos na Catalunha que tiveram os líderes detidos no mês passado, convocaram uma greve geral para 8 de novembro e uma manifestação em massa no dia 11 para protestar contra as prisões.

Uma protesto em Barcelona neste domingo, contudo, atraiu poucas centenas de participantes, bem menos que as milhares de pessoas que se juntaram às marchas de outubro.",Ex-líder da Catalunha se entrega à polícia; pesquisas apontam mais assentos para separatistas em eleição,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1D50U0-OBRTP

Along with Pashto, the language of the Pashtuns, Dari is named in the constitution as one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.","KABUL (Reuters) - The BBC is facing an angry reaction in Afghanistan after it changed the name of one of its local language Facebook pages to BBC Dari, the official name of the Afghan version of Persian or Farsi but one rejected by many local Persian speakers.

The Facebook page and other social media sites were bombarded by criticisms of the change. Many Persian speakers say the name Dari has been imposed historically by the traditionally dominant Pashto ethnic group as an implicit denial of Afghanistan’s place in the wider Persian-speaking world.

The reaction highlighted the sensitivity of linguistic issues in Afghanistan, a country with a mix of over 35 languages spoken by ethnic groups including Pashtuns, Tajiks and Hazaras as well as Uzbeks and Turkmen.

It also echoed some of the tensions around the government led by President Ashraf Ghani, which was formed after the disputed 2014 election and which is seen by many Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras as favoring his own Pashtun ethnicity.

While the Persian spoken in Afghanistan and neighboring Iran have distinct accents and numerous variations in vocabulary and usage, other essentials are the same, with the gap between the two sometimes compared to the differences between the French spoken in France and Canada.

“My language is Farsi,” said Mujib Rahman Rahimi, spokesman for Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, whose Jamiat-e-Islami party draws its support mainly from Tajiks.

“The time of betrayal of our language and culture is past. We will not allow anyone else to choose a name for our language,” he wrote on his personal Facebook page.

However not all reaction was negative and some other users supported the move, saying it reinforced Afghanistan’s national identity: “I am from Afghanistan, not Persia or the Persian race,” wrote one.

There was also no sign the reaction would harm the BBC’s ability to report or have major political repercussions in Afghanistan. Combined BBC services are estimated to reach about 6.6 million Afghans out of a total population of some 35 million, according to figures last year from the BBC Trust.

The head of the BBC’s Afghan service, Meena Baktash defended the use of the term Dari, noting that it was the official name of the language in Afghanistan.

She said the change was intended to link the Facebook page to the BBC Dari radio service, which was launched in 2003 and which, together with the BBC Pashto service, occupies an important place in the crowded local media landscape.

“There are absolutely no political and cultural reasons behind our decision,” she wrote in a statement on Facebook, which, as in other countries, has taken off in Afghanistan to become one of the main sources of news and comment.

Along with Pashto, the language of the Pashtuns, Dari is named in the constitution as one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.

But many Afghan Persian speakers say their language is the same as the one spoken in Iran and Tajikistan and say the name Dari was favoured by past Pashtun leaders as a means of distancing Afghanistan from the Persian cultural sphere.

“The division of the Farsi language into Dari, Farsi and Tajiki is contrary to the reality of our common language and the vast expanse of our common culture and civilization,” Abdul Hai Khurasani, a scholar and former aide to the late Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud wrote in a letter to the director general of the BBC World Service which he posted on Facebook.",BBC name change stirs language row in Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-afghanistan-bbc/bbc-name-change-stirs-language-row-in-afghanistan-idUKKBN1D50O3

FRANCOFORTE, 2 novembre (Reuters) - Alcune delle maggiori banche mondiali stanno facendo pressione sulla Banca centrale europea per evitare norme che le costringano ad accantonare capitale a fronte dei titoli di Stato che detengono, come mostrano documenti pubblicati dalla Bce.

La misura è tra quelle discusse dai regolatori internazionali ed europei per spezzare il circolo vizioso tra banche e governi che ha acuito la crisi del 2010-2011 nella zona euro.

Ma la misura potrebbe comportare miliardi di euro di capitale aggiuntivo per le banche della zona euro, che detengono titoli di Stato del blocco per quasi 2.000 miliardi di euro.

I banchieri che hanno preso parte all‘ultimo gruppo di contatto del mercato dei titoli di Stato della Bce, il 10 ottobre, hanno messo in guardia contro i rischi legati all‘introduzione troppo rapida o a livelli eccessivi di simili coefficienti di ponderazione del rischio, secondo i resoconti della riunione pubblicati sul sito della Bce.

“Una transizione ad una ponderazione del rischio non neutro per il debito sovrano dev‘essere molto graduale per evitare vendite massicce di titoli di Stato e maggiore volatilità”, ha detto Kevin Gaynor della banca giapponese Nomura nella sua presentazione al gruppo.

La Bce, che tiene periodicamente questi incontri per avere feedback e opinioni da chi partecipa al mercato, è stata criticata il mese scorso da un gruppo di attivisti perché troppo vicina al settore finanziario.

Oltre ad essere il principale supervisore del settore bancario per l‘eurozona, la Bce fa parte del Comitato di Basilea di regolatori globali che stendono le regole volte a rafforzare il sistema bancario mondiale dopo le crisi finanziarie.

Consiglia inoltre il Parlamento europeo su questioni finanziarie, inclusa l‘imminente revisione di regolamento e direttiva sui requisiti patrimoniali (CRR/CRD IV).

“Alcuni membri hanno sottolineato che il trattamento del debito sovrano nella imminente revisione di CRD IV/CRR potrebbe essere fonte di preoccupazione”, emerge dai resoconti della riunione.

“Se i livelli di ponderazione del rischio per il debito sovrano delle banche fossero fissati troppo in alto, questo potrebbe bloccare il modello di primary dealer... e portare ad aumenti dei rendimenti dei titoli di stato, almeno durante il periodo transitorio”.

Alla riunione hanno preso parte rappresentanti di BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs e Commerzbank, come pure altri grandi istituti e compagnie assicurative.

E’ stata presieduta dal capo delle operazioni di mercato della Bce ed erano presenti esponenti delle banche centrali di Spagna, Francia, Italia e Germania.

Their revised plan, unveiled on Thursday, only partly deals with earlier criticism that it benefits the rich. And the chief lieutenants responsible for selling it to the public for the White House - Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin - have fumbled their way through their own script.

GOP leaders in the House of Representatives have, at least, ditched the idea of scrapping the top rate of tax for the highest earners of nearly 40 percent. But they’re cutting to 25 percent the rate for so-called pass-through entities like limited-liability companies and partnerships. Many wealthy people, including President Donald Trump and some in his cabinet, have made liberal use of these.

And they’re doubling the exemption and then repealing the estate tax over the next six years. Trump in September claimed this so-called death tax would “protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer.” Yet it only affects about 0.2 percent of the population – ultra-wealthy families, in other words. Its repeal would save Trump’s family and the offspring of rich cabinet members billions of dollars, argue Democrats.

Comments made by Trump administration officials aren’t helping. Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, claimed in September that the typical American family earns $100,000 a year. He’s vastly overstating it: the median annual U.S. household income in 2016 was about $59,000. The Pew Research Center tallies an annual middle-class income as low as $40,000, depending on where you live. Cohn, former president of Goldman Sachs, listed at least $250 million in assets in his financial disclosure.

Mnuchin, another Goldman alumnus, has also garbled his tax message. After saying for months that the wealthy would not get a tax cut, he recently changed his tune. He told Politico it’s difficult to avoid giving a break to the rich because “the top 20 percent pay 95 percent of the taxes.” It’s actually more like the top 50 percent of earners. His own wealth presents a conflict of interest, too: he reported about $500 million in assets in financial disclosures.

Such abysmal marketing is already falling flat with voters: only 25 percent of Americans like the plan and just 14 percent believe they will get a tax cut, according to an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll. If that translates into problems pushing the cuts through Congress, it’ll put the Trump administration’s goals of sustained 3 percent economic growth and rising wages in jeopardy. That’d be a dismal failure going into an election year.",Breakingviews - Botched Republican pitch bodes ill for tax cuts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-breakingviews/breakingviews-botched-republican-pitch-bodes-ill-for-tax-cuts-idUSKBN1D22PS

Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain and Canada issued a statement late on Friday critical of the detention of Ibrahim Metwaly, who was helping investigate the murder of Giulio Regeni. The PhD student’s body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital in 2016 showing signs of extensive torture.

An Egyptian Foreign Ministry statement said the German, Dutch and Italian ambassadors had been summoned and that procedures to summon the British and Canadian ambassadors were ongoing.

The ministry said the criticism from the five Western countries was ”a blatant and unacceptable interference in domestic affairs and the work of the judiciary.

“It is unfortunate that such a statement would be issued from countries that call for respecting rule of law and the principles of separation of powers,” it said.

Metwaly founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared four years ago.

He was taken by airport security in September while heading to Geneva to attend a U.N. conference on enforced disappearances, members of his group said.

They later said a state prosecutor had ordered his detention.

Judicial sources told Reuters on Saturday that Metwaly was detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal group, and that his pre-trial detention was in accordance with the law.

Während der CSU-Chef am Samstag in Berlin mit CDU, FDP und Grünen die Gespräche über eine Regierungskoalition fortsetzte, brach sich auf der Landesversammlung der Jungen Union in Erlangen der Unmut über den 68-Jährigen Bahn. Nach dem Debakel der CSU bei der Bundestagswahl forderte die JU als erster großer Parteiverband den Ministerpräsidenten in offener Abstimmung zum Rückzug auf.

Seehofers Rivale Markus Söder, dem viele in der CSU die größten Chancen auf Seehofers Nachfolge einräumen, ließ sich am Samstagsabend auf einer Party der JU in Erlangen feiern. Die diesjährige Landesversammlung zeige eine “besondere Wirkung”, sagte der bayerische Finanzminister unter dem Applaus und “Markus, Markus”-Rufen der Parteijugend. Der 50-Jährige, den Seehofer selbst als Nachfolger für ungeeignet hält, lobte, die bayerische JU habe “Rückgrat” bewiesen. Söder will zum Abschluss der Versammlung am Sonntag eine Rede halten.

Seehofers Vertraute Joachim Herrmann und Manfred Weber warben am Nachmittag als Redner um Verständnis für Seehofers Absage an einen Auftritt in Erlangen, widersprachen aber nicht der JU-Forderung nach einem Personalwechsel. Seehofer begründete sein Fernbleiben mit den Jamaika-Gesprächen und erklärte in Berlin zu der Personaldebatte: “Wenn die Sondierungen abgeschlossen sind, werde ich mich dazu äußern.”

“Für einen Erfolg bei der Landtagswahl im kommenden Jahr braucht es einen glaubwürdigen personellen Neuanfang”, heißt es in dem am Samstag mehrheitlich gefassten Beschluss der bayerischen JU. “Bei allen Verdiensten, die sich Horst Seehofer zweifellos in vielen Jahrzehnten für die CSU, Bayern und Deutschland erworben hat, muss er jetzt den Weg bahnen für einen geordneten Übergang an der Spitze der Staatsregierung.” Rund zwei Drittel der rund 300 Delegierten stimmten per Handzeichen mit Ja, rund ein Drittel mit Nein. Bei Wahlkämpfen stellt der Parteinachwuchs traditionell einen Großteil der Helfer.

Seit den Stimmenverlussten der CSU bei der Bundestagswahl wachsen in der Partei Zweifel, ob sie unter Seehofer bei der Landtagswahl im Herbst 2018 ihre absolute Mehrheit verteidigen kann. Die Alleinregierung wird in der bayerischen Regionalpartei als wesentlich für ihre Sonderrolle im Bund angesehen. Forderungen nach einer Ablösung Seehofers waren bereits aus drei der zehn CSU-Bezirksverbänden nach nichtöffentlichen Gremiensitzungen laut geworden. Formelle Beschlüsse dazu wurden in den Bezirken Oberpfalz, Oberfranken und München aber nicht gefasst.

Die CSU hat bei der Bundestagswahl mit 38,8 Prozent der Stimmen in Bayern ihr schwächstes Wahlergebnis seit fast 60 Jahren eingefahren. Seehofer hat die Partei mehrfach aufgefordert, Personaldiskussionen bis zum Abschluss der Berliner Sondierungsgespräche zurückzustellen. Der CSU-Chef hat bisher erklärt, er wolle sich auf dem Parteitag Mitte Dezember zur Wiederwahl stellen und die CSU auch als Spitzenkandidat in die Landtagswahl führen. Auf dem Parteitag sind nach JU-Angaben von insgesamt rund 950 CSU-Delegierten rund 150 gleichzeitig JU-Mitglieder.

Seehofer sorgte bei der JU für Verärgerung, als er eine Einladung zu der dreitägigen Versammlung als Redner ausschlug. Die Bekanntgabe der Absage wurde auf der Versammlung am Freitagabend mit Buhrufen quittiert. Mit großem Applaus honorierte der CSU-Nachwuchs in Erlangen hingegen Reden von Bayerns Innenminister Herrmann und dem Europapolitiker Weber.

Vor einer Personaldiskussion müssten in den kommenden zwei Wochen die Koalitionssondierungen abgeschlossen werden, sagte Herrmann, der dort selbst der CSU-Delegation angehört. “Ich denke, dass sich der Diskussion dann auch niemand verweigern wird”, sagte Herrmann, der zu Seehofers engsten Gefolgsleuten zählt. Weber erklärte, eine Durchsetzung von CSU-Positionen im Bund sei wesentlich für das Abschneiden der Partei bei der Landtagswahl im kommenden Jahr. “Die Glaubwürdigkeitsfrage wird heute in diesen Gesprächen entschieden”, sagte Weber.

“We are about to buy a house, so we were hoping it wouldn’t happen,” 36-year-old Hall, a travel manager, said as she pushed her baby along in a pram in Greenwich in southeast London.

“It’s a bit of a difficult time for people trying to get on the housing ladder anyway without it becoming a bit harder.”

The BoE said it did not expect the increase in its benchmark rate to 0.50 percent from an all-time low of 0.25 percent to hit the budgets of borrowers hard, given how low rates remain by historical standards.

But the psychological impact of the first interest rate rise in more than a decade may be hard to measure.

Young people already spend a three times greater proportion of their income on housing than their grandparents, and they often live in poorer accommodation, according to a study published by the Resolution Foundation research group in September.

Home ownership in England has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years fuelled by the growing gap between earnings and property prices.

The BoE said a third of households in Britain have a mortgage. It said that initially the impact of the rate hike will be fairly modest although around 2 million households in Britain with mortgages were now facing their first ever interest rate hike.

The central bank said that if its 25 basis-point rate hike is fully passed on, it would raise the average cost of a mortgage by only around 15 pounds ($20) a month.

What remains to be seen is how households respond to what is likely to be the start of a series of rate hikes in Britain, even if the BoE stressed that it would move only gradually and that rates were unlikely to return to their levels of around 5 percent seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis.

“The Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rate to 0.5 percent may appear subtle at first glance, but it will undoubtedly send a very real signal to UK shoppers and retailers,” Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said.

“This rise marks the first hike in 10 years, and there is therefore a sizeable portion of shoppers who have become all too accustomed to cheap credit.”

James Ronen, 38, who builds drones and has a mortgage, said the rate rise will be a shock for many first-time buyers.

“It’s going to really squeeze people,” he said. “For a lot of first-time buyers, this is the first rate rise they’ve seen so that might be a bit of a surprise for them.”

On the other hand, pensioners whose disposable incomes are growing at a faster rate than for people of working age in Britain will be among the biggest winners, especially as they tend to have savings, which earn more when interest rates rise.

Last year, British Prime Minister Theresa May sided with voters who have long complained that they were being punished by the dwindling returns on their savings in order to help borrowers cope with debt costs.

May’s spokesman said on Thursday that she expected to see commercial banks pass on higher returns to savers quickly following the BoE’s decision.

Martin Wooley, 77, who has no mortgage and just savings, welcomed the Bank of England news.

“We have been starved of decent interest rates on our savings for a very long time now. It’s high time it went up - and a lot more than this,” he said. “I hope they will do a great deal more before too long.”",Bank of England rate hike a blow for UK first-time buyers,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-borrowers/bank-of-england-rate-hike-a-blow-for-uk-first-time-buyers-idUKKBN1D22UH

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

His father, Prince Talal, is considered one of the most vocal supporters of reform in the ruling Al Saud family, having pressed for a constitutional monarchy decades ago.",Future Saudi king tightens grip on power with arrest of Prince Alwaleed,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests/future-saudi-king-tightens-grip-on-power-with-arrest-of-prince-alwaleed-idUSKBN1D506P?il=0

European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts.

Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries.

The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it.

Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package.

The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code.

Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business.

However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units.

Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs.

BLUNT INSTRUMENT

“Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

“I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee.

Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes.

As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018.

European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.

Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties.

“That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy.

He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.”

Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes.

The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law.

The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns.

The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week.

Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well.

There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.

It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said.

“You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?”

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

His father, Prince Talal, is considered one of the most vocal supporters of reform in the ruling Al Saud family, having pressed for a constitutional monarchy decades ago.",Future Saudi king tightens grip on power with arrest of Prince Alwaleed,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1D506P-OCABS

Guevara, a 31 year-old who runs the hardline Popular Will party and is also the deputy leader of congress, entered the residence on Saturday and requested protection, the Chilean government said in a statement.

“In the face of what he deemed immediate threats against his security and personal wellbeing, he has requested the protection of Chile,” the statement late on Saturday read.

Critics say socialist President Nicolas Maduro has turned the OPEC nation into a dictatorship by rigging elections and jailing dissenters. His supporters say the 54-year-old successor to late leader Hugo Chavez is resisting a U.S.-backed push to oust him.

“In the face of a dictatorship that violates human rights and constantly attacks democratic institutions, the international community must continue to be firm and stand with those persecuted for their politics and all the Venezuelan people,” the Popular Will party tweeted late on Saturday, thanking Chile for its help.

The Chilean residence in Caracas had already taken in five magistrates named by the opposition-run congress after they were threatened with jail time.

They then fled over the border to Colombia last month before flying to Santiago to be received by leftist Michelle Bachelet’s government, which has joined a chorus of major Latin American nations in denouncing Maduro.

Unluckily for him, as he and his father watched forbidden Italian television, the regime was watching him.

Maloku was jailed for nine years in 1976 after the secret police bugged his home. Four decades on, he can visit a unique Tirana museum and see for himself the kind of listening devices that betrayed him.

At the Museum of Surveillance, created in the former headquarters of the feared Sigurimi security service, Albanians can now inspect some of the spying paraphernalia used by dictator Enver Hoxha’s totalitarian state as well as the files kept on many of them.

“Until now nothing had been done to show how Albanians were spied upon and kept in check, so this is a good step to illustrate the history of spying we were the victims of,” Maloku, now 71, told Reuters.

Visiting the museum, Maloku told the story of how he had wanted to help his paralyzed father by broadening his television viewing beyond the drab daily four hours of Albanian state broadcasts.

An electronic engineer, he built a device he called “the can” to convert UHF signals from Italy’s RAI television so they could be viewed on an Albanian set.

“The can opened a window into the West for the Albanians. I made them free of charge for my friends, but later learned some of them had denounced me,” Maloku said.

The Sigurimi planted a listening device in a wall to gather evidence against him.

The same model of device - once attached to a broomstick to spy on the Italian embassy in Tirana - is on display in another museum depicting the work of the communist-era interior ministry.

In the age of the smartphone, both Maloku’s and the Sigurimi’s electronic gizmos now look quaintly crude - but they did their jobs, and Maloku went to prison convicted of hostile “agitation and propaganda”. He remembers singing Rolling Stones and Beatles songs in his underground cell to preserve his sanity.

Before the collapse of Albanian communism in 1990, the building that now houses the Museum of Surveillance was known as the “House of Leaves” - a pun referring to both its ivy-clad walls and the “leaves” of secret police files kept on citizens.

The game, in which players fight zombies that are superimposed onto the real world on smartphone screens, is tapping into the trend of augmented reality (AR) which gained mass adoption last year with the release of Niantic Inc’s Pokemon Go.

Next Games said the “Walking Dead: Our World” game, which it hopes will mirror Pokemon Go’s success, will be available for test users on Apple’s App Store and Google Play in selected regions by January before a wider release later next year.

The TV show tells the story of a world overrun by zombies, and the new game will use AR technology to let players battle the zombie characters in real world environments.

Based on the same show, Next Games has previously developed a mobile strategy game which has been downloaded by more than 16 million users.

“I have an optimistic view on (the new game‘s) potential. I expect this game to reach similar levels of revenue to their previous game,” said analyst Jerker Salokivi at Evli brokerage, with a “hold” rating on the stock.

Shares in the company, which was listed in March, jumped more than 100 percent in August after the company released its first video trailer of the upcoming game.

The stock fell more than 7 percent on Friday as the company reported a loss from the first nine months of the year due to investments in game development.

Its sales from January to September rose 30 percent from a year ago to around 26 million euros ($30 million).

This year, Google and Apple have both released augmented reality applications for their devices to compete for the attention of customers and software developers building such games.

Pokemon Go, which has players walking around real life neighborhoods to catch and train creatures, has more than 750 million downloads.

“AR games ... need to give the player a reason to look through their cameras, to change their surroundings into something else. With zombies, you don’t luckily get to do it any other way,” Next Games CEO Teemu Huuhtanen told Reuters in September.

Britain’s parliament is the latest institution to become embroiled in a sex scandal after abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted thousands of women and men to share stories about improper behavior.

On Wednesday, defense minister Michael Fallon resigned saying his past conduct had fallen below the required standard, costing May a trusted ally in a fragile minority government and underlining her political vulnerability to further allegations.

On Friday, she set out the code of conduct on the Conservative Party website, detailing standards expected of elected and appointed party members, the procedure for breaches of those standards and the party’s definitions of discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and bullying.

“This code sets out for the first time in one place the procedure which the party uses in dealing with complaints, along with a number of additional measures which we have introduced in light of recent allegations,” May said in a letter to the speaker of parliament’s lower chamber.

“We knew it would be difficult today with players missing but we wanted to keep the momentum going.”

Palace have four points from 11 games but could count themselves unfortunate as Scott Dann was twice denied by Tottenham’s debutant keeper Paulo Gazzaniga while Wilfried Zaha wasted a great chance shortly before Spurs scored.

Gazzaniga also saved well from former Tottenham player Andros Townsend early in the second half while Son could have given a nervy Tottenham breathing space but dragged a good chance wide.

Tottenham were without Dele Alli, scorer of two goals in the 3-1 victory over Real, while keeper Hugo Lloris and his deputy Michel Vorm were both unable to start, handing a first appearance to Argentina’s Gazzaniga.

The 25-year-old grabbed his chance, making crucial saves to earn the man-of-the-match vote.

Tottenham dominated the first half without being able to break down a stubborn Palace side and they were grateful to Gazzaniga who saved well from Dann’s header.

The second half was more open and Palace grew in confidence after Townsend took advantage of a defensive mistake to force another great save from the home keeper.

Tottenham began to commit players forward and Zaha should have punished them when he was clean through but, after going round a poorly-positioned Gazzaniga, he shot wide with the goal at his mercy.

It proved a costly miss for Roy Hodgson’s side.

A few minutes later a clever Tottenham move ended up with Harry Kane playing in Danny Rose whose shot was blocked. The ball ended up with Son on the edge of a crowded area and he curled a delightful shot past Julian Speroni.

Even as Islamic State is ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group is continuing its battle against authorities in countries like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.

On Oct. 16, the Egyptian military announced that six soldiers and at least 24 IS militants were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. That same weekend, Moroccan police arrested 11 members of an “extremely dangerous” IS-linked cell and seized chemical products used to make bombs. Algerian forces, meanwhile, have killed at least 71 Islamist fighters so far this year – the most since 2014.

The list of arrests, shootouts and seizure of passports from citizens who want to be foreign fighters goes on. But North African leaders have to navigate a particularly tortuous sectarian path. To avoid the perception that fighting extremism amounts to the persecution of the defenders of the faith, their governments have to be seen to be making visible gestures of Islamic piety – while also cracking down on Shi’ite proselytizing so as to rebut IS claims that authorities are complicit with Iran’s “plots and schemes” to carve up the region and spread Shi’ite Islam.

The Islamist PJD party in Morocco warned recently of a “sectarian Shi’ite invasion;” the Grand Mufti of Mauritania called on his country’s leaders to resist the “rising Shi’ite tide.” One North African government minister I interviewed denounced “the intrusion of Shi’ism through social media, university dormitories, high schools and even qur’anic schools,” concluding gravely, “I ask myself whether the Persians want to dominate the Arab world.”

After Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrein, is North Africa the next realm of a more assertive Iranian foreign policy? These fears come from Iran’s attempt to expand its influence in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia – and its “backyard:” Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali.

Iran’s foreign minister toured the region in June, meeting with heads of government in Algeria, Mauritania and Tunisia in search of improved ties. Iran may simply be looking for new economic partnerships to offset current sanctions, but its outreach is enough to make some local powers nervous. Around the same time, Iran launched satellites beaming Arabic-language Shi’ite religious programming into North African homes.

There are thought to be fewer than 20,000 Shi’ites in Algeria, and the government recently mandated the registration of all of them. The Algerian minister of religious affairs has said that Shi’ites have no right to spread their faith in Algeria, “because that causes sedition and other problems.” ""Algeria cannot play host to a sectarian war that does not concern it,” he explained in an interview. “Neither Shi'ism, nor Wahhabism nor any of the other sects are the product of Algerians, nor do they come from Algeria. We refuse to be the battleground for two external and foreign ideologies.” Diplomatic relations resist easy categories, however. Algeria is one of only a handful of countries, along with Iran, to maintain good relations with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are Shi’ite. Algiers was Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s first stop in North Africa in June.

Given the tiny number of Shi’ites living in North Africa and the tight control over mosques in the region, widespread Shi’ite religious influence on the ground is unrealistic. Whether or not the scale of proselytism justifies the level of concern, Moroccan and Algerian leaders view Iran’s Africa policy as a threat to their domestic order and regional security. The prospect of sectarian strife exists for “heterodox” – i.e. non-Sunni – minorities scattered across the region, numbering in the millions who live under mainstream Sunni rule. Some of these groups are offshoots of Shi’ite Islam, but are not necessarily the source of conflict. In Algeria, their mere difference – and the government’s toleration of them – sometimes provokes attack from local hardliners.

North Africa’s Sunni governments struggle with the reality that two adversaries – Iran and IS – are the net beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the crushing of Sunni opposition in Syria in 2017. The decline of Saudi influence after the Sept. 11 attacks and the downfall of Sunni Baathist rule in Iraq enhanced Iran’s stature while diminishing Sunni Arab influence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and opening a path for IS.

Officially, there is no Shi’ite minority in Morocco; unofficial estimates put the number at less than 2 percent. Nonetheless, the foreign ministry in Rabat has accused Iran of trying to alter “the kingdom’s religious fundamentals.” The bad blood is the legacy of a sour relationship between Ayatollah Khomenei and King Hassan II (the father of current Moroccan King Mohammed VI) in the 1980s. The Ayatollah’s claims of Islamic supremacy over all Muslims threatened the Moroccan King’s role as “Emir al Mouamine” – leader of the faithful – of scores of millions of followers across Northwest Africa. Hassan chaired the international council of Islamic scholars that declared the Ayatollah to be an apostate – “if he is Muslim, then I’m not” – and openly supported Iraq in its war with Iran.

In turn, Hassan thought he saw an Iranian hand behind his domestic travails. Tehran provided safe haven to the Moroccan armed opposition group Chabiba Islamiya, and Hassan publicly accused Iran of fomenting riots against rising living costs and the violent uprising in the northern Rif region that is home to many Berbers. Street contestation in the Rif region has again put Rabat off balance in 2017 and revived the accusations a generation later.

The contrast with neighboring Tunisia is significant. Tunis has enjoyed unbroken relations with Iran since 1990, including high-level exchanges before and after the January, 2011 revolution that sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Trade with Iran increased significantly as a result, but hardly registered compared to much more significant trade with the EU, North Africa, China and Turkey. Tunisia prides itself on being an island of sectarian tolerance in a rapidly polarizing region. Senior religious affairs officials proudly state that they represent all religions, including Christians and Jews, although in reality the country has very few non-Sunni Muslims. After the January 15 revolution, Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and helped protect religious freedom in Article 6 of its new constitution.

Saudi Arabia has maintained its natural advantage, however. A month after the Iranian foreign minister left Tunis, a Saudi government delegation arrived, including 53 businessmen. They signed agreements with the government worth $200 million in development projects, including several hospitals and the renovations of a historic mosque in Kairouan.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran. In response to the State Department’s admonishments on religious freedoms in Algeria, the Algerian Minister said: “If they want to accuse us of defending Islam and our historic traditions, then let them.”

The defeat of IS in Raqqa has bought time for North African governments to consolidate their religious communities. But that same defeat also removes an obstacle to Iranian influence – not unlike the fall of Baghdad almost 15 years ago. Don’t expect the competition for leadership from the Persian Gulf to be resolved anytime soon.","Commentary: In Sunni North Africa, fears of Iran’s Shi’ite shadow",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commentary-laurence-afterislamicstate/commentary-in-sunni-north-africa-fears-of-irans-shiite-shadow-idUSKBN1CV376

New York police identified the assailant as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek national, who left a handwritten note in the truck that pledged his allegiance to Islamic State. American security officials did not immediately find evidence that directly tied Saipov with Islamic State. So far, U.S. officials consider him as a “lone wolf” attacker who was inspired by the militant group, but not directed by its leaders or operatives.

“The gist of the note was that the Islamic State would endure forever,” John Miller, New York’s deputy police commissioner, said at news conference on Wednesday. “He appears to have followed almost exactly the instructions that ISIS has put out on its social media channels to its followers.”

Inspired by Islamic State’s detailed propaganda, these lone wolf assailants have turned trucks and other vehicles into highly effective killing machines.

U.S. officials say Saipov appears to have followed instructions distributed by Islamic State in one of its magazines, Rumiyah (Arabic for “Rome”), which in November 2016 called on sympathizers to carry out truck attacks against Western targets. It also urged followers to leave behind notes declaring support for the group and its leaders.

With the fall of Mosul and Raqqa, the last urban centers under Islamic State’s control in Syria and Iraq, the group has now lost most of the territory it once dominated. It’s tempting to assume that the group has been defeated. But it poses a new threat: as a militant organization that can still exploit social media and recruit sympathizers around the world to kill in its name. Islamic State will now invest more of its resources in a “leaderless jihad” that does not need a physical state.

The severe loss of territory in Iraq and Syria means that routes for foreign jihadists to reach the self-declared caliphate have evaporated. But the group still has the capability to attract recruits, raise funds, secure weapons and inspire sympathizers to carry out attacks around the world.

While Islamic State has organized assaults that required months of training and planning -- such as the November 2015 attacks in central Paris, which killed 130 people -- it has moved steadily toward inspiring loosely coordinated and sometimes haphazard attacks by self-radicalized perpetrators.

The latest wave of attacks fits into appeals by Islamic State’s leaders for their supporters to carry out self-directed assaults that use any means necessary -- including trucks, cars, knives and axes -- to kill civilians, especially in the West.

These lone wolf attacks are the result of an organized, decade-old movement within Islamic jihadism to decentralize attacks and make them more diffuse. This trend predated the emergence of Islamic State, and it can be traced back to al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Some of al Qaeda’s leaders were worried that the U.S.-led war after Sept. 11 would hamper their ability to carry out centrally planned attacks, so they sought ways for sympathizers to act on their own.

Islamic State expanded that strategy far beyond al Qaeda’s original conception. In relying on lone wolf attacks by individuals who are self-radicalized and have only a tangential understanding of jihadist ideology, Islamic State is able to project a greater reach than it actually has.

In September 2014, Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, at the time the Islamic State’s top spokesman, issued an audiotaped appeal that explained these new tactics. Adnani, who was killed two years later in a U.S. air strike in Syria, urged the group’s sympathizers to use whatever means at their disposal to attack American and French citizens, and virtually any other Western civilians. “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies,” he said. “Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.”

Since Adnani’s statement, it became clear that Islamic State would adopt the “leaderless jihad” strategy. For two years, the group has inspired lone attackers to act in its name, especially in the West. These attacks allowed Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses.

In recent months, Islamic State has quickly claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on civilians in Europe -- especially in Britain and France -- and in the Middle East. In March, a driver mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing five people before being shot by security forces as he tried to break into Parliament. In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 in an attack on a concert arena in Manchester.

In June, three assailants sped across London Bridge in a van, killing eight by ramming into pedestrians and stabbing people with hunting knives. And in August, suicide attackers stormed a Shi’ite mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, killing at least 30 worshipers and wounding dozens.

The threat extends beyond the West and the Middle East. Islamic State fighters from Southeast Asia -- including some who recently battled Philippine security forces in the city of Marawi during a five-month siege -- are starting to return home, especially to Malaysia and Indonesia. These militants would pose a threat because of their battlefield experience, guerrilla warfare training and networks they established while fighting in Iraq and Syria.

To combat this more complex range of threats posed by Islamic State and its sympathizers, governments throughout the world will need to do more than simply continue military strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria. It will also mean greater vigilance in monitoring clandestine networks set up by Islamic State operatives -- and adjusting to a new enemy that is constantly adapting its methods.",Commentary: NY truck attack part of Islamic State’s ‘leaderless jihad’,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bazzi-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-ny-truck-attack-part-of-islamic-states-leaderless-jihad-idUSKBN1D162G

The Bank of England’s decision to increase official UK borrowing costs for the first time in a decade has a more dismal logic. Governor Mark Carney and his fellow rate-setters have concluded that leaving the European Union will permanently lower Britain’s growth prospects.

Raising the UK bank rate for the first time since July 2007 should have been a milestone in Britain’s recovery from the financial crisis. In fact, the quarter-percentage point increase merely cancels out the cut that followed last year’s referendum. The rationale for changing course is more significant.

The central bank believes Brexit will hobble Britain’s growth potential. Leaving the EU will reverse some of the effects of globalisation that have put a downward pressure on prices and wages. Withdrawing from the EU single market will add friction to close to half of Britain’s exports. The UK will attract fewer immigrants, and companies will invest less.

Those shifts may ultimately enable British workers to demand higher wages. But low productivity means prices will also rise more quickly. The BoE reckons the UK’s potential output is growing by just 1.5 percent a year – below the 1.7 percent increase in GDP it forecasts for the next three years. In short, though the British economy is expanding at a slower pace than in the past, this may be unsustainable.

This analysis does not make raising interest rates now a foregone conclusion. Though inflation reached 3 percent in September and unemployment is low, there’s little evidence of wage pressure. Meanwhile, consumers’ incomes are being squeezed.

Carney sought to ease the pain by signalling that official rates would rise in line with expectations in financial markets – implying just two more quarter-percent increases by the end of 2020. The governor may also worry about the risks that a weak exchange rate pose to Britain’s ability to finance its current account deficit.

After the BoE last hiked rates, it was forced to slash them by 4.75 percentage points in the following 18 months as the global financial crisis tipped the UK into recession.

The king also announced the creation of a new anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman which Al Arabiya TV said had already detained 11 princes, four current ministers and tens of former ministers. The suspects were not named.

The cabinet reshuffle saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah replaced as minister of the National Guard by Khaled bin Ayyaf, while Economy Minister Adel Fakieh was removed in favor of his deputy Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, according to a royal decree carried by state-run media.

Prince Miteb, the preferred son of the late King Abdullah, was once thought to be a leading contender for the throne before the unexpected rise of Prince Mohammed two years ago.

He had inherited control of the National Guard, an elite internal security force built out of traditional tribal units, from his father, who ran it for five decades.

Prince Miteb was the last remaining member of Abdullah’s branch of the family to hold a position in the upper echelons of the Saudi power structure.

The move consolidates Crown Prince Mohammed’s control of the kingdom’s security institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Prince Mohammed, the king’s 32-year-old son, already serves as defense minister and was named heir to the throne in a June reshuffle that sidelined his older cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef who had also served as interior minister.

He has been responsible at the same time for running Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, dictating an energy policy with global implications and behind the plans for the kingdom to build a future after oil.

Prince Mohammed, who has pledged to go after graft at the highest levels, will now also head up the new anti-corruption body, which was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and freeze assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

NEW ECONOMY MINISTER

The country’s new economy minister, Tuwaijri, is a former Saudi air force pilot and former chief executive of HSBC’s Middle East operations who has led the economy ministry’s program to privatize some $200 billion of government assets.

He replaces Fakieh, who served as the point man for the kingdom’s wide-ranging economic reforms since his appointment as economy and planning minister in 2015.

A former food executive with a reputation for pushing through politically sensitive reforms, Fakieh had previously served as labor minister, health minister and mayor of Jeddah.

Fakieh faced down fierce opposition from the business community as labor minister when he established quotas for foreign workers to boost jobs for Saudis.

Under Prince Mohammed, Fakieh led the development of a national transformation plan and privatization drive launched last year to end the kingdom’s vulnerability to an unpredictable oil market. His replacement comes as the kingdom makes adjustments to that plan, a process dubbed NTP 2.0.

The royal decree did not say whether Fakieh would hold any other government position. Former ministers often serve in advisory roles after leaving their posts.","Saudi king sacks top ministers, gives more power to crown prince",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-cabinet/saudi-king-sacks-top-ministers-gives-more-power-to-crown-prince-idUKKBN1D40X7?il=0

To read the latest Reuters coverage of cyber security, click on www.reuters.com/cyberrisk","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Eugene Kaspersky said his company’s widely used antivirus software has copied files that did not threaten the personal computers of those customers, a sharp departure from industry practice that could increase suspicions that the Moscow-based firm aids Russian spies.

The acknowledgement, made in an interview last Friday as part of the Reuters Cyber Security Summit, comes days after Kaspersky’s company said its software had copied a file containing U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) hacking tools from the home computer of an agency worker in 2014.

“We did nothing wrong,” Kaspersky said in the interview.

He said the files containing the NSA hacking tools were taken because they were part of a larger file that included suspicious software. Such actions occur only in “very, very, very rare cases,” he added.

A spokesman at Kaspersky’s firm, Kaspersky Lab, told Reuters the company would never take regular computer files that contained nothing suspicious.

The firm has for years faced suspicions that it has links with Russian intelligence and state-sponsored hackers. Kaspersky denies any cooperation with Russian authorities beyond cyber crime enforcement.

In September, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security banned Kaspersky software from use in federal offices, citing the company’s ties with Russian intelligence. The company is the subject of a long-running probe by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, sources have told Reuters.

Antivirus software is designed to burrow deeply into computer systems and has broad access to their contents, but it normally seeks and destroys only files that contain viruses or are otherwise threatening to a customer’s computers, leaving all other files untouched.

Searching for and copying files that might contain hacking tools or clues about cyber criminals would not be part of normal operations of antivirus software, former Kaspersky employees and cyber security experts said.

In the Reuters interview, conducted at Kaspersky Lab’s offices in Moscow, Eugene Kaspersky said the NSA tools were copied because they were part of a larger file that had been automatically flagged as malicious.

He said the software removed from the agency worker’s computer included a tool researchers dubbed GrayFish, which the company has called the most complex software it has ever seen for corrupting the startup process for Microsoft’s Windows operating system.

Kaspersky said he had ordered the file to be deleted “within days” because it contained U.S. government secrets.

But he defended the broader practice of taking inert files from machines of people that the company believes to be hackers as part of a broader mission to help fight cyber crime.

“From time to time, yes, we have their code directly from their computers, from the developers’ computers,” Kaspersky told Reuters.

‘IMPROPER PRACTICE’

Three former Kaspersky employees and a person close to the FBI probe of the company, who first described the tactic to Reuters this summer, said copying non-infectious files abused the power of antivirus software. The person associated with the FBI said in one case Kaspersky removed a digital photo of a suspected hacker from that person’s machine.

Kaspersky declined to discuss specific instances beyond the NSA case, saying he did not want to give hackers ideas for avoiding detection.

“Sometimes we are able to catch cyber criminals, that’s why I am not so comfortable to speak about this to media,” he said in the interview. “Many of them are very clever, they can learn from what I am saying.”

Other industry experts called the practice improper. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at Finnish security company F-Secure, said that when his firm’s software finds a document that might contain dangerous code, “it will prompt the user or the administrator and ask if it can upload a copy to us.”

Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security firm Trail of Bits, which has performed audits on security software, said Kaspersky’s practices point to a larger issue with all antivirus software.

“All of them aggregate a huge amount of information about their clients, which can be easily exploited when put in willing hands,” he said.

U.S. news organizations have reported that Kaspersky, or Russian spies hijacking its service, have been searching widely among customers’ computers for secret files, citing anonymous U.S. intelligence officials. Reuters has not verified such reports.

Kaspersky said he hoped to alleviate concerns about his company by opening up his source code for review by third parties in independently run centers, as well as by raising the maximum amount it offers for information about security flaws in its programs to $100,000.

Typhoon Damrey, the 12th major storm to hit Vietnam this year, made landfall on Saturday with winds of up to 90 km/h (56 mph) that damaged more than 40,000 homes, knocked down electricity poles and uprooted trees.

The communist state’s Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention said 27 people were now counted dead and 22 were missing. It said 626 houses had collapsed entirely in a trail of destruction that has forced the evacuation of more than 30,000 people.

Heavy rain and high winds lashed the coastal strip on Sunday. Some streets in the ancient capital of Hue were waist deep in water while in the old trading town of Hoi An, another popular tourist attraction, people boated in the streets.

“This is the worst it has been for many years. The waters rose very fast,” said Nguyen Thi Thuan, 64, sitting on one chair and with her feet on another as waters lapped around and into her clothes shop.

The national disaster agency forecast that rain would last until Tuesday and that flooding could worsen.

Battle tanks were mobilized to help with rescue efforts in Nha Trang, which bore the brunt of the typhoon.

Danang, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit is taking place this week, is around 500 km (310 miles) to the north of Nha Trang. It also suffered.

A gateway proclaiming “Welcome to Danang” collapsed in the storm.

“I call all officials, soldiers and citizens of Danang city to come together and try their best to clean up after the rains and welcome delegates to APEC,” Huynh Duc Tho, chairman of Danang City’s people committee said in a message to the city.

Danang will host U.S. President Donald Trump from Nov. 10, as well as China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and counterparts from other APEC members.

The storm moved from the coastal area into a key coffee-growing region of the world’s biggest producer of robusta coffee beans. The typhoon had damaged some coffee trees at the start of the harvest season, farm officials said. But farmers in Daklak, the heart of the region, said the damage was limited.

The government said on Saturday more than 40,000 hectares of crops had been damaged, including sugar cane, rice fields and rubber plantations.

Wydad won the tie 2-1 on aggregate to end their long wait for a second win in Africa’s elite club competition, with victory coming in front of their raucous home supporters, who booed every touch of the ball from Ahly players.

The win ends a stellar campaign for Wydad, who have been particularly strong at home with all seven games won and just a single goal conceded underlining their dominance.

Ahly’s Moroccan striker Walid Azaro had the first opening when he looked to turn the ball home from close-range, but was denied by Wydad goalkeeper Zouheir Laaroubi.

Abdeladim Khadrouf was a whisker away from giving Wydad the lead when his shot from the just inside the penalty area deflected off Ahly’s Hussein El-Sayed and smashed into the post.

Ahly had another chance to claim a precious away goal when Moemen Zakareya found himself one-on-one with Laaroubi just past the half-hour mark, but could not beat the Wydad keeper.

The home side began to exert greater control in the second half and grabbed the lead thanks to the strength of El-Karti as he outmuscled two Ahly defenders to head home Achraf Bencharki’s cross from the right on 69 minutes.

Ismail Haddad might have added a second when he was teed-up from close-range, but this time Ahly keeper Sherif Ekramy made a fine stop.

The visitors pushed forward for the equaliser they needed to level the tie, but were unable to break down the resolute home defence.

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest. Xi’s choice to strengthen authoritarian rule rather than loosen it will prove to be a large error, for himself, his country and beyond these, the world in which China is such a crucial actor.",Commentary: China's media crackdown won't work,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-china/commentary-chinas-media-crackdown-wont-work-idUSKBN1CW2JW

Bush did not vote for fellow Republican Donald Trump last year, says the author of a new book on the 41st and 43rd U.S. presidents in which they open up about their disapproval of the man now occupying the White House.

The elder Bush voted for Hillary Clinton, while his son voted for neither Trump nor his Democratic challenger, or ”none of the above,“ said Mark K. Updegrove, who wrote ”The Last Republicans” with the cooperation of the two Bushes. HarperCollins will publish the book on Nov. 14.

In an interview with the New York Times, Updegrove said the elder Bush, 93, who served as president from 1989 to 1993, had an instinctive dislike of Trump though he did not know him personally.

In an interview during the 2016 presidential campaign, George H.W. Bush told the author that Trump was a “blowhard,” driven by “a certain ego” and lacking a commitment to public service.

The younger Bush, 71, who served in the White House from 2001 to 2009, believed candidate Trump lacked both humility and a necessary understanding of the presidency, Updegrove said in previewing the book about the relationship between the Bushes, written with the cooperation of the father and son.

During the campaign, George W. Bush told the author that he feared he would turn out to be the last Republican elected president.

“At the time, I think he was concerned that Hillary Clinton would win,” Updegrove told the Times.

“But if you look at his values and those shared by his father and Ronald Reagan, they are very much in contrast to the values of the Republican Party today, in particular the platform that Donald Trump ran on, which is essentially protectionism and a certain xenophobia,” said Updegrove, a historian who has written several books about the presidency.

Updegrove could not be reached for further comment.

“The American people voted to elect an outsider who is capable of implementing real, positive, and needed change - instead of a lifelong politician beholden to special interests,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

”If they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won.”

Like many Americans, George W. Bush was surprised that Trump fared so well in last year’s Republican state primaries, where his brother Jeb, a former Florida governor, emerged as one of Trump’s most frequent targets.

During the campaign, the billionaire real estate developer, a political novice, promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington, a vow that extended to the Republican establishment, which the Bush family epitomized.

The book follows a rare speech by the younger Bush in which he delivered a sweeping yet thinly veiled critique of the Trump administration’s policies and the president’s blunt style.

The 43rd president decried “bullying and prejudice” in public life while defending open immigration and trade, two of the pillars of previous Republican administrations that have come under sustained attack by the new president.","Neither George Bush voted for Trump, book author tells New York Times",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-bush-book/neither-george-bush-voted-for-trump-book-author-tells-new-york-times-idUSKBN1D40TP?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

On October 5, the militant group lost the northern town of Hawija – its last urban stronghold after Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul and Tal Afar earlier this year. The brutal battles for these cities have been well documented. Less noticed, however, has been how the near-total defeat of IS is reshaping political and sectarian alliances in the region.

The rise and fall of IS has had a sobering and unifying effect on relationships between Sunnis and Shi’ites. In Iraq, where thousands died in the vicious sectarian war that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein, residents of the mainly-Sunni cities of Mosul and Hawija nonetheless jubilantly welcomed the mostly-Shi’ite Iraqi forces who freed the cities from the Sunni extremists of IS. “They helped liberate us,” one Hawija Sunni leader told the New York Times of the fighters. Nor does a Shi’ite backlash against Sunnis seem imminent given Shi’ite recognition of Sunni suffering in the IS-occupied cities.

The IS experience has affected Iranian politics too. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to show a softer attitude toward Sunnis in a rare pronouncement – seen as carrying the weight of a fatwa – publicly prohibiting any discrimination against minorities. Sunnis have fewer rights than Shi’ites in Iran, and Khamenei’s August comment was made in response to an inquiry by Molavi Abdul Hamid, a prominent Sunni cleric from Iran's impoverished Sunni-dominated Sistan-Baluchistan province on the Pakistan border. In Syria too, IS's faster-than-expected battlefield defeats suggest that the group does not enjoy much local support among the Sunni tribes and populations it has been ruling for the past couple of years.

The biggest changes can be seen in Iraq, where Shi’ite leaders’ attempts to develop a post-IS foreign policy are driven in part by fear of Iran’s growing influence and in part by the IS-inflicted suffering in Iraq. Many observers believe that the pursuit of sectarian policies at the expense of Iraqi Sunnis – as systematically practiced under the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki – expedited the rise of IS.

The result of the new dynamic is that Iraq’s main Shi’ite leaders are distancing themselves from Iran as they make once-unthinkable overtures to the region’s Sunni Arab bloc. In one of the latest signs of that shift, Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al-Abadi declined Tehran’s official invitation to take part in President Hassan Rouhani’s second-term inauguration ceremony on August 5. Such a refusal would have been unimaginable a few years ago.

Similarly, prominent Shi’ite leaders such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Moqtada al-Sadr snubbed Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the newly-appointed chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council – a governing body set up to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians over whether planned legislation conforms with Islamic law – during an official visit to Iraq as the envoy of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

Sadr said after the meeting that he hoped it was 'the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region.' Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS

Underscoring the point, Baghdad publicly slammed a deal made by Hezbollah, Iran’s chief proxy in the region, to evacuate a group of IS fighters from Lebanon to eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. The Tehran-backed agreement was “unacceptable” and “an insult to the Iraqi people,” Prime Minister Abadi said in August.

Iranian influence on Iraq’s domestic politics is shrinking too. Ammar al-Hakim resigned as head of the Tehran-backed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq – the country’s largest Shi’ite party – a month after a June meeting with Khalid al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca and an informal advisor to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Hakim promptly went on to form the National Wisdom Movement, a political party to “embrace” all Iraqis. (After publication of this column, a spokesman for Hakim's movement told Reuters that while Hakim and Faisal had both attended an iftar, the evening meal that breaks the fast during Ramadan, Faisal ""was one of the invitees among other many people, and there was no meeting or political talk during that event."")

At the same time, Iran-funded, Shi’ite-dominated militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces are divided over whether they should be integrated into the regular Iraqi army – a measure that would loosen Iran’s foothold in Iraq’s security apparatus – or whether they should remain independent of the Iraqi government. Groups loyal to Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani have started taking steps to register with the army; those led by Hadi al-Amiri of the Badr Organization and Qais al-Khazali of Asaib Ahl al-Haq remain in the pro-Iran camp.

Against this backdrop, Iraq is trying to improve its ties with Saudi Arabia. In addition to several recent diplomatic visits between the two countries, including one by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Riyadh, Moqtada al-Sadr – an influential Shi’ite cleric with a large following among Iraq’s urban poor – made rare and well-received visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Sadr issued a statement saying that he was “very pleased with what we found to be a positive breakthrough in the Saudi-Iraqi relations,” and that he hoped it was “the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region."" Sadr’s Aug. 13 meeting with Emirati crown prince Zayed al-Nahayan appeared equally successful. “Experience has taught us to always call for what brings Arabs and Muslims together, and to reject the advocates of division,” Nahyan told Sadr, in a veiled reference to Iran as one of the dividers.

It is clearly in Iraq’s strategic interests to diversify its relationships beyond reflexive sectarian or ideological lines. Improved ties with Riyadh pave the way for Baghdad to receive much-needed financial aid from Saudi Arabia and establish an economic relationship that could help counter the political and military influence established when Iran cultivated Shi’ite proxies to fight U.S.-backed forces in Iraq. The outreach can also signal to Iraq’s Sunni minority that the Baghdad government is not an Iranian stooge.

Iraq’s post-IS foreign policy could have broader regional benefits too. For Riyadh, closer ties with Baghdad can help the Saudi leadership feel less threatened by Iran’s rising influence and the perception that Riyadh’s share of regional power has diminished as a result. That in turn may lead to a thaw in Iranian-Saudi ties and a broader contribution to regional security.

Nonetheless, the fact is that neither Riyadh nor Tehran can achieve sustainable hegemony in the region at the expense of the other. It’s ironic that it may be the routing of extremist IS that serves as the catalyst to ease the bitter sectarian rifts that have divided them for so long.",Commentary: The unlikely – and ironic – effects of Islamic State’s fall in Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afterislamicstate-commentar/commentary-the-unlikely-and-ironic-effects-of-islamic-states-fall-in-iraq-idUSKBN1CU2LW

Saudi Arabia’s air defenses intercepted the missile,

bringing it down near the capital Riyadh’s airport on Saturday and it did not cause any casualties, state news agencies reported.

“A shot was just taken by Iran, in my opinion, at Saudi Arabia ... and our system knocked the missile out of the air” Trump told reporters on Air Force One en route to Tokyo.

A Saudi-led coalition has launched thousands of air strikes against Houthi rebels and allied forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh who have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi territory over the course of a 2-1/2 year war.

Regional and Western sources have said Iran is sending advanced weapons and military advisers to the Houthi movement, stepping up support for its Shi‘ite ally in the country’s civil war.

1/TRUMP ON TOUR

U.S. President Donald Trump embarks on his first trip to Asia in the coming week, stopping in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Security concerns in the Korean peninsula and the South China Sea will grab a lot of attention, but investors will also look at trade talks, with Trump particularly keen to address his country’s vast trade deficit with China that Beijing calls unintentional, but which he calls “horrible”.

There is also the first deluge of data since last month’s People’s Party Congress in China. Import and loan growth figures will be particularly closely watched.

A weakening of the former would point to domestic demand finally flagging, while an acceleration of loan growth would show borrowers are finding ways around tighter new lending rules.

2/BALLISTIC BITCOIN

Investors’ appetite for bitcoin appears to have no bounds. The digital currency climbed above $7,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, after an astronomical increase of more than 900 percent over the past 12 months. News that the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator, CME Group, was set to launch bitcoin futures was seen as a significant step in bitcoin’s road to mainstream adoption, driving the latest surge in price.

But with high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett and the head of Credit Suisse saying in recent days that the bitcoin market represents a bubble, could that be set to burst in spectacular fashion? What is to stop a rival cryptocurrency - of which there is a potentially unlimited quantity - from becoming investors’ digital currency of choice? With bitcoin now worth more than $120 billion, more than Citi or Goldman Sachs, the consequences of a sudden crash could be severe.

The Nov. 7 release of the September Job Opening and Labor Turnover (JOLT) survey USJOLT=ECI will show whether demand for labour has held up or is in need of an - ahem - jolt.

At the moment, the ratio of job openings versus quit jobs is close to 2 to 1, hovering in a range close to the all-time peak of 2.12 hit in July 2015.

It all comes following strong recent U.S GDP data and after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives released plans on Thursday for a tax overhaul they believe will help lift the economy.

It certainly seems a long time since last year’s bail out of problem child Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI). It is now back in the market, and the main Italian banks are comfortably outperforming their euro zone peers in share performance .SX7E in 2017, so the results round should be telling.

5/ VENEZUELA RESTRUCTURING

After what feels like years of speculation, OPEC member Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicolas Maduro wants to restructure the ailing country’s foreign debt.

Maduro has invited Venezuelan bondholders to a Nov. 13 meeting in Caracas to discuss the matter, although getting clearance from the compliance department could be interesting for the bankers involved.

Vice President Tareck El Aissami, who is on a U.S. blacklist for alleged drug trafficking, said the country remained committed to paying all its debt but wanted to reformulate terms with creditors, which is likely to mean some lively bouts of price discovery.

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

His father, Prince Talal, is considered one of the most vocal supporters of reform in the ruling Al Saud family, having pressed for a constitutional monarchy decades ago.",Future Saudi king tightens grip on power with arrest of Prince Alwaleed,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-arrests/future-saudi-king-tightens-grip-on-power-with-arrest-of-prince-alwaleed-idUKKBN1D5078

Along with Pashto, the language of the Pashtuns, Dari is named in the constitution as one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.","KABUL (Reuters) - The BBC is facing an angry reaction in Afghanistan after it changed the name of one of its local language Facebook pages to BBC Dari, the official name of the Afghan version of Persian or Farsi but one rejected by many local Persian speakers.

The Facebook page and other social media sites were bombarded by criticisms of the change. Many Persian speakers say the name Dari has been imposed historically by the traditionally dominant Pashto ethnic group as an implicit denial of Afghanistan’s place in the wider Persian-speaking world.

The reaction highlighted the sensitivity of linguistic issues in Afghanistan, a country with a mix of over 35 languages spoken by ethnic groups including Pashtuns, Tajiks and Hazaras as well as Uzbeks and Turkmen.

It also echoed some of the tensions around the government led by President Ashraf Ghani, which was formed after the disputed 2014 election and which is seen by many Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras as favoring his own Pashtun ethnicity.

While the Persian spoken in Afghanistan and neighboring Iran have distinct accents and numerous variations in vocabulary and usage, other essentials are the same, with the gap between the two sometimes compared to the differences between the French spoken in France and Canada.

“My language is Farsi,” said Mujib Rahman Rahimi, spokesman for Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, whose Jamiat-e-Islami party draws its support mainly from Tajiks.

“The time of betrayal of our language and culture is past. We will not allow anyone else to choose a name for our language,” he wrote on his personal Facebook page.

However not all reaction was negative and some other users supported the move, saying it reinforced Afghanistan’s national identity: “I am from Afghanistan, not Persia or the Persian race,” wrote one.

There was also no sign the reaction would harm the BBC’s ability to report or have major political repercussions in Afghanistan. Combined BBC services are estimated to reach about 6.6 million Afghans out of a total population of some 35 million, according to figures last year from the BBC Trust.

The head of the BBC’s Afghan service, Meena Baktash defended the use of the term Dari, noting that it was the official name of the language in Afghanistan.

She said the change was intended to link the Facebook page to the BBC Dari radio service, which was launched in 2003 and which, together with the BBC Pashto service, occupies an important place in the crowded local media landscape.

“There are absolutely no political and cultural reasons behind our decision,” she wrote in a statement on Facebook, which, as in other countries, has taken off in Afghanistan to become one of the main sources of news and comment.

Along with Pashto, the language of the Pashtuns, Dari is named in the constitution as one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.

But many Afghan Persian speakers say their language is the same as the one spoken in Iran and Tajikistan and say the name Dari was favoured by past Pashtun leaders as a means of distancing Afghanistan from the Persian cultural sphere.

“The division of the Farsi language into Dari, Farsi and Tajiki is contrary to the reality of our common language and the vast expanse of our common culture and civilization,” Abdul Hai Khurasani, a scholar and former aide to the late Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud wrote in a letter to the director general of the BBC World Service which he posted on Facebook.",BBC name change stirs language row in Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1D50O1-OCAEN

The Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 51.7 last month - its highest since June - from 50.7 in September.

In July and August, the index was below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.

During those months, confusion over product pricing following the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax pushed manufacturing and services sectors into contraction.

Aashna Dodhia, an economist at IHS Markit, said recovery from the GST implementation “was sustained in the private sector in October, mainly radiating from service providers as growth in manufacturing was relatively subdued.”

A sister survey showed manufacturing activity barely expanded last month.

However, services demand has been recovering since September and the latest survey showed the new business sub-index, a proxy for both domestic and foreign demand, rose to 51.5 in October from 51.1 a month before.

This helped a composite index that takes into account both manufacturing and services activity rise to a four-month high of 51.3 last month from September’s 51.1.

Firms raised prices at a sharper rate to end-consumers than their costs rose, signaling a pickup in inflation over coming months.

Retail inflation held steady at an annual pace of 3.28 percent in September, below the Reserve Bank of India’s medium-term target of 4 percent.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California.

The Senate’s approval is needed to pass laws though it does not often block bills passed by the elected House of Commons. Some senators say police need more time to prepare and also oppose setting the federal age of legal use at 18.

Legalizing marijuana for recreational use was part of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2015 election campaign and the government has set a relatively quick deadline to put it in place. Canada would be the first Group of Seven country to allow the drug nationally.

The legislation is not expected to reach the upper house until December and some senators have said they will take as long as they need to review it.

That could put Trudeau and the upper house of parliament at loggerheads again. Senators, who are not elected, recently delayed the government’s budget bill before ultimately passing it.

Conservative Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu said he expects implementation will need to be delayed until December 2018 or early 2019 to give police forces enough time to prepare for widespread use of the drug.

“I think it’s too early,” Boisvenu said on Friday by phone. “What they’ve (the police) told us until today is they will not be prepared next July.”

Boisvenu said Conservative senators will meet to discuss strategy about delaying the bill if necessary.

Member of Parliament Bill Blair, a former police chief and the government’s point person on the legislation, said added delays in regulation will put more underage users at risk.

“By all means, take the time to do it right, but unnecessary delay is unacceptable,” Blair said by phone.

The potential clash highlights a hurdle Trudeau has partly set up for himself after he expelled all Liberal senators from the party’s caucus in 2014 amid an expenses scandal and to curb partisanship.

Although Trudeau has appointed independent senators since then, he has no formal leverage to get the government’s legislation passed.

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he raised the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to sell about 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest initial public offer ever.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition among New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment.

NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also received some government support for its bid, although that has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

While Trump’s tweet named the New York Stock Exchange, it did not mention rival Nasdaq Inc, which is also vying for the Aramco listing.

“Generally, public servants should be impartial, not give preferential treatment to anyone, and avoid endorsements,” said Scott Amey, general counsel for the government ethics watchdog Project on Government Oversight in Washington. “We have already seen violations in this administration, and it doesn’t help that the president isn’t leading by example.”

Nasdaq replied to Trump in a tweet, saying it agreed the United States was the “best destination for global companies” but that Aramco belongs on Nasdaq “with the 5 most valuable operating companies in the world.”

AWAITING A DECISION

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials say they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA. Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has been an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

Still, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. Saudi leaders welcomed him warmly during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against their nation’s diplomatic archrival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

“President Trump’s tweet indicates that, from the White House’s perspective at least, a public listing of Aramco is not as dead as some recent reports indicated,” said Bob McNally, president of Washington-based energy market and policy consultant Rapidan Energy Group.

“The tweet suggests the White House believes Saudi Arabia may be approaching a decision on where to list and wishes to either claim credit or push a possibly wavering Saudi Arabia for a New York listing,” McNally added.

Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock. The prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings, including IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.",Trump backs New York in bourses' battle for Saudi Aramco listing,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-aramco/trump-backs-new-york-in-bourses-battle-for-saudi-aramco-listing-idUSKBN1D40IL?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

First, he committed to addressing the shortcomings of the Iran nuclear deal, without terminating it. Second, he called for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East. More sanctions, however, will not be enough to accomplish either of these goals.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, at a news conference in Tehran, May 22, 2017. TIMA via REUTERS

The president’s twin objectives of fixing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the nuclear deal is known, and confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional behavior are closely connected. Barack Obama overlooked Tehran’s military expansion into Iraq and Syria, among other actions, for the purpose of winning Iranian cooperation on the nuclear issue. The result was not just a disastrous deal, but a diminished U.S. ability to accomplish any of its strategic objectives in the region.

To defend our vital interests in the Middle East and potentially improve a deeply flawed nuclear deal, the United States must first rebuild leverage by countering Tehran’s growing aggression and influence in the region. That cannot be accomplished overnight. Nor can it be done solely through the use of sanctions or the threat of withdrawal from the agreement.

Along with more sanctions, and before trying to fix or abandon the deal, policymakers must develop a comprehensive strategy, utilizing every element of American power, to rebuild and apply counter-pressure against the full spectrum of Iran’s destabilizing behaviors.The Gemunder Center Iran Task Force at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), which we co-chair, recently detailed such a strategy, consisting of two elements.

U.S. President Donald Trump discusses the Iran nuclear deal in the White House, October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

First, restore credible U.S. military leverage against Iran. American officials should prepare – and make clear they are preparing – contingency plans to defend the United States and its allies from Iranian nuclear-capable missiles. The United States should be prepared to shoot down Iranian nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including test launches, and respond forcefully to any Iranian harassment of U.S. naval vessels. To this end, it should deploy the Aegis missile defense system to the Persian Gulf (like we already do in Europe and East Asia).

It is also critical that the United States has a post-Islamic State strategy for Syria, including more assistance to our allies on the ground in holding territory hard-won from IS. This is necessary to prevent Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies from dictating that country’s future and consolidating a land bridge from Iran to Lebanon.

Second, Washington must take the lead in assembling a coherent regional coalition against Iran. This will require more concerted cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop robust missile defenses against Iran’s region-wide proliferation of advanced missiles.

The Trump administration and Congress must also augment the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on defense aid to Israel by removing Obama-era caps on missile defense assistance. The MoU must be treated as the floor, not the ceiling, for bilateral cooperation against Iran’s and Hezbollah’s growing presence and capabilities on Israel’s northern borders. Similarly, we must ensure U.S. and Gulf air and maritime defenses can operate in close coordination as Iran’s military capabilities expand under the nuclear deal.

Trump is absolutely right to call the JCPOA “unacceptable” in its current form. By allowing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and conventional arms purchases to expire over the next 15 years, the JCPOA actively grants Iran the right to become a de facto ICBM-armed, militarily modernized nuclear power.

FILE PHOTO - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia October 24, 2017. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

FILE PHOTO - Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal leaves the High Court in London July 2, 2013. REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

His father, Prince Talal, is considered one of the most vocal supporters of reform in the ruling Al Saud family, having pressed for a constitutional monarchy decades ago.",Future Saudi king tightens grip on power with arrest of Prince Alwaleed,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D5078

The streaming company suspended production earlier this week of the upcoming sixth and final season of the political intrigue drama, in which Spacey plays U.S. president Frank Underwood.

“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of ‘House of Cards’ that includes Kevin Spacey,” the company said in a statement late on Friday.

Spacey’s publicist cut ties with him on Thursday and it was not known who currently represents him.

His departure may not mean the end of the show, however.

“While we continue the ongoing investigation into the serious allegations concerning Kevin Spacey’s behavior on the set of ‘House of Cards,’ he has been suspended, effective immediately,” Media Rights Capital, the company that produces the show, said in a statement.

“MRC, in partnership with Netflix, will continue to evaluate a creative path forward for the program during the hiatus,” it said.

The Netflix statement also said the company will work with MRC to determine the show’s future.

Spacey, who has had a successful career in film, television and theater, is one of several big names in the entertainment business to be accused of sexual misconduct by people coming forward in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey

Weinstein.

Spacey apologized last weekend to actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. CNN reported on Thursday that eight current and former employees of “House of Cards,” who were not identified, alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the accusations.

Spacey, as part of his apology to Rapp, announced he was gay, which angered many in the LGBT community and beyond who saw his announcement as an effort to divert attention from the accusation by Rapp.

Spacey has sought evaluation and treatment, his representatives said in a statement on Wednesday, without providing details on the nature of the treatment.

The announcement that he would seek treatment followed harassment allegations against him this week by Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who worked in the London theater where Spacey was artistic director from 2004-2015, and U.S. filmmaker Tony Montana.

MRC said in a statement on Thursday it had handled one incident in 2012 in which a crew member it did not identify “shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey” and that immediate action had been taken and the issue was resolved.

It said Spacey had “willingly participated in a training process” and that it was not aware of any complaints since then involving the actor.

Netflix’s move to cut ties with Spacey went beyond “House of Cards.”

The company will not release the film “Gore,” which was in post-production and was produced by Spacey, its statement said.

All are wanted by Madrid for actions related to the push for the region’s secession from Spain. Puigdemont has become the public face of that move for independence.

Other charges are the misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to the secessionist campaign, which has thrown Spain into a political crisis just as its economy has recovered from a sharp downturn and banking stress.

Madrid has taken over administrative control in Catalonia, until then an autonomous region, and called new elections on Dec 21.

Two polls on Sunday suggested pro-Catalonia independence parties will together win December’s regional election although they may fall just short of a majority of seats in parliament needed to revive the secession campaign.

Parties supporting Catalonia staying in Spain would divide seats but garner around 54 percent of the vote, the polls suggested.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium shortly after Madrid took control. On Sunday morning, Puigdemont and four of his former councillors presented themselves to police in Brussels.

A judge will hear the defendants case on Sunday afternoon and has until Monday morning to decide whether the formalities for the extradition request have been fulfilled.

According to a GAD3 survey of 1,233 people conducted between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 and published in La Vanguardia newspaper, pro-independence parties ERC, PDeCAT and CUP would take between 66 and 69 seats in the 135-seat parliament.

A second poll taken over the same period for the conservative newspaper La Razon echoed the GAD3 survey, showing pro-independence parties would capture the most votes though still fall just shy of a parliamentary majority with 65 seats.

Other seats would be generally divided between parties that support the region remaining as part of Spain, though they would run on separate tickets.

Voter participation, however, will rise to a record of 83 percent, the GAD3 poll showed.

POLITICIANS ON REMAND

Under the European arrest warrant system, the five defendants in Belgium can agree to an extradition order immediately or the judge can set bail or detain them. Belgian authorities have to inform their European counterparts if a European arrest warrant cannot be executed after 90 days.

On Saturday, Puigdemont - who PDeCAT said on Sunday would lead the party in the election - called for a united Catalan political front for independence from Spain and against the detention of his former members of government.

On Thursday, nine of his sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial.

One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was freed after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,035) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

According to the GAP3 survey, 59 percent believed legal action against Puigdemont was unjustified while 69.3 percent said the jailing of the Catalan politicians would give the independence cause a boost at the ballot box.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest the detentions.

The Catalonia issue has sent shockwaves across Europe, energizing regions with their own secessionist agenda while unnerving those fighting to keep the European Union from fracturing further.

Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon, a member of the Flemish nationalist and separatist party N-VA, criticized Spain’s handling of situation on Sunday, saying Madrid “went too far” in an interview with Belgian broadcaster VTM.

Madrid says the judiciary acts independently of the legislative arm of government while adding that Catalonia leaders acted outside the rule of law when organizing the vote and making the declaration of independence.

BACK TO THE START

A pro-secessionist rally in Barcelona on Sunday attracted just a few hundred people, a long way from the hundreds of thousands to join pro-independence marches in October. Many of those attending waved the regional flag and carried protest signs.

One protester, Antonia Aguilera, 63, said she was concerned the new elections would not be fair and would be manipulated by the Spanish government.

Her concerns echo the deep mistrust many Catalans have of politicians in Madrid that has deepened since the arrests and after the national police used truncheons and rubber bullets to thwart voting in the illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1.

“I‘m disgusted by it all. We knew they would react but not as strongly as they did,” she said, adding that she believed the pro-independence parties would win the December election.

“And then we’ll be back where we started.”","Sacked Catalonia leader turns himself in, polls show independence strength",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia-poll/sacked-catalonia-leader-turns-himself-in-polls-show-independence-strength-idUKKBN1D50CW?il=0

The Confederation of British Industry’s monthly indicator of output for manufacturers, retailers and services companies remained at +11, its joint lowest level since June.

“Growth in the economy has remained relatively stable, although the pace of growth was a little slower than expected, particularly for retailers and manufacturers,” CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.

Britain’s economy slowed sharply in the first half of 2017 although it picked up a bit of pace in the third quarter.

“I thought I was going to be fired,” recalled the former employee nearly 40 years later. But Shinzo Abe, now Japan’s prime minister, stayed on the job at Japan’s third-largest steelmaker for three years before entering politics in 1982.

Abe has called the steel industry the backbone of the nation. Kobe Steel, a 112-year-old company in south-central Japan’s Hyogo prefecture, has risen from wartime devastation and natural disaster but its past is littered with examples of corporate misconduct.

Its admission last month that workers had tampered with product specifications for at least a decade is the latest in a string of scandals that has battered Japan’s reputation as a manufacturing powerhouse.

Clients around the world, including top carmakers and airplane manufacturers, have been scrambling to check whether the safety or performance of their products have been compromised.

Workers, executives and shopowners in Kobe, a gritty, industrial city bordered by sloping hills where cattle are bred for the famed Kobe beef, said they were concerned but not surprised by the scandal.

Kobe Steel, which has apologized for the tampering, declined comment for this article.

“The corporate culture was to look the other way even while you saw what was going on,” said a retired employee who worked at the company’s flagship steel plant, Kobe Works - a symbol of the city’s quick recovery from a 1995 earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people. The company’s other main plant in the area is Kakogawa Works, in the nearby city of Kakogawa.

“They were supposed to be instilling a culture that paid attention when improprieties were discovered,” the former employee said. “In the end they didn’t create such a corporate culture. That’s management’s responsibility.”

The company initially said some workers had falsified data on contract specifications for a relatively small amount of aluminum and copper products, but it later admitted the problem had spread.

In 2006, Kobe Steel admitted falsifying soot-emissions data from the blast furnaces at Kobe Works and Kakogawa Works.

The latest scandal reflects “exactly the same set-up”, said Shoichi Tarumoto, who was then mayor of Kakogawa. “It looks like nothing has changed at Kobe Steel.”

PAST PROBLEMS

Kobe Steel has admitted taking part in bid-rigging for a bridge project in 2005, and failing to report income to tax authorities in 2008, 2011 and 2013. The company exceeded established limits for ground and water pollution in 2006.

Illegal political funding to candidates in local assembly elections in 2009 prompted the resignations of the then CEO and chairman. And last year Kobe Steel admitted a subsidiary falsified data on stainless-steel products.

The Kobe Steel (Kobelco) logo is seen on the company's headquarters in Kobe, western Japan October 24, 2017. Picture taken October 24, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White

A senior official in local government who has dealt with the company for years said: “Kobe Steel always scouts the backstreets for shortcuts. That’s their nature.”

Although its local dominance has waned, Kobe Steel remains one of only two Kobe-based companies, along with Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd (7012.T), that have revenues over 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) a year. The Kakogawa Works is that city’s biggest company, vital as a local taxpayer and employer.

More than a third of the Kobe Steel group’s 6,123 domestic customers are concentrated in Hyogo or neighboring Osaka, according to credit-research firm Teikoku Databank. More than half its customers are small and midsize Japanese companies.

The other clients are spread around the world and include top automobile manufacturers, airplane makers, railways and nearly any industry that uses steel, aluminum or copper in any form. [nL4N1N834X]

No safety issues have been found so far because of the tampering, but Kobe Steel has withdrawn its forecast for its first annual profit in three years. Whatever the eventual economic impact, the scandal is already affecting morale in Kobe city.

“If Kobe Steel suffers a blow, this is the area that will be most affected,” said Tsuyoshi Matsuda of Teikoku Databank’s Kobe office.

Kobe Steel acknowledges some customers have shifted orders to other suppliers. Major banks are instructing their Kobe area branches to keep close watch on the credit management at companies that do business with the steelmaker, bankers say.

“HEAVY MOOD”

The scandal “isn’t an open topic on the job,” said a worker in his 30s, finishing the night shift around 8 a.m. at Kobe Works, a hulking jumble of rusting pipes, risers and tanks.

“Nobody says it out loud, but I think people are worried,” he said. “It’s a heavy mood.”

Shinzaike, the local train station closest to Kobe Works, is home to several bar-restaurants that count the company’s employees among their best customers. Since the latest scandal erupted, business has dried up, traders said.

“Looks like they’re holding back from going drinking,” said a pub owner.

Reservations for year-end parties would normally be starting now, but there haven’t been any yet, he added.

Abe, who worked at both the Kobe and Kakogawa works, has called his years at Kobe Steel “the starting point of my adult life.”

Last year, according to media reports, he urged young people entering the workforce to follow his example of learning from mistakes at Kobe Steel.

“I got through it without incident,” he said. “I want you not to be discouraged by a few mistakes but rather do the best you can.”","Scandal-hit Kobe Steel has a 'look the other way' culture, they say in hometown",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kobe-steel-scandal-hometown/scandal-hit-kobe-steel-has-a-look-the-other-way-culture-they-say-in-hometown-idUSKBN1D5011?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

“The project will cost $2.8 billion that comprised $2.4 billion as loan and remaining $400 million will be equity participation of both companies,” A.M. Khurshidul Alam, the managing director of North-West Power Generation Company Limited (NWPGCL) of Bangladesh, said on Sunday.

Alam said the project would be implemented in three phases and completed by 2021. It aims to produce 3,600 megawatts of electricity.

“This will be the largest single power project and it will also be the largest single investment from any European country,” he added.

The project will be set up in Payra of southern Patuakhali district, 320 km from (200 miles) Dhaka and from there power will be transmitted to the capital.

“To be a middle income country by 2021 and a developed economy by 2041 the national demand of electricity will be 24,000 MW by 2021 and 60,000 MW by 2041,” said Nasrul Hamid, junior minister for power, energy and mineral resources.

He said that to become a developed country Bangladesh needs uninterrupted and quality power supply all year round.

The power generation will be fueled by imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) as the country has no additional natural gas.

“There is no additional gas in the country, and oil is too expensive with volatile price fluctuation, moreover LNG based power generation will be cheaper and it will also ensure clean energy,” Hamid said.

At present Bangladesh has only 12.68 trillion cubic feet of gas and it will be exhausted by 2030 if no new gas fields are discovered and the consumption rate remains at the present level, energy officials said.

Sunil Mathur, the chief executive officer of Siemens for south Asia, said that it would ensure Bangladesh acquired a world class power plant.

Hariri left Lebanon for Saudi Arabia on Friday and resigned on Saturday in a televised statement that took the Lebanese political establishment by surprise.

He cited an assassination plot against him and criticized the regional role of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah however Lebanon’s army said on Sunday it had not uncovered any plot.

The move has thrust Lebanon back into the arena of regional rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, an ally of Hariri, and Shi‘ite Muslim Iran, which backs Hezbollah.

President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, will wait to accept or reject Hariri’s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to explain his reasons, sources at the presidential palace said.

Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat cited unnamed sources close to Hariri as speculating that he would probably remain outside Lebanon because of the security threat against him.

Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh sought to calm fears the political turmoil unleashed by Hariri’s bid to resign would hit Lebanon’s already fragile economy, issuing a statement to reaffirm the stability of its currency, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar.

In Lebanon’s sectarian system the president must be a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shi‘ite. Hariri is Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

His father, Rafik al-Hariri, was prime minister after Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war and was assassinated in a car bombing in 2005.

A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted five Hezbollah members for the killing but the group denies any involvement.

Saudi media have published reports of a plot to assassinate Hariri in recent days, but all of Lebanon’s main security branches have said they have no information about such a plot.

A Saudi minister said on Saturday that Hariri’s personal security detail had “confirmed information” about the plot. Thamer al-Sabhan said in an interview with a Lebanese TV station on Saturday that there are “threats against the prime minister and the Kingdom is keen for his security”.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

Trump kicked off a 12-day Asian trip and is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.

He told reporters on Air Force One en route to Asia that North Korea would figure prominently in discussions, and also singled out trade, which he said had been “badly handled” in the region for years.

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

A top aide said last week Trump intends to tell Asian leaders the world is “running out of time” in dealing with the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.

“No dictator, no regime, no nation should ever underestimate American resolve,” Trump told hundreds of cheering U.S. and Japanese troops in camouflage uniforms gathered at Yokota Air Base, just west of Tokyo, soon after he arrived.

“Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it?” said Trump, who wore a bomber jacket as he addressed the troops.

North Korea’s recent actions, including several missiles that flew over Japan and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test, have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Recent drills over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have further heightened tensions.

“We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defense of our freedom,” Trump said.

He told reporters earlier on Air Force One that a decision would be made soon on whether to add reclusive North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Trump said his administration planned to take a different approach after years of what he termed “total weakness.”

“It’s a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved.”

In an apparent attempt to distinguish between North Korea’s leadership and ordinary people, he said he thought North Koreans were “great people.”

“And I hope it all works out for everybody.”

GOLF DIPLOMACY

Abe told reporters before Trump’s arrival that he welcomed the visit as a chance to deepen bilateral ties by building on the “friendship and trust” between the two leaders, fostered by several meetings that included a round of golf in Florida earlier this year.

“I hope we will be able to have thorough discussions about international issues, including North Korea,” he said.

Trump and Abe greeted each other with a handshake at a golf course to be used during the 2020 Olympic Games, changing clothes and heading out to play after what media said was a lunch of hamburgers. In an allusion to a Trump campaign slogan, they signed caps that said “Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.”

They discussed North Korea and trade while playing nine holes with Hideki Matsuyama, the world no. 3 pro golfer.

A senior White House official said the two leaders have developed a close bond since Trump took office in January.

“Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people!” Trump tweeted. For his part, Abe took to Twitter to say he played golf “with a marvellous friend (President Donald J. Trump) full of spirited conversation.”

The two leaders and their wives later dined on grilled Japanese premium beef at an upscale restaurant.

In brief pre-dinner remarks, Trump said U.S.-Japan ties were closer than ever. But he added: “We’ll have dinner tonight. I think we’ll insult everybody by continuing to talk about trade.”

Trump also said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, the longest Asian tour by any U.S. leader since George H.W. Bush in 1992.

“I think it’s expected that we will meet,” he said. “We want Putin’s help on North Korea.”

Trump wants a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before he visits Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Separately, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed that “now is the time to apply firm pressure on North Korea,” Kono told reporters.

A senior U.S. State Department official traveling with Tillerson said the pressure was having an effect.

“I think we have a better chance now than we’ve had in the last couple of decades to solve this problem because the most important thing is to have the international community completely united in order to really choke off the lifeline for North Korea. It’s got to be the way,” the official said.

TRADE TALKS

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to policies more favorable to the United States, a point Trump emphasized.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where Trump will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.

“One of the things we’re going to be very focused on is trade because trade has not been done well for 25 years by the United States with this part of the world, with any part of the world,” he said on Air Force One.

“We’re going to be discussing reciprocal trade. Fair, free but reciprocal,” he said.","Trump in Japan stresses unity on North Korea; talks trade, too",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-trump-asia-japan-northkorea/trump-in-japan-stresses-unity-on-north-korea-talks-trade-too-idUKKBN1D501L

Zuckerberg’s absence in Washington on Wednesday was widely noted by politicians. Earlier in the day, Facebook’s general counsel was raked over the coals by U.S. senators probing how the Kremlin could effectively push propaganda on social media as it tried to sway the presidential election.

Lawmakers were quick to say it appeared Facebook’s first priority was its business as opposed to national security. California Democrat Kamala Harris even brandished a 10-Q form. Several senators expressed disappointment that Zuckerberg, in addition to his missing counterparts at Twitter and Alphabet unit Google, decided to skip out on the hearings.

It would be a glaring error, even by Silicon Valley’s happy standards, to brush aside the Russian problem on earnings day. Sure, the firm reported its profit jumped almost 80 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, to nearly $5 billion. That topped analysts’ expectations and fueled a 2.6 percent rise in the stock. But Zuckerberg also said he was “dead serious” about fixing security and that doing so “will significantly impact our profitability going forward.” The shares shed the day’s gain, and a bit more, in after-hours trading.

The company plans to hire more people to police dubious content, doubling the number of such staff to 20,000. As a result, expenses are expected to mushroom by as much as 60 percent next year.

The OPEC member’s socialist leader wants to restructure the ailing country’s foreign debt and has put an alleged drug trafficker in charge of working out how. U.S. sanctions make any refinancing virtually impossible. But even default might not force the hapless, increasingly authoritarian former bus driver from power.

Maduro presides over a mismanaged economy that was hit hard by the end of the oil-price boom in 2014. Now the government cannot provide sufficient food or medicine for its citizens despite huge crude reserves. Nonetheless, on Thursday he said state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela would make a $1.1 billion payment on a bond maturing that day. He also asked Vice President Tareck El Aissami to head a commission studying how to restructure all future obligations. El Aissami called on bondholders to meet in Caracas on Nov. 13 to discuss how that might work.

With great difficulty, is the answer. El Aissami is blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury as an alleged narcotics kingpin, something he denies. Sanctions against Maduro’s government effectively mean U.S. banks can’t take part in any restructuring of the country’s foreign debt, estimated at $90 billion or higher. The country owes some $9 billion in sovereign and PDVSA debt payments in 2018. Reserves have dwindled to barely more than that.

Default might ease some domestic pressure on Maduro by allowing his government to divert scarce dollars to import more medical supplies, food and other basic goods. Yet that may prompt creditors to seize Venezuelan oil shipments and assets abroad such as PDVSA’s U.S. refiner Citgo.

To counter that, Maduro’s government could try to somehow funnel oil exports through ally Russia, or try to arrange further cash-for-oil barter deals like those it has with Russia and China. It could try to maintain payments on PDVSA debt, protecting the company’s assets, while halting payments on sovereign debt.

Maduro looks increasingly willing to resort to repression. Elections for an all-powerful Constituent Assembly resulted in a rubber-stamp body crammed with government loyalists. Opposition politicians alleged fraud in recent gubernatorial polls but lost heavily and seem unable to unite against him. A presidential vote due next year looks unlikely to be free or fair. Unless dissatisfaction among his own allies in government forces Maduro out, he may end up presiding over a bizarre twilight economy for years to come.",Breakingviews - Venezuela's Maduro enters alternate reality,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-bonds-breakingviews/breakingviews-venezuelas-maduro-enters-alternate-reality-idUSKBN1D324G

French and German officials confirmed Le Maire would be in Berlin on Wednesday, when he will meet acting Finance Minister Peter Altmaier, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Le Maire is also due to see Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), and Cem Oezdemir, co-leader of the Greens party. Both are in discussions with Merkel’s conservatives on forming a coalition government.

France’s Emmanuel Macron has made euro zone reform a central goal of his five-year presidency. But any changes will require the support of Merkel and her new government, which is not expected to be in place before Christmas. Lindner has been critical of Macron’s idea to create a budget for the euro zone.

“We want to follow up on the president’s Sorbonne speech and exchange views on the future of the euro zone,” a French finance ministry official said, referring to a speech by Macron in September when he laid out his vision for EU reform.

While Le Maire’s visit - his first to Berlin since the German election - is about strengthening contacts with likely members of the new government, officials indicated that it would also be an opportunity to sound out Berlin on the Eurogroup presidency, a powerful position that will be elected next month.

Since it was created in 2005, the Eurogroup, which brings together the euro zone’s 19 finance ministers, has had only two presidents: Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who served from 2005 to 2013, and former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is due to step down in January.

The position involves chairing monthly meetings and driving policy around economic and monetary union, including ensuring that all member states stick to strict targets on deficits and debt. The post has been dubbed “Mr Euro”.

“NO NATURAL CANDIDATE”

Le Maire, 48, is regarded as sharp, ambitious and more than capable of leading the group. But some euro zone officials are wary about the presidency ending up in the hands of either Germany or France, the two largest economies in the single currency bloc and already dominant forces in policymaking.

A further complication for Le Maire is France’s poor record of meeting its own deficit targets over the past decade. German officials are not ruling out Le Maire, but they have also expressed a preference for giving the post to a smaller country.

Last week, one official in Berlin mentioned two possible alternatives: Pierre Gramegna of Luxembourg and Peter Kazimir of Slovakia. The official also floated the idea of extending Dijsselbloem, seen as a close ally of Berlin, even though he is not part of the new Dutch government.

“It is still quite unclear who will come forward,” the German official said when asked about the presidency. “At this stage there does not seem to be one candidate everyone is rallying behind. There is no natural candidate.”

The Eurogroup president will be chosen on Dec. 4, an EU official said last week, with the formal call for candidates opening in mid-November.

“It is not a done thing,” the German official said of Le Maire’s candidacy. “He will only apply if he gets the impression that he is the one.”

The talks in Berlin on Wednesday could be decisive in determining whether he does throw his hat into the ring.

If Le Maire were to get the job, it could have repercussions for other top euro zone jobs. Mario Draghi will end his term as president of the European Central Bank on Oct. 31, 2019, and Germany’s Jens Weidmann is already being mentioned as a potential successor.

Euro zone watchers say that if the French secure the presidency of the Eurogroup, it may be harder for them to argue against a German candidate taking over the ECB.

Still, as one senior French official told Reuters on condition of anonymity last month, Weidmann at the helm of the ECB “would be a problem for a lot of countries, not just for France”.",France's Le Maire heads to Berlin to test Eurogroup waters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-germany-lemaire/frances-le-maire-heads-to-berlin-to-test-eurogroup-waters-idUSKBN1D50UA

Hariri left Lebanon for Saudi Arabia on Friday and resigned on Saturday in a televised statement that took the Lebanese political establishment by surprise.

He cited an assassination plot against him and criticized the regional role of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah however Lebanon’s army said on Sunday it had not uncovered any plot.

The move has thrust Lebanon back into the arena of regional rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, an ally of Hariri, and Shi‘ite Muslim Iran, which backs Hezbollah.

President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, will wait to accept or reject Hariri’s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to explain his reasons, sources at the presidential palace said.

Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat cited unnamed sources close to Hariri as speculating that he would probably remain outside Lebanon because of the security threat against him.

Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh sought to calm fears the political turmoil unleashed by Hariri’s bid to resign would hit Lebanon’s already fragile economy, issuing a statement to reaffirm the stability of its currency, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar.

In Lebanon’s sectarian system the president must be a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shi‘ite. Hariri is Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

His father, Rafik al-Hariri, was prime minister after Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war and was assassinated in a car bombing in 2005.

A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted five Hezbollah members for the killing but the group denies any involvement.

Saudi media have published reports of a plot to assassinate Hariri in recent days, but all of Lebanon’s main security branches have said they have no information about such a plot.

A Saudi minister said on Saturday that Hariri’s personal security detail had “confirmed information” about the plot. Thamer al-Sabhan said in an interview with a Lebanese TV station on Saturday that there are “threats against the prime minister and the Kingdom is keen for his security”.

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

England’s most prolific wicket-taker was the standout bowler for the touring side after they declared on 349 for six before the start of play on the second day of the two-day match.

Anderson finished with figures of 4-27 from 13 overs but his opening partner Stuart Broad struggled for rhythm ahead of the five-test series against Australia starting later this month.

Broad picked up one for 64 from 13 overs while Chris Woakes, who last season struggled with injuries, went wicketless in 15 overs.

”You could probably see from the first session that we were pretty rusty as bowlers,“ Anderson told reporters. ”We didn’t get it right. The point (of the warm-up match) is to try to get into the tour.

“We’ve got two first-class games coming up that we want to be fit for and get the cobwebs out.”

Western Australia were bowled out for 338 but kept batting to allow England a full day on the field.

Leg-spinner Mason Crane and pace bowler Craig Overton picked up two wickets each, boosting their hopes of making their debuts during the series. Jake Ball returned figures of 1-31.

England’s bowlers initially struggled to make an impact as Western Australia openers Josh Philippe and Jake Carder put on 80 runs for the first wicket. Overton dismissed Carder for 22 to break the stand.

The 20-year-old Philippe, who is yet to play a first-class match was impressive in his knock of 88, studded with 16 fours.

On her first attempt she followed a crew toward the plane and was turned back. She melted into the crowd and pretended to look for her parents. The second time, she managed to get into a plane, was spotted by an official, stopped, and handed over to police.

Staempfli declined to say which airline was involved or where it was flying to, but he said it was leaving from the airport’s French sector and the destination was in France.

Hariri left Lebanon for Saudi Arabia on Friday and resigned on Saturday in a televised statement that took the Lebanese political establishment by surprise.

He cited an assassination plot against him and criticized the regional role of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah however Lebanon’s army said on Sunday it had not uncovered any plot.

The move has thrust Lebanon back into the arena of regional rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, an ally of Hariri, and Shi‘ite Muslim Iran, which backs Hezbollah.

President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, will wait to accept or reject Hariri’s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to explain his reasons, sources at the presidential palace said.

Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat cited unnamed sources close to Hariri as speculating that he would probably remain outside Lebanon because of the security threat against him.

Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh sought to calm fears the political turmoil unleashed by Hariri’s bid to resign would hit Lebanon’s already fragile economy, issuing a statement to reaffirm the stability of its currency, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar.

In Lebanon’s sectarian system the president must be a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shi‘ite. Hariri is Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

His father, Rafik al-Hariri, was prime minister after Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war and was assassinated in a car bombing in 2005.

A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted five Hezbollah members for the killing but the group denies any involvement.

Saudi media have published reports of a plot to assassinate Hariri in recent days, but all of Lebanon’s main security branches have said they have no information about such a plot.

A Saudi minister said on Saturday that Hariri’s personal security detail had “confirmed information” about the plot. Thamer al-Sabhan said in an interview with a Lebanese TV station on Saturday that there are “threats against the prime minister and the Kingdom is keen for his security”.

U.S. Women’s Open champion Park did not play the LPGA event, but Ryu had to finish no worse than sixth to stay in top spot, according to the projection.

“I didn’t know that,” Ryu told Reuters outside the scoring tent at the Taiheiyo Club Minori, when told she had surrendered the number one ranking.

”I don’t really care about it. It’s just a title. It’s great to be number one of course but the more important thing is how I‘m playing for the present.

“I more care (about that) than my ranking.”

Ryu, 27, was delighted to become number one back in June, but admitted to eventually feeling the pressure of the lofty position.

“Because of number one, a lot of expectations levels went up high but right now I want to win a tournament more than keep my position,” she said.

Rye battled a sore right shoulder throughout the TOTO Japan Classic, constantly rubbing it after hitting a shot.

“It was a struggle to play three rounds,” she said.

Ryu is having a week off, and said she might see a doctor in the next few days to have the injury diagnosed.

Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain and Canada issued a statement late on Friday critical of the detention of Ibrahim Metwaly, who was helping investigate the murder of Giulio Regeni. The PhD student’s body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital in 2016 showing signs of extensive torture.

An Egyptian Foreign Ministry statement said the German, Dutch and Italian ambassadors had been summoned and that procedures to summon the British and Canadian ambassadors were ongoing.

The ministry said the criticism from the five Western countries was ”a blatant and unacceptable interference in domestic affairs and the work of the judiciary.

“It is unfortunate that such a statement would be issued from countries that call for respecting rule of law and the principles of separation of powers,” it said.

Metwaly founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared four years ago.

He was taken by airport security in September while heading to Geneva to attend a U.N. conference on enforced disappearances, members of his group said.

They later said a state prosecutor had ordered his detention.

Judicial sources told Reuters on Saturday that Metwaly was detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal group, and that his pre-trial detention was in accordance with the law.

The size of the purge - 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers were detained by a newly created anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - raised questions about the stability and predictability of the Saudi government.

For foreigners, a major shock was the detention of flamboyant billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who as a big investor in top Western companies such as Citigroup (C.N) is known as the international face of Saudi business.

Local investors, meanwhile, worried about whether a sustained investigation into corruption could turn up scandals in the kingdom’s opaque business world, forcing people implicated to sell off their equity holdings.

But many bankers and analysts saw the purge, which replaced the head of the National Guard, as a power grab by Prince Mohammed, designed to remove any remaining obstacles to his authority and assure his eventual succession to the throne.

This, they said, could help the economy by making it easier for Prince Mohammed to pursue radical reforms that include slashing the state budget deficit, putting more women into employment, lifting a ban on women driving, and selling $300 billion of state assets.

“This is the latest act of concentration of power in Saudi,” said Hasnain Malik, global head of equity research at emerging markets investment bank Exotix.

”As unprecedented and controversial as it may be, this centralization might also be a necessary condition for pushing the austerity and transformation agenda, the benefits of which very few investors are pricing in.”

After initially tumbling as much as 2.2 percent on Sunday, the Saudi stock index .TASI rebounded to close slightly higher. Shares related to some of the detained people, such as Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, sank but most banks rose, a sign of economic optimism.

INSTABILITY

The purge may increase Prince Mohammed’s grassroots support by tackling corruption, a problem that has long plagued the economy.

“It’s a populist move that makes sense because a lot of the princes, businessmen and bureaucrats are corrupt, taking kickbacks and being involved in all kinds of shady deals,” said Bernard Haykel, professor of Near East studies at Princeton University.

A danger for financial markets, however, is that Prince Mohammed is shaking up business practices and ties that have lasted for decades, a move which could backfire if it triggers an exodus of money and wealthy individuals from the country.

“The fact that some of the country’s leading business people were arrested will scare the private sector and there might be even more capital flight than before. And most bureaucrats will now be terrified, perhaps justifiably,” Haykel said.

Many corporate executives expect Prince Mohammed to persuade or pressure rich Saudis to repatriate some of the billions of dollars which they are believed to have transferred overseas for safe-keeping, and which could now help to kick-start the development projects that he plans.

The corruption crackdown may be an initial step in this effort; the decree creating the committee gave it the right, pending the result of investigations, to seize assets at home or abroad and transfer them to the state Treasury.

James Dorsey, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, wrote that Prince Mohammed appeared to be reacting to growing opposition within the royal family and the military to his reforms and Riyadh’s military intervention in Yemen.

“It raises questions about the reform process that increasingly is based on a unilateral rather than a consensual rewriting of the kingdom’s social contract.”

For many people, however, a unilateral approach is seen as the best chance to push through the reforms. A chief economist at a big regional bank said Prince Mohammed’s main motive for acting was frustration that reforms were not moving fast enough.

The privatization program, for example, including the planned sale of 5 percent of national oil giant Saudi Aramco, has been discussed for many months with little action. Now the program may pick up.

“The message this should send to foreign investors is it’s unwise to bet against MbS,” said Sam Blatteis, chief executive of regional advisory firm The MENA Catalysts, using a common abbreviation of Prince Mohammed’s name.

“When he wants to get things done, he has proven that he can. This is not a consolidation of power, it’s an acceleration. The wheels of policy-making are moving faster.”",Saudi purge worries investors but may speed reforms,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests-economy/saudi-purge-worries-investors-but-may-speed-reforms-idUSKBN1D50RN

Berkshire on Friday said it lost $3 billion before taxes, or $1.95 billion after-tax, from the disasters, leaving its Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance units with underwriting losses for the year.

Insurance typically accounts for about one-fourth of Berkshire’s overall profit. Berkshire has roughly 90 businesses in such sectors as chemicals, energy, food and retail and industrial products. It also owns the BNSF railroad.

Jim Shanahan, a senior analyst at Edward Jones & Co, said the disaster losses were higher than he had expected, given how pricing pressures had caused Berkshire to retrench from some business, but said shareholders should remain comfortable with the company over the long term.

Overall net income fell to $4.07 billion, or $2,473 per Class A share (BRKa.N), from $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per share, a year earlier.

Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses and which Buffett says better reflects company performance, fell 29 percent to $3.44 billion, or $2,094 per Class A share, from $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share a year earlier.

That missed analysts’ average operating profit forecast of $2,402.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s diversification helped cushion the earnings decline, as profit rose at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, while “improving economic conditions” helped boost shipping and profit at BNSF.

A better economy may also have persuaded more people to buy cars and trucks, as higher financing activity at the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealership unit helped boost pre-tax retail profit by 22 percent.

Book value per Class A share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 2.5 percent in the quarter to $187,435, and was up 8.9 percent from January to September.

Berkshire also ended September with $109.3 billion of cash and equivalents, more than five times the $20 billion minimum Buffett has said he prefers, and investors are waiting to see what he does with it.

Buffett, 87, has run Berkshire since 1965, and investors have remained confident in his leadership, as the company’s share price has risen 15 percent this year.

The Class A shares closed Friday down $2,963.99, or 1 percent, at $280,470.01, while Class B shares (BRKb.N) fell $1.34, or 0.7 percent, to $187.27. Both were about 2 percent below their Oct. 24 record highs.

FULL-YEAR UNDERWRITING LOSS LIKELY

Berkshire lost $1.44 billion from insurance underwriting in the quarter and $1.73 billion from January to September, putting it on pace for its first full-year underwriting loss since 2002.

It had even eked out a small underwriting profit in 2005, the year of Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita and Dennis.

But investment income from insurance operations cushioned the blow, rising 23 percent in the quarter to $1.04 billion.

Other insurers and reinsurers, such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N), American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S), also suffered larger quarterly storm losses, and like Berkshire are hoping to boost rates.

Berkshire’s results also reflected an accounting charge tied to its January agreement to assume many of AIG’s policies in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront.

But that and other premiums that Berkshire receives before paying claims have helped boost its insurance “float” to $113 billion, giving Buffett more money to invest.

Shanahan, who rates Berkshire a “buy,” said he was encouraged at how Geico is adding market share, reflected in a 16.5 percent jump in premiums and 9.9 percent year-over-year growth in policies.

Some of Berkshire’s cash hoard will eventually be used to buy 80 percent of Pilot Flying J, the largest U.S. truck stop operator. Buffett announced that investment on Oct. 3.

Berkshire also owns shares in dozens of companies including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), and has a 26.7 percent stake in food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O).","Hurricanes, earthquake drag down third-quarter profit at Buffett's Berkshire",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-hatha-results/hurricanes-earthquake-drag-down-third-quarter-profit-at-buffetts-berkshire-idUSKBN1D32F4

Singers Jason Aldean, Jake Owen and Chris Young were among the musicians either on stage in Las Vegas when the shooting broke out, or watching the show.

Caleb Keete, a guitarist with the Josh Abbott Band, said in October that the shooting had caused him to change his stance on gun control after being a lifelong supporter of the right to bear arms.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

Puigdemont, que foi para a Bélgica depois de seu governo ter sido destituído após uma declaração unilateral de independência, disse na sexta-feira que está considerando concorrer nas eleições, mesmo estando em Bruxelas.

Em meio à mais grave crise política da Espanha desde o retorno da democracia, no fim da década de 1970, o primeiro-ministro, Mariano Rajoy, convocou uma eleição depois da intervenção na Catalunha, ocorrida há uma semana.

Os partidos políticos que desejarem formar uma coalizão têm até a terça-feira para registrar suas chapas, e até 18 de novembro para anunciar seus candidatos.

Pesquisa publicada na terça-feira mostrou que a coalizão pró-independência Juntos pel Si ganharia a eleição se ela fosse realizada hoje, com 35,2 por cento das preferências.

Esse resultado daria a eles novamente uma maioria parlamentar pela independência, caso o grupo mantenha sua atual aliança com o CUP, de extrema-esquerda.

A rica região noroeste da Espanha continua dividida entre os que apoiam a separação e os que querer manter as terras catalãs como parte da Espanha, mostraram pesquisas tomadas desde a declaração de independência.

Se os partidos pró-independência se separarem, pode ficar difícil formar uma maioria parlamentar, embora a prisão de ex-membros do governo possa unir o eleitorado crítico a Madri, visto como poder demasiadamente repressor.

São candidatos pró-Espanha os do Partido Popular (PP), de Rajoy, os Socialistas e o Ciudadanos, legenda pró-mercado. Tais partidos realizaram pequenas manifestações neste sábado, pedindo que a chamada maioria silenciosa vote em massa em dezembro.

Na quinta-feira, nove membros do gabinete de Puigdemont receberam ordem de prisão preventiva pela Suprema Corte espanhola, enquanto são investigados e podem ser denunciados. Um membro do ministério dissolvido, Santi Vila, foi solto na sexta-feira, após pagar fiança de 50 mil euros. Os outros oito permanecem presos.

Na sexta-feira, a Espanha emitiu o mandado de prisão contra Puigdemont e quatro assessores por rebelião, incitação de motim, malversação de dinheiro público, desobediência e quebra de confiança, todas acusações relacionadas à campanha pela independência.

O grupo cívico catalão Asamblea Nacional Catalana y Omnium Cultural, cujos líderes foram presos no mês passado sob acusação de motim, convocaram uma greve geral no dia 8 e uma grande manifestação no dia 11, em protesto contra as detenções.

Puigdemont afirmou que não voltará à Espanha até receber garantias de Madri.

For many foreigners, Prince Alwaleed - whose net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion(£13 billion) - is the face of Saudi business, appearing frequently on international television and in articles on his investments and lifestyle.

A 2013 Forbes magazine profile described his marble-filled, 420-room Riyadh palace, a private Boeing 747 equipped with a throne, and his 120-acre resort on the edge of the Saudi capital with five homes, five artificial lakes and a mini-Grand Canyon.

He is also known for his outspoken views on politics - making headlines in 2015 when he called Donald Trump a “disgrace” on Twitter during the U.S. election campaign.

Prince Alwaleed’s investments, current and future, may now be in doubt after he was detained in an investigation by a new Saudi anti-corruption body.

“There will be questions on what this all means,” said a senior executive at a European financial institution, who visited Riyadh late last month to attend a big international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination.

“People will be looking at any kind of international holdings of the people who have been arrested, to see what will be the impact.”

Aside from a stake in Citigroup, Prince Alwaleed, 62, owns significant stakes in Twitter (TWTR.N), ride-hailing firm Lyft and Time Warner (TWX.N).

His investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE - whose share price plunged 10 percent on Sunday in response to news of his detention - recently bought about half of a 31.1 percent stake in Saudi lender Banque Saudi Fransi 1050.SE from France’s Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA).

FINANCE MINISTER‘S SON

Prince Alwaleed’s father was the kingdom’s finance minister during the 1960s. Prince Alwaleed formed Kingdom Holding in 1979, initially pouring money into real estate in Riyadh; in the 1990s he ventured into Wall Street, investing heavily in Citigroup.

He had a close relationship with former Citigroup Chief Executive Sanford “Sandy” Weill, and has nurtured close ties with other Wall Street leaders including Goldman Sachs (GS.N) CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

Prince Alwaleed increased his stake in Citigroup at the height of the global financial crisis a decade ago and he has held on to the stake, saying as recently as last month that he was very happy with the investment.

“He’s always been a colourful and unofficial public face of Saudi Arabia, though he has never been a key decision-maker in the kingdom,” a Gulf-based businessman said.

During the U.S. election campaign, Prince Alwaleed demanded that Trump withdraw from the election campaign after the candidate pledged to ban Muslims’ entry into the United States.

Trump responded by tweeting that the Saudi prince wanted to control “our politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it after I get elected.”

Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban and spent five years under brutal captivity by the insurgent group. He had faced up to life in prison after pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The 31-year-old Idaho native trembled in a military courtroom at Fort Bragg in North Carolina as he waited to hear his punishment. Army Colonel Jeffery Nance delivered the sentence in a hearing that lasted just two minutes, and did not comment on his decision. He also recommended Bergdahl be demoted to private. Bergdahl and lawyers in the case had no immediate comment. Prosecutors had asked Nance to send Bergdahl to prison for 14 years for the hardships and injuries endured by service members who searched for the soldier after he left his combat outpost in Paktika province in June 2009 without permission. Defense lawyers had said Bergdahl, who experts testified has several mental health conditions, should not go to prison. Bergdahl's case made him a polarizing figure. He drew withering criticism from political leaders in Washington and fellow soldiers, both for the dangerous efforts to find him and the 2014 Taliban prisoner swap brokered by the Democratic Obama administration that secured his release. During his successful campaign for the presidency last year, Republican Donald Trump called Bergdahl ""a no-good traitor who should have been executed."" Nance, acting on a defense motion, ruled that Trump's comments had not influenced him nor affected Bergdahl's chances of a fair sentence, but said he would consider them a mitigating factor. Defense attorneys argued at Bergdahl's sentencing hearing that he was a young, hardworking soldier who did not understand the full consequences of his actions when he deserted. Bergdahl, who has said he wanted to report problems in his unit, apologized in court this week for the suffering he caused his comrades and admitted he had made ""a horrible mistake.""

Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, invests in firms such as Citigroup (C.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N). He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, two senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf.

News of the purge came early on Sunday after King Salman decreed the creation of an anti-corruption committee chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed, his 32-year-old favorite son who has amassed power since rising from obscurity three years ago.

The new body was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and seize assets.

“The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable,” the royal decree said.

Analysts say the arrests were another pre-emptive measure by the crown prince to remove powerful figures as he exerts control over the world’s leading oil exporter.

The round-up recalls the palace coup in June through which Mohammed bin Salman ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne and interior minister.

MbS, as he is known, was expected to follow at least by removing Prince Miteb from leadership of the National Guard, a pivotal power-base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes.

Over the past year MbS has become the ultimate decision-maker for the kingdom’s military, foreign, economic and social policies, causing resentment among the Al Saud dynasty, parts of which have been frustrated by his meteoric rise.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market .TASI dropped 1.5 percent in early trade on Sunday before recovering somewhat.

The royal decree said the arrests were in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.”

REFORM AGENDA

The line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled by an Islamic system in which law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists.

WikiLeaks cables have detailed the huge monthly stipends that every Saudi royal receives as well as various money-making schemes some have used to finance lavish lifestyles.

Analysts said the purge aimed to go beyond corruption and aimed to remove potential opposition to Prince Mohammed’s ambitious reform agenda.

In September the king announced that a ban on women driving would be lifted, while Prince Mohammed is trying to break decades of conservative tradition by promoting public entertainment and visits by foreign tourists.

The crown prince has also slashed state spending in some areas and plans a big sale of state assets, including floating part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on international markets.

The most recent crackdown breaks with the tradition of consensus within the ruling family, wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

“Prince Mohammed, rather than forging alliances, is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the National Guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” he said.

Scholar Joseph Kechichian said the interests of the Al Saud, however, would remain protected.

“Both King Salman and heir apparent Mohammed bin Salman are fully committed to them. What they wish to instill, and seem determined to execute, is to modernize the ruling establishment, not just for the 2030 horizon but beyond it too,” he said.

Many ordinary Saudis praised the crackdown as long-awaited.

OPULENT HOTEL

Other detainees include former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting MbS’ reforms; former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the Royal Court under the late King Abdullah.

People on Twitter applauded the arrests of certain ministers with some comparing them to “the night of the long knives”, a violent purge of political leaders in Nazi Germany in 1934.

Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the big Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained.

At least some of the detainees were held at the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, said sources in contact with the government and guests whose plans had been disrupted.

The hotel’s exterior gate was shuttered on Sunday morning and guards turned away a Reuters reporter, saying it had been closed for security reasons though private cars and ambulances were seen entering through a rear entrance.

The hotel and an adjacent facility were the site of an international conference promoting Saudi Arabia as an investment destination just 10 days ago attended by at least one of those now being held for questioning.

The detentions follow a crackdown in September on political opponents of Saudi Arabia’s rulers that saw some 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists detained.

Prince Alwaleed, a flamboyant character, has sometimes used his prominence as an investor to aim barbs at the kingdom’s rulers.

In December 2015, he called then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump a “disgrace to all America” and demanded on Twitter that he withdraw from the election.

Trump responded by tweeting: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected.”

His father, Prince Talal, is considered one of the most vocal supporters of reform in the ruling Al Saud family, having pressed for a constitutional monarchy decades ago.",Future Saudi king tightens grip on power with arrest of Prince Alwaleed,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests/future-saudi-king-tightens-grip-on-power-with-arrest-of-prince-alwaleed-idUSKBN1D506P?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Two British companies pulled their planned London listings on Friday, following weak performances from other new stocks. At the same time, tycoon-controlled Russian energy group En+ priced its shares at the bottom of the offer range. The one thing still rising is the number of banks working on IPOs. That’s part of the problem.

The London Stock Exchange

Arqiva, a broadcast infrastructure group, and Bakkavor, which makes hummus for supermarkets, both shelved their IPOs at the last minute, saying that the market for new issues is too volatile. There’s something to that, at least in Britain. Companies in Europe have raised $38.5 billion in new equity offerings in 2017, 22 percent more than at this time last year. In Britain, however, total takings are down 13 percent.

True, the affected companies have their quirks. Arqiva runs old-school TV masts, while Bakkavor has four customers of scale and En+ is an oligarch’s plaything. Yet newly listed stocks elsewhere are also doing less well than new investors might have hoped. Shares in BAWAG Group, an Austrian bank, have fallen 5 percent since they started trading on Oct. 25. SMCP, a French clothier, is also trading below its offer price. HelloFresh, which delivers pre-prepared recipe kits and is ploughing the proceeds of its offering into marketing, is barely a whisker above where it started on Thursday.

Hedge funds are one source of trouble. Having made a decent return this year so far – 10.7 percent on equity strategies by Sept. 30 according to Preqin data – fund managers have little incentive to risk their performance fees on untested new stocks. Shares in Blue Apron, an American HelloFresh clone, have plunged by two-thirds since the company’s June IPO in New York. Hedge funds aren’t everything, but they provide capital markets bankers with a useful way of jimmying up price tension.

The finger then points to the banks themselves. After all, their job ought to be to know how market participants are feeling some time before the 11th hour. But accountability is being spread ever thinner. A European IPO now has on average 2.5 bookrunners – the highest ever in the region.

Canada’s new three-year immigration plan, unveiled on Wednesday, will see it increase its immigration intake by 13 percent over three years to help meet the needs of an aging population.

But the increase is below that recommended by a government advisory council in 2016, which had wanted the figure to rise by 50 percent over five years.

“It’s easy to bring somebody in, it’s another thing to make sure they succeed in Canada,” Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said by telephone from Ottawa.

Canada’s immigration system focuses on bringing in skilled workers, but has struggled to connect them with job opportunities in keeping with their skills and credentials.

The immigration minister, himself a former refugee from Somalia, said bringing newcomers to Canada was only “half of the job,” and that supports were needed to ensure they integrated well into society.

Canada has resettled more than 40,000 Syrian refugees since 2015 and seen more than 15,000 asylum seekers walk across its border with the United States this year, with many saying they fear a U.S. immigration crackdown.

Many of the latter group have gone to Quebec, sparking an anti-immigrant backlash in the French-speaking province. The military set up a tent encampment to house asylum seekers while they are processed.

Both Hussen and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau say they are wary of anti-immigrant sentiment in Canada.

“I think in Canada we’re lucky that, broadly speaking, we have support (but) it’s not consensus, there are people who oppose immigration,” Hussen said.

Canada isn’t “some magical place that doesn’t have worries about immigration, worries about security, worries about division and intolerant minds,” Trudeau said at a Toronto conference on Thursday.

Trudeau made international headlines in January with tweets touting Canada’s welcome of refugees, coinciding with U.S. President Donald Trump’s first travel ban.

But two years after mobilizing the country to bring in Syrians, the Canadian government is dialing down its involvement. About 30 percent of resettled refugees in the next three years will be government-sponsored, compared with 46 percent in the previous three years.

“Look, we can’t take every refugee from the world,” Hussen said. “What we can do is we can play our part.”

Hussen said Canada offered to resettle some of the more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled their homes in Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh, but was told by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees that was not necessary.

Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the UNHCR’s Canadian representative, said the agency is focused on providing for the immediate needs of Rohingya refugees, with an eventual return to their homes in Myanmar as the “best solution.”

Canada’s three-year immigration plan would see immigration rise by 40,000 to 340,000 people annually in 2020. That is below an increase to 450,000 by 2021 recommended by the advisory council, to offset an aging population and strains on the social safety net.",Canada to take in migrants at 'gradual' pace amid integration concerns,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1D22N3-OCADN

Sharif, 67, arrived at the court with his daughter, Maryam, who is also on trial over the family’s wealth and financial dealings.

The family has called the case a political conspiracy but opposition leaders who pushed it before the courts have hailed it as accountability for the rich and powerful.

The charges in the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court are linked to London properties the family owns that were revealed in the 2016 Panama Papers leaks involving offshore companies owned by prominent international figures.

Allies of Sharif, who has served as prime minister twice and was toppled in a military coup in 1999, have called the proceedings a political vendetta and hinted at intervention by elements of the powerful army.

The Supreme Court disqualified Sharif from office in July over unreported sources of annual income of about $10,000, a salary the former premier denies ever receiving.

An agreement would see Merkel extend her 12-year spell at the helm of Europe’s largest economy, during which she has helped avoid a collapse of the euro zone and established her country as the bloc’s economic powerhouse.

Merkel must bring together the Greens, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and her own conservative bloc to secure a majority, with sticking points including immigration caps, whether to end coal production and increasing defense spending.

The poll published by German daily Bild put the Greens at 11 percent, up by one percentage point from a week earlier, while the FDP fell by the same amount to 10 percent.

Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian CSU sister party were stable at 31 percent while the Social Democrats, who have said they would not renew their ruling coalition with the conservatives, slipped by one percentage point to 21 percent.

Party leaders are slated to meet on Monday evening before the larger negotiating teams launch into more detailed talks.

The FDP leader, Christian Lindner, said in an interview published on Sunday his party did not fear new elections if the negotiations failed.

But a new vote could see more gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which surged into parliament last month after a campaign that channeled public anger at Merkel’s 2015 decision to leave Germany’s border open to migrants.

The euro-sceptic AfD was stable in Sunday’s survey at 12 percent while left-wing Die Linke rose by one percentage point to poll to 10 percent.

Polling firm Emnid interviewed 1,476 people between 26 and 30 October.

A separate survey, carried out by pollster INSA in Bavaria, put Merkel’s local ally, the CSU, at 37 percent, down from an already disappointing 38.9 percent at general elections on Sept. 24.

CSU leader Horst Seehofer has been fending off calls for his resignation since the vote. Bavaria was the main entry point for migrants to Germany in 2015 and the CSU wants a limit of 200,000 migrants a year.

The NBC report said that lawyers for Flynn and his son, Michael G. Flynn, who worked with his father, declined to comment as did Mueller’s office.

Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the report.","Special Counsel Mueller has enough evidence to charge Flynn, son: NBC",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-mueller/special-counsel-mueller-has-enough-evidence-to-charge-flynn-son-nbc-idUSKBN1D50VE

The company also reported its biggest quarterly loss ever, sending shares down nearly 5 percent after hours as the loss was bigger than analysts had expected.

Tesla, led by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, faces a crucial test in its growth strategy as it ramps up production of the Model 3, its new sedan that starts at $35,000, about half the price of its flagship Model S.

Although Tesla has made inroads among luxury car buyers with the advanced technology and innovative design in its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, it is the Model 3 on which its long-term viability rests. The company continues to burn through cash, and spent $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter.

The company said it now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by late in the first quarter of 2018 from its original target date of December.

Tesla said the main constraint was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, where the company had to redesign part of the production process.

“I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago,” Musk said, adding that he is now optimistic because it is clear what needs to be done. “We are on it, we’ve got it covered,” but it will take a few months longer than expected, he said.

The Palo Alto, California-based company made just 260 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter due to what it called “production bottlenecks.” It had planned to build more than 1,500.

Model 3 production delays mean postponed sales could exacerbate the company’s cash burn. The problems could also worry the over 500,000 customers who have put down a refundable deposit on the car.

Adding to the pressure is the fact that U.S. tax credits for Tesla buyers, intended to help manufacturers ramp up electric vehicles, begin to expire after the company sells its 200,000th vehicle in the United States. The company has not said when that will be, but it has sold 250,000 globally.

Shares of Tesla have fallen nearly 17 percent from a 12-month high of $385 in September, but are still up 50 percent from January fueled by belief in the long-term prospects of the company.

Tesla’s soaring stock has made the company the second-most valuable U.S. automaker behind General Motors Co (GM.N), which had annual net profit of $9.4 billion in 2016.

LARGEST-EVER LOSS

Tesla could face major new requirements for cash given Model 3 problems, a possible factory in China, and plans to develop other vehicles, including an electric heavy duty truck.

But Musk said he did not expect any significant capital expenditures for China until 2019, adding that he envisions a factory producing at least a couple hundred thousand vehicles per year for the Chinese market.

Tesla said it was “well capitalized” for the delayed Model 3 production schedule and predicted capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the fourth quarter. That, together with spending in the third quarter, matched Tesla’s August estimate of $2 billion in capital expenditures for the second half of the year.

Tesla reported that cash and cash equivalents rose to $3.53 billion on Sept. 30 from $3.04 billion at the end of the second quarter, but Tesla in August raised $1.8 billion by selling debt. It also spent $325 million to repay a credit facility in the quarter.

The price of the $1.8 billion eight-year junk bond 88160RAE1= issued by Tesla last August also fell after the quarterly report.

Tesla’s continued need for cash is exacerbated by Musk’s insistence on vertical integration, such as making its own batteries and selling cars directly to customers. That, industry experts say, is among the reasons Tesla is nowhere close to its aggressive goal of building 500,000 vehicles annually by next year, most of them Model 3s.

Tesla posted a net loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of $21.9 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2lF0H65)

Revenue rose 30 percent to $2.98 billion. Excluding items, the company lost $2.92 per share.

Tesla warned that its adjusted gross margin would decline to about 15 percent due to a higher mix of lower-margin Model 3 deliveries in the fourth quarter, but then recover in the first quarter of 2018.

Last month, Tesla reported it delivered 26,150 vehicles in the third quarter, a 4.5 percent rise on the same period of 2016.","Tesla stock falls on Model 3 delays, biggest-ever quarterly loss",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-results/tesla-stock-falls-on-model-3-delays-biggest-ever-quarterly-loss-idUSKBN1D15TP

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

Talks between conservatives, Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) resumed on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.

“The weekend pause for thought did us good,” said Andreas Scheuer, a leader in the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU). Other party leaders agreed.

But Monday’s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week.

One sign of the division came in an interview Merkel ally Peter Altmaier gave to the newspaper Die Zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.",Scooters instead of boardroom 'kabuki': how one fund manager picks winners,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-greenlightmasters/scooters-instead-of-boardroom-kabuki-how-one-fund-manager-picks-winners-idUSKBN1930DA

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he raised the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to sell about 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest initial public offer ever.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition among New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment.

NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also received some government support for its bid, although that has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

While Trump’s tweet named the New York Stock Exchange, it did not mention rival Nasdaq Inc, which is also vying for the Aramco listing.

“Generally, public servants should be impartial, not give preferential treatment to anyone, and avoid endorsements,” said Scott Amey, general counsel for the government ethics watchdog Project on Government Oversight in Washington. “We have already seen violations in this administration, and it doesn’t help that the president isn’t leading by example.”

Nasdaq replied to Trump in a tweet, saying it agreed the United States was the “best destination for global companies” but that Aramco belongs on Nasdaq “with the 5 most valuable operating companies in the world.”

AWAITING A DECISION

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials say they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA. Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has been an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

Still, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. Saudi leaders welcomed him warmly during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against their nation’s diplomatic archrival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

“President Trump’s tweet indicates that, from the White House’s perspective at least, a public listing of Aramco is not as dead as some recent reports indicated,” said Bob McNally, president of Washington-based energy market and policy consultant Rapidan Energy Group.

“The tweet suggests the White House believes Saudi Arabia may be approaching a decision on where to list and wishes to either claim credit or push a possibly wavering Saudi Arabia for a New York listing,” McNally added.

Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock. The prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings, including IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.",Trump backs New York in bourses' battle for Saudi Aramco listing,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-aramco/trump-backs-new-york-in-bourses-battle-for-saudi-aramco-listing-idUSKBN1D40IL?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

An illness for flyhalf Foley and a calf strain for scrumhalf forced coach Michael Cheika to rejig his backline for the test against the Brave Blossoms and he was overall pleased with what the makeshift side produced in the 63-30 victory.

“We had moments that were really good and moments that were less effective but we’ve had a huge week where we’ve lost players and we’ve travelled overseas to a new place,” Cheika told reporters.

“We managed the first part of the game really well, which got us into a position where we could try some new combinations so it was a good entree into the rest of the tour.”

Rugby league convert Karmichael Hunt, who provides Cheika with an option at fullback in place of the rested Israel Folau, is also expected to be available to face Wales in Cardiff after missing the Yokohama match with a neck injury.

With Hunt unavailable Cheika had to use Kurtley Beale in the number 15 shirt and give a first test start at flyhalf to centre-winger Reece Hodge.

“I thought Japan tested him with line speed many times and he made some good decisions,” Cheika said of the 23-year-old, who converted all nine tries.

“Still a long way to go, but a great start for him in that number 10 jersey. I was very happy with his game.”

Australia have beaten Wales in their last 12 meetings going back to 2009 and will again face the men in scarlet in the pool stage of the 2019 World Cup.

Ten of those wins have been by 10 points or fewer, however, and Cheika was not delighted that Japan forwards had been able to score three tries from close range in the second half.

“We need to tighten ... the goal line defence in particular - that’s where we struggled,” said Cheika.

“In the outfield we were very good, but in the goal line I felt we took our eye off the ball.”

The Wallabies will take a six-match unbeaten run to Europe, where they also face England and Scotland, after having beaten New Zealand in their last fixture of the year on home soil.

After a pretty miserable run of results in the 18 months up to the middle of August, however, Cheika is keen for the Wallabies to develop the sort of consistency of performance that has long set apart the All Blacks.

In that context, he was particularly pleased that in the latter stages of the match, even with a big lead on the board and a few unfamiliar combinations on the pitch, the Wallabies had stuck to the gameplan.

“We didn’t just start doing anything that was out of what we’d normally do, because that’s what we’ve got to do in the games that are a bit tighter,” he said.","Foley, Genia set to return for Wallabies against Wales",https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1D50CY-OZASP

U.S. technology companies including Alphabet’s Google and Facebook have long opposed legislation that would amend what is known as Section 230 of the decades-old Communications Decency Act, arguing it could thwart digital innovation and prompt endless litigation.

Hariri left Lebanon for Saudi Arabia on Friday and resigned on Saturday in a televised statement that took the Lebanese political establishment by surprise.

He cited an assassination plot against him and criticized the regional role of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah however Lebanon’s army said on Sunday it had not uncovered any plot.

The move has thrust Lebanon back into the arena of regional rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, an ally of Hariri, and Shi‘ite Muslim Iran, which backs Hezbollah.

President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, will wait to accept or reject Hariri’s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to explain his reasons, sources at the presidential palace said.

Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat cited unnamed sources close to Hariri as speculating that he would probably remain outside Lebanon because of the security threat against him.

Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh sought to calm fears the political turmoil unleashed by Hariri’s bid to resign would hit Lebanon’s already fragile economy, issuing a statement to reaffirm the stability of its currency, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar.

In Lebanon’s sectarian system the president must be a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shi‘ite. Hariri is Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

His father, Rafik al-Hariri, was prime minister after Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war and was assassinated in a car bombing in 2005.

A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted five Hezbollah members for the killing but the group denies any involvement.

Saudi media have published reports of a plot to assassinate Hariri in recent days, but all of Lebanon’s main security branches have said they have no information about such a plot.

A Saudi minister said on Saturday that Hariri’s personal security detail had “confirmed information” about the plot. Thamer al-Sabhan said in an interview with a Lebanese TV station on Saturday that there are “threats against the prime minister and the Kingdom is keen for his security”.

The company said its stores and website would offer more exclusive products from companies such as appliance maker Cuisinart and audio equipment maker Bose.

The plans were announced at a media briefing to outline Wal-Mart’s strategy for the November and December holiday shopping season, an important period for retailers during which they earn an outsized portion of their annual profits and sales.

Bratspies said that for the third consecutive year the retailer would focus more on discounts and offering the lowest prices on items instead of gimmicky product deals, as customers expect more consistent pricing.

All are wanted by Madrid for actions related to the push for the region’s secession from Spain. Puigdemont has become the public face of that move for independence.

Other charges are the misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to the secessionist campaign, which has thrown Spain into a political crisis just as its economy has recovered from a sharp downturn and banking stress.

Madrid has taken over administrative control in Catalonia, until then an autonomous region, and called new elections on Dec 21.

Two polls on Sunday suggested pro-Catalonia independence parties will together win December’s regional election although they may fall just short of a majority of seats in parliament needed to revive the secession campaign.

Parties supporting Catalonia staying in Spain would divide seats but garner around 54 percent of the vote, the polls suggested.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium shortly after Madrid took control. On Sunday morning, Puigdemont and four of his former councillors presented themselves to police in Brussels.

A judge will hear the defendants case on Sunday afternoon and has until Monday morning to decide whether the formalities for the extradition request have been fulfilled.

According to a GAD3 survey of 1,233 people conducted between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 and published in La Vanguardia newspaper, pro-independence parties ERC, PDeCAT and CUP would take between 66 and 69 seats in the 135-seat parliament.

A second poll taken over the same period for the conservative newspaper La Razon echoed the GAD3 survey, showing pro-independence parties would capture the most votes though still fall just shy of a parliamentary majority with 65 seats.

Other seats would be generally divided between parties that support the region remaining as part of Spain, though they would run on separate tickets.

Voter participation, however, will rise to a record of 83 percent, the GAD3 poll showed.

POLITICIANS ON REMAND

Under the European arrest warrant system, the five defendants in Belgium can agree to an extradition order immediately or the judge can set bail or detain them. Belgian authorities have to inform their European counterparts if a European arrest warrant cannot be executed after 90 days.

On Saturday, Puigdemont - who PDeCAT said on Sunday would lead the party in the election - called for a united Catalan political front for independence from Spain and against the detention of his former members of government.

On Thursday, nine of his sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial.

One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was freed after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,035) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

According to the GAP3 survey, 59 percent believed legal action against Puigdemont was unjustified while 69.3 percent said the jailing of the Catalan politicians would give the independence cause a boost at the ballot box.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest the detentions.

The Catalonia issue has sent shockwaves across Europe, energizing regions with their own secessionist agenda while unnerving those fighting to keep the European Union from fracturing further.

Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon, a member of the Flemish nationalist and separatist party N-VA, criticized Spain’s handling of situation on Sunday, saying Madrid “went too far” in an interview with Belgian broadcaster VTM.

Madrid says the judiciary acts independently of the legislative arm of government while adding that Catalonia leaders acted outside the rule of law when organizing the vote and making the declaration of independence.

BACK TO THE START

A pro-secessionist rally in Barcelona on Sunday attracted just a few hundred people, a long way from the hundreds of thousands to join pro-independence marches in October. Many of those attending waved the regional flag and carried protest signs.

One protester, Antonia Aguilera, 63, said she was concerned the new elections would not be fair and would be manipulated by the Spanish government.

Her concerns echo the deep mistrust many Catalans have of politicians in Madrid that has deepened since the arrests and after the national police used truncheons and rubber bullets to thwart voting in the illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1.

“I‘m disgusted by it all. We knew they would react but not as strongly as they did,” she said, adding that she believed the pro-independence parties would win the December election.

Archbishop Socrates Villegas, president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, was speaking as the church launched a new prayer campaign to “heal the nation and stop the killings” in the country.

Philippine Catholic bishops have been stepping up opposition to killings blamed on a government crack down on drugs.

They are now asking the faithful to pray with the rosary for 33 days until Dec. 8, an important Catholic feast of the Immaculate Conception.

The new campaign follows the 40-day ringing of church bells and lighting of candles for thousands of people killed in President Rodrigo Duterte’s 16-month war on drugs.

More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police called self-defense after armed suspects resisted arrest. Critics dispute that and say executions are taking place, with zero accountability, allegations the police reject.

In a mass for families of victims of drug-related killings, Villegas said that if the killings continue “a curse awaits a nation that kills its own people”.

Symbolically, the mass was held at the Catholic shrine of Mary Queen of Peace which stands on the site where nuns stopped soldiers from attacking mutineers who overthrew dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.

“Why do we applaud the killings?,” Villegas said in his homily. “We chose violence instead of peace. We chose lies instead of truth. We chose to laugh at obscenities instead of correcting these. We chose to be silent than to be involved.”

Human rights lawyers, politicians, civil society groups and opponents of the president joined the families of victims in a religious procession after the mass to the “People Power” monument, where they held a cultural show.

Harry Roque, presidential spokesman, said the government welcomed “constructive dissent” after hundreds joined the religious activity condemning the killings.

“We reiterate that this administration does not - and will never - condone extrajudicial and vigilante killings,” Roque, a human rights lawyer, said in a statement, adding police have been investigating more than 2,200 killings with drug-related motives.

“Accountability is essential to good government. The president himself made a clear stance that any violation committed by the police during operations would be dealt with accordingly.”

Les multinationales américaines ont amplement tiré profit, au troisième trimestre, de la plus forte baisse du dollar depuis trois ans, en données annuelles.

Depuis le début octobre, 35 sociétés américaines au moins ont mis en avant l‘apport des effets de change ou d‘un “dollar plus faible” à leurs résultats trimestriels, alors que cet élément était plus rarement évoqué il y a un an, et certaines pensent qu‘il se retrouvera au quatrième trimestre, montre une analyse de Reuters.

“Le dollar a faibli dans le courant du trimestre sous revue, plus que les analystes ne le prévoyaient”, observe Jill Carey Hall, stratège de Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “C‘est ce dont les multinationales ont profité, entre autres choses”.

L‘indice du dollar, qui retrace l‘évolution du billet vert face à panier de six monnaies de référence, a rétrogradé de 2,5% environ au troisième trimestre, par rapport à la période comparable de 2016, un pourcentage sans précédent depuis 2014, selon des données de Thomson Reuters.

Depuis, l‘indice s‘est un peu remis mais il reste en recul de 7% environ sur l‘année.

Parmi les grandes entreprises américaines qui ont signalé cet effet bénéfique du dollar figurent Alphabet, International Business Machines et d‘autres sociétés high tech, secteur de l‘indice S&P-500 qui réalise le plus grand pourcentage de ses ventes à l‘étranger.

D‘autres sociétés ont dit que le troisième trimestre 2017 était le premier, sur 13, durant lequel un dollar affaibli avait augmenté le résultat d‘un point environ.

“Et nous pensons que ce sera encore mieux au quatrième trimestre, sur la foi des taux de fin de trimestre”, a dit William Osbourn, directeur financier de Xerox, le 26 octobre, à l‘occasion de la publication des trimestriels.

Le coup de mou du dollar a permis aux entreprises d‘amortir l‘impact des ouragans qui ont dévasté une partie des Etats-Unis au troisième trimestre et si cet effet joue encore sur les trois mois suivants, alors leurs bénéfices pourraient bien atteindre le taux de croissance de 11,7% projeté par les analystes pour le quatrième trimestre.

Plus des trois quarts des sociétés du S&P-500 ont publié leurs comptes trimestriels à ce jour et la croissance des bénéfices est estimée à 8,0% au troisième trimestre, au lieu des 4,3% anticipés voici trois semaines, montrent des données de Thomson Reuters.

Une performance imputable en grande partie au secteur des technologies de pointe: 90% des sociétés composant l‘indice sectoriel des technologiques ont battu le consensus, tandis que 72% dépassent le consensus pour l‘ensemble de l‘indice Standard & Poor’s 500.

Les entreprises opérant dans les matières premières ont également dégagé un pourcentage élevé de consensus dépassés, la baisse du dollar se traduisant par un renchérissement des matières premières en question.

Une situation économique mondiale globalement meilleure s‘est ajoutée à un dollar poussif pour vivifier les bilans et des entreprises et elle explique aussi pourquoi les multinationales ont fait mieux que les autres sociétés au troisième trimestre, dit Jill Carey Hall, de BofA Merrill Lynch.

Les sociétés du S&P-500 qui réalisent la moitié au moins de leur chiffre d‘affaires à l‘étranger ont dégagé une hausse de leur bénéfice estimée à 16,7% au troisième trimestre, alors que l‘estimation n‘est que de 5,5% pour les entreprises qui réalisent moins de la moitié de leur CA en dehors des Etats-Unis, suivant les données de Thomson Reuters.

Les plus grosses multinationales se distinguent encore plus et leur indice affiche une hausse de 3,3% depuis le 1er octobre, tandis que l‘indice Russell 2000 des petites capitalisations doit se contenter d‘un maigre 0,2%.

“Il serait plus juste de dire que le dollar n‘est pas un plus en soi mais qu‘en tout cas il n‘est plus un moins; c‘est ça qui est positif et les perspectives des entreprises sont d‘une manière générale de bon augure”, note David Katz (Matrix Asset Advisors).",Du bon effet dollar sur les résultats du 3e trimestre,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idFRKBN1D50UC-OFRBS

The decision to endorse a measure advancing in the U.S. Senate could clear the way for Congress to pass the first rewrite of a law adopted 21 years ago that is widely considered a bedrock legal shield for the internet industry.

Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, said in a statement it supported a bipartisan proposal advancing in the U.S. Senate making it easier for states and sex-trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.

“Important changes made to (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act) will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,” Beckerman said.

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed Catalonia’s secessionist government, called a regional election for Dec. 21 and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Bekaert told Belgian broadcaster VTM that Puigdemont had not fled Catalonia, was not hiding and would make a public appearance in Brussels on Tuesday.

After what he described as an hour-long meeting in his office in western Belgium, the lawyer - who quoted his experience with asylum and extradition cases, as well as with Spain - said his client was in high spirits, driven by “strong support among his backers in Catalonia”.

‘THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON’

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public-sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started work as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices, although some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Some 200,000 public-sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and 100,000 others in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence, while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. That compared with 41.1 percent in July, according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday, who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for dismissed regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies, which called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Monday the escalation of tensions in Catalonia significantly worsened the outlook for Spain’s economic growth and could prompt negative action on the country’s rating.",Spanish prosecutor accuses sacked Catalan leader of rebellion,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spanish-prosecutor-accuses-sacked-catalan-leader-of-rebellion-idUSKBN1CZ0IP

Applauding Pruitt’s move, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the plan to stop power plants from dumping unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere ”a vast, unlawful expansion of government authority” into the energy sector that had been “especially devastating” to coal country.

The reality is different. Republicans say that deregulating carbon pollution will revive the coal industry, but it won’t. The decades-long decline in coal jobs reflects larger economic forces: mechanization, tapped-out coal veins in Appalachia, and stiffer competition from increasingly cheap energy production from solar panels, wind turbines, and natural gas. In the last decade, coal’s share of the U.S. energy portfolio declined from half to one-third. This predates the Clean Power Plan, which has not yet even taken effect.

The Trump administration may not even be able to repeal the Clean Power regulation. Liberal states and environmental groups already are lining up to challenge Pruitt’s plans in court. The federal government is legally obligated to limit carbon pollution and coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source. Unless Republicans change the law, they may be forced to uphold the plan. Anyway, the Democrats will reinstate the rule if they win back control of the White House.

Although Ryan called the Clean Power Plan a “signature climate rule” of the Obama administration, it was Republican President Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act of 1970, which requires EPA to regulate pollutants that endanger human health. In 2007, the Supreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that clear evidence — some of it produced by the government’s own scientists — demonstrated that carbon emissions cause global warming, which in turn causes dangers such as smog, deadly heat waves, and hurricanes. Therefore, the court ruled that EPA had to regulate carbon.

George W. Bush stalled on implementation until the end of his administration, and Barack Obama spent his first few years in office trying to craft legislation in which the government would create a cap-and-trade program to regulate carbon. Because the Senate failed to pass cap-and-trade, the Obama administration eventually came up with the Clean Power Plan.

Even if Pruitt were able to convince courts that the Clean Power Plan’s costs outweigh its benefits – an argument for which environmentalists have plenty of counter-evidence – the EPA would still be obligated to come up with a replacement carbon pollution regulation. Courts could order EPA to produce a regulation by a certain time and hold Pruitt in contempt of court if he fails to comply. That’s what happened to EPA administrator William D. Ruckelshaus in 1984 for not issuing standards on radioactive airborne materials.

Although other regulatory rollbacks might trigger apoplexy among green organizations, in this case they say they are certain of victory. Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club, the largest U.S. environmental organization, while predicting that “Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt will go down in infamy for launching one of the most egregious attacks ever on public health,” also noted, “No matter who is in the White House, EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution.”

To be sure, Pruitt’s plan represents a threat to the environment. Coal is the dirtiest major source of energy in the United States. In addition to contributing to climate change, it produces a host of toxins such as nitrous oxide and mercury and is a major source of smog. When it drafted the Clean Power rule, the EPA estimated that it would prevent 90,000 childhood asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths per year by 2030. If the courts do let Pruitt repeal the rule, it could slow the transition away from coal, causing dirtier air and more global warming.

However, the only way to lastingly prevent carbon regulation would be to revise the Clean Air Act to stipulate that its standards do not apply to carbon. Republicans in Congress have tried to do just that. Their most recent bill, released in February, immediately attracted over 100 co-sponsors, all of them Republicans.

Preventing carbon regulation would be extremely unpopular. Polls show large majorities of the public, sometimes including a majority of Republican voters, support regulating climate pollution.

As David Doniger, director of the climate program at the left-leaning Natural Resources Defense Council and a former EPA official, told me in April for an article I wrote in The Washington Post: “After the Bush administration...the Clean Air Act was still in effect and the Obama administration started to set things right. It’s not a very satisfying thing to think of this as a 30-years war, but it’s longer than a four-year battle.”

Trump does have considerable political capital invested in the battle. In March, he issued an executive order directing Pruitt to get rid of the Clean Power rule. As a candidate, the president repeatedly promised to end his predecessor’s “war on coal” and put the miners back to work.

However, market realities will make this promise impossible to keep as coal’s slide continues. In 2016, natural gas passed coal as the leading source of American electricity, a shift the U.S. Energy Information Agency finds is “mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices.” There’s no sign of the fracking-driven cheap gas boom abating. In fact, Trump hopes to boost it by deregulating fracking on federal land. Whether governments will cut carbon pollution swiftly enough to stave off climate catastrophe remains an open question. But laws in place from a time when Republicans were more moderate will ultimately ensure that carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants is regulated — insufficient and late though it may be — and coal’s foreordained death will hardly have been slowed at all.",Commentary: EPA repeal of Clean Power Plan won’t get Trump what he wants,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adler-coal-commentary/commentary-epa-repeal-of-clean-power-plan-wont-get-trump-what-he-wants-idUSKBN1CT2TT

O órgão executivo da UE vê o plano da Rússia de dobrar o gás que poderia bombear pelo mar Báltico para a Alemanha, ignorando rotas tradicionais através da Ucrânia, subestimando os esforços da UE para reduzir a dependência de Moscou e seu apoio a Kiev.

A mudança se ajusta à proposta da Comissão de um mandato dos Estados membros para negociar com a Rússia as objeções ao gasoduto.

Mesmo com as mudanças, os reguladores da UE dizem que podem precisar de novas conversas com a Rússia, uma vez que não podem impor a lei no trecho do gasoduto que está fora do seu território.

Sob as mudanças propostas para a diretriz de gás, todos os dutos de importação teriam que cumprir as regras da EU, que exigem que os gasodutos não sejam diretamente de fornecedores de gás, tarifas não discriminatórias, operações transparentes e pelo menos 10 por cento da capacidade disponível para terceiros.

A proposta será submetida a uma votação na quarta-feira durante reunião dos Comissários da UE. Se aprovada, será enviada aos Estados membros e ao Parlamento Europeu para aprovação.

Os reguladores da UE afirmam querer as regras em vigor o mais cedo possível para a solicitação do gasoduto Nord Stream 2, que deverá estar concluído até o final do ano seguinte.

ティラーソン米国務長官が中東を歴訪した目的はただ２つ。イランに対抗する地域的枠組みにイラクを取り込むこと、そしてカタールに対する禁輸措置を終了するようサウジアラビアを説得することだった。１０月２７日、米国はこの３年間、ＩＳ打倒を最優先する中東政策をとってきたが、問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。写真はティラーソン米国務長官。カタールで２４日代表撮影（２０１７年 ロイター）だが、どちらも不首尾に終わった。過激派組織「イスラム国（ＩＳ）」が事実上の首都としていたシリアのラッカが陥落し、ようやく戦塵は収まりつつある。米国政府とその主導による有志連合が中東地域にとどまらず広範囲で収めた大きな成功だ。実際の戦闘の大半は現地勢力によって担われたとはいえ、米国による支援がなければ、依然としてＩＳがこの地域に広大な占領地を維持していたのはほぼ確実だ。ＩＳが２０１４年に劇的な勝利を重ねたことで、特にイラク、サウジアラビア両国政府はひどく混乱した。だが、ＩＳが窮地に追い詰められた今、どちらの政府も米国にあれこれ指図されることを快く思っていない。トランプ政権、オバマ政権のどちらも認めたくないかもしれないが、実はこの３年間、両政権とも中東政策に関しては似たようなアプローチをとっている。「ＩＳ最優先」と呼ばれることもあるが、中東地域のその他すべての利害よりも、ＩＳ打倒を優先してきたのである。これは理にかなったアプローチで、結果的に大きな成功を収めた。問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。核となる行動規範がないため、ただでさえ矛盾を抱えるアプローチが完全に崩壊してしまうリスクが顕在化している。いくつかの面で、そのリスクはすでに現実のものとなっている。米国政府と、シーア派主導でイランと同盟関係にあるイラク政府、またイラク領内のさまざまなクルド人政治組織との関係はこれまでも常にギクシャクしていたが、イスラム国の脅威が減るなかで、急速に悪化しつつある。９月にはクルド地域の独立を問う住民投票が行われたが、イラク政府はその直後、クルド地域の都市キルクーク周辺の石油資源が豊富な地域に進出した。クルド人勢力とイラク政府軍のあいだで衝突も相次いだ。中東のそれ以外の地域では、スンニ派・シーア派間の歴史的なライバル関係が複雑化の様相を強めている。シリアでは、アサド政権を救おうというイラン、ロシアの企図が実質的に成功した。米国政府はこれを、安定性の確保とＩＳに対する反撃のための代償として容認しているように見える。その一方で、サウジアラビアに対しては、イエメンにおいてイラン政府と同盟関係にあるフーシ派の掃討を進めることを事実上黙認している。ＩＳの弱体化に伴い、トランプ政権は現在、イランへの対抗を米中東政策全般における最優先課題とすることを明らかに望んでいる。これまでのところ、それを最も明瞭に示しているのは、トランプ大統領が１０月１３日に前政権が交渉したイラン核合意を承認しないと発表したことである。その後まもなく、米国がテロ支援組織に指定しているイラン革命防衛隊に対する新たな制裁が発表された。だが対イランに関しては、米国政府がＩＳに対して結成したような広範囲かつ一枚岩の有志連合を生み出す現実的なチャンスはほとんどない。イラン政府に対するアプローチとして何が最善なのか、米国の同盟諸国のあいだには依然として深い溝があり、欧州諸国は、ロシアも中国も署名している核合意を破棄することについて、気が進まない姿勢を明らかにしている。湾岸諸国は、統一的な連合とはとうてい言いがたい状態にある。サウジアラビア、アラブ首長国連邦が支持する対カタール禁輸措置は継続されており、これら３カ国すべてに重要な軍事基地を持つ米国は居心地の悪い立場に置かれている。米国政府がこの状況を修復する能力はきわめて限定されているように思われる。１０月２７日、米国はこの３年間、ＩＳ打倒を最優先する中東政策をとってきたが、問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。写真はティラーソン米国務長官。サウジアラビアの首都リヤドで２２日代表撮影（２０１７年 ロイター）カタールの近隣諸国は、同国がムスリム同胞団などの組織を支援していることに怒っており、この対立は米国政府が仲裁できる領域を超えてしまっている可能性がある。しかしそれはともかく、ティラーソン氏が、中東歴訪のもう１つの目的であるイラク政府の立場を反イランに転向させるのに成功する可能性は、さらに低かった。ＩＳ打倒に関して、イラク政府は、米国政府やクルド人勢力に頼るのと少なくとも同じ程度に、イランの支援を受けたシーア派民兵に依存していた。ティラーソン氏がシーア派民兵に対し、イランに帰国するよう求めたことは、ひどく不合理な要求と受け止められた可能性がある。何しろ、その構成員の多くはシーア派イラク国民だからである。ティラーソン氏の訪問は、オバマ政権以来高まっていた言説をさらに補強してしまうリスクがある。つまり、従来の友好国・敵対国双方に対して同じように、米国の支配力・影響力がいっそう低下している、というものだ。しかもこれら諸国では、今やプーチン大統領率いるロシアに接近するという選択肢さえあるという感覚が強まっている。遠く１９世紀末以来、米国の信頼できる同盟国であったトルコは、エルドアン大統領のもとで、ますます反米的な意識を強めている。エジプトの軍事政権も、引き続き米国から大量の支援を受けているとはいえ、独自性を主張することにますます熱心になっている。イスラエルとの関係においては、オバマ政権時代よりトランプ政権の方がわずかに改善されているかもしれないが、それでもここ数十年に比べればかなり疎遠になっている。イスラエル・パレスチナ間の紛争に関する「２国家共存」案について、トランプ氏は曖昧なシグナルを送っている。米国大使館をテルアビブからエルサレムに移転させることを提案する一方で、今年前半には、イスラエルが提供したＩＳに関する機密情報をロシア外相に漏らしたことが報道され、イスラエル側を動揺させている。イスラエルはイランの影響力拡大とトランプ政権の予測しにくさに懸念を抱いており、特に湾岸諸国との独自の地域外交努力を強めていくことになろう。ＩＳに対する有志連合の取り組みがほぼ成功を収めるのと同時進行で、このような状況が生じているのは逆説的である。その有志連合は、米国に深く依存していたのだし、このような有志連合をまさにこのような形でまとめ上げることは、恐らく他のどの国にもできなかっただろう。米国政府は、かつてのイラクに対する単独主義的な武力介入とは対照的に、対ＩＳにおいては域内諸勢力と協力し、彼らを介在させることに大きな努力を注ぎ、それが顕著な効果を発揮することになったのである。米国の軍事的な支援は今後も続くだろう。ＩＳは完全に消滅したわけではなく、攻撃を続けるだろう。リビアやアフガニスタンの一部におけるように、新たに安全な潜伏地を確保するかもしれない。アルカイダに刺激された武装勢力に対するより広範囲の戦いは確実に続くだろうし、多くの場合は、米国による軍事的な支援・協調を伴うことだろう。だが、１０年以上にわたる戦争が失敗に終わったとみられる今、中東再編という試みに向けた米国の熱意は冷めていくかもしれない。そして、仮に米国の熱意が維持されるとしても、中東の諸勢力の側で、米国の声に耳を傾けようという気持ちがうせてしまう可能性はある。＊筆者はロイターのコラムニスト。元ロイターの防衛担当記者で、現在はシンクタンク「Project for Study of the 21st Century（ＰＳ２１）」を立ち上げ、理事を務める。＊本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。（翻訳：エァクレーレン）＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。,"［２７日 ロイター］ -

だが、どちらも不首尾に終わった。

過激派組織「イスラム国（ＩＳ）」が事実上の首都としていたシリアのラッカが陥落し、ようやく戦塵は収まりつつある。米国政府とその主導による有志連合が中東地域にとどまらず広範囲で収めた大きな成功だ。

実際の戦闘の大半は現地勢力によって担われたとはいえ、米国による支援がなければ、依然としてＩＳがこの地域に広大な占領地を維持していたのはほぼ確実だ。ＩＳが２０１４年に劇的な勝利を重ねたことで、特にイラク、サウジアラビア両国政府はひどく混乱した。だが、ＩＳが窮地に追い詰められた今、どちらの政府も米国にあれこれ指図されることを快く思っていない。

トランプ政権、オバマ政権のどちらも認めたくないかもしれないが、実はこの３年間、両政権とも中東政策に関しては似たようなアプローチをとっている。「ＩＳ最優先」と呼ばれることもあるが、中東地域のその他すべての利害よりも、ＩＳ打倒を優先してきたのである。これは理にかなったアプローチで、結果的に大きな成功を収めた。

問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。核となる行動規範がないため、ただでさえ矛盾を抱えるアプローチが完全に崩壊してしまうリスクが顕在化している。

いくつかの面で、そのリスクはすでに現実のものとなっている。

米国政府と、シーア派主導でイランと同盟関係にあるイラク政府、またイラク領内のさまざまなクルド人政治組織との関係はこれまでも常にギクシャクしていたが、イスラム国の脅威が減るなかで、急速に悪化しつつある。９月にはクルド地域の独立を問う住民投票が行われたが、イラク政府はその直後、クルド地域の都市キルクーク周辺の石油資源が豊富な地域に進出した。クルド人勢力とイラク政府軍のあいだで衝突も相次いだ。

中東のそれ以外の地域では、スンニ派・シーア派間の歴史的なライバル関係が複雑化の様相を強めている。

シリアでは、アサド政権を救おうというイラン、ロシアの企図が実質的に成功した。米国政府はこれを、安定性の確保とＩＳに対する反撃のための代償として容認しているように見える。その一方で、サウジアラビアに対しては、イエメンにおいてイラン政府と同盟関係にあるフーシ派の掃討を進めることを事実上黙認している。

ＩＳの弱体化に伴い、トランプ政権は現在、イランへの対抗を米中東政策全般における最優先課題とすることを明らかに望んでいる。

これまでのところ、それを最も明瞭に示しているのは、トランプ大統領が１０月１３日に前政権が交渉したイラン核合意を承認しないと発表したことである。その後まもなく、米国がテロ支援組織に指定しているイラン革命防衛隊に対する新たな制裁が発表された。

だが対イランに関しては、米国政府がＩＳに対して結成したような広範囲かつ一枚岩の有志連合を生み出す現実的なチャンスはほとんどない。イラン政府に対するアプローチとして何が最善なのか、米国の同盟諸国のあいだには依然として深い溝があり、欧州諸国は、ロシアも中国も署名している核合意を破棄することについて、気が進まない姿勢を明らかにしている。

湾岸諸国は、統一的な連合とはとうてい言いがたい状態にある。サウジアラビア、アラブ首長国連邦が支持する対カタール禁輸措置は継続されており、これら３カ国すべてに重要な軍事基地を持つ米国は居心地の悪い立場に置かれている。米国政府がこの状況を修復する能力はきわめて限定されているように思われる。

１０月２７日、米国はこの３年間、ＩＳ打倒を最優先する中東政策をとってきたが、問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。写真はティラーソン米国務長官。サウジアラビアの首都リヤドで２２日代表撮影（２０１７年 ロイター）

カタールの近隣諸国は、同国がムスリム同胞団などの組織を支援していることに怒っており、この対立は米国政府が仲裁できる領域を超えてしまっている可能性がある。

しかしそれはともかく、ティラーソン氏が、中東歴訪のもう１つの目的であるイラク政府の立場を反イランに転向させるのに成功する可能性は、さらに低かった。

ＩＳ打倒に関して、イラク政府は、米国政府やクルド人勢力に頼るのと少なくとも同じ程度に、イランの支援を受けたシーア派民兵に依存していた。ティラーソン氏がシーア派民兵に対し、イランに帰国するよう求めたことは、ひどく不合理な要求と受け止められた可能性がある。何しろ、その構成員の多くはシーア派イラク国民だからである。

ティラーソン氏の訪問は、オバマ政権以来高まっていた言説をさらに補強してしまうリスクがある。つまり、従来の友好国・敵対国双方に対して同じように、米国の支配力・影響力がいっそう低下している、というものだ。

しかもこれら諸国では、今やプーチン大統領率いるロシアに接近するという選択肢さえあるという感覚が強まっている。遠く１９世紀末以来、米国の信頼できる同盟国であったトルコは、エルドアン大統領のもとで、ますます反米的な意識を強めている。エジプトの軍事政権も、引き続き米国から大量の支援を受けているとはいえ、独自性を主張することにますます熱心になっている。

イスラエルとの関係においては、オバマ政権時代よりトランプ政権の方がわずかに改善されているかもしれないが、それでもここ数十年に比べればかなり疎遠になっている。イスラエル・パレスチナ間の紛争に関する「２国家共存」案について、トランプ氏は曖昧なシグナルを送っている。

米国大使館をテルアビブからエルサレムに移転させることを提案する一方で、今年前半には、イスラエルが提供したＩＳに関する機密情報をロシア外相に漏らしたことが報道され、イスラエル側を動揺させている。イスラエルはイランの影響力拡大とトランプ政権の予測しにくさに懸念を抱いており、特に湾岸諸国との独自の地域外交努力を強めていくことになろう。

ＩＳに対する有志連合の取り組みがほぼ成功を収めるのと同時進行で、このような状況が生じているのは逆説的である。その有志連合は、米国に深く依存していたのだし、このような有志連合をまさにこのような形でまとめ上げることは、恐らく他のどの国にもできなかっただろう。

米国政府は、かつてのイラクに対する単独主義的な武力介入とは対照的に、対ＩＳにおいては域内諸勢力と協力し、彼らを介在させることに大きな努力を注ぎ、それが顕著な効果を発揮することになったのである。

米国の軍事的な支援は今後も続くだろう。ＩＳは完全に消滅したわけではなく、攻撃を続けるだろう。リビアやアフガニスタンの一部におけるように、新たに安全な潜伏地を確保するかもしれない。アルカイダに刺激された武装勢力に対するより広範囲の戦いは確実に続くだろうし、多くの場合は、米国による軍事的な支援・協調を伴うことだろう。

だが、１０年以上にわたる戦争が失敗に終わったとみられる今、中東再編という試みに向けた米国の熱意は冷めていくかもしれない。そして、仮に米国の熱意が維持されるとしても、中東の諸勢力の側で、米国の声に耳を傾けようという気持ちがうせてしまう可能性はある。

In Hong Kong, some buyers quickly resold iPhone X handsets for a profit, but the resale premium eased as waiting times fell and supply concerns eased.
Demand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apple’s online store.","NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shoppers surged into Apple Inc stores across the world on Friday to buy the new iPhone X, signaling stronger demand for the 10th anniversary version of the premium smartphone than the last two iterations.

Investors and analysts took the swell of interest, alongside the company’s better-than-expected sales forecast for the upcoming holiday shopping season, as signs that Apple could be the first ever company worth $1 trillion.

Apple’s shares rose 3 percent on Friday, hitting a record high and giving the world’s most valuable publicly traded company a market capitalization of almost $890 billion.

“I can’t wait to get to my office and plug it in, back it up and play around with it,” said Jordan Shapiro, a 34-year-old recruiter from New Jersey who was one of the first to get into Apple’s flagship store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, at the head of a line that stretched for a block.

Jasmine Rivera, a 16-year-old from Las Vegas, said getting one of the new phones was the highlight of her New York trip with her aunt.

“I’m so excited and can’t wait to show this to my friends,” she said. “I’m especially excited about the camera quality and facial recognition.”

The glass-and-stainless-steel device that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has billed as “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone,” starts at $999 in the United States.

The handset features an edge-to-edge display designed for deeper color rendition and an innovative camera that uses facial recognition to unlock and operate the phone.

Cook appeared on TV greeting the first customers in line at the company’s store in Palo Alto, California, about a half-hour drive from Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino.

In nearby San Francisco, about 250 people lined up outside the Apple store in the Union Square shopping district.

“I’m feeling good, but my socks are wet,” said Ross Hendrix, 20, one of the first in line after camping out on the sidewalk despite a light rain on Thursday night.

GLOBAL EXCITEMENT

Similar scenes of excitement occurred earlier in the day in Asia and Europe.

In Australia, around 400 people queued outside Apple’s main store in central Sydney to pay A$1,579 ($1,218) for the new phone. Just 30 turned up for the September release of the iPhone 8, an incremental update of the iPhone 7.

“It’s beautiful bro, what a feeling, I‘m excited,” builder Bishoy Behman, 18, told Reuters after picking up two iPhone X as the first in line. He said he camped outside the store for a week before paying to improve his place in the queue overnight.

In Apple’s Omotesando store in Tokyo, some 550 people were waiting in a line stretching to around 600 meters.

“I‘m going home, and after having a rest, I’d like to have fun (with the phone),” said first-in-line Yamaura, a 21-year-old college student who spent six days in the queue.

In Europe, Apple stores in Amsterdam, Berlin and London saw lines of several hundred fans, while smaller, more subdued crowds were observed at stores in Frankfurt and Paris.

Arbitrage traders were also in line in an attempt to take advantage of the strong demand. In Hong Kong, some buyers quickly resold iPhone X handsets for a profit, but the resale premium eased as waiting times fell and supply concerns eased.

Slideshow (21 Images)

Newly purchased iPhone X were reselling for HK$11,800 ($1,512) soon after sales began, but the price quickly fell to HK$10,300, a trader told Reuters. In mainland China - where Hong Kong traders often sell newly purchased goods - the anniversary model’s starting price is 8,388 yuan ($1,267).

SUPPLY CLOSER TO DEMAND

Analysts had expressed concern that supply issues might stop Apple satisfying early demand. The camera, for instance, has never before been manufactured in the volume Apple demands.

But Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Thursday that Apple was “quite happy” with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing.

“Production is growing every week, and that’s very, very important during a ramp period,” he said.

Demand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apple’s online store. While last week users trying to order the iPhone X were told they faced waits up to five to six weeks, these delays are now three to four weeks.

The rush of interest in the new phone came after Apple issued an upbeat sales forecast for the year-end holiday shopping season on Thursday.

Wall Street welcomed that outlook, and five analysts now have stock price targets that would move Apple’s market value past $1 trillion.

Friday’s lines signaled the company was “on track for a pretty good replacement cycle” said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor, but he questioned whether the new model sales will be as large as prior iPhone upgrade cycles.

“We do not think that the iPhone X will offer a cycle nearly as big as the iPhone 6 and my concern is that this is what the market is looking for,” said Windsor, who actively tracks all the major players in the global smartphone industry.",Long lines for iPhone X help push Apple shares to record high,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/long-lines-for-iphone-x-help-push-apple-shares-to-record-high-idUSKBN1D22Y2

“Overall, sustained job growth and labor market slack at pre-crisis lows keeps December in play.”Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Fed’s 2 percent target.
The lack of wage growth despite a rapidly tightening labor could raise concerns about consumer spending, which appears to have been largely supported by savings this year.
Monthly job growth has averaged 162,000 over the past three months, below the 187,000 average in 2016.
Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, but wages grew at their slowest annual pace in more than 1-1/2 years in a sign that inflation probably will remain benign.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 last month as 106,000 leisure and hospitality workers returned to work, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Friday. That was the largest gain since July 2016 but below economists’ expectations for a jump of 310,000 jobs.

Data for September was revised to show a gain of 18,000 jobs instead of a decline of 33,000 as previously reported.

The White House, which is pushing a Republican-backed package of tax cuts to boost economic growth and employment, trumpeted the payrolls gains. “Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!” President Donald Trump tweeted after the release of the report.

But Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, said in a statement that the report showed Americans were continuing to be denied bigger paychecks by Republicans’ “billionaires-first agenda.”

Average hourly earnings slipped one cent in October, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms, in part due to the return of the lower-paid leisure and hospitality workers. Wages shot up 0.5 percent in September. They were up 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis last month, the smallest gain since February 2016, after a 2.8 percent advance in the prior month.

October’s job growth acceleration reinforced the Federal Reserve’s assessment on Wednesday that “the labor market has continued to strengthen,” and the sluggish wage data did little to change expectations it will raise interest rates in December.

The U.S. central bank has increased rates twice this year.

“The weakness in wages will not go unnoticed at the Fed, particularly for members that remained more concerned over the inflation outlook,” said Michael Hanson, chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York. “Overall, sustained job growth and labor market slack at pre-crisis lows keeps December in play.”

Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Fed’s 2 percent target. Should wage growth remain sluggish, economists say it would be hard for central bank policymakers to hike rates three times next year as they currently anticipate.

Although the unemployment rate fell to near a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in October, from 4.2 percent in the prior month, it was because the labor force dropped by 765,000 after a surprise rise of 575,000 in September.

The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell four-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent.

The sharp moderation in job growth in September was blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September and left workers, mostly in lower-paying industries such as leisure and hospitality, temporarily unemployed.

Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher as were U.S. stocks. The dollar .DXY gained against a basket of currencies.

LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING

Economists, however, remain optimistic that wage growth will accelerate with the labor market near full employment. The unemployment rate, which has declined by 0.7 percentage point since January, is now at its lowest level since December 2000 and below the Fed’s median forecast for 2017.

A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.9 percent last month. That was the lowest level since December 2006 and was down from 8.3 percent in September.

The lack of wage growth despite a rapidly tightening labor could raise concerns about consumer spending, which appears to have been largely supported by savings this year.

“You cannot get strong growth when spending power is increasing so modestly,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The economy grew at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed the U.S. trade deficit increased 1.7 percent to $43.5 billion in September as rising exports were offset by a surge in imports.

Other economic reports showed a jump in business spending on capital in September and a measure of services sector activity racing to more than a 12-year high in October.

Economic growth has remained strong even as Trump and the Republican-led Congress have struggled to enact their economic program.

House Republicans on Thursday unveiled a bill that would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cut tax rates on individuals and families and end certain tax breaks. Small businesses, realtors and homebuilders have opposed the current proposal.

Monthly job growth has averaged 162,000 over the past three months, below the 187,000 average in 2016. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.

The slowing job growth trend largely reflects employers’ difficulties in finding qualified workers. Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.

Private payrolls surged by 219,000 jobs in October after falling by 3,000 in September. Manufacturing employment increased by 24,000 jobs last month while the retail sector lost 8,300 jobs.

Construction payrolls were up 11,000 in October, likely boosted by hiring related to the clean-up and rebuilding efforts in the wake of the hurricanes. Professional and business services payrolls rose as did healthcare employment.",U.S. job growth picks up; flat wages raise consumer spending worries,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy/u-s-job-growth-picks-up-flat-wages-raise-consumer-spending-worries-idINKBN1D308D

TENTATIVE DE DIVERSION

Kevin Spacey a présenté ses excuses le week-end dernier à l‘acteur Anthony Rapp, qui l‘avait accusé d‘avoir tenté de le séduire en 1986 alors que ce dernier était âgé de 14 ans.

Selon une information donnée par la chaîne de télévision CNN jeudi, huit employés de “House of Cards”, anciens et actuels, ont accusé Kevin Spacey de comportement sexuel non approprié.

Netflix a également annoncé vendredi qu‘il ne diffuserait pas le film “Gore”, qui se trouve en postproduction et qui est produit par Kevin Spacey. L‘acteur y incarne l‘écrivain Gore Vidal, décédé en 2012.

The deal would combine CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers and drugstore chains, with Aetna, one of the oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.

The companies have agreed that CVS will split its consideration for the deal between cash and CVS stock, a deal structure that would minimize tax liabilities for Aetna shareholders, the sources said.

A deal will probably value Aetna at significantly more than $200 per share, the sources said, adding that the companies will agree to an exact price closer to signing the deal in December.

The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Aetna declined to comment, while CVS did not respond to a request for comment.

Aetna shares rose as much as 6 percent on the news and ended trading up 2.7 percent on Friday at $176.99. They have risen over 10 percent since Oct. 26, when the Wall Street Journal first reported that CVS and Aetna were in merger talks.

CVS shares ended trading down 0.2 percent at $69.25, giving the company a market capitalization of $70 billion.

Healthcare consolidation has been a popular route for insurers and pharmacies, under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs.

Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers.

They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines in PBM formularies with low co-payments.

A tie-up with Aetna could give CVS more leverage in its price negotiations with drug makers.

The deal would follow years of major changes to the U.S. health insurance industry under former President Barack Obama, whose 2010 Affordable Care Act created new ground rules for how insurers operate and expanded insurance to 20 million more Americans.

Republican President Donald Trump has promised to turn back many of the Affordable Care Act’s facets, but Congress has not been able to agree on a repeal or a replacement. The lack of progress, along with Trump’s executive order to bring down healthcare costs, has created uncertainty for insurers as they head into 2018.","CVS, Aetna aim to finalize deal as early as December: sources",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs-health/cvs-aetna-aim-to-finalize-deal-as-early-as-december-sources-idUSKBN1D32A6?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Trump kicked off a 12-day Asian trip and is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.

He told reporters on Air Force One en route to Asia that North Korea would figure prominently in discussions, and also singled out trade, which he said had been “badly handled” in the region for years.

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

A top aide said last week Trump intends to tell Asian leaders the world is “running out of time” in dealing with the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.

“No dictator, no regime, no nation should ever underestimate American resolve,” Trump told hundreds of cheering U.S. and Japanese troops in camouflage uniforms gathered at Yokota Air Base, just west of Tokyo, soon after he arrived.

“Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it?” said Trump, who wore a bomber jacket as he addressed the troops.

North Korea’s recent actions, including several missiles that flew over Japan and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test, have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Recent drills over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have further heightened tensions.

“We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defense of our freedom,” Trump said.

He told reporters earlier on Air Force One that a decision would be made soon on whether to add reclusive North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Trump said his administration planned to take a different approach after years of what he termed “total weakness.”

“It’s a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved.”

In an apparent attempt to distinguish between North Korea’s leadership and ordinary people, he said he thought North Koreans were “great people.”

“And I hope it all works out for everybody.”

Abe told reporters before Trump’s arrival that he welcomed the visit as a chance to deepen bilateral ties by building on the “friendship and trust” between the two leaders, fostered by several meetings that included a round of golf in Florida earlier this year.

“I hope we will be able to have thorough discussions about international issues, including North Korea,” he said.

Trump and Abe greeted each other with a handshake at a golf course to be used during the 2020 Olympic Games, changing clothes and heading out to play after what media said was a lunch of hamburgers. In an allusion to a Trump campaign slogan, they signed caps that said “Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.”

They discussed North Korea and trade while playing nine holes with Hideki Matsuyama, the world no. 3 pro golfer.

A senior White House official said the two leaders have developed a close bond since Trump took office in January.

“Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people!” Trump tweeted. For his part, Abe took to Twitter to say he played golf “with a marvellous friend (President Donald J. Trump) full of spirited conversation.”

The two leaders and their wives later dined on grilled Japanese premium beef at an upscale restaurant.

In brief pre-dinner remarks, Trump said U.S.-Japan ties were closer than ever. But he added: “We’ll have dinner tonight. I think we’ll insult everybody by continuing to talk about trade.”

Trump also said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, the longest Asian tour by any U.S. leader since George H.W. Bush in 1992.

“I think it’s expected that we will meet,” he said. “We want Putin’s help on North Korea.”

Trump wants a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before he visits Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Separately, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed that “now is the time to apply firm pressure on North Korea,” Kono told reporters.

A senior U.S. State Department official traveling with Tillerson said the pressure was having an effect.

“I think we have a better chance now than we’ve had in the last couple of decades to solve this problem because the most important thing is to have the international community completely united in order to really choke off the lifeline for North Korea. It’s got to be the way,” the official said.

TRADE TALKS

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to policies more favorable to the United States, a point Trump emphasized.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where Trump will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.

“One of the things we’re going to be very focused on is trade because trade has not been done well for 25 years by the United States with this part of the world, with any part of the world,” he said on Air Force One.

“We’re going to be discussing reciprocal trade. Fair, free but reciprocal,” he said.","Trump in Japan stresses unity on North Korea; talks trade, too",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D501L

He failed to accomplish either.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now that it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson embraces Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi before a meeting of the Saudi-Iraqi Bilateral Coordination Council in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, October 22, 2017. REUTERS/Alex Brandon/Pool

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Peter Van Buren: What you need to know about post-IS battle for Mideast

Maysam Behravesh: The unlikely - and ironic - effects of Islamic State's fall in Iraq

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.

A U.S. State Department official said on Saturday that the government was “aware of reports that a U.S. citizen was detained in Zimbabwe. We stand ready to provide appropriate consular assistance for U.S. citizens”.

Lawyer Obey Shava said he would now apply for bail at the High Court on Monday.

O‘Donovan, who denies the charges against her, was not formally charged nor was she asked to plead in court, where she will return on Nov. 15.

The case against her centers around a post on Twitter last month in which O‘Donovan allegedly called 93-year-old Mugabe a “selfish and sick man”. Her arrest comes after the creation of a Ministry of Cyber Security last month.

Mugabe’s government has been particularly uneasy about social media after activists such as pastor Evan Mawarire and his #ThisFlag movement last year used social media to organize a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade.

Trump hailed the “good chemistry” of the sunny summit in Florida and predicted “lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away.”

The “bromance” is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trump’s visit starting on Wednesday. Xi has grown more powerful since their last meeting, while Trump is under a political cloud after his former campaign manager was indicted in an intensifying investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Chinese experts say Beijing has learned to manage Trump, a real-estate mogul who had never held elective office before becoming president, and whose administration in its first 10 months has been turbulent.

“China has an objective view of him. We’re going to make him feel comfortable,” said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. “He may end up being re-elected. We need to look at this from a long-term perspective, and not view him as an ‘other’ or a joke.”

Trump clearly respects Xi.

In a congratulatory phone call, Trump hailed the “extraordinary elevation” of Xi, whose political thoughts were enshrined in the Communist Party’s constitution last month during a congress marking the start of his second term.

Aboard Air Force One on his way to Asia, Trump cited record stock market levels, low unemployment and Islamic State “virtually defeated in the Middle East” as evidence of his own success.

“(Xi) knows that and he respects that,” Trump said, adding trade is still an irritant in ties.

“I think he’s viewing us as very, very strong and also very friendly. Look we have to do better with trade with China because it’s a one way street right now. It has been for many years. And we will.”

‘STATE-PLUS’

China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said Trump will receive a “state visit-plus” experience in Beijing.

It’s unclear what the “plus” means. Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details. The protocol will let Trump “rejoice in grandiosity”, important to keeping relations stable, said Teng Jianqun, head of American Studies at Foreign Ministry think-tank China Institute for International Studies.

“We must seize upon his special characteristics, such as liking instant gratification, and set up some things that bring immediate results,” he said.

On the commercial front, that means a slew of deals - and worries among some in the U.S. business community that the transactional Trump will be placated by a handful of contract wins instead of resolving long-standing complaints over discriminatory Chinese policies and market access restrictions. [L4N1N304G]

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told reporters on Friday that China would “create a good atmosphere” with informal activities for the two presidents, so they have ample time to talk about important issues.

Zheng said that at the April summit, Trump and his wife Melania had extended an “extremely warm, friendly and thoughtful” reception to Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan. “The Chinese people demand that courtesy be repaid in kind,” he said.

Trump is a popular figure for many in China, who admire his business acumen; he is not the divisive figure he is in the United States and its allies in Europe and elsewhere.

The WeChat account of the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily marked China’s announcement of his visit with a picture of a beaming Trump and the headline “Trump’s coming!”

STARK CONTRAST

A contrast between the two presidents was set at the start of the year.

Days ahead of Trump taking office, Xi was the keynote speaker at the World Economic Forum in Davos, offering a vigorous defense of globalization. Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership his first week in office, distancing America from its Asian allies.

One Beijing-based Western diplomat said Xi’s strong and confident vision for China contrasts with perceptions that Trump often seems to pick arguments.

But not with China. Trump in office put aside his grievances about China’s trade and currency practices, aired vociferously during the campaign, to get China behind his strategy of punishing sanctions on North Korea for its escalating missile and nuclear tests.

And Beijing accommodated him when he grew frustrated.

Days after Trump’s Sept. 4 tweet that the United States was considering “stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,” Beijing ordered North Korean companies operating within its borders to shut down, banned its exports of textiles and reduced China’s oil exports to the North.

But with North Korea occupying most of the Trump administration’s attention in Asia, China’s construction of military facilities on artificial islands in disputed waters of the South China Sea has seemingly fallen off the radar. Beijing does still get irritated about U.S. navy “freedom of navigation” patrols there, which have continued under Trump.

“Trump is very popular with the (Chinese) military,” said a Chinese official with ties to the military, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It’s great for China that the United States is in chaos. It means we don’t have to worry about them challenging us.”

Trump’s 12-day trip to Asia – the longest by a U.S. president in a quarter-century - will give him a chance to reassure friends and allies in the region, who have expressed uncertainty about his “America First” policies.

Tillerson has already signaled the limits of Washington’s patience with China.

Ahead of a trip to India last month, Tillerson said that “China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly, at times undermining the international, rules-based order,“ and he criticized China for its “predatory economics” and its ”provocative actions in the South China Sea”.

At last month’s party congress, Xi laid out a vision for a prosperous and assertive China taking a bigger place on the global stage.

The congress left China with “greater confidence and lung power, more unhurried in its dealings with the United States,” Wang Wen, president of Renmin University’s Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, wrote in a front page commentary on Friday in the overseas edition of the People’s Daily.","Riding high, Xi looks to soothe Trump as U.S. pressures China",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D502M-OCATP

Saudi Arabia’s air defenses intercepted the missile,

bringing it down near the capital Riyadh’s airport on Saturday and it did not cause any casualties, state news agencies reported.

A Saudi-led coalition has launched thousands of air strikes against Houthi rebels and allied forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh who have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi territory over the course of a 2-1/2 year war.

Regional and Western sources have said Iran is sending advanced weapons and military advisers to the Houthi movement, stepping up support for its Shi‘ite ally in the country’s civil war.
