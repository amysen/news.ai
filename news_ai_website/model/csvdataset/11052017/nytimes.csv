During a recent interview, Ms. Gatewood walked the green-and-white halls of the building in the financial district, her head held high, her pace brisk.","But when the luxury hotel closed its doors on March 1 for years of renovations, Ms. Gatewood found herself without a job, along with more than 1,200 unionized hotel employees. Although they had known the closing was coming, Ms. Gatewood said, there was still an atmosphere of disbelief. Her work at the Waldorf was highly specialized — waiters served in pairs and did not use a computer-ordering system — and Ms. Gatewood worried such specialization would make it difficult for her to find employment elsewhere.

On the afternoon that the Waldorf closed, Hilton Worldwide, which manages the hotel, treated employees to a party in the Grand Ballroom, complete with champagne.

“But champagne is for celebrations,” Ms. Gatewood said. “And what were we celebrating? We were losing our jobs. We needed a good strong vodka, or maybe a Scotch.”

At the end of the party, the employees turned toward the stage, where a large mock light switch was flipped and the lights went out.

Seeking a fit for her specialized skills was not Ms. Gatewood’s only concern: She feared the challenge of finding work in her 60s. She joined the 91,000 New York State residents who are 55 or older and looking for work. About a third of people in that demographic face long-term unemployment, or at least 27 weeks without work, according to the Bureau for Labor Statistics.

At the party, Ms. Gatewood said, many colleagues whispered hopes of returning when the hotel reopens. She hoped her $10,000 post-tax severance package would help carry her through, along with her savings of $50,000, roughly her annual salary. Ms. Gatewood provides for her two adult sons and her mother, who has advanced Alzheimer’s disease. They live together in a home she rents for $1,000 a month.

Her younger son, Isaiah Page, 27, got a minimum-wage job about a year ago stocking shelves at a supermarket, but he is not yet able to contribute to the family’s expenses. His brother, William Page, 33, has been out of work for many years.

With her savings in jeopardy, Ms. Gatewood decided she needed to develop skills for a different career. In March, she enrolled at Grace Institute, a job-training program serving low-income women in New York City. During a recent interview, Ms. Gatewood walked the green-and-white halls of the building in the financial district, her head held high, her pace brisk.

“This is my home away from home,” she said with a smile.

She commuted an hour and a half from Staten Island to Lower Manhattan by train, ferry and CitiBike to attend classes five days a week in professional development and typing. In August, she graduated from the institute, which is affiliated with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. That month, Catholic Charities provided her with $279 from the fund for a suit, shirt, shoes and coat for job interviews.

Last week, Ms. Gatewood started a temporary full-time job at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue, where she works as a room service attendant, filling in for a staff member on leave.

Hilton, when contacted this week for this article, offered to help Ms. Gatewood find a permanent job at one of its other locations in New York City.

Before securing temporary employment, Ms. Gatewood received $425 a week in unemployment benefits. She has many years of hospitality experience, but said she would like to one day work in real estate.

Ms. Gatewood said she wished that she could have spent more time with her sons when they were younger. After her partner left she began waitressing, and the flexible hours allowed her to see her sons off to school and day care. But long shifts kept her out sometimes until 5 a.m., leaving her older son to look after his brother. In 1998, they settled in the Staten Island neighborhood of Park Hill, where they still live today. Ms. Gatewood would occasionally work seven days a week and was not home enough, she said.

She wants her sons to find jobs they are passionate about and make lives for themselves.

“My job as a mother isn’t done,” she said. “I still have to continue to keep them, to assist them, to guide them. I have to fulfill my responsibility to them. If there’s parenting left to be done, you keep doing it. And I’m still going.”",From Serving the Famous at the Waldorf to Starting Over,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/nyregion/from-serving-the-famous-at-the-waldorf-to-starting-over.html

The drop in atmospheric humidity often depletes skin of its moisture, a shift that requires your internal system to work harder to stay hydrated. Firing up the furnace at home doesn’t help matters, explains the New York-based dermatologist Dr. Julie Karen. “Changes in temperature — like going from the cold outdoors to the heated indoors — can aggravate redness,” she says, especially for those dealing with already-sensitive skin or chronic inflammation from eczema and rosacea. Relief, however, is coming in the form of next-generation skin soothers that combine active botanicals with calming agents to counteract the seasonal elements.

To speed healing, start by softening rough spots — delicately. “Gentle exfoliation can allow for better penetration of other ingredients, such as hydrators,” says Dr. Karen. Omorovicza Midnight Radiance Mask cushions salicylic acid with ultra-moisturizing hyaluronic acid and algae extract; the cooling gel should be worn overnight to maximize the time when skin repairs itself. A daily cleanser like May Lindstrom Pendulum Potion, meanwhile, clears pores with anti-inflammatory tamanu oil, replenishing fatty acids, and a spalike application ritual to quiet reactive skin. (Apply four to six pumps into palms and press onto dry skin. Then wet your hands and lightly massage it off.)

Next, prime skin to become more resilient to the forces of nature. True Botanicals Calm Pure Radiance Oil is rich in helichrysum — a plant that’s considered unique among botanists and skin-care enthusiasts for its ability to heal wounds and fight off bacteria that can weaken skin (Dr. Karen says it has potential to be a “hero” ingredient). The potent flower is also found in Tammy Fender’s Intensive Repair Balm Formula No. RB-410, a therapeutic salve with lipids and proteins to help reinforce the skin’s protective outer layer. And for a modern update on the classic oatmeal bath remedy, Pai Instant Calm Redness Serum delivers sea aster and wild oat in a lotion gel to strengthen blood vessels and minimize flushing — no matter the forecast.

A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

The governor’s race, although reminiscent of 2016, hasn’t quite polarized voters to the same extent.

White working-class voters said they backed Mr. Trump by a 48-point margin, 67 percent to 19 percent, somewhat wider than Mr. Gillespie’s 40-point edge.

Mr. Northam holds a 26-point lead among voters from Northern Virginia; voters from that area said they backed Mrs. Clinton by 31 points. It’s a pattern up and down the ballot.

The pattern has also been fairly common beyond Virginia this year. In special congressional elections, Republicans have fallen far short of Mr. Trump’s strong showing in white working-class areas, while Democrats have struggled to exceed Mrs. Clinton’s showing in the areas where she excelled, like Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District.

But the Virginia contest seems to have a distinct dynamic. Mr. Gillespie, with establishment roots as a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has run a campaign plainly intended to rally Mr. Trump’s supporters, making the question of whether he can approach Mr. Trump’s strong tallies somewhat more interesting.

If Mr. Gillespie prevails or runs well ahead of Mr. Trump, it might be interpreted as a sign that establishment Republicans can excel by embracing Mr. Trump’s message. According to this view, they could lure white working-class Trump supporters with his message on race and immigration, while maintaining greater support among well-educated voters with their establishment-friendly credentials and tone.

Even if Mr. Gillespie loses by a small margin, his campaign could be judged a success, given national political conditions and Virginia’s Democratic lean.

Mr. Northam entered the race as a clear if modest favorite. Virginia, with a high percentage of college-educated voters, backed Mrs. Clinton by a five-point margin in November, and the national political environment would seem to be very favorable to a Democrat.

The party out of power has generally won the Virginia governor’s race, and Republicans have struggled in this year’s special elections. Mr. Trump’s approval rating has consistently been in the 30s, and Democrats have a considerable lead on the generic congressional ballot. These conditions are consistent with a so-called wave election, like the ones that swept Democrats into power in the House in 2006 and back out in 2010.

But Mr. Trump’s approval rating was at 39 percent in the Upshot/Siena survey, with his disapproval at 51 percent. These figures are somewhat better for Mr. Trump than those of most other surveys — perhaps in part because this poll tries to capture likely voters in an off-year election, and those voters are considerably older and whiter than the overall adult population.

The poll was sampled from an L2 voter file, and it’s weighted to a likely electorate. It supposes a turnout of around 2.4 million votes, up somewhat from the 2.24 million cast in the 2013 governor’s race. But higher or lower turnout would not necessarily be a clear advantage for either side, according to our results. The Democratic strength among well-educated voters — and the robust Democratic turnout in the primary for this race — gives the party more strength among high-turnout voters than has been the case in recent elections.

About 14 percent of respondents were undecided or refused to answer, while another 2 percent backed the Libertarian candidate Cliff Hyra. The relatively high proportion of undecided voters is partly because the sample includes a large number of less likely voters, who are vastly more likely to be undecided than the likeliest voters. Many public polls sample only frequent voters, or screen their sample down to the likeliest voters. Mr. Northam would have led by three points, 46 to 43, if the sample had counted only voters who were “almost sure” or “very likely” to vote.

How the Poll Has Changed

The poll is the first Upshot/Siena survey since the 2016 presidential election, when polls generally overstated Mrs. Clinton’s support in the decisive battleground states.

Mr. Trump led by four points in our final Florida survey in 2016, and he was tied in our final North Carolina survey.

But the Upshot/Siena survey also had Mrs. Clinton up by seven points in earlier polls of North Carolina and Pennsylvania, taken soon after the third debate, when she still had a wide lead in national and battleground state polls. The apparent shifts over the last few weeks of the race make it more difficult to assess the performance of these surveys.

But a close analysis of last year’s surveys, combined with insights from across the survey industry, has helped inform two initial changes to the Upshot/Siena poll since last November’s election.

First, the poll is weighted by self-reported education to match estimates based on the census’ Current Population Survey. There’s considerable evidence that the failure to weight by education was a major reason state pre-election polls were off the mark, especially in the Rust Belt states.

It’s not so clear that education weighting would have considerably improved the performance of Upshot/Siena surveys. That’s because the Upshot/Siena sample design and weighting scheme was already intended to properly represent low-turnout voters, who tend to be less educated.

The education weight had no effect on the results of this Virginia survey.

Second, we sampled and weighted to a likely electorate, rather than registered voters. Similarly, the modeled turnout score — our estimate for the probability that a voter will turn out, based on past voting record and other measures — now represents 60 percent of our estimate that a respondent will turn out, up from 50 percent in 2016. The remaining 40 percent of the estimate is based on respondents’ answers to several questions about their interest in politics, the coming election and their intention to vote.

Over all, these changes would have eliminated about half of the bias and one-third of the error in our final three surveys in 2016. (That may not be generalizable to other elections.)

Mr. Kushner’s role on China has been similarly circumscribed in recent months. He was pivotal in arranging the first face-to-face meeting between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s Florida estate, in April, which he did through a back channel with China’s ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai.

But Mr. Kushner has taken a lower profile on China since then, in part, officials said, because of concerns about his efforts to lure Chinese investors into his family’s real estate ventures in New York City, as well as his sister’s campaign to attract Chinese money through a visa program that offers American citizenship to foreign investors.

The administration’s decision to leave the economist Peter Navarro off the plane appears to be more about symbolism than protocol.

As director of the White House National Trade Council, Mr. Navarro would not automatically be guaranteed a place on a presidential delegation to Asia. But more than any other White House official, Mr. Navarro is identified with an anti-China stance on trade. His strident writings on the American trade relationship with Beijing — one of his books is titled “Death by China” — won him Mr. Trump’s notice and a job in the administration.

Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist and an ally of Mr. Navarro’s, lobbied to get him a seat on the plane. Leaving Mr. Navarro at home, he has told colleagues, undercuts the president’s talk of confronting China with a tough message on trade.

That may be precisely the point. Mr. Navarro now reports to Mr. Cohn, after a reshuffle engineered by Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly. Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has argued against the most aggressive protectionist moves advocated by Mr. Bannon and Mr. Navarro.

While the White House has talked about pressing China and other Asian countries on trade, it is not asking the Chinese for any major steps during this trip. Administration officials said the White House wanted to avoid accepting incremental measures when it is seeking a more wholesale change in the trade relationship.

Some former officials were disappointed, saying Mr. Trump was squandering an opportunity to use a presidential visit to extract meaningful measures from the Chinese. The president is bringing 29 corporate chief executives to Beijing, and the White House seemed content to roll out a list of billion-dollar deals for American industry.

“If that’s the policy decision, it seems like a missed opportunity,” said Daniel M. Price, who served as President George W. Bush’s economic “sherpa” at summit meetings. “I can’t recall a presidential visit that did not couple the announcement of deals with the securing of additional market access reforms.”

Cutting contentious figures, however, has a long history at the White House. Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter’s national security adviser, once excluded the diplomat Richard C. Holbrooke from a meeting with China’s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, because Mr. Brzezinski feared Mr. Holbrooke’s forceful style would upset him.

Mr. Trump is bringing his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, and the United States trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, on the trip. But Mr. Ross will be present only for the Beijing stop, officials said, and his history with China trade issues is more ambiguous.

While Mr. Ross has pushed for the United States to take a tough line on steel imports by countries from South Korea to Mexico to Germany, he tried to cut a deal with China last summer, under which the Chinese would voluntarily reduce their capacity in steel production. When Mr. Ross presented the agreement to Mr. Trump, he angrily vetoed it, saying he wanted to impose tariffs on countries that export steel to the United States.

Mr. Trump will, however, be backed by a full complement of national security advisers. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson will accompany the president on every stop, as will the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster.

To some analysts, that suggests the White House will make a much stronger argument on mustering regional pressure on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs than on overhauling the trade relationships between Asia and the United States.","The Subtle Messages Sent by Who Is, and Isn’t, Joining Trump in Asia",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/asia/trump-asia-trip-advisers.html

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

Photo

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

Mr. Kushner’s role on China has been similarly circumscribed in recent months. He was pivotal in arranging the first face-to-face meeting between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s Florida estate, in April, which he did through a back channel with China’s ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai.

But Mr. Kushner has taken a lower profile on China since then, in part, officials said, because of concerns about his efforts to lure Chinese investors into his family’s real estate ventures in New York City, as well as his sister’s campaign to attract Chinese money through a visa program that offers American citizenship to foreign investors.

The administration’s decision to leave the economist Peter Navarro off the plane appears to be more about symbolism than protocol.

As director of the White House National Trade Council, Mr. Navarro would not automatically be guaranteed a place on a presidential delegation to Asia. But more than any other White House official, Mr. Navarro is identified with an anti-China stance on trade. His strident writings on the American trade relationship with Beijing — one of his books is titled “Death by China” — won him Mr. Trump’s notice and a job in the administration.

Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist and an ally of Mr. Navarro’s, lobbied to get him a seat on the plane. Leaving Mr. Navarro at home, he has told colleagues, undercuts the president’s talk of confronting China with a tough message on trade.

That may be precisely the point. Mr. Navarro now reports to Mr. Cohn, after a reshuffle engineered by Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly. Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has argued against the most aggressive protectionist moves advocated by Mr. Bannon and Mr. Navarro.

While the White House has talked about pressing China and other Asian countries on trade, it is not asking the Chinese for any major steps during this trip. Administration officials said the White House wanted to avoid accepting incremental measures when it is seeking a more wholesale change in the trade relationship.

Some former officials were disappointed, saying Mr. Trump was squandering an opportunity to use a presidential visit to extract meaningful measures from the Chinese. The president is bringing 29 corporate chief executives to Beijing, and the White House seemed content to roll out a list of billion-dollar deals for American industry.

“If that’s the policy decision, it seems like a missed opportunity,” said Daniel M. Price, who served as President George W. Bush’s economic “sherpa” at summit meetings. “I can’t recall a presidential visit that did not couple the announcement of deals with the securing of additional market access reforms.”

Cutting contentious figures, however, has a long history at the White House. Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter’s national security adviser, once excluded the diplomat Richard C. Holbrooke from a meeting with China’s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, because Mr. Brzezinski feared Mr. Holbrooke’s forceful style would upset him.

Mr. Trump is bringing his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, and the United States trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, on the trip. But Mr. Ross will be present only for the Beijing stop, officials said, and his history with China trade issues is more ambiguous.

While Mr. Ross has pushed for the United States to take a tough line on steel imports by countries from South Korea to Mexico to Germany, he tried to cut a deal with China last summer, under which the Chinese would voluntarily reduce their capacity in steel production. When Mr. Ross presented the agreement to Mr. Trump, he angrily vetoed it, saying he wanted to impose tariffs on countries that export steel to the United States.

Mr. Trump will, however, be backed by a full complement of national security advisers. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson will accompany the president on every stop, as will the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster.

To some analysts, that suggests the White House will make a much stronger argument on mustering regional pressure on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs than on overhauling the trade relationships between Asia and the United States.","The Subtle Messages Sent by Who Is, and Isn’t, Joining Trump in Asia",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/asia/trump-asia-trip-advisers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Do you like movie trivia? Ross Trudeau returns to test our mettle.

Today’s Theme

Four famous lines from well-known movies are offered in the grid, clued with just the titles: Your job is to match them to the actors who said them. Those entries are also part of the theme: CRUISE LINE (59A), for example, is the answer to the SHOW ME THE MONEY (42A) line from “Jerry Maguire.” It’s also a real phrase in its own right, and is clued as “Carnival, say, or a further hint to 42-Across.”

Tricky Clues

6A: Is it GIF with a hard G or a soft G? No one knows for sure, although it’s said that because the G stands for “graphics,” which has a hard G, GIF should be pronounced that way. Either way, surely we have better things to argue about.

13A: “Canine supporters” could be all the wonderful rescue organizations that abound (Like Elayne Boosler’s Tails of Joy), but today we’re talking teeth, so the answer is GUMS.

30A: Get to know your hockey moves! A DEKE, which is a fake-out on the ice, comes up every now and then and is worth knowing.

71A: Nice wordplay! “What I may turn into” is not really about Mr. Trudeau morphing into something. It’s about what the word “I” could become, and that’s the ROYAL WE.

17D: TIL that “metathesiophobia” is the fear of CHANGE. And I hope it stays that way.

Constructor Notes

A couple thoughts: 1. ""Going Off Script” includes four white actors. Moreover, the SHOW ME THE MONEY line was also spoken by Cuba Gooding Jr., a black actor who goes uncredited in this puzzle (despite upstaging Tom Cruise). 2. “Going Off Script” also comprises four male actors. The original version did include WOODLINE/I FEEL PRETTY OH SO PRETTY, which got axed because it yielded asymmetric themers. But then again, Natalie Wood, an American with Russian parents, was cast to play Maria, a Puerto Rican. Dios. Aside from Ms. Wood, I only found revealers that referenced white males (PENNLINE, CRYSTALLINE, SHORTLINE), let alone ones that matched with legitimately iconic movie quotes. So, open question: If Hollywood’s gender/race representation problem means that, after an honest effort, you only can find white male actors for your ___LINE puzzle, do you scrap it? Is doing otherwise cynical and opportunistic? Is the choice mitigated if you subsequently construct an UZI GAL GODOT puzzle? (Very interested in collaborating on that puzzle. Let’s chat.)

But he acknowledges that Republicans must produce a victory for antsy constituents after Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

“We won the election, and now we have an obligation to make good on our word and make good on our principles and make good on the things we said we would do to help people,” he said, “and this is time to deliver.”

As he spoke of the tax proposal, Mr. Ryan, the former head of both the tax-writing and budget committees, seemed energized by the challenge. But a speaker can’t will a proposal into law. It takes votes. And some Republicans quickly peeled away, joining in opposition expressed by influential and often Republican-aligned trade groups such as the National Association of Home Builders and the National Association of Realtors.

Those groups expressed alarm that proposals to cap the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000 and end the ability to deduct state and local income taxes could rattle the housing industry and drive up expenses for those in higher-tax states. Other interest groups are expected to dig in against a plan that eliminates a wide variety of popular deductions from medical and moving expenses to the cost of having taxes done by a professional.

Mr. Ryan said that the interest groups were just protecting their privileged rank in the tax hierarchy and that lawmakers would have to look beyond such narrow considerations.

“Tax reform is really hard because we’re taking on myriad special interest provisions and groups,” said Mr. Ryan, noting that such clashes are a primary reason efforts to reconfigure the tax code have failed since 1986. “The special interests that protect the current code of the status quo have successfully managed to overwhelm the general welfare of the country.”

Mr. Ryan will very likely have to steer his tax plan to approval with no help from Democrats, who view the Republican proposal as far too weighted toward big business and the wealthy while doing far too little for the middle class to justify adding as much as $1.5 trillion in red ink. It is yet another example of the partisan divide that has contributed to years of Washington dysfunction.

Mr. Ryan believes passage of a tax plan that produces the promised economic benefits could have a much broader impact and help ease the nation’s political divisiveness.

“I think one of the reasons we’re a polarized, high-anxiety country is because we’ve had pretty flat economic growth and pretty flat opportunity,” he said. “Most people haven’t got a pay increase. Most people, half the people in this country, live paycheck to paycheck, so there’s a lot of economic anxiety. And I think just one of the key solutions is faster economic growth, more jobs. And I think the best thing we could do to deliver that is tax reform.”

In achieving success, Mr. Ryan will need to work hand-in-hand with President Trump, who yearns for a tax cut victory as much as Mr. Ryan does. The speaker has had a complicated relationship with the president, a man he barely knew before the campaign, beginning with Mr. Ryan’s decision at the conclusion of the primary season to temporarily withhold his support from the presumptive nominee.

Now his decision to regularly back the president and not chastise him for various perceived unpresidential acts has drawn Mr. Ryan scorn from those who think he should follow the example of his friend and former Republican House colleague, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and condemn the president’s conduct. Mr. Ryan disagrees.

“I don’t see why we would want to start a circular firing squad in our party when we have an opportunity that’s almost a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to make a big change for people’s lives,” he said, breaking with Mr. Flake. “That’s not what people voted us in to do, is scream and yell and call each other out and, you know, get into these shouting matches. They elected us to fix their problems, not grouse about, you know, personality differences.”

Mr. Ryan is heading into a 2018 midterm election in which Republicans are predicted to lose seats and see their majority shrink, if not disappear. The outcome of the tax fight is certain to influence events.

The new proposal will undergo changes as it makes its way through Congress. If those revisions aren’t enough to secure passage and win public appreciation, it may be House Republicans and their leader who are in store for big changes of their own.

From the moment Woody Harrelson swaggers into “LBJ,” you can see the glinting intelligence and hear the thudding heartbeat that he brings to the title character. It couldn’t have been easy. He’s nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy — an actor’s landscape — while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson, a transitional, still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions. This was, history tells us, a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, a president who declared an “unconditional war” on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam.

Video

Only some of that history makes it into this disappointing movie, which tracks Johnson’s road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency, an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nation’s healer after John F. Kennedy’s death. It’s a near-miraculous, compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky. One moment it’s 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next, he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office.

Mr. Harrelson makes Johnson an almost predictably entertaining force, and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether he’s barnstorming through politics, slamming down phones, lobbing obscenities, braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier. He’s fun to watch despite the facial makeup, which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasn’t thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in “Point Break.” It’s a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him. I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Lady Bird, only when she started talking.

Directed by Rob Reiner from Joey Hartstone’s script, “LBJ” is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelson’s talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity. Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang, but he’s booming in a vacuum. Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary. That’s too bad, especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies — “Selma,” “Jackie,” “Marshall” — that, both directly and obliquely, speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s.

Taken together, these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black, female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history. They represent, onscreen and off, the very changes that they narrate. With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters, “LBJ” doesn’t look all that different from most other great-man stories. Yet there are moments — Johnson conspiring with a racist power broker played by an excellent Richard Jenkins — when the filmmakers seem ready to shake up the story by laying white, male power bare in all its ugliness.

“The market mix has also changed in the past five years,” he said. Demand for aftermarket car wheels is down, but sales of truck and sport-utility wheels are up 30 percent, he said.

At 72, John Nordquist, a real estate manager in Chicago, is always going for the right look. With five cars and trucks in his family, including a 1978 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1995 Chevy pickup, he buys wheels the way that some people buy sneakers.

Mr. Nordquist has 20 wheels on the road, plus spares, and at least another set of wheels and tires for each vehicle, usually going up in size for the replacements.

“When you’re over 70, it’s O.K. to look cool,” he said. “I want my cars to look just a little different than the run of the mill.”

Wheel aficionados — from classic car enthusiasts and dedicated racers to off-roaders — can choose from a dizzying array of looks and brands. And they don’t necessarily have to leave the showroom to do it. Most original equipment manufacturers, or O.E.M.s, offer customers upgraded wheel choices — larger rims, different colors, sexier designs — when they order the car.

“More often than not, buyers ask about the wheels on a new car,” said Peter Fearon, a sales consultant at Helms Brothers Mercedes-Benz in Queens.

Ordering upgraded wheels has broad appeal. “While men are interested in doing that, many women are as well,” Mr. Fearon said. A 2018 C Class sedan, for example, can be ordered with one of six optional wheel sets, ranging in size from 17 inches to 19 inches.

They can be a visible indicator of premium status when a new car rolls off the lot.

“Wheels are a key differentiator for AMG and play a major role in the purchase decisions of our customers,” said Melina Evangelisti, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz’s AMG performance division. AMG’s in-house engineers, like those at many carmakers, design the wheels for its vehicles and buy them from suppliers like OZ, Borbet and Enkei.

Aluminum alloys have replaced steel as the material of choice, making wheels lighter and reducing a vehicle’s unsprung weight — the mass of its suspension components. Less unsprung weight, particularly in the wheels, is better: A heavier wheel is harder to get going and harder to stop once it is.

“That impacts the efficiency as well as the performance of the car,” Mr. Edmonds said.

Dropping weight at the corners is crucial for racecars, and the quest to shave seconds off lap times has led engineers to use new materials, like forged magnesium and carbon fiber, which uses lightweight carbon fabric and special plastic resins to make feather-light wheels. Ford has developed carbon fiber wheels for its GT, and Porsche this summer introduced a set for its 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series that it claims are 20 percent stronger and lighter than normal forged alloys. The price in Europe for a set of four? Just under $18,000.

Mr. Donnelly may love wheels, but he’s not sold on carbon fiber, yet.

“Magnesium is proven for racing, for O.E.M. and the aftermarket, but carbon fiber doesn’t have enough history yet in the marketplace,” he said. “That will change rapidly. Resins will get better — they have a heat issue now — and the weave of the material will advance. And the price points will come down.”

Buyers have reason to be cautious. While federal and state safety standards can be exhaustive for cars and S.U.V.s, there are none that are enforced in the United States for wheels, Mr. Donnelly said.

“Germany and Japan have government regulations that require aftermarket wheels to meet certain quality standards and fit a vehicle correctly,” he said.

That can make picking replacement wheels a tricky affair.

“You have to start with the vehicle,” said Mr. Edmonds, the Tire Rack executive. “By doing that, you know what some of the technical specs have to be — not just the diameter and width, but also the bolt pattern, the offset, the load-carrying capacity of that wheel.”

And then there are practical considerations. “If you’re going to run those wheels in the winter, they need a finish that’s durable and will handle the salt and the chemicals on the road,” he said. “And the wheel needs to clear everything that’s behind it, like the brakes and the suspension components.”

The Tire Rack uses digital scanning equipment to create a three-dimensional model of the wheels it sells as well as the pieces behind them on specific vehicles.

“We can virtually fit the wheel on the car and ensure it will clear everything,” Mr. Edmonds said.

For drivers who consider their car little more than an appliance, any rim will do. But for some, a wheel purchase is simply an exercise in expression.

“You have the people who want the vehicle to reflect themselves,” said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “We women notice jewelry, earrings.

Jill Filipovic What Donald Trump Thinks It Takes to Be a Man Image Credit Illustration by Joan Wong; Photograph by Damon Winter/The New York Times

Donald Trump is a new kind of old-school American man. In some ways, he’s a throwback to days when authority and power were exclusively white and male by definition, when displays of masculine entitlement were overt and unapologetic. But he’s also a thoroughly modern man-child, the kind of overgrown adolescent you expect to find on internet forums dedicated to video games or anti-feminism: a tweeter of juvenile threats, a crass name-caller, an id unrestrained. Trump-style masculinity, in other words, is less John Wayne and more Tucker Max — and a revealing insight into American male anxiety.

American manhood is reshaping itself in two opposing directions, and both archetypes are ones we’ve never seen before. If Barack Obama embodied the new ideal of the progressive man — a hands-on dad and a self-identified feminist married to a high-achieving woman who was once his boss, who is also well mannered and protective of his family — then Mr. Trump is his antithesis, an old-school chauvinist embracing a new code of adolescent anarchy. He is a paradigm of feckless male entitlement, embracing male power while abnegating the traditional masculine requirements of chivalry, courtesy and responsibility.

Almost a year ago, he won the presidential election by presenting this version of aggrieved manhood in opposition to Hillary Clinton’s hand-raising Hermione Granger feminism. White American men loved it.

This happened while, in homes across America, the Obama model of manhood had increasingly taken root. Yes, powerful men do abuse their positions to extract sexual services from women or to remind us that no matter how mighty and successful we are, we can be reduced to simple objects of predatory male sexuality. The past few weeks have been a stark reminder that these abuses don’t fall along partisan lines, with the Harvey Weinstein revelations and stories across industries and continents still unfolding in their wake.

Most men also continue to fall short when it comes to household responsibilities, and men still tend to out-earn women. But, in much of America, men’s and women’s lives look more similar than they ever have: Women do more work for pay, and men do more care work than they previously have done. Feminists have insisted that women and men alike can and should embody the characteristics we positively associate with both masculinity (power, respect, dependability, providing) and femininity (caregiving, devotion, compassion), and many of our lives have crept closer to this ideal.

To Mr. Trump and many of his increasingly nihilistic supporters, this is a threat to their fantasy of masculinity. We could have guessed that men who believe in gender equality would do more housework than men with conservative views, and it is not news that white conservative men overwhelmingly vote Republican. What is different from generations before is that many of the men making up Mr. Trump’s base are less attached to the institutions that offered respect and required responsibility — unions, church, marriage, school, even independent living. In the face of women’s success, many of them have fallen behind on adult obligations and fallen back on misogyny.

Many of these men now seek community online. Mr. Trump knows how to speak to them, and he adopted the modern man-child’s medium. When he tweets insults about the stature of those who challenge him — “Liddle Bob Corker” and “Little Marco” Rubio — he’s not just emasculating his tormentors by suggesting that manly authority is tied to height (although he’s doing that, too); he’s adopting the ad hominem rhetorical tactics that are a staple of angry men on Twitter and Reddit.

Today, young women are more likely to attend college than young men, while young men are more likely to live with their parents, and it’s not only student loan debt that’s driving them home. Economic shifts that have decreased employment in blue-collar jobs but increased opportunity in female-dominated sectors have had a psychic as well as financial impact. Care jobs are not jobs men are generally willing to take, in part because of the depressed pay, but also because of social constraints: Nursing, elder care and child care are women’s work.

A desire to reclaim this psychic masculinity is why Mr. Trump fetishizes a specific (and specifically white) kind of rough-hewed American maleness while embodying an envy-inducing lack of obligation. The white working men of Trump speeches have the kind of dirty-fingernail jobs so revered in the American imagination: coal miners, firefighters, autoworkers. In real life, more Trump voters work in cubicles than in coal mines. But the point was never Mr. Trump’s understanding of reality. It was his grasp of white male aspiration and identity.

Mr. Trump’s own life and actions paint an appealing picture of masculine entitlement for those who want power without the shackles of responsibility. He may not be the smartest or most qualified guy in just about any room, but his money allowed him to marry and reproduce with a succession of models, star in a reality television show, live in vulgar gold-plated glory, say whatever offensive thing danced through his brain and still make a successful run for president. It was a plus that in the three Trump marriages, there have been no “power couple” partnerships of equals, just Mr. Trump on “The Howard Stern Show” talking about his wife’s breasts and bragging that he never changed a diaper.

Most American men are unable to actually achieve this level of authority minus accountability; as a result, admiration for men like Mr. Trump gets paired with an “if I can’t have it, no one can” nihilism. White male power remains a dominant force in America, but it is no longer the only force that matters. For many men, this is not a leveling of the playing field, but a plundering of what was rightly theirs.

Resentful of the changing order of things, some men have simply leaned in to chaos: If the system no longer serves them, it will at least be fun to blow it all up. Which is exactly why the old rules of political engagement don’t work with Mr. Trump or his base.

The president is a perfect figurehead for this bizarre moment: a man who carries all of the negative characteristics of stereotypical masculinity while adopting almost none of the virtues, occupying the most powerful and exclusively male seat of power in the nation (and perhaps in the world), who ascended in large part because a yawning fear of female power kept one of the best-qualified candidates in history out of office. He is ego unchecked, narcissism in place of dignity.

In a 1961 essay for Vogue , Joan Didion wrote that people with “self-respect have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things.” The piece went on to say, “In brief, people with self-respect exhibit a certain toughness, a kind of moral nerve; they display what was once called character .” Character, she wrote, is “the willingness to accept responsibility for one’s own life.”

Our current president, who can’t even accept responsibility for his own social media use or admit that all-caps tweeting might suggest he’s angry about continuing criminal investigations and low poll numbers, may indeed be a new low. Mr. Trump has ushered in a fresh era of noxious manhood wherein bullying is conflated with toughness and self-interest is more important than self-respect. But all is not lost. Every generation believes it is uniquely observing diminishing standards of behavior, even while by most measures, life improves. Plenty of American men are doing exactly the opposite of Mr. Trump and embracing the more productive characteristics of masculinity while rejecting the malicious ones. And the virtues of self-respect — toughness, moral nerve, character — have never been, unlike the presidency, male-only business.

Structured as a call and response between eight of his most significant articles and briefer, more personal essays arranged by year, Coates gives us something between a mixtape and a Künstlerroman, demonstrating how he came to dominate the nonfiction genre. Even without the framing of the lively if clipped “this is what I was doing that year” portions, we can see Coates’s growing power and prowess from the progression of the pieces themselves. Picking up steam with “Why Do So Few Blacks Study the Civil War?” from February 2012, Coates is in full command by the time we reach “Fear of a Black President,” an essay that captures the Obama that many are nostalgic for and others continue to rage against.

In “Fear of a Black President,” Coates offers a cleareyed assessment of the racism that limited what the 44th president could say. After the shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida, Coates reminds us, the initial popular reaction was mournful and respectful — it was only after Obama offered the mildest of identifications with the dead child (“If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon”) that negative responses flooded the airways. White people posted pictures of themselves “Trayvoning”: wearing hoodies and pretending to be dead with a package of Skittles. Rather than ushering in a post-racial paradise, Coates writes, the election of Obama became a rallying cry for racists and “effectively racialized white Americans’ views, even of health care policy.” The fear has now become a formula, and “Fear of a Black President,” which was published in the fall of 2012, now feels like both prophecy and jeremiad. (A small criticism: The book doesn’t clearly provide these original publication dates in the text itself, making the exact timing hard to parse.)

In Coates’s essays from the early years of the Obama administration, he regularly identifies a conservatism that black culture often aligns with but that outsiders find hard to name. There is, in fact, another unrealized book here, one in which Coates would have traced this tradition as he started to in an early essay on Bill Cosby. Thankfully he didn’t — instead, the prologues introducing each year often serve as retrospectives, letting him amend the record; with Cosby, Coates says he should have made more of “the torrent of rape allegations that swirled around him even then,” missing a chance to point out the hypocrisy of Cosby’s moralizing “call-outs” about the black community. Coates senses a strain of “the organic black conservative tradition” in both Malcolm X and Obama, calling the former president “a conservative revolutionary” and comparing him to Booker T. Washington. This feels a bit too simplistic. In reality Obama complicates any genealogy of radicals or reactionaries, just as Coates rewrites the narrative of being a public intellectual.

At the start of Coates’s own “two terms,” he is writing in Harlem while living check to check, hoping to give his young family stability; by the following year, he has been invited to attend the Aspen Ideas Festival. The leap seems both unexplained and now inevitable, with the book’s episodic form letting Coates gloss over such gaps. Still, the emotional journey he does detail feels real, and realized. “It is, I think, the very chaos of America that allowed me to prosper,” he writes in “Notes From the Eighth Year.” “I suspect, though I do not know, that the lack of both ceilings and safety nets is how we got a black president. I suspect it is how, at least for these eight years, I came to thrive.”

Always passionate, the essays grow increasingly precise. With “Why Do So Few Blacks Study the Civil War?” Coates found not so much his subject as a language for it. He starts to quote historians to show where we’ve been; makes regular reference to Reconstruction and the regression and receding of the American dream; invokes the demonization of “super-predators” and Sistah Souljah — all with elegance and insight. His is one of the chorus of voices (following, I’d argue, those of our poets) critiquing not only American nostalgia, both black and white, but the very notion of progress.

It is the record of his struggle as a writer that is of great interest here. As in Baldwin, the struggle of the writing dovetails with the struggle of the race. This becomes clearest in his 2014 essay “The Case for Reparations,” which became Coates’s calling card, and rightly so: It provides a remarkable pocket history of the financial toll of white supremacy, from disenfranchisement to land grabs to redlining, offering a harrowing account of the economic injustices imposed on African-Americans. Framed by one man’s moving from Mississippi to Chicago during the Great Migration only to encounter the same-old systematic shafting in what we used to call “Up South,” it isn’t cross-burning but the slow burn of oppression that makes the blood boil. Compelling and compulsory, “The Case for Reparations” is as convincing in its restraint and pacing as it is in its depth of research and recognition of black humanity. Even if readers don’t see their own families, as I did, in the tales of the Federal Housing Administration’s discriminatory practices or the “kleptocracy” of black-owned land “taken through means ranging from legal chicanery to terrorism,” we can see the forms of injustice that persist and speak to basic rights: Where can one live? Indeed, who gets to live?

“Racism is not merely a simplistic hatred,” Coates points out. “It is, more often, broad sympathy toward some and broader skepticism toward others.” He also highlights the effect of racist policies on the polity — and just how “plunder in the past made plunder in the present efficient,” affecting everything from subprime mortgages to mandatory minimum sentencing. This story is now one that others are telling more fully — books like Carol Anderson’s “White Rage” and Ibram X. Kendi’s “Stamped From the Beginning” help detail the history of reactions to and restrictions of black advances — yet few have done it more succinctly than Coates, or with more power: “What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts. What is needed is a healing of the American psyche and the banishment of white guilt.”

Obama remains an important foil for Coates, one he fruitfully returns to with “My President Was Black,” a feature begun before the 2016 election (and published after) that shows Coates’s new status — he is now a regular enough White House visitor that he scores an extensive interview — while foreshadowing the ways both men underestimated the opposition, if for different reasons. To Coates, and to many, Obama “became a symbol of black people’s everyday, extraordinary Americanness”; but where Obama’s blindness to Trump’s electoral victory stems, Coates believes, from Obama’s essential optimism, for Coates, any unseeing came from a well-earned pessimism: “I was shocked at my own shock.”

The election of President Obama inspired not only Coates but, as he points out, “a crop of black writers and journalists who achieved prominence during his two terms.” The undeniable black renaissance in poetry and cinema, from documentaries like “I Am Not Your Negro” to horror films like “Get Out,” has been met by fellow adventurers in the essay, from Teju Cole to Jesmyn Ward to Kiese Laymon to Roxane Gay. Obama also embodies a phrase that might serve as an alternative subtitle of “Eight Years,” since it appears so often: Being Twice as Good. This phrase is simultaneously the injunction black families have had to give their progeny in a world redlined against them, while also being the very idea that Coates examines as an unjust “double standard.” It is this double standard, he argues, that brought about President Trump: “Barack Obama delivered to black people the hoary message that in working twice as hard as white people, anything is possible. But Trump’s counter is persuasive — work half as hard as black people and even more is possible.”

As Coates turns the heat lower, his brilliance cooks more evenly — and more urgently. Never is this more true than in “The First White President,” his recent cover story for the Atlantic. The essay, presented here as an epilogue, manages to be as bloodless as it is blistering. Coates rebukes those on the left who try to pawn Trump off “as a product of the white working class as opposed to a product of an entire whiteness that includes the very authors doing the pawning.” To Coates, Trump’s “ideology is white supremacy in all of its truculent and sanctimonious power”; to pretend otherwise is to treat “white labor as noble archetype, and black labor as something else.”

If there’s anything to critique in Coates, it is that for him black autobiography — the story black folks tell themselves and sometimes others — is chiefly trauma. There is another, blues-based tradition, embodied by the likes of the poet Lucille Clifton or Zora Neale Hurston — an ethos that is often as Southern, countrified and womanist as Coates’s vision is Northern, urban and male — which, while forgoing easy optimism, sees black life as a secret pleasure, or at least sees joy, however hard-earned, as “an act of resistance.” (The depiction of joy is from the poet Toi Derricotte; Clifton used to inscribe her books with “Joy!,” which I always took not as balm but challenge.) Coates means to address this when he says that black cultural identity offers “the balm for such trauma,” yet he insists “it is incredibly hard to be a full participant in the world of cultural identity without experiencing the trauma of racial identity.” Hurston would offer something else: “Even in the helter-skelter skirmish that is my life, I have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation more or less. No, I do not weep at the world — I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.” Her declaration, suffused with a blues aesthetic, even rhymes.

For Coates, his tragic view is usefully defiant: “Our story is a tragedy. I know it sounds odd, but that belief does not depress me. It focuses me.” Coates’s book brings us to a boil, then lets us simmer, and anyone who wants to know who we are — and where we are now — must sit with him for a good while. “Eight Years” confirms why Coates is enjoying his extended moment, while also pulling back the curtain on all the hard work that preceded and produced his success. It should inspire us as writers, and as Americans, that he urges us, in exile or online, to become better — or at least clearer on why we’re not.",Between the Presidency and Him,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/books/review/we-were-eight-years-in-power-ta-nehisi-coates-essays-memoir.html

It’s their job to try to see things clearly. Often, what they see in their workplaces is low salaries, inept management and poor communication — ills that plague many workplaces across America. For more than two years now, online media outlets have been unionizing as a way to make our industry better. This week, we learned just how horrifying some rich people find the idea of employees coming together to improve their workplace.

Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, is worth more than $2 billion. He is the owner of DNAinfo, a local news site that covered New York City and Chicago with unparalleled skill, as well as Gothamist, a network of city-oriented websites that DNAinfo bought this year. He is also a major right-wing political donor of rather flexible morality. During the last presidential primaries, Mr. Ricketts spent millions of dollars funding ads that portrayed Donald Trump as an untrustworthy, dangerous misogynist. Once Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Mr. Ricketts spent a million dollars to support him.

One might think that such flexibility would allow Mr. Ricketts to bend but not break when faced with every plutocrat’s worst nightmare: a few dozen modestly paid employees who collectively bargain for better working conditions.

Alas, no.

Six months ago, reporters and editors at DNAinfo-Gothamist announced their intent to join the Writers Guild of America, East. This is the union that my colleagues and I at Gawker Media joined in 2015, and the union that has organized major online media companies like HuffPost, Vice Media, Slate and Thrillist in the past two years. In that short amount of time, unionized “new media” workers have won substantial raises, editorial protections and other improvements that writers at more mature companies take for granted. In defiance of the conventional wisdom that unions are outdated, this young, high-tech industry has been one of the most visible recent successes for organized labor in America.

The DNAinfo-Gothamist announcement sparked a zealous anti-union campaign: Management threatened employees by saying that Joe Ricketts might shut the whole place down if it unionized. Nevertheless, employees last week voted 25-2 in favor of unionization. And on Thursday, Mr. Ricketts abruptly shut the whole place down.

It is worth being clear about exactly what happened here, so that no one gets too smug. DNAinfo was never profitable, but Mr. Ricketts was happy to invest in it for eight years, praising its work all along. Gothamist, on the other hand, was profitable, and a fairly recent addition to the company. One week after the New York team unionized, Mr. Ricketts shut it all down. He did not try to sell the company to someone else. Instead of bargaining with 27 unionized employees in New York City, he chose to lay off 115 people across America.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The fact that Trump has tried to govern as more of a conventional conservative than a populist is probably one reason the core now supports him so steadfastly. By letting Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have their way (however unsuccessfully) on policy detail, he’s weakened any appeal to the center he once had, but also sealed partisan loyalties and protected his right flank. The same goes for his promise-keeping, to date, with his religious-conservative supporters: Churchgoing evangelicals, in particular, were quite skeptical of his primary campaign, but now they seem to have accepted a transactional relationship, telling themselves “in Pence we trust.”

But the biggest reason for Trump’s support from core Republicans is likely the simple pull of partisanship. When he wasn’t yet the face of the party, they found various principled and practical reasons to oppose him. But now that he’s their Republican president, all those doubts seem irrelevant, and identifying as a partisan means identifying with him.

This is a difficult environment in which to imagine a primary challenger flourishing. Indeed, it leaves the most common type of anti-Trump Republican politician, the Jeff Flake sort who imagine themselves the tribunes of a more principled and ideologically-consistent conservatism, without any obvious constituency at all — since the supposedly principled and ideologically-consistent conservative voters are now the heart of Trump’s support.

I still think somebody should primary the president, both as a protest against his unfitness and a means of beginning the necessary debate within the party about how its future leaders — the Tom Cotton-Nikki Haley ticket, or the Ivanka-Rubio Duumvirate — might make conservatism great again.

But no rising figure in the G.O.P. is likely to consider sacrificing their career to make a protest or start an intellectual debate — leaving the task to retirees and elder statesmen, to a Flake or a Bob Corker or a John Kasich or even a Mitt Romney. And there is every reason to think that most of them would demur as well, and that the inevitable challenger will look more like the third party challengers of 2016 — an Evan McMullin or a Gary Johnson, or some foolhardy NeverTrump pundit drafted into the lists.

However: It would also be a mistake to assume that the present environment will necessarily persist — that because Trump has held Republicans thus far there is nothing that could shake his 38 percent support. George W. Bush was bonded to the G.O.P. base by partisanship and wartime leadership and shared religious values and his approval still sank to the 20s when events turned sharply against his presidency. Trump does not have nearly as far to fall as Bush, some of his support is soft, he has already lost seven points off his January 2016 approval ratings, and neither war nor economic crisis have really tested him as yet.

What might weaken him further? An economic slowdown. An overseas debacle too significant to be explained away by Fox’s talking heads. The indictment of a family member. A botched nomination the next time a Supreme Court vacancy occurs. Something strange and Trumpy, that cannot yet be foreseen.

Partisanship and incumbency being what they are, even with approval ratings in the twenties Trump would still be the favorite to win his party’s nomination. But the possibilities for a challenger would widen, and so might the list of possible contenders.

Such a contender, though, would need to be shrewd as well as bold. Various obvious lines of attack against Trump are ill-suited for a primary assault. He’s not an ideological conservative was tried and found conspicuously wanting in ’16. Pious attacks on his moral failings, however justified, are likely to also feel like indictments of his voters — whose backing a primary challenger would need to win. And absent something dispositive from Robert Mueller, going all-in on the Russia scandals would link a challenger too closely to the Democrats.

Instead, a primary campaign would need to be waged more in sorrow than in anger, accusing Trump of broken promises, lamenting his administration’s inability to legislate, and promising to carry on certain parts of his agenda (judges, above all) but with more competence and tact. The challenger would need to criticize Trump from the ideological right on some issues, but also reach out to more populist Republicans, especially from Pew’s “Market Skeptic” category, by asking why his infrastructure bill never happened, why his tax cuts haven’t done more for the middle class, why he isn’t doing more to stop outsourcing and bring back the coal industry and so on down the list of (yes, always-implausible) broken promises. And then instead of accusing Trump of being a racist or misogynist or authoritarian (as true as those accusations may be), the challenger would simply lament that after pledging to drain the morass of Washington the president let his administration be taken over by swamp creatures.

The goal would be to create a permission structure for wavering Republican voters, the sort who dislike Trump’s Twitter feed and fret a little about the nuclear codes and say they “somewhat” rather than “strongly” approve of him, but thanking him for waging war on Washington and then moving on to a more competent alternative.

Which also means that such a campaign would make the most sense coming from outside Washington, rather than from one of the senators who have opposed or criticized or resisted Trump to date. It would be a plausible fit, especially, for a governor whose chances in a crowded 2024 field might be quite dim, giving him a good reason to take a risk in ’20 — but who is not strongly identified with anti-Trump politics right now, and who would be taken seriously as a vehicle for Republicans who want to turn the page.

The liberation of Raqqa, Syria, the Islamic State’s final stronghold, has severely weakened the group as a military threat. But as its members slink off the battlefield to melt into local populations or infiltrate nations in Europe, Africa and around the world, they leave a region in ruins and an almost impossible challenge for the United States.

And American leaders seem to have no clear plan to manage this instability or to capitalize on their military success.

One big concern is the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan, which until recently was Iraq’s anchor. Today its future, and that of a unified Iraq, is in doubt. That’s because of an independence referendum in September that was pushed through by Masoud Barzani, then the Kurdish leader, despite warnings from Iraq’s central government, Turkey, Iran and the United States — the Kurds’ main ally — that the vote could lead to Iraq’s dissolution, undermine the anti-ISIS fight and widen divisions even among Kurdish factions.

She helped during the recent Alfred Angelo closing. “If a bride had a receipt for a deposit from Angelo and found a dress in my inventory, I gave her an extra discount,” Ms. Jon said.

Many others will do the same.

Different Brand, Same Look

The manager of a store can give you the name of the wholesale sales representative the store works with for the dress you are looking for. Ask the wholesale rep to help locate the dress you want. The wholesaler may have recently shipped inventory to stores not on your radar.

Misty Cushing, a bride-to-be in Las Vegas, had ordered a dress last summer in Ohio (where her family lives) for her March 2018 wedding. She lost the dress in the Alfred Angelo closure but did get her deposit back. She then bought a similar dress by a different manufacturer (Morilee) at a store in Las Vegas.

“The entire bridal industry stepped up,” she said. “The original store credited my deposit back to my credit card; I had a photo of the dress with me to show the store in Las Vegas. They found a Morilee dress that almost matched my original choice. The bridal shops really try to make brides happy. It’s an art that’s been lost on our society.”

Morilee sold her the wedding dress at a 20 percent discount because she had her deposit receipt. And, Mitchel Udell, an owner of Morilee said even though there is usually a rush charge for a bride who needs her dress quickly, “we waived the rush charge for anyone caught in the closing.”

Jillian Forsberg is the sales manager at the Dress Gallery, a 6,000-square-foot store in Wichita, Kan., that dresses 1,500 brides a year. “We’ve had other designers go out of business but never anything on the scale of the Alfred Angelo closing,” she said. “We still had some Angelo dresses in our stock and we were able to sell the exact ones to about five girls who contacted us from all over the country.” They sold them at wholesale if a deposit receipt was shown.

Once the designer goes out of business, the samples already in stores are of no use, she explained, since these dresses have been tried on and are not new. The Dress Gallery shipped dresses all over the country to people who could use such samples, she said.

When Alfred Angelo went out of business, David’s Bridal, another national chain of dress stores, gave 30 percent discounts toward a new gown, also waiving the usual rush fee (with proof of deposit).

SYDNEY, Australia — Visitors to Uluru, a giant sandstone slab jutting from the central Australian desert, have for decades ignored a sign at the rock’s base that politely reads: “Please don’t climb.”

On Wednesday, the board members of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, which manages the popular site also known as Ayers Rock, said they would soon stop requesting that hikers respect the landmark. Instead, they will demand it.

Beginning in 2019, climbing Uluru, which is considered sacred to the region’s indigenous Anangu people, will be banned, the board said.

“It is an extremely important place,” said Sammy Wilson, an Indigenous community representative who sits on the park’s board and is what is known as a traditional owner. Uluru, he said, is “not a theme park like Disneyland.”

It’s a good question to ask when planning a menu. The original New World Thanksgiving dinner — a several-days-long feast — was lavish, but it is likely that green vegetables were not abundant.

Gourds, melons, pumpkins and squashes were the vegetables of choice, or carrots and parsnips grown from seed brought by the settlers. Dried native corn was ground, and either baked into cakes or cooked for porridge. Berries and other wild fruits such as plums, gooseberries and grapes were much appreciated.

But mostly there was game to eat, and plenty of it. Wild turkeys and pheasants, ducks, geese and swans were spit-roasted, as was a vast supply of venison. Cod and lobster were plentiful. Shellfish was abundant, too; huge coastal beds were stacked with oysters, clams and mussels, just waiting to be plucked.

Over centuries, the Thanksgiving menu has changed. Giant turkeys and hams now dominate the meal, and vegetables have more real estate on the sideboard. In many respects, however, the repertoire has remained the same — somewhat bland and soft. We put forth mashed potatoes, soggy peas, green-bean casserole, creamed onions, marshmallow-topped canned sweet potatoes and bread stuffing. Salads are shunned by many Thanksgiving cooks. (With exceptions, of course.)

I get it. Nostalgia makes us, myself included, crave these dull and mellow accompaniments. Even so, I’m usually inclined to tinker just a little. I monkey around with the bird’s seasoning, and, for the vegetables, I want some bright flavors and colors to contrast with the generally monochromatic basics. I always turn my cranberries into spicy chutney, for instance. This year, I’m playing with basic vegetables like carrots, cauliflower and brussels sprouts.

Mashed carrots may bring baby food to mind, or a fancy French purée, but these “smashed” ones are something else, and they have texture. Add the salty tang of feta cheese and lots of chopped fresh mint, and the carrots’ sweetness becomes a playful partner in a new scheme.

“Alias Grace” is a story about storytelling — one character compares Grace with Scheherazade — which makes Ms. Gadon essential to its success. She is mesmerizing. She plays Grace convincingly as a timid child and a toughened inmate, and she brings both of them to Grace’s wary testimony.

The novel by Ms. Atwood (who has a bit part as “Disapproving Woman”) is a challenge to adapt visually. It’s as internal and retrospective as “Handmaid’s” is propulsive, though both protagonists are slyly defiant. The screenwriter, Sarah Polley (who adapted a story from the Canadian author Alice Munro into the film “Away from Her”), turns it into a sinuous, layered script that is constantly aware of what is being said, to whom and why.

Mary Harron (“I Shot Andy Warhol”) directs the series dynamically. In an early sequence, Grace’s meditates on the curious phrase “celebrated murderess” over quick cuts of the crime — a body tumbling to the floor, a strip of cloth tightening around a throat.

For all that, “Alias Grace” isn’t overly brutal. It’s an exquisitely woven fabric with blood staining the corners. The violence is often in the language, as when a servant woman describes a death scene — the result of an illegal abortion — as smelling like a butcher shop.

You could almost mistake the series for a nostalgic period piece, as when a bushy-bearded Zachary Levi (“Chuck”) enters as a silver-tongued peddler, or when Grace befriends Mary (Rebecca Liddiard), a feisty, politically aware servant who fatefully attracts the interest of one of her employer’s sons. (The series follows Netflix’s roughed-up “Anne With an E,” which surfaced the dark subtext of “Anne of Green Gables,” another story of 19th-century Canadian girlhood.)

The series is conscious of class — there’s a little primer on colonial Canadian populism — and of how patriarchy pits women against women, like Nancy Montgomery (Ms. Paquin), the housekeeper and jealous lover of Grace’s employer, who terrorizes the staff below her.

Above all, “Alias Grace” is about how men abuse power over women, and how that power is always present, even when the men aren’t. It’s present in something as innocuous as a wedding quilt, which Grace likens to a battle flag. A bed may seem like a place of rest, she tells Dr. Jordan, but “there are many dangerous things that need take place on a bed.”

It’s tempting to think of this series, like “The Handmaid’s Tale,” as especially timely, with today’s revelations of sexual abuse in places of power. But to say that would suggest that there have been moments when these ideas would not be timely.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

BRUSSELS — The former president of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, and four former members of his regional government turned themselves in to the Belgian police on Sunday morning, a spokesman for the Brussels prosecutor’s office said.

The spokesman, Gilles Dejemeppe, said that they would be questioned over the next 24 hours by an investigative judge, who will decide whether to keep them in jail or to order any other measures, such as house arrest.

A Spanish judge issued an international arrest warrant on Friday for Mr. Puigdemont and the four former members of his cabinet, who left Catalonia for Brussels. The warrant was sent to the Belgian federal prosecutor.

Mr. Puigdemont told RTBF, a Belgian television broadcaster, on Friday that he was “completely available to cooperate” with the Belgian court system, which he called “the real justice.”

Despite all these challenges, suppliers are optimistic that legal recreational sales will be a reality by summer.

“I 100 percent think Canada will be ready,” said John Fowler, the chief executive of Supreme, which has been selling medical marijuana since 2016. “But I think the real question is: What does ‘ready’ mean?”

The answer, Mr. Fowler said, will be managing expectations in the early days.

“Canadians should not expect that on Day 1, the legal market is going to supply the billions of dollars of illegal cannabis being consumed in Canada,” he said in his windowless office at the greenhouse complex near the shore of Lake Huron where employees work in disposable suits and hairnets to avoid contaminating the multimillion-dollar crop. “That will take time, and I think that’s fine.”

Even with the uncertainty, many investors are betting there is money to be made on legal marijuana. Last month, Constellation Brands, a major wine and beer distributor in the United States, invested $245 million in Canopy Growth, the owner of several licensed medical marijuana growers in Canada.

While the commercial side is upbeat, many provincial leaders say Mr. Trudeau’s timetable of legalization by July — one of his main campaign promises — is unrealistic. Some have demanded a delay.

In a statement, Brad Wall, the premier of Saskatchewan, said that he and several of his counterparts believed a postponement was needed to deal with all the questions.

“Despite these concerns, the federal government has not changed its timetable,” Mr. Wall said.

Speaking with reporters last month, Brian Pallister, the premier of Manitoba, said that his province is reluctantly working to meet the federal government’s schedule.

“That doesn’t mean I like it,” he said. “I’m going to continue to express my concerns about the rapidity of this change.”

But Bill Blair, the former police chief of Toronto and a Liberal member of Parliament tasked by Mr. Trudeau with overseeing the marijuana issue, said that the government will stick with its plan. He dismissed suggestions that the process was rushed, noting that the federal government had been discussing the issue with provinces for two years.

“I don’t minimize the complexity of the work ahead,” Mr. Blair said on Friday. “But by establishing a date for implementation, it’s focused the process.” Further delay, he added, “just facilitates vast windfalls of profit to criminal enterprises.”

Of the three provinces that have released broad outlines, the plans put forth by Ontario and Alberta, although sketchy, treat marijuana much like alcohol.

In Alberta, marijuana will be available in licensed, privately owned shops. Ontario, which has a population of 13.6 million spanning two time zones, will set up 150 government-owned stores. The buying ages will be 18 in Alberta, 19 in Ontario. (Ontario introduced legislation for its new system this past week, but many important details will come later.)

How the provinces and the federal government will divide the tax revenue is still unclear. Governments do not want a repeat of their experience with cigarettes, in which high taxes intended to discourage smoking created a large black market.

Many police forces are among the groups calling for a delay. While a new law will allow the police to use saliva tests to identify marijuana-impaired drivers, what will qualify as impairment has yet to be defined. Little equipment to conduct the tests is now in the field, and few officers have been trained in its use.

“Are we going to be ready?” asked Mario Harel, the president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the head of the force in Gatineau, Quebec. “We don’t think so. We’re dealing with a lot of situations so we’re going to be doing our best to be as ready as possible.”

While some Canadians are questioning the accuracy of salvia tests, Robert Mann, a scientist at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health who studies cannabis use, said the tests have proved valid in other countries, although he acknowledged that marijuana’s active ingredient was not as easily measured as alcohol.

His larger concern, he said, is changing public opinion about whether it is safe to drive under the influence of marijuana.

“There’s quite a common perception that you can drive safely under the influence of cannabis,” Dr. Mann said, adding that this view is based in part on now-refuted research from about 20 years ago. “It took quite a while for people’s attitudes about drinking and driving to change.”

The authorities have also faced black-market sales in stores after Mr. Trudeau’s legalization announcement. Cities and provinces have taken different approaches to the black-market shops. In Vancouver, where they are most numerous, officials try to keep control through business licenses. In other areas, particularly Quebec, the police have moved swiftly to close them down.

Mr. Trudeau’s government has repeatedly said that the stores are illegal and will not be a part of the new recreational market.

Brendan Kennedy, the president of Tilray, a licensed medical marijuana producer, said the experience of American states with legalization suggested that the stores will quickly wither away in the face of a legal alternative — provided that “there is adequate supply and adequate locations of legal products.”

Mr. Harel, the police chief, is less certain the black market will vanish anytime soon after legalization.

He anticipates that the illegal market will aggressively promote food laced with marijuana, one of many products that will not immediately be allowed under the new system. In his view, the success of the legal system will rest on swiftly and aggressively shutting down the black market.

“We figure it’s an $8 billion-a-year economy,” he said of illegal marijuana sales. Legalization, he added, will change the dynamics of the black market. “But we don’t think it will fade away.”","Ready or Not, Recreational Marijuana Use Is Coming to Canada",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/canada/canada-marijuana-legal-justin-trudeau.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

On his way to Japan, Mr. Trump told reporters he would probably meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia next week to discuss the North Korean threat, part of his 12-day, five-country tour through Asia that is also likely to focus heavily on trade.

White House officials had said that a meeting by Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin — who last held face-to-face talks in Hamburg, Germany, in July — was a possibility on the sideline of the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Da Nang, Vietnam.

“We want Putin’s help on North Korea,” Mr. Trump said.

The White House also signaled that Mr. Trump could decide on this trip to designate North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism, a largely symbolic move since it is already among the world’s most heavily sanctioned countries. Still, the gesture would reinforce the administration’s efforts to cast the North as a global pariah.

Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, and other administration officials are looking at the prospect “very closely,” a senior White House official told reporters in Tokyo on Sunday, and a decision will come “very soon.”

The president used his speech on Sunday to call for building a “free and open Indo-Pacific” region, a new approach to Asia that is likely to be seen by China as a challenge. The idea, first proposed by the Japanese and adopted in recent days by Mr. Tillerson, envisions the United States strengthening ties with three other democracies in the region — Japan, Australia and India — to contain a rising China.

“We will seek new opportunities for cooperation and commerce, and we will partner with friends and allies to pursue a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” Mr. Trump said. “We will seek free fair and reciprocal trade.”

Mr. Trump’s trip to the continent will be the longest by an American president in more than 25 years, with additional stops in South Korea, China and the Philippines. Ahead of what his advisers called a grueling schedule of meetings and summits, the president got a chance to relax by playing golf on Sunday afternoon with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at Kasumigaseki Country Club.

The outing was reciprocation for rounds that Mr. Trump hosted in Jupiter, Fla. and nearby West Palm Beach in February for Mr. Abe and Ernie Els, once the world’s top golfer. For Sunday’s round, Mr. Abe invited Hideki Matsuyama, a Japanese golfer ranked fourth in the world. Before the game, the Japanese prime minister presented Mr. Trump with white caps in the style of the president’s trademark red “Make America Great Again” trucker hats; Mr. Abe’s were emblazoned in gold: “Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.”

The already extensive trip grew longer still on Friday when Mr. Trump abruptly announced to reporters that he would attend the East Asia Summit in Manila on Nov. 14, adding a day to his travels.

“It is grueling, they tell me, but fortunately, historically that has not been a problem for me,” Mr. Trump said. “If I don’t stay fresh, you’ll be the first to tell me. I’ll stay fresh.”

White House officials have framed the trip as a chance for Mr. Trump to showcase his warm relationships with world leaders including Mr. Abe and President Xi Jinping of China, as well as to demand trade deals more favorable to the United States after his decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But it will also highlight the uncertainty in the region and around the world about what to expect from the Trump administration, and the degree to which major powers are charting their own course in the absence of clear signals from the United States.

Mr. Trump also makes the trip hobbled by new questions about the Russia investigation back in Washington, sharpened in recent days by revelations that his aides sought to arrange meetings between him and Mr. Putin during the campaign. In contrast, Mr. Abe and Mr. Xi are newly empowered, with their countries handing them sweeping mandates.

Mr. Trump denied being at a disadvantage when reporters noted on Sunday that Mr. Xi was in a particularly powerful position.

“Excuse me, so am I,” Mr. Trump said, citing stock market gains and low unemployment in the United States, and asserting that “ISIS is virtually defeated in the Middle East.”

“We are coming off some of the strongest numbers we’ve ever had, and he knows that and he respects that,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Xi. “We’re going in with tremendous strength.”

Mr. Trump’s ability to stay on message during a lengthy and physically demanding trip will most likely be tested, with many opportunities for gaffes or intemperate language.

On Sunday, North Korea’s state media accused Mr. Trump of provoking the country with “foolish remarks” and said “the only and one way for checking his rash act is to tame him with absolute physical power.” The commentary in North Korea’s state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun added: “We warn Trump’s coteries once again. If they want to avoid ruin, do not make reckless remarks.”

Asked last week whether the president — who likes to refer to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, as “Little Rocket Man” and spoke about raining “fire and fury” on his country — would seek to temper his rhetoric while he traveled through the region, his national security adviser was frank.

“The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously,” Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster told reporters. “I don’t think the president really modulates his language — have you noticed him do that?”",Trump Opens Asia Trip Talking Tough in Campaign-Style Rally,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/asia/trump-asia-japan-korea.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”",Six Myths About Choosing a College Major,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/choosing-a-college-major.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Any form of carbon pricing has become taboo in Australia — particularly in Mr. Turnbull’s conservative Liberal Party — even though such a market-based approach is the most efficient, cheapest way of reducing emissions. Last week, a report from Australia’s Productivity Commission reiterated this point, declaring Australia must “adopt a proper vehicle for reducing carbon emissions that puts a single effective price on carbon.”

Instead, Australians have contorted ourselves to look like we’re responding to climate change without really doing so. We’ve paid some companies taxpayer dollars to reduce their emissions, while imposing no penalties on those who don’t. We’ve legislated a “renewable energy target,” then announced it was under review, then finally reduced it. While we reviewed, we watched investments in large-scale renewables drop an astonishing 90 percent in a year.

As a target was settled, investment recovered. But, even then, because there was no carbon price — charges for those who emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — to make investments in renewable energy more commercially attractive, energy retailers weren’t giving investors the long-term contracts they needed to get bank loans. This naturally makes investment a shorter-term affair, limiting its scope and ambition. It also means that investments in renewable energy weren’t being directly connected to the retail market.

With the lost years and disconnections between investors and retailers, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that whatever renewables investment Australia now has, it should have had more. Meanwhile, Australia hasn’t even enjoyed the short-term financial benefits of repealing the carbon tax, which was demonized for making electricity unaffordable. As a result, Australia now has the most expensive energy prices in the world, and a power supply so unreliable that summer blackouts are now a real possibility.

There are many reasons for this, including an underdeveloped renewable energy grid and coal-fired power stations on which Australia has for so long relied that are nearing the end of their operating lives.

Enter the Turnbull government’s National Energy Guarantee. Perhaps its most fundamental change is that it addresses energy retailers, rather than generators. It’s a useful idea, ensuring that energy investments have a home in the consumer market.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The policy plan makes two fundamental requirements of the retail companies that sell energy to consumers. First, retailers have to meet a quota for reliable energy — “dispatchable” energy that can be made available immediately. This seeks to minimize the chance of blackouts, which the government has argued are at least partly a function of how renewable energies like solar and wind can fluctuate with weather unless effectively stored. This may be read as a way of giving an advantage to coal, though that seems less likely as storage of renewables increases.

Second, there is a limit on the amount of emissions intensity that will require retailers to purchase “clean energy” from energy generators. It’s a proposal that manages to obey the current laws of Australian politics. There’s no carbon price, no taxes and no explicit focus on renewable energy. The reliable energy quota is deliberately agnostic on the sources of energy, thereby making it a blank political canvas. If you really believe coal is the future, the quota can accommodate that. Same if you think renewables are becoming cheaper and more reliable every year. The policy plan holds at least the potential for broad support, which is something Australia has never achieved.

But that’s only possible because, for the moment, it’s largely content-free. Just about everything depends on what the relevant reliable energy quotas will be, but no one yet knows. Will they be set low and then increased? If so, how quickly? What relationship will they bear to Australia’s commitments under the Paris climate accord? Will they shift the emissions burden to the electricity sector, or will they require other sectors to make disproportionate reductions? And precisely how severe will the penalties be for retailers that fail to meet these targets?

These are not mere policy details. They are the essence of the political differences that remain on climate change.

That this is the best we can do — indeed that this is a relative triumph for Mr. Turnbull — illustrates just how tangled Australia’s climate politics have become. The country has taken a long, hard look at every warning about the costs of delayed climate action and ignored them all. And, subsequently, it has paid for those costs through high energy prices and curtailed investment.

At last, having long understood that a carbon price would be the most efficient solution, we’ve opted for what is a fairly blunt form of regulation. It’s where nobody would have recommended we be a decade ago, and it is not ideal. But it is something. And if we can find a way to work with it, perhaps the next decade will be better than the one before.",Australia Has a Climate Change Lesson for the World,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/opinion/australia-climate-change.html

The provision explicitly allows expectant parents to designate a “child in utero” as a beneficiary of a 529 plan.

Parents have long been able to set up 529 accounts for an unborn child, but the provision accomplishes what anti-abortion activists have long sought: It enshrines into federal law the recognition of the unborn.

“An unborn child means a child in utero,” the provision states. “A child in utero means a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”

Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion rights, said the addition of the words “unborn child” was a major victory for their movement.

“It is fantastic because the unborn child is appropriately represented in the tax code,” she said. “All of these things represent a serious commitment to treating the unborn child, as she or he should be, equal and protected in the eyes of the law.”

The bill also contains a sought-after change by the religious right: repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt organizations like churches from engaging in political activity.

Eliminating it was an early campaign promise of Mr. Trump’s, and it has been a cause long championed by religious conservatives.

“Repealing the bigoted Johnson Amendment is long overdue,” Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a letter on Thursday to members of Congress.

“This clearly unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech has been used by the Internal Revenue Service to harass, intimidate and persecute the faith community for over six decades,” he wrote. “It is long past time to repeal it and we strongly support this legislation’s provision restoring the full First Amendment rights of people of faith.”

Still, doing away with the Johnson Amendment is not a cause that unites all conservatives, nor is it one that liberals are likely to let go quietly because of the considerable clout it would give pastors in the electoral process.

“The entire reason Donald Trump promised religious leaders he would help get rid of the Johnson Amendment was to empower the Christian right,” said Peter Montgomery, a senior fellow for People for the American Way, a left-leaning political advocacy group.

Other aspects of the bill would make it harder for immigrant parents to claim the refundable child tax credit, even if their children were born in the United States. Under the legislation, filers would need to provide a Social Security number, rather than just a taxpayer identification number, in order to claim the benefit, which can be claimed even by those who owe no taxes. Social Security numbers are provided only to United States citizens or those authorized to work in the country.

The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the provision would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80 percent born in the United States.

Hair cascading about her shoulders in keeping with a spirit that won’t be easily tamed, Ms. Best’s impassioned heroine wants specifically to wrest her son Gerald (the bright-eyed Harry Lister Smith) away from hoped-for employment as Lord Illingworth’s private secretary. The issue, which this feral mother is eager to keep under wraps, is that the moneyed cad whom she regards as competition for Gerald’s attention is in fact Gerald’s father. If Gerald lands under Lord Illingworth’s sway, Mrs. Arbuthnot will have lost the one truly legitimate love of her life — her adored and adoring son.

Observing watchfully (some might say overearnestly) as the stakes are heightened is Hester Worsley, the play’s lone American, who is courted by Gerald but otherwise exists at odds with the same frivolous English upper crust with which the Dublin-born Wilde was clearly and entirely smitten. A chore at the best of times, the role essentially reduces the teenage Hester to the butt of numerous jokes, and the young American actress Crystal Clarke can’t enliven the part beyond staring at the societal swells in her midst with her chin upturned.

It’s equally possible that Ms. Clarke, in her London theater debut, is simply in awe of her colleagues’ timing. The distinguished roll call of talent includes the stage veteran Eleanor Bron, who purrs her way through the part of a grande dame with a habit of forever misplacing her husband, and Emma Fielding — fondly remembered from the 1993 National Theater premiere of Tom Stoppard’s “Arcadia” — as a drolly expressive house guest who pronounces that there are only four “ideal men” in London. Mrs. Arbuthnot would presumably put that number at somewhat less.

Ms. Best, by contrast, handles the borderline melodrama of the plotting with ease and makes one see the cost to the soul of Mrs. Arbuthnot’s intervention, her protective mother a companion piece of sorts to the fallen matriarch whom this actress played so well earlier this year in Terence Rattigan’s “Love in Idleness.” Mr. Dromgoole, as director, fills the scene changes with a sequence of sweet cabaret turns by Ms. Best’s co-star, Anne Reid, the beloved octogenarian actress-singer whose Lady Hunstanton presides garrulously over proceedings that she can in no way control. (Ms. Reid some years back earned acclaim as Daniel Craig’s onscreen lover in the unexpected romance “The Mother.”)

It’s Lady Hunstanton during the scenic interludes who proffers the breezily trilled assertion in song that “a boy’s best friend is his mother,” but the production deepens the minute Mrs. Arbuthnot confronts her status as a “tainted thing.” This woman’s ruin is the production’s glory.

Ms. Best’s elemental quality would be perfect for Ellida, the lighthouse-keeper’s daughter at the conflicted heart of Ibsen’s “The Lady From the Sea” (1889), a play that predates Wilde’s by only a few years. The role has, this time, landed into the empathic hands of Nikki Amuka-Bird in a ravishingly designed reckoning with a text that keeps one foot in the mystical, just as Tom Scutt’s painterly set gives the watery landscape of the title its own enclosed perch onstage.

The production, at the Donmar Warehouse through Dec. 2, marks a well-timed feather in the cap of its director, Kwame Kwei-Armah, who was appointed in September as artistic director-designate of the Young Vic theater across town. And in filleting a play that, in Elinor Cook’s new version, has been relocated from the Norwegian fjords to an unidentified island in the Caribbean of the 1950s, Ibsen’s vaunted claustrophobia finds release amid a climate of rum cocktails and steel drums.

I’d have liked a bit more of a sense of place and the rhythms that go with it, in an authorial gambit that puts one in mind of the Trinidadian writer Mustapha Matura’s Caribbean reworking of J. M. Synge with “Playboy of the West Indies” many years ago. But the fine cast includes Tom McKay and Jonny Holden as two of the men at large in the unfolding erotic hothouse and Helena Wilson as the older, more questing of two sisters who move not just between land and sea but between the ever-porous shores of desire and disappointment.

After Wilde and Ibsen, what can one say about Agatha Christie beyond reminding those who keep track of such things that her record-breaking “The Mousetrap” celebrated its 65th birthday last month on the West End. Dame Agatha wrote other plays, of course, among them “Witness for the Prosecution” (1953), which has pitched up in the unusual setting of the debating chamber of London County Hall for a run through March 11. In taking their seats, the audience becomes the de facto jury inside the very building that was once a seat of London government. (County Hall now consists of a mixture of commercial enterprises, including two hotels.)

Christie’s thriller at this juncture feels, truth to tell, like a hoary curiosity, and Lucy Bailey’s production could benefit from the outsize fun that has made Billy Wilder’s 1957 screen adaptation an enduring favorite over the years. (Choice characters like Miss Plimsoll — the nurse played in the movie by Elsa Lanchester — don’t appear onstage.) As it is, one clocks the belligerent Englishness of the piece in both its appeal to national sentiment (we are told several times that England has the best justice system in the world) alongside a casual xenophobia whereby to be foreign is to be “evil.”

It doesn’t help that the younger generation comes off as comparatively lightweight, which means that Jack McMullen as the hapless, accused Leonard Vole rarely seems worth the fuss made by his plummy-voiced defense lawyer, Sir Wilfrid Robarts (David Yelland, commendably avoiding the temptation toward camp that must come with the role). That said, the twists are genuinely surprising and the surroundings have a novelty value all their own.

Nonetheless, at least one in five Americans regularly chooses gluten-free foods, according to a 2015 poll. Sales of products with gluten-free labels rose to $23 billion worldwide in 2014, up from $11.5 billion worldwide in 2010.

Gluten-free diets can lead to deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin B, folate and iron. Compared with regular bagels, gluten-free ones can have a quarter more calories, two and a half times the fat, half the fiber and twice the sugar. They also cost more.

The hullabaloo over gluten echoes the panic over MSG that began roughly half a century ago, and which has yet to fully subside. MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is nothing more than a single sodium atom added to glutamic acid — an amino acid that is a key part of the mechanism by which our cells create energy. Without it, all oxygen-dependent life as we know it would die.

A 1968 letter in The New England Journal of Medicine started the frenzy; the writer reported feeling numbness, weakness and palpitations after eating at a Chinese restaurant. A few limited studies followed, along with a spate of news articles. Before long, nutrition experts and consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader were calling for MSG to be banned. The Food and Drug Administration never had to step in; food companies saw the writing on the wall, and dropped MSG voluntarily.

Many people still wrongly believe that MSG is poison. We certainly don’t need MSG in our diet, but we also don’t need to waste effort avoiding it. Our aversion to it shows how susceptible we are to misinterpreting scientific research and how slow we are to update our thinking when better research becomes available. There’s no evidence that people suffer disproportionately from the afflictions — now ranging from headaches to asthma — that MSG-averse cultures commonly associate with this ingredient. In studies all over the world, the case against MSG just doesn’t hold up.

Too often, we fail to think critically about scientific evidence. Genetically modified organisms are perhaps the best example of this.

G.M.O.s are, in theory, one of our best bets for feeding the planet’s growing population. When a 2015 Pew poll asked Americans whether they thought it was generally safe or unsafe to eat modified foods, almost 60 percent said it was unsafe. The same poll asked scientists from the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same question. Only 11 percent of them thought G.M.O.s were unsafe.

Most Americans, at least according to this poll, don’t seem to care what scientists think. In fact, Americans disagree with scientists on this issue more than just about any other, including a host of contentious topics such as vaccines, evolution and even global warming.

If people want to avoid foods, even if there’s no reason to, is that really a problem?

The answer is: yes. Because it makes food scary. And being afraid of food with no real reason is unscientific — part of the dangerous trend of anti-intellectualism that we confront in many places today.

Food should be a cause for pleasure, not panic. For most people, it’s entirely possible to eat more healthfully without living in terror or struggling to avoid certain foods altogether. If there’s one thing you should cut from your diet, it’s fear.","Relax, You Don’t Need to ‘Eat Clean’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/opinion/sunday/relax-you-dont-need-to-eat-clean.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

What were President Trump, Paul Manafort, Jeff Sessions and Vice President Mike Pence doing in a shower together? Why was Larry David making jokes about trying to pick up women at a concentration camp? Who thought it would be a good idea for Alec Baldwin, of all people, to take satirical potshots at Harvey Weinstein ?

These were just some of the questions raised by this weekend’s head-scratching installment of “Saturday Night Live,” which was hosted by Mr. David and featured Miley Cyrus as musical guest. Even after an extra hour of sleep , we’re still not certain we can adequately answer them.

This week’s cold open featured Mr. Baldwin in his recurring role as Mr. Trump, visiting Paul Manafort (played by the “S.N.L.” cast member Alex Moffat), his recently indicted former campaign chairman , while he is under house arrest.

“God, you’re screwed,” Mr. Baldwin told him. “You’re so, so screwed. It’s a shame you’re going to prison. Because I was about to give you a huge tax break. According to my tax plan, cut cut cut. Because it was named while I was having a small stroke. Speaking of cuts, do you have a good shiv you can bring with you to prison, Paul? Because after the stuff I’ve said about certain ethnic groups, they are really going to go to town on you in prison.”

After a quick cutaway to Melania Trump (Cecily Strong), the sketch returned to the characters of Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort, who are now standing in a shower.

Mr. Baldwin explained he had to make certain that Mr. Moffat wasn’t wearing a wire. “I would never do that with you,” Mr. Moffat said.

Mr. Baldwin answered, “That’s what she said. Like, a whole bunch of she’s have said that. Speaking of which, what an idiot that Harvey Weinstein is. He could have gotten away with all of it, if only he’d gotten himself elected president.”

It was an awkward juxtaposition, at a time when a growing number of Hollywood figures are being confronted with claims of sexual misdeeds.

Mr. Baldwin has lately come under scrutiny for his friendship with the filmmaker James Toback, who has faced widespread accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , Mr. Baldwin said he had “no idea” that Mr. Toback had “done anything criminal.” “If that’s true, that’s news to me,” Mr. Baldwin said. “I never had any idea that Jimmy’s appetites took him in that direction.”

During a tribute on Thursday at the Paley Center for Media, Mr. Baldwin said, “I certainly have treated women in a very sexist way. I’ve bullied women. I’ve overlooked women. I’ve underestimated women. Not as a rule.”

On Saturday, Mr. Baldwin said he would suspend posting at his @AlecBaldwin Twitter account, following criticism of an interview he gave to PBS in which he seemed to blame some of the actresses who have accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct.

“You heard the rumor that he raped Rose McGowan,” Mr. Baldwin said in the interview. “You heard that over and over — we heard that for decades. And nothing was done.”

He added, “Rose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him. And it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case.”

Following that interview, Mr. Baldwin wrote on Twitter , “my heart goes out to all such victims. My goal is to do better in all things related to gender equality. Au revoir.”

As for “S.N.L.”, it still had another 85 minutes to go.

Uncomfortable Monologue of the Week

Mr. David, the creator and star of the HBO cringe-comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” took the stage by joking to the audience, “You tolerate me. You really, really tolerate me.” He then put that proposition to the test with a discomforting monologue that even his cable-TV alter ego would have had trouble getting away with.

Larry David's Monologue Credit Video by ""Saturday Night Live""

“A lot of sexual harassment stuff in the news of late,” the real Mr. David said. “And, uh, I couldn’t help but notice a very disturbing pattern emerging. Which is that many of the predators — not all, but many of them — are Jews.”

After a long grimace, Mr. David said, “I don’t like it when Jews are in the headlines for notorious reasons. I want, ‘Einstein Discovers the Theory of Relativity.’ ‘Salk Cures Polio.’ What I don’t want? ‘Weinstein Took It Out.’”

Mr. David continued to think aloud: “You know, I’ve always, always been obsessed with women, and I’ve often wondered, if I’d grown up in Poland, when Hitler came to power, and was sent to a concentration camp, would I still be checking out women in the camp? I think I would.”

He added, “Of course, the problem is, there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp.”

Imagining how such an interaction might unfold, Mr. David said, “How’s it going? They treating you O.K.? You know, if we ever get out of here, I’d love to take you out for some latkes. You like latkes? What, what’d I say? Is it me or is it the whole thing? It’s ‘cause I’m bald, isn’t it?”

Bernie Sanders Sketch of the Week

Reprising a recurring role from last season, Mr. David played Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, this time as a contestant on a celebrity edition of “The Price Is Right.”

Paired with a baffled civilian contestant (Pete Davidson), Mr. David said, “Thank you, it’s good to be here. I just want to say, this show is a travesty. Consumerism disguised as entertainment. That being said, I do need a new dinette set.”He added, “We’re going to win this thing the Bernie way. Which means if I lose, I’ll bring everyone else down with me.”

Trump Family Sketch of the Week

In a “Weekend Update” deskside segment, Mr. Moffat and Mikey Day played the president’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., speaking out against the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into their father’s presidential campaign.

Weekend Update: Eric and Donald Trump Jr. Credit Video by ""Saturday Night Live""

While Mr. Moffat clumsily mimed his gestures and body language, Mr. Day explained, “We’d like to make it very clear that our father did nothing wrong. Some people who barely worked for him did. But Dad knew nothing about it. And the same goes for Eric and myself.”

Colin Jost, the “Weekend Update” co-anchor, replied, “Well, I definitely believe you that Eric had no idea what was going on.”

“Exactly,” Mr. Day said. “And look, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, we barely knew these guys. And as for the last guy, George — ”

Mr. Moffat confidently interjected, “Doctor Octopus.”

Mr. Day corrected him. “No, buddy, it’s not George Doctor Octopus, it’s George Papadopoulos ,” he said.

Mr. Day went onto argue that there should instead be an investigation of Mr. Trump’s Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.

“As we learned from Donna Brazile,” he said. “Crooked Hillary and company did some shady back room deals with the Russians and tried to rig the election in her favor.”

“Just like dad,” Mr. Moffat said.

Sketch We Wanted to Like of the Week

Did you fully grasp the pretaped sketch about the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders (Aidy Bryant), which crosscut between her overseeing a contentious daily press briefing and her fantasizing that she is in a music video, performing Demi Lovato’s “Confident” ?

1) 2 P.M. Latin Rhythms

El Barrio stretches north from East 96th Street to the Harlem River, but its heart is the commercial strip of East 116th Street, between La Marqueta, the revitalized historic market under the railroad tracks of Park Avenue, and First Avenue. Casa Latina Music Shop beckons with Latin rhythms blaring from loudspeakers. In the neighborhood for more than 50 years, the store is owned by the couple Vicente and Cristina Barreiro — he, Spanish; she, Argentine — who have survived both gentrification and music downloads with an eclectic mix of sounds, from salsa and reggaeton to vintage ballads. They also sell collectibles, books and percussion instruments like bongos and cowbells.

2) 2:30 P.M. Murals and Comfort Food

Not far away, at 168 East 116th Street, Cuchifritos entices with the aroma of Puerto Rican fritters like alcapurrias (green banana dough filled with ground beef, $1.50). Caribbean comfort food includes pork shoulder and rice with pigeon peas, for $8, but seating is limited to a counter with stools, so pick up a snack at the sidewalk window and keep walking as you munch. Along 116th Street, between First and Second Avenues, a mosaic portrait of the Puerto Rican educator and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Antonia Pantoja, founder of the educational youth organization Aspira, frames the entrance of the senior center at Corsi Houses, a public-housing project. The piece is just a sample of the multimedia artist Manny Vega’s artwork and a good start to a walking tour of the street art throughout the neighborhood, including the 1970s-era, four-story mural “The Spirit of East Harlem” on a residential building at 104th Street and Lexington Avenue, by Mr. Vega and Hank Prussing, depicting a domino game in progress, kids playing basketball and other neighborhood scenes and portraits.

3) 5 P.M. Peace and Party

The wooden fishing pier at the end of Dyckman Street in Inwood, a neighborhood on the northern tip of Manhattan with a large Dominican population, is an urban refuge, with stunning views of the Hudson River, the George Washington Bridge and the sunset over New Jersey. A boisterous Latin party scene awaits on the leafy street as you stroll east past playgrounds and auto shops. If it is warm enough, have a drink at the sidewalk tables of any of the restaurants that serve Dominican, Spanish and seafood fare with a pulsating beat. Another option awaits on 207th Street at Raíces, where the skirt steak marinated with chimichurri sauce and yucca fries goes for $25.95.

He was pristine. His critics were pigs.

“General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isn’t perfect, it doesn’t mean it’s not our history,” she said on Tuesday with an impossibly straight face, utterly ignoring Kelly’s “compromise” comment and his gauzy eulogy of Robert E. Lee.

She added that journalists’ refusal to brush off those tangents was the truly “outrageous and absurd” development. Thus she aced her favorite trick: the moral inversion of the universe.

Other press secretaries demonized the media, but not as ambitiously and artlessly as she. On Wednesday, she was reminded of her recent statement that all leaders have flaws, and she was asked to name one of Trump’s.

“Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis,” she said.

She needs a vocabulary lesson. The bloat of Trump’s ego is a flaw. The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw. Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience — or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment — but it’s not a flaw. It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.

When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster. She chalked up that tweet of his about Mika Brzezinski (“bleeding badly from a face-lift”) to a laudably bold retaliation against a merciless adversary, and she used it as a springboard to swoon over him anew. “I think the American people elected somebody who’s tough, who’s smart and who’s a fighter,” she said. “And that’s Donald Trump.”

She zealously parrots his contention that there’s no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesake’s infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as “pretty standard campaign operating procedure.”

She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos — once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign — was trying to coordinate with Moscow. When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had “nothing to do with the president.”

So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own. She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before. So he was — what — grandfathered in? Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.

Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system “a joke” and “a laughingstock.”

“That’s not what he said,” she shot back — it’s like a reflex with her — and later added, “He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.” Wow. Huge difference. Small problem: Acosta’s description of Trump’s remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.

She’s awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.

Besides, she’s serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. (To listen to her pronounce “priorities” is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)

She’s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump’s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place. Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home. Hence her invocation of religion — she’s the daughter of a rather well-known pastor — when asked during one briefing how she’d explain Trump’s worst behavior to her own children.

“When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model,” she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion. “I point to God. I point to my faith. And that’s where I would tell my kids to look.”

THURSDAY PUZZLE — I will not hold a grudge against the constructor Jacob Stulberg just because he made a puzzle that was bound to make me remember how bad I am at this particular kind of theme. The reason I will not hold a grudge is because the theme itself is very clever and almost a parody of the form. And I can appreciate a good parody.

But if I were going to hold a grudge, this would be the perfect puzzle over which to do it.

Today’s Theme

Because rebuses. I just don’t see them. It’s a flaw in my brain. My best piece of advice to anyone who asks how to recognize whether there is a rebus element in their crossword is to say that if you find yourself cursing at the puzzle because none of your expected answers fit, it is more than likely that it’s a rebus theme. And even with that bit of knowledge in my brain, I still miss them.

The trick today is to make your way down to the revealer at 59A as early as possible, and hope to high heaven that you know your active volcanos. MT. EREBUS is the southernmost active volcano (You’re welcome) and if you break the name up, you might get MTE REBUS.

Top Women Contenders

Mary Keitany (Kenya)

She’s the three-time defending champion. Only she and Grete Waitz have won three or more in a row. (Waitz won three in a row from 1978 to 1980 and then five in a row from 1982 to 1986.) Last year, Keitany won by 3 minutes 34 seconds — the largest margin of victory since 1980. Keitany also holds the women-only marathon world record — 2 hours 17 minutes 1 second — which she set in April at the London Marathon, breaking Paula Radcliffe’s 12-year-old mark.

Edna Kiplagat (Kenya)

She won this race in 2010, but has been back only once since (13th in 2014). She was the 2011 and 2013 world champion, the only back-to-back winner. She was second at this year’s world championships. She also won this year’s Boston Marathon. At 37, she is still in excellent form.

Mare Dibaba (Ethiopia)

The 2015 world champion and bronze medalist at the Rio Olympics. Her 2015 title, at the Bird’s Nest Stadium in Beijing, was a sprint win over three other women. She competed briefly for Azerbaijan in 2009, but quickly returned to her native country.

Buzunesh Deba (Ethiopia)

Based in the Bronx, she was second in this race in 2011. She won the 2014 Boston Marathon after the original winner, Rita Jeptoo, was disqualified for doping. She hasn’t really sparkled since then, but is still only 30.

Shalane Flanagan (United States)

She was the silver medalist in the 10K at the Beijing Olympics (upgraded from bronze because of doping). She was second in her marathon debut in New York in 2010. She dropped out of consideration for this year’s Boston Marathon with a fracture in her back.

Top Men Contenders

Lelisa Desisa (Ethiopia)

He was the winner of the Boston Marathon in 2013, the year of the bombing. He endeared himself to the people of Boston by presenting his winner’s medal back to the city to honor the victims. He also gave his racing bib to two of the victims. “Sport holds the power to unify people,” he said. “Sport should never be used as a battleground.”

He returned to win Boston in 2015 as well. He has been second (2014) and third (2015) in New York, but has never won here. He won the silver medal at the 2013 world championships.

Meb Keflezighi (United States)

At 42, Keflezighi plans to retire after this race, his 26th marathon. A fan favorite for years, he was born in Eritrea and came to the United States at age 12.

He won New York in 2009, and Boston in 2014. He won a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics and competed in three Olympics, including Rio. He holds the 40-and-over record for New York, which is 2:13:32.

He is the only American to win Boston since 1983, and the only American to win New York since 1982. He is the only man from any country to win New York, Boston and an Olympic marathon medal.

But he isn’t really a contender to win this year; he told Sports Illustrated: “Maybe top 10. To be on the podium would be huge.”

Ghirmay Ghebreslassie (Eritrea)

The defending champion and the young superstar of the sport. He won New York last year at age 20, making him the youngest male winner. He won the 2015 world championships at 19, the youngest winner for that competition. He was fourth in the Rio Olympics, almost a disappointment.

Wilson Kipsang (Kenya)

He won this race in 2014, then was fourth the next year before skipping last year. He was the bronze medalist at the London Olympics. Unusually consistent, he is the only man to rank in the world top 10 for the last six years. He is a former world-record holder at 2:03:23, set in Berlin in 2013 (and broken the next year). He won the Tokyo Marathon this year.

“Everyone says how great we’ve managed doing a long-distance relationship, but it’s been extremely hard and painful,” Ms. Spagnola said.","“I was mesmerized by the best-looking guy I’d ever seen,” she said. “I told my friends, ‘We have to go over there now.’ I quickly retreated to my cabin, did a beauty transformation and went with my friends to Guido’s boat.”

Mr. Wolff was equally charmed. “She wore a captain’s hat and a green bikini,” he said. “I knew she was the pretty girl that people wanted to talk to, so I left her a little space.”

Hours later, the two boats traveled together to the evening activity, which was a party at Fort George, an abandoned castle overlooking the Adriatic Sea. “Her table was next to mine,” Mr. Wolff said. “I was so attracted to her. I never lost sight of her.”

They drank and danced, and at midnight they kissed. “I remember looking out onto the crowd, being very happy, and thinking this is exactly where I want to be,” Ms. Spagnola said. “Kissing him felt very special.”

It was that kind of special that transcended back to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, where Ms. Spagnola was living while finishing her law degree at Brooklyn Law School. Her mother visited the day after she returned home.

“I didn’t think she would meet anyone, it was a singles trip, and she went with friends,” said Victoria Spagnola, 57. “But she couldn’t stop talking about this man she met. She was 100 percent sure she loved him. She had boyfriends before, but she had never spoken about anyone the way she was speaking about Guido. When she said he was from Amsterdam, I thought, ‘How are they going to do this? Is it just vacation thing? Who is going to move where?’”

And thus, problem No. 1: location. Ms. Spagnola grew up in Todt Hill, Staten Island. Her parents also own an apartment in Murray Hill in Manhattan. Her mother is a retired accountant, and her father, Fred Spagnola, 58, is a financial adviser for UBS. She and her brother, who went to school in Manhattan, had strong ties to New York. Moving to Amsterdam for love seemed impulsive.

Mr. Wolff grew up in Abcoude, a small town in the Netherlands, until he was 4. Then he moved to Madrid with his older brother and parents. “My mother was a homemaker and my father was the C.E.O. of a record label,” he said. They returned to his hometown six years later, and by then there were four Wolff children.

Still love has a way of steering the ship, so to speak, and after that first kiss, the couple’s course was set.

When the night was over, they departed to their separate yachts, hoping they would continue finding each other along the same route and schedule.

“I was the captain of our boat and in charge of docking the ship,” he said. “I’d always be looking for hers and park as close to hers as possible. Somehow we end up finding each other at every party.”

Except for the final night, which was filled with mishaps. Each thought the other was going to a specific event and, without cellphone reception, there was no way to connect.

“I was so upset I couldn’t find him,” Ms. Spagnola said.

Mr. Wolff was at another party looking for her.

“We didn’t have any goodbye or closure,” she said. “I didn’t have his phone number. I wasn’t sure how he spelled his first name. All I remembered was Wolff had two Fs.”

Upon arriving home, though, she saw that Mr. Wolff had sent her a message on Facebook.

“I was really sad about not saying goodbye,” Mr. Wolff said. “On the last day, every boat goes back to their original harbor. Ours weren’t together. When I arrived back in Amsterdam, I looked at Yacht Week’s app, which was connected to Facebook. I went through 500 photos looking for her, none of which had names on them, but I found her.”

His message, according to Ms. Spagnola, read: “If we didn’t say a proper goodbye, then it wasn’t a goodbye.”

She replied, and phone numbers were exchanged. The next several days turned into a texting frenzy. Then came the phone calls and Skyping. Two months later, Mr. Wolff was visiting her in New York.

“You always have to be cautious with your heart, but I didn’t want any regrets not following it,” he said. “I might as well go and see if she felt the same.”

Ms. Spagnola did. “When I saw him again, I knew I was looking at the man I would marry,” she said. “It was one of the happiest weeks of my life.”

Mr. Wolff stayed with Ms. Spagnola for 10 days, during which time they each said “I love you.” The two also went to see a lawyer who informed them about visas, immigration laws and working internationally.

Their desire to be with each other superseded the obvious roadblocks.

In November 2013, she visited him in the Netherlands, and again for the New Year’s holiday. In March 2014, Mr. Wolff stayed with her for three months. That October, Ms. Spagnola passed the bar and Mr. Wolff visited to celebrate.

“They were so committed to each other from the start,” the bride’s mother said. “It was true love. You could see it. They looked at each other like no one else was in the room.”

But the couple understood they would not often actually be in the same room, let alone live together full time.

“I lived in constant fear we wouldn’t be together,” Mr. Wolff said. “There’s also the fear of not knowing when you’ll see the other person or that you’ll lose them because they’re not in the same city or even the same country with you.”

Ms. Spagnola felt similarly. “I never knew you could miss someone so much that it caused physical pain,” she said. “Guido had unwavering confidence in us and the value of our love.”

In December 2013, Mr. Wolff obtained a sales job with a denim company that would sponsor him to work in the United States.

The couple found an apartment in Williamsburg.

On a cold, foggy day in February 2015, while walking on the Brooklyn Promenade, Mr. Wolff dropped to one knee and proposed with a diamond ring he had designed.

“Even though we spent so much time being separated, I wanted her to know this was forever,” he said.

Things seemed to be going well until that September, when Mr. Wolff, who planned to study for an M.B.A., received a scholarship to Hotelschool The Hague, one of the best hospitality schools in the world, in Amsterdam.

He was hesitant to leave. “When you only get to be with someone for a week or two at a time, there’s the fear you won’t get a chance to really know them because you’re only seeing them for such short periods,” he said. “We never got to have a normal rhythm of life. I wasn’t sure leaving would be the best thing for our relationship.”

Ms. Spagnola refused to let him miss the opportunity. “It was an 18-month program,” she said. “I knew he couldn’t pass it up, so I really encouraged him to take it. ”

For the next four months the couple fell back into a long-distance relationship, each visiting the other monthly. In January 2016, Ms. Spagnola, unable to live without him, found work by persuading a law firm that it needed an international person in its Amsterdam location. Another visa, this time for her, was obtained.

“Everyone told me not to go, but I would have regretted not meeting the people who made him the person that I love,” she said.

After a year, Ms. Spagnola was unfulfilled with her job. Knowing that Mr. Wolff would return to New York after graduating from school in September, she came home in May 2017. Mr. Wolff was able to secure a job in New York as an account executive at Harver, a Dutch technology company.

“Everyone says how great we’ve managed doing a long-distance relationship, but it’s been extremely hard and painful,” Ms. Spagnola said.

Eduard Sabbagh, who was part of the groom’s boat and a guest at the wedding, saw the couple’s determination from the beginning. “Within a week the relationship escalated very quickly,” he said. “It was difficult, but they did it. If Guido sets his mind to something, he’ll figure it out. They’re very similar in that respect.”

The couple were married Oct. 7 before 190 guests at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan. The Rev. Andrew King, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony.

Later in the evening, guest were greeted by two trumpeters in medieval attire at the Metropolitan Club on 60th Street. The couple’s 15 bridesmaids and groomsmen descended the grand stairwell of the club, and then waited as the newly Mr. and Mrs. Wolff entered the reception.

“They were instantly drawn to each other,” said Morgan Manousos, who was on the bride’s boat when the couple first met. “It didn’t matter there was an ocean between them and different continents, they both love fiercely.”

Indeed, in the last four years, between the two of them, they have taken the eight-hour flight between New York and Amsterdam more than 35 times.

If you are reading this on a mobile device or tablet, you can listen to the interview here.

All warmed up? Good, let’s see if we can achieve a personal best today.

Today we follow the path the marathoners will run on Sunday, by BOROUGH, and we are starting at the bottom of the grid. For example, the race begins on Staten Island, but that borough is no where to be seen, unless you jump down to 67A’s “Step 1: A passenger ship since 1817” and fill in FERRY. I got that through the crossings, because I wasn’t think about a small FERRY being a ship. However, we’re specifically thinking about the STATEN ISLAND FERRY from that clue, and the borough is implied.

We then lope — sorry, I mean run — into BROOKLYN, with 51A’s “Step 2: An old baseball team,” which is, of course the (BROOKLYN) DODGERS.

Keep up a good pace and, if you get lost, send up a flare or click here to see the entire theme.

5A: TIL that a small cape, like the one in Provincetown, is also called a SPIT.

17A: Not sure whether the Little Dipper is in URSA MAJOR or URSA MINOR? Fill in URSA M_ _OR, and use the crossings, Luke.

27A: Ha! You thought that was a political clue, didn’t you? “Trump is often involved in these” is a bridge clue today. The answer is BID.

15D: I honestly thought that “Faces With Tears of Joy” was some piece of artwork that I hadn’t learned about, but it turns out that today’s answer is the laugh-til-you-cry EMOJI.

49A: The city of Zagazig is not only in EGYPT, it’s extremely fun to say out loud.

Peter Sagal: In 2016, my friend Greg Pliska asked me to come do the “play-by-play” at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament finals in Stamford, CT. I went and had a great time, including running into some old friends in the puzzle community. That inspired me to start solving the puzzle myself, and I’ve been doing it daily since around that time. In fact, it’s become a daily ritual in the “Wait, Wait ...” offices: we solve the puzzle together after our daily editorial meeting.

So, when Mike Selinker got in touch to ask me if I’d collaborate with him as a “celebrity,” I was thrilled. I had actually begun poking around with practice grids myself, thinking how gratifying it would be to make a puzzle for The Times, and was envious of the other folk who had gotten to work on one for the anniversary project. Mike and I met on a cruise a few years ago, and he helped me create a trivia game for the entertainers.

My first idea for the puzzle was shot down and I was a bit at sea as to what to do. I wanted to do something that related to my career, as many guest constructors had done, but didn’t know how to work the idea of a “quiz show host” into the puzzle. Maybe the clues were riddles with the solution being the answer? That didn’t work. Mike pointed out that I also am known for running marathons (13 so far, and I write a bi-monthly column for Runners World) and maybe that was a theme ... so I suggested in turn a “map” of the New York Marathon, which at that time was a few months off.

Mike responded amazingly. He constructed a grid in which a series of answers suggesting the five boroughs of the race, as a map, with the themed clues indicating their order in the race (Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and Manhattan again.) The clues are all phrases that suggest the name of the boroughs without naming them. He also managed to get in the phrase NEW YORK MARATHON and even BOROUGH.

I love the puzzle because it combines two things I enjoy when they happen to appear in the puzzle: first, the unwritten answer (i.e., you have to mentally provide the word BRONX to complete the answer CHEER) and the physical form of the puzzle; that is, it’s relevant where the answers appear in the grid.

As said, the grid was entirely Mike’s work. I contributed to the cluing as best I could, which was both difficult and a delight. As Mike pointed out to me, some words, like AGA, have appeared in the puzzle many times, and its a challenge to come up with new ways of cluing them. Of my clues that made it through the editing process, I’m most happy about 36 Across and 29 Down.

This really was great fun. It makes me want to try to construct one on my own, although it’ll be a huge leap from simply kibbitzing to doing it all myself. At any rate, I hope solving it gives puzzlers the same sense of pleased satisfaction I’ve gotten from doing the puzzle the last year.

One last important note: I couldn’t very well co-author a puzzle about the New York Marathon without running it, so I signed up with Achilles International to be a guide for a blind runner, as I’ve done three times before. I’ll be helping to guide an accomplished para-athlete named Asim Baig, and we’re raising money for Achilles and Mr. Baig.

Mike Selinker: A couple years ago on the JoCo Cruise, I helped Peter Sagal out with the clues for a game show — I know, right? — and so it seemed about time for him to return the favor. Peter was a more-than-willing collaborator, and we fleshed out a lot of ideas that didn’t really go anywhere. Eventually I posed to Peter, who runs a lot of marathons, the obvious question “What about a marathon puzzle?” Peter wanted to run the New York Marathon this week, and so he came up with this insane and stellar idea of drawing a map of the entire marathon route. To which I said, “Uh, yeah, I think I can do that,” and came up with this.

Actually, the first grid also had a 26-letter message — RUN AND RUN TILL THE RACE IS DONE — running from the second R in FERRY to the N and E at the start of NEW YORK MARATHON, with the black squares being the bridges between the boroughs. Which was great except Will went, “Okay, but why?” And he was — stop me if this sounds familiar — completely correct. I ripped that out and made a much better grid with Will and Peter’s guidance.

Once that was done, Peter clued the first pass all by himself, and he’s the best crossword cluer ever. That brain is crammed with so much trivia, he’s probably had to delete the node that tells him how to use a fork. I had no freaking idea about half the stuff he crammed into there. For me though, the best clues of his are the ones that just roll off as effortless comments, like the ones for MOO, IMHO, and ROCK ON. It was a great three-way collaboration with me, Peter, and Will. I hope we get to do it again soon. Now Peter just has to teach me how to be a radio god and we’re even. Meanwhile, I’ll also be doing a marathon of a different kind, playing Dungeons & Dragons all day to benefit children hospitals for [Extra Life].

The studio behind the hit television series “House of Cards” has suspended Kevin Spacey while it investigates what it called “serious allegations” concerning the actor’s behavior on set.

The announcement by the studio, Media Rights Capital, came late Friday night and did not detail the nature of the allegations. It came shortly after Netflix said in a separate statement that it would not be involved with any further production of “House of Cards” if the show included its star, Mr. Spacey.

In its statement, Media Rights Capital said Mr. Spacey’s suspension was “effective immediately” and added that it would “continue to evaluate a creative path forward” for “House of Cards” during what it called a “hiatus.”

Production of the show’s sixth season had already been suspended earlier this week.

The announcements came after Variety reported earlier Friday that “House of Cards” producers were considering killing off Frank Underwood, the diabolical politician played by Mr. Spacey.

In its statement on Friday night, Netflix also announced that it would “not be moving forward with the release of the film ‘Gore’” — a Gore Vidal biopic in postproduction that starred and was being produced by Mr. Spacey.

“We are adamantly opposed to the elimination of the adoption tax credit,” Ms. Dannenfelser said.
“And in order to help poor, expectant mothers and families, we are pressing for the expansion of the child tax credit to include the unborn child.”","The language is contained in an innocuous provision related to education savings vehicles — so-called 529 plans, which are state-sponsored, tax-free investment funds that allow families to put aside money for a child’s college education. The provision explicitly allows expectant parents to designate a “child in utero” as a beneficiary of a 529 plan.

Parents have long been able to set up 529 accounts for an unborn child, but the provision accomplishes what anti-abortion activists have long sought: It enshrines into federal law the recognition of the unborn.

“An unborn child means a child in utero,” the provision states. “A child in utero means a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”

Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion rights, said the addition of the words “unborn child” was a major victory for their movement.

“It is fantastic because the unborn child is appropriately represented in the tax code,” she said. “All of these things represent a serious commitment to treating the unborn child, as she or he should be, equal and protected in the eyes of the law.”

The bill also contains a sought-after change by the religious right: repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt organizations like churches from engaging in political activity.

Eliminating it was an early campaign promise of Mr. Trump’s, and it has been a cause long championed by religious conservatives.

“Repealing the bigoted Johnson Amendment is long overdue,” Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a letter on Thursday to members of Congress.

“This clearly unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech has been used by the Internal Revenue Service to harass, intimidate and persecute the faith community for over six decades,” he wrote. “It is long past time to repeal it and we strongly support this legislation’s provision restoring the full First Amendment rights of people of faith.”

Still, doing away with the Johnson Amendment is not a cause that unites all conservatives, nor is it one that liberals are likely to let go quietly because of the considerable clout it would give pastors in the electoral process.

“The entire reason Donald Trump promised religious leaders he would help get rid of the Johnson Amendment was to empower the Christian right,” said Peter Montgomery, a senior fellow for People for the American Way, a left-leaning political advocacy group.

Other aspects of the bill would make it harder for immigrant parents to claim the refundable child tax credit, even if their children were born in the United States. Under the legislation, filers would need to provide a Social Security number, rather than just a taxpayer identification number, in order to claim the benefit, which can be claimed even by those who owe no taxes. Social Security numbers are provided only to United States citizens or those authorized to work in the country.

The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the provision would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80 percent born in the United States.

Malliotakis as Manager: Lessons From Hurricane Sandy and Albany

The government of New York City is enormous, with more than 295,000 full-time employees and an annual budget of $85 billion, presenting a host of challenges for any manager. The New York Times asked Nicole Malliotakis , the Republican candidate for mayor, about her approach to management, the experiences that would inform her decisions as a manager of city government and her vision for New York City over the next four years.

Ms. Malliotakis spoke with The Times in a conference room in the Midtown office tower where she has her campaign headquarters. Read a similar interview with Mayor Bill de Blasio , Ms. Malliotakis’ Democratic opponent.

This interview has been condensed and edited.

Q. What in your life, in your work experience, prepares you to lead the biggest municipal government in the United States?

A. First of all, seven years in the Legislature. I have a good understanding of government, just how it works, what needs to be done to get things accomplished. I’ve established good relationships with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and that’s very important, particularly now where we’re seeing a rift between the mayor and the governor. I’ve worked with Governor Cuomo, following what was a crisis situation in my district, with Hurricane Sandy having devastated my district.

Hundreds of families were affected by Hurricane Sandy, and so I had to work under pressure, under a serious devastation in getting my constituents food, water, clothing. Getting them emergency shelter. That is real emergency management, crisis management, on-the-job training that I had during the months following Hurricane Sandy.

Q. What did you learn about what worked in managing a large group of people and what doesn’t work?

A. I was coordinating efforts of hundreds of volunteers at a time, even on various cleanup efforts. I think it’s about having good people helping you. I think with what we see now in the administration is you have ideologues. I really intend on bringing in people in my administration who have, not only a passion for a particular area, but have also the capability to implement things.

When you look at the recovery program, seven years in the Assembly has also trained me to see where there’s mismanagement and where there are things that are inefficient. And if you look at the Hurricane Sandy recovery program, the rebuilding program, Build it Back, that is the poster child of mismanagement.

Q. You said you worked with Governor Cuomo after Sandy. How many times did you speak to Governor Cuomo and —

A. I would work with his agency. I was dealing with, we had a person who was assigned to Staten Island, or we had multiple people that were assigned. So personally speaking, one-on-one with the governor, I had not.

Q. How many employees do you have as an Assembly member?

A. I mean roughly 10 altogether with …

Q. Full-time, paid employees?

A. Full time? Well, you know what the Assembly members’ budget is right?

We just want to establish the baseline here.

All right, so you’re trying to belittle my job, is that what you’re trying to do?

We’re talking about management, and so ...

Management doesn’t necessarily mean the people who are reporting to you. There’s a lot more than that. We utilize volunteers, we utilize interns. That’s important. It’s not just the two full-time, I have what, three full-time people? It’s not just that, I have part-time staff, I’ve got volunteers whom I rely on who serve almost as part-time or full-time staff; it’s just not costing the taxpayer money.

I would say that I do a lot more with less than other Assembly members do who have three or four times the amount of staff that I have. That’s also a major display of my management ability, is to do more with less.

Image If elected mayor, Ms. Malliotakis said that she intended to keep an open dialogue with city workers. Credit Holly Pickett for The New York Times

Q. How you would approach managing the enormous operation of city government?

A. First of all, I feel it’s important to surround yourself with people who reflect your work ethic. My chief of staff is one of the hardest. I would put my chief of staff up against anybody else because the hours and the amount of time that he would put in, the dedication to the position. I will be surrounding myself with people who are passionate about the area that they’re focused on. I see a lot of, actually, Democratic colleagues whom I would like to bring into my administration because they are not only passionate but they’re capable. And I think that that’s really important. You don’t want people who are just ideologues, which is what I see right now. You want people who have ideas and have vision and have the ability to implement.

I want to have an open dialogue with my commissioners. So I would like to have a weekly call or biweekly call, depending on — obviously, there’s a lot of agencies — and being really somebody who meets with and is accessible to the leadership of each department. I feel there’s a lot of apathy right now with city workers. And I feel that the rank-and-file doesn’t have a voice or a seat at the table. So, I want to know from the people who are the first line.

Q. How would you do that?

A. I’m going to go personally and will pick a handful of employees who are on the front lines and talk to them. And say, “What are you hearing? What are you experiencing? What is it like out there?” And I feel the second thing that’s very important is the public. I want to have my town halls at the beginning of my term, not at the end of my term. I feel that we need to work closer with the borough presidents. We need to work closer with the City Council members, because they know their community better than anybody else.

I’m not someone who’s looking to be a dictator and force things down throats — but instead I want to have the people and the city workers part of the conversation. Of course, at the end of the day, I make the decision because I’m the executive, but I think that it’s important to listen to the opinions of those who are closest to the ground.

Q. How would you manage a situation in which you have a policy goal in mind that the local officials disagree with, and you’re convinced that you’re right?

I’m going to be listening and getting their take and getting all the information but at the end of the day, you know, I’m the mayor and I’m going to be making those decisions based on what I think overall is right. An effective leader listens and then makes a decision based on having information, all the information.

Q. You would be the youngest mayor in a century. Tell New Yorkers how your age would impact your mayoralty and what about New Yorkers who say they want someone who is more seasoned?

I bring a new, fresh vision. I am among the new crop of leaders who are taking office, and it’s not just happening here in the United States, it’s happening across the world. I mean we just saw the new head of France, we just, I think it was Austria, right, the other day? I’m pretty sure it was Austria, you can look it up later. But we’re seeing leaders of nations who are emerging. It would be good for New York City because I’m going to bring New York City into the 21st century.

We have a lightning round. It’s very fun.

It’s fun? I hope something’s fun today.

We’re going to throw out some words or phrases and we want you to say the first word that pops into your head.

Andrew Cuomo.

Effective manager.

Equity.

Equity? Oh jeez. Equity. Property taxes. The need for equitable property taxes.

Donald Trump.

Stay off Twitter!

Gym .

I wish I had time to go.

For the coffee.

Q. Do you think that the city has been too lax in allowing the homeless to sleep on the city’s streets, subways, and hasn’t done enough to address both the shelter issue and street homelessness?

A. I do. Look at the disaster that’s been made. When you’re spending nearly double on Department of Homeless Services and the problem’s getting worse. That’s ineffective management. I really feel that they’ve been very lax. I think there needs to be more urgency in transitioning people out of the shelter system.

I don’t agree with reducing the welfare-to-work programs. I feel that we need more. There is a waiting list for vocational training opportunities. We should provide them. I think there’s a lot of things that could be done with existing city and state land that could help relieve the issue. You have a lot of seniors in homeless shelters. You have veterans in homeless shelters. Let’s start with giving property to nonprofits who can provide housing for them as a permanent solution as opposed to what the mayor’s looking to do, to build 90 additional homeless shelters at an expense of hundreds of millions of dollars. You can’t allow people to sleep all over Penn Station. Underneath expressways, there are encampments. This is not acceptable. That’s a breakdown, breakdown of society.

Q. Do you think it’s a problem, then, that the city has a right to shelter?

A. I think it is a major problem. You know, there was legal action, it was upheld. And so it’s something that has to be dealt with. But so we can’t create an environment where people feel that they can sleep on the street, aggressively panhandle, sleep on the subway. There has to be some order as well.

Q. What would you do to establish that order?

A. Well I think we fell behind the 8-ball here because we didn’t build more supportive housing, like we got, there’s a lot of catch-up that needs to be done.

Q. How would you instruct your police commissioner regarding the use of stop and frisk?

A. I think that stop and frisk is a tool that, when used appropriately, it is effective. But in no way should it be a tool that we’re looking to target any particular group. But if someone is stopped and they’re questioned, there’s a reasonable suspicion, I think to frisk is appropriate, but it’s got to be used appropriately.

I’ve spoken to mothers of victims who have been killed by gun violence, and they wished that their perpetrator was stopped, questioned and frisked. So I think we certainly shouldn’t go back to the Bloomberg days of stop and frisk, but we should allow our police, and we should properly train them, and allow them to utilize it as a tool when it’s necessary and there’s reasonable suspicion.

Q. You’ve suggested that crime in the city is higher than the Police Department acknowledges. Do you think that they’re presenting false statistics?

No, I don’t think that they’re presenting false statistics, but look what happened the other day when the mayor’s saying summonses are down 90 percent — that doesn’t mean that public urination has gone down or that smoking marijuana in the street has gone down. That just means that it’s not being enforced. I think it’s great murder is down. But I think when most people walk down the street, they’re not afraid of being murdered, they’re afraid of, women, in particular, are afraid of rape, you know men, afraid of maybe some type of assault.

Q. In a recent poll you performed far better with white voters than with blacks or Hispanics. Why do you think that is?

A. I don’t know. You’d have to ask them. But I do believe that I’ve been getting a great response in the Latino community as I travel around. I’ve done a lot of campaigning. My mother comes around with me, I have Assemblyman Jose Rivera traveling to various events in the Bronx, and we’ve received a great response.

Image Ms. Malliotakis supports President Trump but she says that some of his policies “are not good for New York City.” Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times

Q. Do you think that President Trump has been or will be harmful to New York City?

A. I think that the job of the mayor is to make sure that he’s not harming New York City. I think some of the policies that he’s putting out there are not good for New York City.

Q. Namely?

A. Well, so for example, anything that diminishes services for Medicaid. Anything that’s going to change our tax structure where we can’t write off income tax or property tax is going to be hurtful. Those are my concerns. I’ve already said how I feel about the DACA, that I don’t believe we should be stripping status from DACA recipients.

Q. One of the things that people say about this mayor is that he doesn’t go out and enjoy the city that much. Do you envision yourself out on the town?

A. I’ve never been someone who was into bars or clubs. Even when I was in college. But what I think one of the great experiences of running this campaign has been, being able to go out into the communities and just meeting people, experiencing their culture, trying different restaurants.

You need to ride the subway. You need to take the ferry. I want to be someone who’s out with the people and plan on going to a gym nearby Gracie Mansion. I’m not going to be going to Staten Island to go to the gym. But I still want to be able to do things that I love. CrossFit. Boxing. Yoga. Obviously when time permits. I mean I don’t anticipate a lot of free nights.

For every Puerto Rico, St. John, St. Martin, Dominica and other islands ravaged by hurricanes this year, operators said, there’s an Aruba, St. Lucia, Jamaica and other Caribbean spots ready and open for business.

But many loyal visitors, especially those with relatives, friends and property in the affected areas, say they are still planning to travel to their getaways, eager to somehow help out, if only by injecting tourist dollars into battered economies.

That would be me.

I have lived in several states for more than 40 years but was born and raised in San Juan and visit every New Year’s Eve with my husband, Jim. In the agonizing first weeks after Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, I learned about the fate of my sister and extended family, including a cousin with Alzheimer’s living in a home for the elderly, at an excruciatingly slow pace and only through sporadic emails, texts, Facebook postings and snippets of phone conversations before the calls dropped. It was hard to sleep at night.

Through a cousin in Texas I found out about another cousin who lives near El Yunque National Forest in the northeast of Puerto Rico. Through another cousin in San Juan I learned about other relatives scattered in both urban and rural areas around the island. All my loved ones were safe, though in survival mode.

My attention turned then to the touchstones and places that give Puerto Rico its beauty and culture and that I now realize I have taken for granted all my life.

What was left of “El Yunque,” known for its waterfalls and endangered parrots, I wondered? I later learned that the 28,000-acre treasure, El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest in the United States forest system and a major driver of the island’s tourism, was obliterated.

What about the restaurants and kiosks nearby along Luquillo Beach — Jibaro’s, Terruño, La Parrilla — always good for fritters like alcapurrias, home cooking and music after a day in the sun? Was Old San Juan still recognizable? Did the ice cream place with the long lines for the freshly made waffle cones, Mantecaditos Los Chicos, survive in Culebra, the Puerto Rican island municipality to the east? What was the damage to the delicate bioluminescent bay in Vieques, another island municipality?

What did Hurricane Maria not annihilate? How long would it take for it all to come back?

Ms. Westerman, who eventually confirmed the well-being of both her neighbors and condo and who has been mailing checks to some friends to help them cope, said she planned to see for herself.

She and her husband were planning to go back this year for their usual December to mid-April stay in Boquerón, a beach village in the town of Cabo Rojo on the southwestern tip of the island, with one condition — they will not fly down until the electricity is back on.

“If worst comes to worst we go a month later,” she said.

Restored power was a big “if,” though. By early November, more than a month after the hurricane hit, the power company was generating less than 40 percent of electricity, government figures showed. Close to 20 percent of the island was without running water and about a third without telecommunication services.

The Army Corps of Engineers, charged by the White House to rebuild the power system, has warned that total power restoration could take nearly a year, partly because of the challenge of getting supplies like utility poles quickly to an island.

Neighboring St. Thomas and St. John in the United States Virgin Islands had not fared much better.

“Power lines are strewn across our roads; utility poles snapped in half like matchsticks; boats lie sunken in the harbors; many thousands of our homes stand heavily damaged or destroyed and some of our major road systems are impassable,” Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp of the United States Virgin Islands wrote in an Oct. 12 letter to Congress, estimating that rebuilding would cost $5.5 billion.

Both governors in the American Caribbean — Puerto Rico with a population of 3.4 million, and the United States Virgin Islands, with about 110,000 residents — have optimistically said that nearly all power should be back by Christmas because of a ramp-up in restoration work.

In the meantime, tourism officials, hoteliers and others in the service industry were scrambling to get hotels, beaches and tourist attractions back on their feet to salvage at least part of their peak tourist season, a crucial economic engine that runs from mid-November to April 1.

Photo

But while cruise ship traffic has been rebounding, top hotels in Puerto Rico like El San Juan Hotel and Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, shut down because of damages and many of those that remained open with the help of generators were housing workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other relief agencies.

The Environmental Protection Agency and local government officials have warned against bathing in beaches, rivers and streams because of possible raw sewage discharges as a result of hurricane damage to treatment plants.

In St. Thomas and St. John, major hotels have closed for 6 to 18 months and officials expected a significant decline in overnight visitors.

“We lost the last quarter of the year,” said Beverly Nicholson Doty, commissioner of tourism for the United States Virgin Islands.

It is true that tourism-dependent islands have been able to recover quickly after hurricanes, even if visitors have to look at topless palm trees. When I reported from St. Thomas, St. Martin (divided into French St. Martin and Dutch St. Maarten) and Antigua less than two months after Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn in 1995, I found varying degrees of progress, but much of the tourist industry was ready for visitors and some tourists were trickling back.

Photo

But tourism officials in the American Caribbean acknowledged that Irma, which made landfall in the Virgin Islands on Sept. 6 as a Category 5 hurricane, and Maria, which hit Puerto Rico barely short of that magnitude as a Category 4, were like no other hurricanes in recent history because of their power and overwhelming reach. In Puerto Rico, hardly a corner of the island was spared its destruction, officials said.

José Izquierdo, executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, said that such impact has led the agency to appeal to new types of travelers. One local tour operator that the agency has partnered up with, Local Guest, planned to take volunteers to mountainous regions where brigades of about 15 people each could plant crops of coffee and root vegetables, rebuild bridges and homes and help in other recovery efforts.

Some travel companies, like Global Works Travel, are signing up high school students to visit in 2018 and combine community service with a vacation.

Mr. Izquierdo said that he also expected more Puerto Ricans to visit from the mainland, perhaps those who had not visited in several years and were anxious to reunite with relatives on the island after the disaster. The local newspapers have noted the influx and I personally know friends who headed for the island as soon as flights became available to bring supplies and money and to check up on relatives. (By the same token, others were hosting Puerto Rican friends and relatives escaping the hardships of the island temporarily in New York and New Jersey.)

“A hurricane like this changes the profile of tourists,” Mr. Izquierdo said. “The diaspora now takes a greater prominence.”

Within days of the hurricanes, volunteers started showing up in St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands, where the organization All Hands Volunteers set up operations in the gym at the Kingdom Life International Christian Center in the capital city of Charlotte Amalie.

The disaster relief group, based in Massachusetts, had received more than 1,600 applications by the end of October but can accommodate only about 70 volunteers at any given time in spartan quarters. People can come for as long as they want to work in cleanup, mold remediation, building temporary classrooms and permanent reconstruction, among other efforts.

Erik Dyson, All Hands executive director and chief executive, said the organization planned to extend its work to Puerto Rico by early 2018.

“Anyone can help,” he said. “There’s a need for people to carry things. There’s a lot of not highly skilled jobs.”

One volunteer who arrived in early November, Sid Sharma, 48, of Allen, Tex., spent his honeymoon 26 years ago in St. Thomas, which he remembered as “lush, green and beautiful.” A general contractor who does residential remodeling, he committed to three weeks of volunteer work.

“Seeing the devastation on the news, I just had a little time on my hands and a push from my heart,” said Mr. Sharma, who is still married and the father of two children. “This is something that I should be doing.”

Regular visitors to the Virgin Islands like Joanne Barker, a resident of Washington who last went to St. John in January, have found ways to send care packages directly to those in need. Ms. Barker said she was shopping in October to fill up boxes with items like baby powder milk formula and diapers after being paired up with families through a site — Adopt a Family in USVI — that matches donors to specific people.

“At least you’re doing something,” she said. “You just feel so helpless up here.”

Tourism officials say they have not totally given up on leisure travelers. Mr. Izquierdo noted that big attractions like Old San Juan suffered only “minimal” structural damage (although it lost many trees).

And, he added: “At the core of every successful tourism destination is the quality of the people and hospitality, and that wasn’t washed away by the hurricane. That’s stronger than ever.”

But some in the tourism industry warned that a minimum level of services is required to lure travelers back. Jack Richards, president and chief executive of Pleasant Holidays in Los Angeles, which books trips for 23 countries in the Caribbean, said that the destination must have electricity, phone service, internet, clean water and medical supplies — and no public health issues.

Photo

“Given the level of devastation in Puerto Rico,” Mr. Richards said, “it’ll take a long time for things to get restored.”

Puerto Rico residents like my younger sister, Mari Navarro, and two nephews were still living day to day in a kind of surreal, stressed-out world as November approached. Our family home in San Juan, not far from the airport, suffered only minor damages except for the landscaping, which was gone. But without electricity Mari was cooking on a small gas stove, washing clothes and towels by hand and using flashlights to see at night.

My sister had prepared well for Hurricane Maria, but supplies were running low and she asked me to send D batteries for flashlights and a battery-powered fan. She had to line up for food and bottled water at stores.

She was back on the job as an account executive with a health insurer but she avoided driving except to work, she told me, because most traffic lights were not working. On a recent outing, two cars in front of her had crashed into each other, setting off a panic attack.

“I’m grateful that I have a roof over my head, that we’re all working and that we’re doing better than a lot of people,” she told me over the phone, “but sometimes it’s hard not to get depressed.”

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

But he acknowledges that Republicans must produce a victory for antsy constituents after Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

“We won the election, and now we have an obligation to make good on our word and make good on our principles and make good on the things we said we would do to help people,” he said, “and this is time to deliver.”

As he spoke of the tax proposal, Mr. Ryan, the former head of both the tax-writing and budget committees, seemed energized by the challenge. But a speaker can’t will a proposal into law. It takes votes. And some Republicans quickly peeled away, joining in opposition expressed by influential and often Republican-aligned trade groups such as the National Association of Home Builders and the National Association of Realtors.

Those groups expressed alarm that proposals to cap the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000 and end the ability to deduct state and local income taxes could rattle the housing industry and drive up expenses for those in higher-tax states. Other interest groups are expected to dig in against a plan that eliminates a wide variety of popular deductions from medical and moving expenses to the cost of having taxes done by a professional.

Mr. Ryan said that the interest groups were just protecting their privileged rank in the tax hierarchy and that lawmakers would have to look beyond such narrow considerations.

“Tax reform is really hard because we’re taking on myriad special interest provisions and groups,” said Mr. Ryan, noting that such clashes are a primary reason efforts to reconfigure the tax code have failed since 1986. “The special interests that protect the current code of the status quo have successfully managed to overwhelm the general welfare of the country.”

Mr. Ryan will very likely have to steer his tax plan to approval with no help from Democrats, who view the Republican proposal as far too weighted toward big business and the wealthy while doing far too little for the middle class to justify adding as much as $1.5 trillion in red ink. It is yet another example of the partisan divide that has contributed to years of Washington dysfunction.

Mr. Ryan believes passage of a tax plan that produces the promised economic benefits could have a much broader impact and help ease the nation’s political divisiveness.

“I think one of the reasons we’re a polarized, high-anxiety country is because we’ve had pretty flat economic growth and pretty flat opportunity,” he said. “Most people haven’t got a pay increase. Most people, half the people in this country, live paycheck to paycheck, so there’s a lot of economic anxiety. And I think just one of the key solutions is faster economic growth, more jobs. And I think the best thing we could do to deliver that is tax reform.”

In achieving success, Mr. Ryan will need to work hand-in-hand with President Trump, who yearns for a tax cut victory as much as Mr. Ryan does. The speaker has had a complicated relationship with the president, a man he barely knew before the campaign, beginning with Mr. Ryan’s decision at the conclusion of the primary season to temporarily withhold his support from the presumptive nominee.

Now his decision to regularly back the president and not chastise him for various perceived unpresidential acts has drawn Mr. Ryan scorn from those who think he should follow the example of his friend and former Republican House colleague, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and condemn the president’s conduct. Mr. Ryan disagrees.

“I don’t see why we would want to start a circular firing squad in our party when we have an opportunity that’s almost a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to make a big change for people’s lives,” he said, breaking with Mr. Flake. “That’s not what people voted us in to do, is scream and yell and call each other out and, you know, get into these shouting matches. They elected us to fix their problems, not grouse about, you know, personality differences.”

Mr. Ryan is heading into a 2018 midterm election in which Republicans are predicted to lose seats and see their majority shrink, if not disappear. The outcome of the tax fight is certain to influence events.

The new proposal will undergo changes as it makes its way through Congress. If those revisions aren’t enough to secure passage and win public appreciation, it may be House Republicans and their leader who are in store for big changes of their own.

There, guided by English-speaking teachers and surrounded by toddlers babbling in loose English, I adopted the new language quickly.

Young bats may not be so different.

Wild fruit bats, living in crowded roosts, are exposed to calls from hundreds of fellow bats from birth. Most often these calls are made in response to unsolicited physical contact, and essentially amount to a crabby “move out of my way.” In a study published Wednesday in PLOS Biology, a team of Israeli researchers found that bat pups match their vocalizations to the group sounds they are immersed in, even if this “dialect” differs from that of their mothers.

Human babies and toddlers pick up the utterances around them effortlessly. The ability, called vocal learning, is considered critical for our spoken language.

But vocal learning has rarely been proven to exist in animals other than humans or songbirds, said Yossi Yovel, a neuroecologist at Tel Aviv University who led the study with graduate students Yosef Prat and Lindsay Azoulay.

In nonhuman mammals, much of the evidence for vocal learning “comes from animals that imitate human speech or other artificial sounds,” such as a zoo elephant emulating the Korean spoken by his keepers, Mr. Prat said. What he and his colleagues wanted to know was how an animal learns the sounds of its own species.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Today’s constructor, Natan Last, has taken the road less traveled, at least in his career. After being graduated from Brown University in 2012, he worked in economic consulting at a start-up company in Kenya and at an education nonprofit before landing a job as a strategist at the International Rescue Committee. He has devoted his life thus far to being of service, and I say kudos to him.

“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference.” — Robert Frost

Mr. Last’s puzzle not only uses the title of Robert Frost’s 1916 poem “THE ROAD NOT TAKEN” as a seed entry, but he shows us how to (almost) effortlessly make that detour when necessary.

Today’s Theme

Five phrases take a masterful detour as we make our way from left to right in today’s puzzle. One of things I liked about today’s theme is that the entire puzzle is solvable even if you don’t take those detours.

For example, Mr. Last’s seed entry, THE ROAD NOT TAKEN is clued as “1916 Frost verse … or, diverged: Start of a saying about meaning well.” It’s a central Across entry, but once you get to the “N” in NOT, the road diverges into shaded/circled squares and becomes THE ROAD TO HELL. That’s the start to the saying, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”

On Monday morning, after America learned that Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort’s lobbying partner, Rick Gates, had been indicted and turned themselves in to federal authorities, the president tried to distance himself from the unfolding scandal. “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” the president wrote in one tweet. A few minutes later, he added, in another, “Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”

At almost the exact same time, news broke suggesting that the F.B.I. has evidence of collusion. We learned that one of the Trump campaign’s foreign policy aides, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his attempts to solicit compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Despite Trump’s hysterical denials and attempts at diversion, the question is no longer whether there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but how extensive it was.

In truth, that’s been clear for a while. If it’s sometimes hard to grasp the Trump campaign’s conspiracy against our democracy, it’s due less to lack of proof than to the impudent improbability of its B-movie plotline. Monday’s indictments offer evidence of things that Washington already knows but pretends to forget. Trump, more gangster than entrepreneur, has long surrounded himself with bottom-feeding scum, and for all his nationalist bluster, his campaign was a vehicle for Russian subversion.

We already knew that Manafort offered private briefings about the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The indictment accuses him of having been an unregistered foreign agent for another Putin-aligned oligarch, the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Trump wasn’t paying Manafort, who reportedly sold himself to the candidate by offering to work free. But he intended to profit from his connection with the campaign, emailing an associate, “How do we use to get whole?” If there were no other evidence against Trump, we could conclude that he was grotesquely irresponsible in opening his campaign up to corrupt foreign infiltration.

But of course there is other evidence against Trump. His campaign was told that Russia wanted to help it, and it welcomed such help. On June 3, remember, the music publicist Rob Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr. to broker a Trump Tower meeting at which a Russian source would deliver “very high level and sensitive information” as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. responded with delight: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”

The guilty plea by Papadopoulos indicates what information Trump Jr. might have been expecting. An obscure figure in foreign policy circles, Papadopoulos was one of five people who Trump listed as foreign policy advisers during a Washington Post editorial board meeting last year. A court filing, whose truth Papadopoulos affirms, says that in April 2016, he met with a professor who he “understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials.” The professor told him that Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, including “thousands of emails.” (The Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta had been hacked in March.)",The Plot Against America,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/mueller-manafort-indictment.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Nor have most provincial governments decided on the minimum age for buyers, or where smoking marijuana will be legal. The federal government must also explain how it will deal with international drug treaties that prohibit marijuana sales.

Even the precise starting date for legal pot is a mystery.

On top of that, and perhaps counterintuitively, police forces are warning that successful inauguration of a legal system for selling marijuana will require an accompanying crackdown on the black market.

Despite all these challenges, suppliers are optimistic that legal recreational sales will be a reality by summer.

“I 100 percent think Canada will be ready,” said John Fowler, the chief executive of Supreme, which has been selling medical marijuana since 2016. “But I think the real question is: What does ‘ready’ mean?”

The answer, Mr. Fowler said, will be managing expectations in the early days.

“Canadians should not expect that on Day 1, the legal market is going to supply the billions of dollars of illegal cannabis being consumed in Canada,” he said in his windowless office at the greenhouse complex near the shore of Lake Huron where employees work in disposable suits and hairnets to avoid contaminating the multimillion-dollar crop. “That will take time, and I think that’s fine.”

Even with the uncertainty, many investors are betting there is money to be made on legal marijuana. Last month, Constellation Brands, a major wine and beer distributor in the United States, invested $245 million in Canopy Growth, the owner of several licensed medical marijuana growers in Canada.

While the commercial side is upbeat, many provincial leaders say Mr. Trudeau’s timetable of legalization by July — one of his main campaign promises — is unrealistic. Some have demanded a delay.

In a statement, Brad Wall, the premier of Saskatchewan, said that he and several of his counterparts believed a postponement was needed to deal with all the questions.

“Despite these concerns, the federal government has not changed its timetable,” Mr. Wall said.

Speaking with reporters last month, Brian Pallister, the premier of Manitoba, said that his province is reluctantly working to meet the federal government’s schedule.

“That doesn’t mean I like it,” he said. “I’m going to continue to express my concerns about the rapidity of this change.”

But Bill Blair, the former police chief of Toronto and a Liberal member of Parliament tasked by Mr. Trudeau with overseeing the marijuana issue, said that the government will stick with its plan. He dismissed suggestions that the process was rushed, noting that the federal government had been discussing the issue with provinces for two years.

“I don’t minimize the complexity of the work ahead,” Mr. Blair said on Friday. “But by establishing a date for implementation, it’s focused the process.” Further delay, he added, “just facilitates vast windfalls of profit to criminal enterprises.”

Of the three provinces that have released broad outlines, the plans put forth by Ontario and Alberta, although sketchy, treat marijuana much like alcohol.

In Alberta, marijuana will be available in licensed, privately owned shops. Ontario, which has a population of 13.6 million spanning two time zones, will set up 150 government-owned stores. The buying ages will be 18 in Alberta, 19 in Ontario. (Ontario introduced legislation for its new system this past week, but many important details will come later.)

How the provinces and the federal government will divide the tax revenue is still unclear. Governments do not want a repeat of their experience with cigarettes, in which high taxes intended to discourage smoking created a large black market.

Many police forces are among the groups calling for a delay. While a new law will allow the police to use saliva tests to identify marijuana-impaired drivers, what will qualify as impairment has yet to be defined. Little equipment to conduct the tests is now in the field, and few officers have been trained in its use.

“Are we going to be ready?” asked Mario Harel, the president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the head of the force in Gatineau, Quebec. “We don’t think so. We’re dealing with a lot of situations so we’re going to be doing our best to be as ready as possible.”

While some Canadians are questioning the accuracy of salvia tests, Robert Mann, a scientist at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health who studies cannabis use, said the tests have proved valid in other countries, although he acknowledged that marijuana’s active ingredient was not as easily measured as alcohol.

His larger concern, he said, is changing public opinion about whether it is safe to drive under the influence of marijuana.

“There’s quite a common perception that you can drive safely under the influence of cannabis,” Dr. Mann said, adding that this view is based in part on now-refuted research from about 20 years ago. “It took quite a while for people’s attitudes about drinking and driving to change.”

The authorities have also faced black-market sales in stores after Mr. Trudeau’s legalization announcement. Cities and provinces have taken different approaches to the black-market shops. In Vancouver, where they are most numerous, officials try to keep control through business licenses. In other areas, particularly Quebec, the police have moved swiftly to close them down.

Mr. Trudeau’s government has repeatedly said that the stores are illegal and will not be a part of the new recreational market.

Brendan Kennedy, the president of Tilray, a licensed medical marijuana producer, said the experience of American states with legalization suggested that the stores will quickly wither away in the face of a legal alternative — provided that “there is adequate supply and adequate locations of legal products.”

Mr. Harel, the police chief, is less certain the black market will vanish anytime soon after legalization.

He anticipates that the illegal market will aggressively promote food laced with marijuana, one of many products that will not immediately be allowed under the new system. In his view, the success of the legal system will rest on swiftly and aggressively shutting down the black market.

“We figure it’s an $8 billion-a-year economy,” he said of illegal marijuana sales. Legalization, he added, will change the dynamics of the black market. “But we don’t think it will fade away.”","Ready or Not, Recreational Marijuana Use Is Coming to Canada",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/canada/canada-marijuana-legal-justin-trudeau.html

(The style seems especially popular among women in their 20s and 30s — trumping the received wisdom that one should flaunt one’s body before it is marked by the supposed scourges of childbearing or menopause.) It can also sometimes seem like an elitist project of sociocultural self-positioning: By embracing the covered-up look, you declare yourself part of a particular psychographic tribe, one whose members don’t just dress for other women, but for a particular subset of other women — those who get it, who are sophisticated enough to understand that opting out of conventional beauty standards makes for its own kind of conceptual, better-than-thou fashion. It also, however, has the feel of a real dare. Observing this version of feminist signaling, which conflates the rebel, haphazard spirit of a Bloomsbury Group-like smockishness with traces of early ’90s grunge and a dash of post-bellum Sunday best, we might begin to ask ourselves: What happens when women start dressing in ways that are less than conventionally flattering? Why are they doing it? And what does it look like when fashion choices that might have been linked to female oppression perform in the service of liberation?

HISTORICALLY, CONSERVATIVE dressing is most frequently associated with religious adherence, which makes the most recent, trendier iteration of the phenomenon especially surprising — considering the kind of woman who is newly sheathing herself in long, baggy silhouettes is often the type of liberal nonbeliever who’d be the first to eschew any traditional strictures on her choices, sartorial or otherwise. Orthodox Jews follow the laws of tzniut (literally “modesty” in Hebrew), according to which the body of a woman — and her hair, too, if she’s married — should be substantively covered; observant Muslim women often wear a version of the hijab and loose-fitting, figure-obscuring clothing in public settings; and women in traditional Christian communities, from Amish to Mennonite, wear long dresses and, sometimes, some form of head covering. But whether one believes it’s a marker of outdated patriarchal coercion or a choice to be made by the devout woman herself, what seems clear is that this kind of dressing has until recently been seen as miles away from what a modern secular woman would want to wear.

This contradiction might be best embodied in the story of the lifestyle magazine Kinfolk — a publication that led the charge in advancing the kind of woodsy-hipster design-and-fashion aesthetic that has grown popular in America’s most liberal enclaves, from Silver Lake to Fort Greene, but that also has its roots in the Mormon upbringing of its founders, who established it in 2011 while attending Brigham Young University-Hawaii. The humble, homespun spirit usually associated with retiring, self-enclosed communities of believers has been imported, not unlike the covered-up dressing trend, to an arena that feels largely alien to it, but that embraces its tenets — the handcrafted, the natural, the rustic — at least inasmuch as they can be marketed as a kind of soothing artisanal salve to the alienations of late-capitalist life.

SPEAKING TO some nonreligious women who tend to dress modestly, however, goes a way toward clarifying the style’s utility and function, as well as some of its inherent ambiguities. Thirty-two-year-old Hannah Hoffman, who runs her own eponymous gallery in Los Angeles, says she prefers figure-enshrouding outfits, mostly from Céline, to any other look. This is a matter of being both mobile and versatile — with her low heels and wide-cut pants, Hoffman told me, she can always jump up to grab an artwork or walk clients through her space — but the roots of her choices go deeper. “Everyone who’s involved on the commercial side of the art world is transacting on desire, for an object but also for an experience,” she said. “So you have to walk a very particular line in order to not dilute it, or misrepresent it, so people won’t get confused about what you’re selling them.” As a young woman helming her own business, this is a line that Hoffman feels she has to be careful not to cross, and she told me that rather than a more conventionally feminine aura, she prefers to project a “rigor and intellectual thoughtfulness” with her clothing choices. Commenting on the body-conscious silhouette prevalent among assistant-level gallery girls when she was starting in the art world in the mid-2000s, Hoffman noted how the power of a certain breed of male gallery owner had often seemed to her to be transacted through exactly such specters of young female sexuality, “and that’s not something you want to do.” Still, sometimes she wonders why she is the one who has to police the boundaries of appropriateness: Why is it, she said, that “if you wear a short skirt and a collector hits on you, it’s your fault?”

There is something dispiriting (though perhaps not surprising, considering, for one, who America elected for president) about the ongoing need to consider such questions — after at least three waves of feminism have asserted a woman’s right to self-determination over her own body, and, by extension, her clothing choices. Haven’t we realized by now that women not only shouldn’t be held responsible for men’s misreading of their cues, but that, moreover, they might come to see their bodies and sexuality as a source of power to be reveled in rather than guarded? (Certainly, another recent leaning in fashion — that toward body positivity and acceptance — has been championing exposing rather than obscuring bodies of all sizes.)

Still, Hoffman’s perspective is familiar and understandable: Being a woman, one needs to frequently assess others’ expectations over and against one’s own. As the 21-year-old actress, writer and editor Tavi Gevinson told me, the relative modesty — or lack thereof — of her clothing choices reflects more than her own individual preferences. If she’s going on an audition, she won’t dress in what she called “a frumpy art teacher look” (a look, as she joked during our conversation, that could also be called “Brooklyn mom” or “European baby”). Rather, “I would dress in something that makes my figure look nice, because people are stupid, and most of the time when they say, ‘We want her to come in again,’ what they really mean is ‘Wear something more conventionally attractive.’ ” In the publishing world, however, when Gevinson wants to be taken more seriously, as a thinker rather than a body, a dowdier look is helpful, so she can seem, she said, “as if I’ve somehow matured past a quote unquote juvenile desire to be perceived as a woman.” The formula, then, is flipped, but not in a way that’s necessarily more freeing.

THE STATE OF wanting to be looked at is often mingled with self-consciousness about that very desire. I’ve always thought that one of the reasons the “Little House on the Prairie” books continue to be popular with tween girls, many decades after they were first published, is that their presentation of the difficulties inherent to a girl’s maturation into womanhood are mediated through the cushioning presence of yards of calico, wool and muslin. As a 10-year-old, excited but terrified at the prospect of my own encroaching puberty, reading the passages in “Little Town on the Prairie” (1941) detailing, say, Mary Ingalls’s going-away-to-college outfit, with its “gored skirt of brown cashmere,” and “overskirt ... of brown-and-blue plaid” not to mention its confusingly named “flounced train” and “pleated flounce” (were those one and the same?) acted as a balm, a calming litany; covered-up fashion, it seemed, could protect you from the grenade that your body was slowly but surely becoming.

Keeping this potential explosiveness to oneself, however, could also be understood as a sign of strength. As 32-year-old Aminatou Sow, a digital strategist and the co-host of the popular podcast “Call Your Girlfriend,” told me, “if you let women dress for themselves, we’d all be wearing muumuus and caftans.” Sow, who grew up Muslim in Guinea and Nigeria before moving to Europe and then the States, cited the comfort factor of these silhouettes (“anything that looks like a sack is my jam”), but also the sense of inner confidence that they foster, one that she first recognized in the women she grew up among in West Africa. “It’s part of my cultural heritage. ... I don’t need to show my shoulders, I don’t need to show my back. I know what I’m carrying underneath this thing,” she said. “I really disagree with women who think walking around naked is liberation. I’m like, ‘I’m sorry, too may people get to enjoy this for it to be liberation,’ ” she added, only half in jest. Instead, she cites figures like Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who, first as actresses and street-style sensations and later as designers of the Row, made dressing in long, hobo-ish layers chic. “It was really jarring, and men didn’t like it,” Sow recalled to me. “But there was something disgusting and liberating about it. These were girls who didn’t care how anyone else was supposed to be dressing. It was the rejection of body politics.”

Navigating the world in a woman’s body remains a fraught proposition in the most quotidian and granular of ways. And a woman with her body de-emphasized, with her conventional calling card scrapped — what a puzzle she is! I recall a couple of years ago walking in downtown Manhattan and spotting the writer Sheila Heti across the street. It was late fall, and as far as I can recall, Heti, whom I’ve never met, was wearing a knee-length nubby coat over a long skirt and some practical lace-up shoes, all in varying shades of gray and brown. In all the more typical ways, she was looking maybe a little drab, maybe a little dowdy. And yet, there was something about her air that was enviable. There she was, walking along, her hair in a ponytail, carrying a book and swinging it at her side, as if without a care in the world. She seemed completely at home — and completely herself — in her essentially concealed body.","Modest Dressing, as a Virtue",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/t-magazine/modest-fashion-clothes.html

The disease of extremism rampages through Albert Camus’s “State of Siege,” a deservedly minor 1948 play revived by the director Emmanuel Demarcy-Mota of Théâtre de la Ville in Paris and presented by the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The energetic staging — in French with English supertitles — is a master class in how to make a bad play better. But not even Mr. Demarcy-Mota’s stylish interventions can make “State of Siege” anything more than a hollow allegory.

On a breezy summer night in Cadiz, Spain, a ballad plays and couples sway. Then a comet flames across the sky, heralding the arrival of the Plague (Serge Maggiani) and his slinky secretary (Valérie Dashwood), a grim reaper in lingerie. The Plague seizes power in the town, bullying the populace and curbing civil liberties. Truth is a casualty, so is love. Language suffers, too. Words like freedom — liberté if you don’t like looking at the supertitles — lose all meaning.

How do we understand this Plague, a man who stomps around the stage in a black overcoat? Is he a grave illness or a fascist bureaucrat? Which is worse?

“State of Siege,” which flopped at its Paris debut, can be read as a peculiar companion piece to Camus’s 1947 novel “The Plague,” about a pandemic that overtakes an Algerian town. Here the symbolism is starker, the characters more crudely sketched.

It’s a political allegory, a form that has lately saturated New York theater. Like several other recent productions — “1984,” “Rhinoceros,” Shakespeare in the Park’s “Julius Caesar” — “State of Siege” sometimes misses the symbolic mark and sometimes hits it as squarely as a punch in the nose.

Lady Bird will put on the dress and wear it out and think nothing of it.","Gerwig has acted in 25 films and co-written five, but “Lady Bird,” her first solo directorial project, is the most unadulterated distillation of her sensibility to date. The title character is a high-school senior, played with winning naturalness by Saoirse Ronan, who lives in Sacramento and attends an all-girls Catholic school. She was born Christine, but demands to be called by the name she has given herself — as if she were a pop star, or being constantly confirmed in the faith. The film’s working title was “Mothers and Daughters,” and Gerwig is especially attentive to Lady Bird’s tempestuous relationship with her mother, Marion, played with brilliant, wounded toughness by Laurie Metcalf. Their fights hit every note and tempo: nagging, bickering, quarrelsome, sniping, passive-aggression, shouting, screaming, wailing, whispered rage.

Lady Bird is a delicious and daring weirdo. She shows up to audition for the school musical with a prepared belter. She runs a long-shot campaign for class president every fall, just because she can. Her hair is stringy and dyed. She is sexy without being conventionally pretty, and when she decides she likes a boy, she writes his name in marker on her bedroom wall and pursues him boldly. Saying that she “puts herself out there” is an understatement. She throws herself over every cliff. (At one point, she throws herself out of a moving car.) She’s the girl — I’m stealing this from Ronan, who told me that she “admires” the character — whom you didn’t even know you wanted to be. That all this buoyant confidence feels so effervescently radical is a testament to the humor and intelligence of Gerwig’s script. That it is so rare is an indictment of our woman-hating culture, which makes a depiction of a smart teenage girl who likes herself and chases her desires seem like news.

Gerwig couldn’t have played Lady Bird; she’s 34. But it’s notable that she didn’t choose to write a character she could have played. Perhaps she didn’t want to confuse the issue. A female body onscreen has a way of obscuring, or distracting from, the intelligence offscreen. She is already well established as an actor — the critic Richard Brody has called her “the most important new actor” to emerge in the last 10 years of American independent film. What shines through in Gerwig’s performances is a quality of radiant openness. Jay Duplass, the filmmaker and actor who directed Gerwig in the 2008 movie “Baghead,” described her to me as a “spazzy genius” who has “the courage to let herself unfold in front of other people.” Think of her toddling down the steps behind the Times Square TKTS booth in “Mistress America,” issuing a cornball greeting to her soon-to-be-stepsister standing below: “Welcome to the Great White Way!” And the frozen smile on her face, as she continues her grand descent, trying awkwardly, antically, to hold on to the magic of making an entrance.

Her smile is of the huge, gum-baring variety. She talks with her whole body. She was a live wire in Mary Bronstein’s “Yeast” and enchanting in Whit Stillman’s “Damsels in Distress” and a little out of place in Pablo Larraín’s “Jackie,” where all she did was stand around. She needs to be moving — galloping down the street or shoving somebody through a door or doing a shuffle-ball-change. The writer, artist and filmmaker Miranda July, when I asked her about Gerwig’s physicality, told me, “She looks very strong, and she can either spin that into something that’s grounded and familiar and funny or into something that’s really quite beautiful and dancerly.” She can sing and tap too. I’ve heard her compared to Diane Keaton, which I’m sure she’d like — for a while as a teenager she tried to dress like Annie Hall — but I think of her as a taller Irene Dunne. Except that instead of being in movies about love affairs, she is in movies — and making movies — about women self-actualizing and paying their bills.

The check arrived, and I reached for my wallet. Gerwig became concerned. “You can put this on The New York Times?” she said. “I just always worry.” After breakfast, while we were power-walking through the West Village, I mentioned that I had seen that she was doing a voice part in Wes Anderson’s forthcoming animated movie, “Isle of Dogs.” She remarked that Anderson’s previous animated film, “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” isn’t “really” about animals. “It’s not?” I said, which prompted the beginnings of an earnest analysis, until I cut her off to explain that I had been kidding. “Ohhhhh,” she said. “I don’t understand sarcasm. I take it seriously!” Her T’s are shiny and bright, like the ringing of a hand bell.

When Gerwig went out to raise the money for “Lady Bird,” she noticed something interesting. Most of the potential funders she met with were men, of course — that’s not the interesting thing. It’s men, for the most part, who have the power and money to finance films. “What I typically found,” she said, “was that if they had daughters or had been raised with sisters, they understood what it was, and if they didn’t, they kind of couldn’t believe that women actually fought like that, which was an interesting window into why some stories can’t get told. People don’t understand that they’re even a story to tell.”

Gerwig has long been interested in how women fight. “Frances Ha” (2013), the film she made with her partner, Noah Baumbach, begins with two best friends sparring gleefully in Washington Square Park. Over the course of the film, they fall out in the usual way — very slowly and then all at once — but by the end are back in each other’s lives, casually, at arm’s length. In “Mistress America” (2015), which Gerwig and Baumbach also made together, a major act of betrayal leads to the severing of a bond between two women. In “Lady Bird” the fights between mother and daughter are constant — at once background noise and main event. Every situation is pretext for a confrontation: underdone eggs, a pile of rumpled clothes, a hand reaching too quickly for the radio. The question on the surface might be What did you do? but the feeling underneath is Who are you and why don’t you know how to love me?

The visual style of “Lady Bird” is intentionally unshowy — most shots are framed and still, so that attention is focused on the actors and the dialogue. Language is what matters. There was no improvisation on the set, and the movie matches the shooting script “probably 95 percent.” The writer and director Lena Dunham told me that what she often admires about Gerwig’s dialogue is the contrast between erudition and naturalism — “In one breath she’ll be referencing a superobscure book and also utilizing the awkward parlance of our times.” “Lady Bird” does that, too. Gerwig expects her audience to be well read enough to get what’s funny about a nun referencing Kierkegaard’s “love story” (Kierkegaard broke off his engagement) but also to laugh when Lady Bird tells her friend that they’re done with “the learning portion of high school.” The rhythm is very quick, and much of the humor lies in the way that characters respond to or undercut one another. My favorite joke of the movie is when Lady Bird, after passing her driver’s test, profusely thanks the guy from the D.M.V. “It’s not a thanking situation,” he says. “You either pass or you don’t.”

The plot is structured according to the “rituals” of senior year — homecoming, prom — which Gerwig has said she imagined “unfolding in a series of placed scenes like Stations of the Cross.” Emotional drama presents itself in the form of Lady Bird’s two boyfriends, Danny and Kyle, and a rough patch with her best friend, Julie, but the big narrative question is where Lady Bird will go to college. She longs to go to a private East Coast (i.e., outrageously expensive) college; her family expects her to stay in state. As it is, they’re barely keeping it together, moneywise. Marion works double shifts as a psychiatric nurse, and Lady Bird’s father, played by Tracy Letts, has lost his job. They live in a shabby, cramped house that is literally on the wrong side of the railroad tracks. (Marion and Lady Bird’s favorite Sunday-afternoon activity is dropping in at real estate open houses and admiring what they cannot have.) But “those East Coast schools” carry complex symbolic weight for Lady Bird: They mean possibility, and glamour, and leaving home, and something like self-worth. The movie doesn’t totally endorse her fantasy, but it is a little unsettling, in this moment, to witness a narrative triumph that hinges on a teenager’s assumption of a lifetime of student debt.

Gerwig wrote “Lady Bird” partly as a response to films about boys growing up. At the New York Film Festival, she asked the crowd: “What is ‘Boyhood,’ but for a girl? What is ‘The 400 Blows,’ but for a girl? What is personhood for young women?” In most films, girls exist to be looked at. Sometimes they help a male protagonist come to a realization about himself. Sometimes they die. Gerwig makes Lady Bird the one who looks: at boys but also houses, magazines, books, clothes and at the city of Sacramento. She also takes the wind out of a particular kind of male self-seriousness around cultural objects. Toward the end of the movie, a very drunk Lady Bird is in her dorm room with a boy — the kind of boy who would invite you to see “The 400 Blows” on a first date — who is flipping through her CD case. He scoffs that her taste in music sucks: All she has are greatest-hits albums. “But they’re the greatest,” she says. They immediately start making out.

As in “Boyhood,” “Lady Bird” is remarkable for what doesn’t happen. No one dies. No one overdoses. Conflicts are reconciled. The film is ostensibly about a young girl’s ambition, but the mood is one of poignant loss. “There is a certain vividness in worlds that are coming to an end,” Gerwig wrote in the production notes. “It is something beautiful that you never appreciated and ends just as you come to understand it.” Her characters are always preternaturally nostalgic, able to look back on recent hurts with the bittersweet regard that it takes more rancorous humans a lifetime to achieve. She loves Mike Leigh and Éric Rohmer, but the movie moment that will always stay with her is the end of “Annie Hall”: “When they leave each other, and he says it’s just nice knowing her, and you’re like, ugh! That’s life!”

There are no jerks or bullies in “Lady Bird,” no one who intentionally manipulates or abuses, no one who hates or is hateable, no one who holds a grudge. All the characters are doing their best — it’s just nice to know them. You can’t accuse Gerwig of a lack of seriousness; her conversation is peppered with references to George Eliot, Elena Ferrante, Maggie Nelson, Simone Weil, Milton and Kierkegaard. But the way she distributes sympathy has an undeniably magical effect. The result is delightful and a little bit romantic — delightful, perhaps, because it is romantic, showing life as it should be, or could be.

“I have a deep need to take care of my characters,” she said to me at breakfast. “It’s not that I don’t want to go down the dark avenues — I want to hold their hands down the dark avenues. I want to walk with them while they go there and give them the dignity of representing it honestly, and finding the thing that is grace-filled.”

Early reviews of “Lady Bird” have referred to the film as “autobiographical.” The word irks Gerwig. “I was doing interviews in Toronto,” she said to me, “and people would say, ‘Well, it’s autobiographical,’ and I’d think: Do you know my autobiography? How do you know that this is autobiographical? That’s a leap!”

“Autobiographical” can carry a whiff of dismissal, a suggestion that the achievement was somehow easier to pull off because it involved less creative effort. There are, to be sure, parallels to reality: Gerwig is from Sacramento and went to an all-girls Catholic school before attending a college in New York, Barnard, on scholarships and loans. But she wasn’t like Lady Bird as a high-school student. She followed the rules.

Still, only a person who liked high school could have written this movie. And Gerwig liked high school. There were the usual cliques and hierarchies, but because it was a Catholic school, the focus was on being a good citizen of the community and using your talents for a higher purpose. She refers to the nuns who taught her as “really groovy.” She admits to “some teenage anger” and says that her fights with her mother were “epic,” but “for me, epic fighting never spelled lack of love.” Her eyes widened. “Some of my friends have been, like, ‘You can really scare the [expletive] out of me,’ and I’m like, ‘Oh, no, that’s just me being close!’ ”

“These are my parents,” Gerwig said, holding out her phone.

We were in a greenroom at Lincoln Center, during the New York Film Festival. Previously I had seen Gerwig dressed down in casual settings, carrying a backpack: drinking coffee on a park bench, being shushed at Film Forum for talking during a movie. Now she was in busy professional mode: Proenza Schouler dress, eyeliner, flanked by publicists. On the phone, her parents were squinting in sunshine, from what looked to be a very nice vacation in San Diego.

Gerwig is close to her parents. (They appeared as Frances’s parents in “Frances Ha.”) Her mother is a retired OB/GYN nurse and her father works in small-business loans for a credit union. “I always felt like they were both artists without being artists,” she said. At the holidays, the house overflowed with guests. Her father plays “a ton” of instruments. Her mother has a closet in the hallway where she keeps presents, wrapped, for all different ages — just in case someone comes over and it’s her birthday.

As a child, Gerwig had a tendency to become obsessive — first about ballet, which she had to quit (her hips lacked turnout, and her knees couldn’t take it), and then about fencing, which her mother urged her to put aside, lest she become “a mono-person.” In high school she got into theater, and in college she continued acting and writing plays. One play she wrote featured a seduction scene in which someone breaks a jar of mayonnaise onstage. Another one, which involved a daughter murdering her mother, was written in two weeks’ time, after a group lost the rights to perform “Misery.” She always liked movies, but it wasn’t until she started renting DVDs from the indie video store Kim’s while a student at Barnard that she thought of film as an art made by directors. “Beau Travail” was the movie that helped her truly understand cinema. She didn’t realize until she saw Claire Denis’s name in the credits that it had been directed by a woman. She remembers thinking: That’s a job you can have?

After she was rejected from M.F.A. programs in playwriting, she began acting in very-low-budget, independent “mumblecore” films, including “LOL,” “Hannah Takes the Stairs” and “Nights and Weekends,” which she directed with Joe Swanberg. In 2010 she broke through to the mainstream, when she appeared in Noah Baumbach’s “Greenberg.” After “Greenberg,” she and Baumbach, who had been married to Jennifer Jason Leigh, became a couple, and together they wrote two films that Gerwig starred in: “Frances Ha” and “Mistress America,” which feature some unmistakable Gerwigian traits. Their protagonists are semidelusional female dreamers, surrounded by rich people and anxious about money, with hearts pure enough to put them in a Dostoyevsky novel. But film is a director’s medium, and occasionally Gerwig’s work on these projects was dismissed by journalists and people in the industry. “Something that used to really hurt me is, people would say, ‘Did you help write the script?’ And I’d say: ‘I co-wrote it. I didn’t “help” to write it,’ ” she said. “It used to make my blood rise.”

Gerwig calls her last 10 years of working in film “my version of my 10,000 hours.” When she finished the writing of “Lady Bird” in 2015, she knew she had to direct it herself. “I thought, Yes, there is more to learn, but you are not going to keep learning it by not doing it. You will only now learn the next part if you go ahead and do it.”

Acting in films under two female directors, Rebecca Miller and Mia Hansen-Love, helped “shift” something in her. She recalls a conversation with Hansen-Love, who had been in two films directed by her partner, Olivier Assayas. “She had worked at Cahiers du Cinéma,” Gerwig says. “She said that the other young male writers there treated her dismissively because they thought of her as Olivier’s girlfriend, who got there because she was his girlfriend, and how they changed when she had her first movie at Cannes, when she was in her 20s. All of a sudden they looked at her like they’d never seen her before. I hung onto that story. All those little pieces I put in my pocket. I think I needed these little signs.”

Several years ago, Gerwig was at Miranda July’s house. It was early in their friendship (and before Gerwig’s turn as a punk photographer in “20th Century Women,” which was directed by Mike Mills, July’s husband). On her way out, July offered her a pair of shoes: Rachel Comey loafers that didn’t quite suit July. Not long after, Rebecca Miller, who was directing her in the romantic comedy “Maggie’s Plan,” handed over a pair of “sturdy English shoes that you can see women wearing who were on their way to work in the ’30s.” The meaning wasn’t lost on Gerwig. “I thought, If I wrote this into a movie, people would think it was too obvious of a symbol,” she says. “I was literally given shoes by two female directors. And it felt like, if you’re looking for a sign, there you go!” The shoes acquired talismanic powers. She wore them to the “Lady Bird” set whenever she needed an extra boost.

Movie sets have not historically been comfortable environments for women. Less than a month has passed since the publication of the articles in The New York Times and The New Yorker claiming sexual abuse of women by the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. That Gerwig is a confident young woman making movies about confident young women feels especially meaningful right now. It is not merely Gerwig’s being a woman that feels relevant but her directorial style. She extends the same protective impulse to her cast that she does to her characters, saying that the job of a director is to “hold the perimeter” of “a bubble of magic safety” so that actors can play. I spoke with several actors from “Lady Bird,” as well as with Sam Levy, the cinematographer, and heard again and again how cared-for, and safe, they felt on Gerwig’s set. She ran rehearsals at her apartment and conscripted the cast into awkward dance parties (a trick cribbed from Mills). She encouraged the actors to have secrets from her — things they knew about their characters that she didn’t.

“I trusted her completely,” says Metcalf, who adds that she relied on Gerwig to help her understand the character of Marion. “On the page it could just be like a nonstop aggression. But she taught me what the character was covering up.”

“I wanted Marion to secretly be the main character,” Gerwig told me. “I kind of wanted her to take over the movie.”

The history of mothers on film is one littered with angels and witches. Marion is neither. She’s tender and loving but doesn’t know how to express it; she is often impatient, can be nasty and aggressive and doesn’t support Lady Bird in the way she wants to be supported. (We might call this good mothering, in that she is helping Lady Bird to separate from home.) She doesn’t exactly take over the movie — the film ends on a shot of Lady Bird, alone, on a New York street, with Marion left behind — but she does center it. There is one scene in particular that is a kind of anchor. It shows Marion at her sewing machine, fixing a dress that Lady Bird will wear to a fancy Thanksgiving dinner at her boyfriend’s grandmother’s mansion. Marion would prefer that Lady Bird spend Thanksgiving at home, but she’s helping her anyway, first by shopping with her at the thrift store, and now by mending the dress.

The shot is framed squarely, in dim lighting, with Metcalf looking drab and dour in the center. It is very brief, a few seconds long, and silent, except for the wild thrum of the needle. It’s Gerwig’s homage to “Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,” Chantal Akerman’s classic 1975 drama of a three-day unraveling, consisting mostly of shots of a woman doing repeated household chores. Gerwig told the audience at the New York Film Festival that she was moved by a remark that Akerman once made about the importance of seeing images of housework on film. “We value watching a woman get raped more than we value her making dinner,” Gerwig said, incredulity and disgust mixing in her voice. If there are Lady Birds in the world, it is only because there are Marions — mothers, and foremothers — who brought them up. Lady Bird will put on the dress and wear it out and think nothing of it. But we saw the care Marion took, late at night and all alone, to alter, ever so slightly, what was possible.",Greta Gerwig’s Radical Confidence,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/magazine/greta-gerwigs-radical-confidence.html

(She began to experience visual and auditory hallucinations as a child and they continue.) She has characterized art as her chance for salvation both here and in the afterlife.

Now 88, Ms. Kusama works nonstop and, if you’re wondering, does all the painting herself, save for a ground color applied by assistants. Recently she shifted her workweek from five days to six, saving Sunday for writing, reading, talking on the phone and making smaller paintings. She and her art run the gamut from avant-garde to popular to outsider to whiz-bang conjuring. The pixieish creature we see in a bright orange wig wearing clothes printed with patterns from her art is only her most recent public persona. She plays cute grandma to Jeff Koons’s cheerful robot, to cite another widely known artist’s self-presentation.

The new Zwirner space in New York, on East 69th Street, is presenting “Infinity Nets,” a beautiful display of 10 paintings, all from this year, that make a surprisingly good case for Ms. Kusama’s continuing reprises of her Net paintings from the early 1960s. Who knows how many of these works exist, but individually they can mesmerize. Their surfaces of little commalike strokes resembling knitting are ancestors of the artist’s polka dots.","Yayoi Kusama and the Amazing Polka-Dotted, Selfie-Made Journey to Greatness",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/arts/design/yayoi-kusama-david-zwirner-festival-of-life-review.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

3. As all that’s going on, Republicans on Capitol Hill are trying to muscle a new tax plan onto President Trump’s desk by Christmas. It proposes $1 trillion in tax cuts for businesses, and roughly half that for individuals.

Although the long-term benefit to middle-class families is uncertain, there are a few clear winners and losers.

Adding additional wrinkles, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, above center, said he was considering folding the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s so-called individual mandate into the developing tax plan, which already includes language that would enshrine in federal law certain legal rights for fetuses.

5. A clearer picture is emerging of Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in Manhattan that left eight people dead. An Uzbek who immigrated via a now-controversial diversity lottery program, he led a rootless life and, according to a former friend, had “monsters inside.” Wounded by police gunfire, he was able to make a court appearance.

President Trump urged the death penalty, expressing frustration at the pace of terrorism trials.

He was also angered by the lack of a federal investigation into his political rivals and by the sentencing of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl — who received a dishonorable discharge, but no prison time, for walking off his Army base in Afghanistan in 2009. These grievances led Mr. Trump to issue perhaps the most vocal criticisms of the justice system from an American president.

The report had been approved for release by the White House with less friction than many scientists had expected. The administration, however, appeared to undercut the findings in a statement that said, “The climate has changed and is always changing.”

Instead of trying to prevent arguments, we should be modeling courteous conflict and teaching kids how to have healthy disagreements.
If kids don’t learn to wobble, they never learn to walk; they end up standing still.","It turns out that highly creative adults often grow up in families full of tension. Not fistfights or personal insults, but real disagreements. When adults in their early 30s were asked to write imaginative stories, the most creative ones came from those whose parents had the most conflict a quarter-century earlier. Their parents had clashing views on how to raise children. They had different values and attitudes and interests. And when highly creative architects and scientists were compared with their technically skilled but less original peers, the innovators often had more friction in their families. As the psychologist Robert Albert put it, “the creative person-to-be comes from a family that is anything but harmonious, one with a ‘wobble.’ ”

Wilber and Orville Wright came from a wobbly family. Their father, a preacher, never met a moral fight he wasn’t willing to pick. They watched him clash with school authorities who weren’t fond of his decision to let his kids miss a half-day of school from time to time to learn on their own. Their father believed so much in embracing arguments that despite being a bishop in the local church, he had multiple books by atheists in his library — and encouraged his children to read them.

If we rarely see a spat, we learn to shy away from the threat of conflict. Witnessing arguments — and participating in them — helps us grow a thicker skin. We develop the will to fight uphill battles and the skill to win those battles, and the resilience to lose a battle today without losing our resolve tomorrow. For the Wright brothers, argument was the family trade and a fierce one was something to be savored. Conflict was something to embrace and resolve. “I like scrapping with Orv,” Wilbur said.

The Wright brothers weren’t alone. The Beatles fought over instruments and lyrics and melodies. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony clashed over the right way to win the right to vote. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak argued incessantly while designing the first Apple computer. None of these people succeeded in spite of the drama — they flourished because of it. Brainstorming groups generate 16 percent more ideas when the members are encouraged to criticize one another. The most creative ideas in Chinese technology companies and the best decisions in American hospitals come from teams that have real disagreements early on. Breakthrough labs in microbiology aren’t full of enthusiastic collaborators cheering one another on but of skeptical scientists challenging one another’s interpretations.

If no one ever argues, you’re not likely to give up on old ways of doing things, let alone try new ones. Disagreement is the antidote to groupthink. We’re at our most imaginative when we’re out of sync. There’s no better time than childhood to learn how to dish it out — and to take it.

As Samuel Johnson was growing up, his parents argued constantly. He described a family as “a little kingdom, torn with factions and exposed to revolutions.” He went on to write one of the greatest dictionaries in history, one that had a lasting impact on the English language and wasn’t supplanted until the Oxford English Dictionary appeared more than a century later. Who would be more motivated and qualified to clean up a messy language than someone whose household was filled with it?

Children need to learn the value of thoughtful disagreement. Sadly, many parents teach kids that if they disagree with someone, it’s polite to hold their tongues. Rubbish. What if we taught kids that silence is bad manners? It disrespects the other person’s ability to have a civil argument — and it disrespects the value of your own viewpoint and your own voice. It’s a sign of respect to care enough about someone’s opinion that you’re willing to challenge it.

We can also help by having disagreements openly in front of our kids. Most parents hide their conflicts: They want to present a united front, and they don’t want kids to worry. But when parents disagree with each other, kids learn to think for themselves. They discover that no authority has a monopoly on truth. They become more tolerant of ambiguity. Rather than conforming to others’ opinions, they come to rely on their own independent judgment.

It doesn’t seem to matter how often parents argue; what counts is how they handle arguments when they happen. Creativity tends to flourish, Mr. Albert, the psychologist, found, in families that are “tense but secure.” In a recent study of children ages 5 to 7, the ones whose parents argued constructively felt more emotionally safe. Over the next three years, those kids showed greater empathy and concern for others. They were friendlier and more helpful toward their classmates in school.

Instead of trying to prevent arguments, we should be modeling courteous conflict and teaching kids how to have healthy disagreements. We can start with four rules:

• Frame it as a debate, rather than a conflict.

• Argue as if you’re right but listen as if you’re wrong.

• Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person’s perspective.

• Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you’ve learned from them.

Good arguments are wobbly: a team or family might rock back and forth but it never tips over.

But times change, and a conceptual makeover was necessary — and not just to boost his box-office appeal. Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn’t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It’s a good fit, at least for a while. Like some other superheroes, Thor has been good for the occasional light, mocking laugh, often hooked to his otherworldly identity: He’s a god (as he likes to announce), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and so forth. For much of “Ragnarok,” he’s a playfully sustained joke.

As a storyteller, the director Taika Waititi (“Hunt for the Wilderpeople”) has a charmingly idiosyncratic human touch and a gift for turning goofiness and gab into personality. That gift is first evident here in the intimate huddles between Thor and whoever happens to be within chatting (or shouting) distance. There’s a lot of yakking, some barking; at one point, Odin does some god-splaining. The Chatty Cathies also include Thor’s sister, Hela (a vamping Cate Blanchett), an overgrown Goth Girl with smudged eye makeup and killer dominatrix looks who plays very hard. She lusts for Odin’s realm, which remains as drearily amorphous and anonymous as before.

The story is an uninteresting thicket of brawls, machinations and useful coincidences. (Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay.) Soon after Hela appears, she moves back home and Thor lands elsewhere, allowing her to run amok — kill, strut, repeat — and him to leisurely settle into his new, more lighthearted mode until it’s serious hammer time. Much of his great un-Thoring happens on Sakaar, a planetary garbage dump run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum, comically jiving and dithering), a psychopath Auntie Mame in flowing gold lamé and blue fingernail polish who suggests a low-rent version of Stanley Tucci’s host in “The Hunger Games.”

The Grandmaster presides over a gladiatorial game, an exasperatingly lazy and uninteresting story development that is mostly (mostly) alleviated by Mr. Waititi’s handling of the material. It’s here that the vibe relaxes and the picture’s filigree becomes brighter and wittier as extras with puffball hairdos straight out of Dr. Seuss light up the background. It’s also here that Thor reunites with the Hulk, who’s been crushing the gladiatorial competition on an extended incredible bender. After he and Thor engage in some Steinbeckian George-and-Lennie riffing, the Hulk’s inner mouse, Bruce Banner, takes over, and Mark Ruffalo eases in to help turn the temperature from hot to cozy.

For a guy who looks chiseled by Michelangelo, Mr. Hemsworth can be a surprisingly agile physical performer, capable of real bounce, and he clearly likes ricocheting off walls as much as he does ceding center stage to the other actors.

His ascent and brash approach have angered some members of the royal family.

Prince Alwaleed, with his Omar Sharif mustache, ubiquitous sunshades and penchant for publicity, is a relatively flamboyant figure for the royal family and is one of the most high-profile Saudis internationally. His arrest seems particularly aimed at demonstrating that no one is beyond the reach of the committee and the crown prince.

Prince Talal’s style was on display during a trip to the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh in August. In a Putin-esque turn, a promotional video from the trip shows the prince, bare-chested and in a pair of shorts, leading an entourage of men around the resort — cycling, playing beach volleyball, doing the backstroke, water-skiing, and hiking up a mountain, pumping his arms above his head triumphantly while clutching a cell phone in one hand.

Set to action-movie music, much of the action unfolds against the backdrop of his 86-meter yacht, the Kingdom 5KR.

During the trip Prince Talal, who already owns several dozen hotels in Egypt, announced a further $800 million investment in Egypt’s tourism industry. He drew criticism from some conservative Egyptians for a video that shows him meeting with Egypt’s female minister of investment and international cooperation, Sahar Nasr, aboard his yacht while he was again wearing shorts. It was unusual protocol in a public meeting for a member of the family that rules a hyperconservative Islamic kingdom.

The arrests also come as Crown Prince Mohammed has forged a close relationship with President Trump, who shares his aggressive approach to Saudi’s regional rival, Iran, and a penchant for bold decisions.

Prince Alwaleed sparred with Mr. Trump on Twitter during the American presidential election, referring to him as a “disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.” Mr. Trump fired back, also on Twitter, that he was a “dopey prince” trying to “control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money.”

Prince Alwaleed made early bets on some of the technology world’s biggest stars, also including Snap, riding a boom that catapulted many young entrepreneurs to top the rich lists, and earned him handsome returns. Prince Alwaleed also made an early bet on JD.com, a Chinese online retailer, anticipating that country’s emergence as a vast e-commerce market.

In moments of corporate crises, Prince Alwaleed has stepped in to tip the balance.

When the phone hacking scandal rocked a London tabloid owned by the Murdochs, the prince went on the BBC to say that Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive officer of the British unit of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation, should resign. “You bet she has to go,” he said in July 2011. She resigned the next day.

At the time, Prince Alwaleed was the second-biggest shareholder in News Corporation, with a more than 6 percent stake. He later sold most of his stake in the company.

In the darkest hours of the 2008 financial crisis, Prince Alwaleed said he would increase his stake in Citigroup, in a move of solidarity with the then-embattled bank’s chief executive officer, Vikram S. Pandit.

Later, when Mr. Pandit faced a rebuke from angry shareholders over a 2012 pay package that totaled $15 million, the prince said he voted for it, according to a recent interview in Vanity Fair.

Prince Alwaleed has worked closely with some of Wall Street’s biggest and best known banks and investors.

Just a month ago, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs, sat across from Prince Alwaleed at a meeting in Riyadh. The two talked about investments and economic developments in the Middle East. A longtime banker for Kingdom Holding, Goldman Sachs recently helped Prince Alwaleed’s company acquire a 16 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi, the Saudi bank.

When he traveled to New York in 2016, Prince Alwaleed met with Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Bloomberg. After a meeting, Mr. Bloomberg agreed to support news programming on the Alarab News Channel, a venture that Prince Alwaleed owns privately.

Kingdom Holdings has played a role in top leadership at AccorHotels, in which it has a 5.8 percent stake. A recent news release showed pictures of Prince Alwaleed laughing with a former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who was asked to join the board of the French hotel chain earlier this year.

The arrest could shake confidence in Saudi Arabia as it tries to diversify its economy. The kingdom is planning to list the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco next year in what is expected to be the biggest initial public offering in history.

Despite the best efforts of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to destroy the Affordable Care Act, the law is not collapsing. And on Wednesday, Americans began signing up for health insurance policies for next year through the online exchanges created by that law.

President Trump’s attempts at sabotage have clearly taken a toll on the A.C.A., or Obamacare. Experts say it is likely that one million to two million fewer people will choose health plans for 2018, compared with 2017. That’s because the administration has reduced the open enrollment period by half, to 45 days. And it has slashed spending on advertising and on health care navigators who help people sign up for insurance plans.

Further, Mr. Trump has said Obamacare is “finished,” “dead” and “gone” — and his words appear to be having an impact. A recent poll found that a sizable minority of voters think the law has been repealed. Others are unaware of when open enrollment started (Nov. 1) and when it will end (Dec. 15 for much of the country). The president’s remarks and actions have also scared insurance companies into raising premiums — by about 37 percent for popular “silver” plans, and by smaller amounts for the “bronze” and “gold” plans — because the administration is cutting payments to insurers, and the companies are expecting fewer healthy people to buy coverage.

That said, a majority of the people who rely on the exchanges will be able to buy affordable health plans, thanks to the protections built into the law. About 80 percent of the people who sign up are expected to qualify for subsidies that will reduce the cost of insurance to $75 a month or less, according to government data. The law provides subsidies to single people who make up to $48,000 a year and families of four earning up to $98,000.

It is important that people examine their options. People’s choices and costs will vary based on where they live, how much they earn, the size of their families and other factors. Experts say many lower-income people will be able to sign up for a bronze-level plan with no upfront cost to them. However, these plans include high deductibles and copays. Silver plans will become much more expensive for many families. That’s because Mr. Trump stopped making the payments to insurers that compensated them for reducing deductibles for low-income customers who sign up for silver plans.

“Literal people may ask, Why, then, does not woman have the right of suffrage?” it stated. “The answer is easy. She does not want it. Of course, it must be admitted that women, or some women, think they want the ballot. But they do not really want it.”

It continued: “Philosophers have observed that the female desire is invariably kindled by that which is, or seems to be, unattainable.”

The article — which examined a debate between Anthony and Edward Rosewater, a Republican politician and newspaper editor from Omaha — shot down Anthony’s assertion that disenfranchisement was akin to degradation. To be “disfranchised,” it stated, one would have to be robbed of a right “he (or she) already holds.”

It then reinforced a central argument made by those who opposed women’s suffrage: that it would lead to the destruction of the traditional home. “To give woman the ballot, provided woman wanted it, would be to bring desolation and distraction into multitudes of happy homes.”

Ms. Bernikow, whose current work focuses on the effort to achieve women’s suffrage in New York City, said The Times and its editors were “speaking to the status quo.”

“They’re entrenched white men,” she said. “The main boogeyman that they’ve come up with is home life.”

It took another generation for the movement to gain a wider audience, Ms. Bernikow said. Harriot Stanton Blatch, a daughter of the women’s rights pioneer Elizabeth Cady Stanton, broadened the movement from its initial focus on morality — that it was immoral to believe that women were not citizens.

Blatch’s method: Appeal to the court of public opinion by holding open-air meetings, speaking from soapboxes on street corners, and holding parades and marches with banners and pins.

This next iteration of the movement also benefited from a vast network of suffrage-focused media. “They had magazines, ways of distributing information that didn’t depend of the mainstream press, tons of it,” Ms. Bernikow said. “That made a huge difference.”

The earlier revolutionaries were meeting in churches and petitioning the state and federal governments, but not enough citizens were paying attention. Anthony’s 1872 vote and the subsequent trial had a very small audience.

“Until the turn of the 20th century, that’s the kind of movement it was,” Ms. Bernikow said. “You were basically speaking to the converted.”

Women’s activists in the early 1900s also gained support by appealing to working women who were persuaded that having the vote would improve conditions. “That’s a huge number, particularly in New York City — the garment workers,” Ms. Bernikow said.

And marchers took to the streets, “extremely organized in military ranks,” Ms. Bernikow said, disproving stereotypes that were common about women at the time — that they couldn’t be organized and had no discipline.

REES By the grace of God, you said yes.

BLIGE Well, by the grace of God, you noticed me, because people don’t notice me, you know?

People don’t notice you?

Dee, did you know you wanted Mary for this?

REES I imagined [Florence] as this woman who had to have this exterior reserve, but this raging emotional inner life and really deep sense of empathy. Mary played the Wicked Witch of the West in “The Wiz.” If you can be the Wicked Witch of the West, you can do anything. And in her musical work, her lyrics, she’s not just recounting or singing lines at you; she’s living every experience. If you’ve been to her concert, it’s like therapy with 30,000 people.

Every one of you had brutal scenes. How did you recoup from that, or is that part of your job?

GARRETT HEDLUND Every bit of it was quite emotional, and we had an amazing team that made it seem easy. Because it was an insanely short shoot, everybody came to play.

CAREY MULLIGAN I do quite a lot of films that are emotional. So a long time ago I stopped taking it home. I did a play in New York about seven years ago where I played a paranoid schizophrenic. It was very bleak. And after that I realized I couldn’t take it home at the end of the day. I had to sort of wear a hat and take the hat off.

Even though “Mudbound” is a period film, it feels deeply relevant today. With the events in Charlottesville and neo-Nazis on the rise, do you think that people are more aware of something that black people in this country knew never went away?

REES It’s like we just pulled the tablecloth off. This table’s always been here; we just now pulled off the cloth and said, “Oh, wait.” So I think it’s forcing a recognition for seeing an interrogation of histories. If I can go three grandmothers back and find a slave, that means someone else can go three grandmothers back and find a slave owner. When you interrogate your histories, it forces you to rethink who you are and where you are.

Was it surprising that things maybe haven’t changed all that much?

MULLIGAN I was surprised to the extent of it, that part of society still holds archaic, unforgivable beliefs about things. I’ve been shocked in the last year by the extent of it. I think I was a little bit naïve. Where people felt before they had to keep a secret, now they’re given a platform to speak these things out loud, which is crazy.

REES They assume you’re stealing.

BLIGE —— until you pull your credit card out, you know?

REES I feel like a lot of it was evident during Barack Obama’s presidency. There was unprecedented disrespect, unprecedented resistance. There was a sole purpose to stonewall him. That was a version of putting him in his place. People were talking about postracial; we just kind of knew that was an error. I’m fine now dressed up in these clothes and talking to you, but when I’m in the drugstore and in my sweats, the reaction is still more of suspicion. I’m treated as a thief rather than a customer. And that’s New York City today.

It’s arguably most pronounced in America, but it’s not limited to America. Set against that bleak reality, what does “Mudbound” do then?

REES I think “Mudbound” reveals the interconnectiveness of our stories. You can’t separate out threads of history and race as economic construct. “Mudbound” makes it very plain. Race is about commerce; it’s not an actual thing. It’s a fiction that was created to basically divide resources unequally. You couldn’t do this with someone if you saw them as another human being. You could only do it if you say, “You’re different. Manifest Destiny. God wants us to have it.” “Mudbound” unravels all that. We see these particular threads, and how their fates are woven together, and how they’re in almost a jail of their own creation.

BLIGE I think that it will show us that we really need to stop all of this “I’m better than you because I have this,” or “I’m better than you because I’m this.” I know it sounds cliché, but it will show us that we are in this together. When all those storms came and Houston was flooded, the same neighbor you said you hated the other day — as you were underwater — had to help you.

HEDLUND I think there’s going to be a great amount of self-reflection for everybody that watches it to see where they stand and where they’ve been. I don’t want to give away the ending; I think that the best part is that it ends with love. For a film that everybody thinks is so sad, or so divided, that ends so positively, that’s a rarity.

Do you feel it’s different working for a male director versus a female director?

HEDLUND I think an artist is an artist, and passion is passion. And there is no divide in that.

MULLIGAN I’ve had great experiences with women and great experiences with men. I’ve had very collaborative experiences with women, probably more so. But that might just be chance. I felt on this particularly there wasn’t an idea that wasn’t fully explored. We all brought stuff that we wanted to put in. Seventy-five percent of it did get in and that’s rare. But that could just be Dee being really collaborative and wonderful.

HEDLUND The most freeing thing was that we didn’t overrehearse everything and do it nine million times. Dee said from the beginning she wants to meet the characters through us, and it was just beautiful for that.

They pushed back against a short-lived Obama administration plan to bring five Guantánamo detainees accused of aiding the Sept. 11 attacks to New York for a civilian trial, and deplored the F.B.I.’s handling with criminal justice system procedures of a Nigerian who tried to blow up a Detroit-bound plane with a bomb in his underwear.

The critics maintained that the government would lose information if interrogators read suspects Miranda warnings that they had a right to remain silent and be represented by defense lawyers. They also argued that civilian trials presented a greater risk of spilling classified information and that terrorism trials could turn courthouses into targets.

The talking point that the military should exclusively handle terrorism cases persisted for years among Republicans, even as in scores of such cases, F.B.I. interrogators proved adept at persuading suspects to talk and federal prosecutors swiftly won harsh sentences without security problems. That includes such high-profile cases as the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing cases.

At the same time, the Guantánamo tribunals — which had started slowly, after the Supreme Court struck down an earlier version in the Bush years — have repeatedly plunged into chaos. Contested cases, including the attempted prosecution of the five Sept. 11 defendants, bogged down in years of hearings without getting to trial.

“Time and time again, federal courts have proven to be more efficient and more effective than military tribunals,” said Nicholas J. Lewin, a former counterterrorism federal prosecutor. “On punishment, federal courts win. On length of time between capture and conviction, federal courts win. On certainty of upholding conviction on appeal, federal courts win.”

Amid those real-world complexities, the Trump administration has confounded expectations that it would swiftly bring new detainees to Guantánamo. It has brought to civilian court several foreign terrorism suspects, including an Algerian-Irish Qaeda suspect facing trial in Philadelphia and a Turkish Islamic State suspect facing trial in New York.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who as a senator routinely attacked the Obama administration as foolhardy for not sending newly captured terrorists to Guantánamo, is now extolling the successes of civilian courts.

“Since 9/11, the Department of Justice has made fighting terrorism its top priority,” Mr. Sessions said in a speech on Thursday in New York. “Our goal is not just to catch terrorists, but to prevent them from striking us. And in this fight against terror, we have gotten results.”

Mr. Sessions did make a nod to Guantánamo, citing it as another lawful tool that the Trump administration remains willing to use. But that fleeting and vague reference contrasted with the detailed praise he heaped on civilian terrorism prosecutions.

Mr. Sessions lauded the conviction last month of Ahmad Khan Rahimi in the September 2016 bombing in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan; he faces a mandatory life sentence. Mr. Sessions pointed to charges unsealed last month against three men accused of plotting Islamic State-inspired attacks in New York.

And he cited the case of Mustafa al-Imam, the second suspect captured in the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, who was seized by American commandos in a raid there last week and made his initial appearance on Friday in a federal courthouse in Washington.

Several signs have emerged this year that Mr. Sessions has begun to view the practical merits of Guantánamo-style policies more skeptically in his new job.

In March, for example, he said in a radio interview that it was time to think through “to what extent we’re going to use military commissions” because they were not working “in an effective way,” although he expressed hope of fixing them. And in July, when Mr. Sessions visited Guantánamo, he privately expressed dismay at the expense of the prison operation, according to multiple American officials familiar with his comments. Taxpayers spend millions of dollars a year on each detainee, roughly 100 times the cost of housing inmates in high-security civilian prison.

Another senior presidential adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, the homeland security adviser, suggested at a meeting this year a compromise to make the prison somewhat more useful for new captives: take suspects to Guantánamo for a period of interrogation, then bring them to the United States for civilian trial. But he was told, according to a current and a former American official, that a law passed by Congress to block Mr. Obama’s plan to close the prison barred the transfer of detainees to domestic soil once they have been held at Guantánamo.

A spokesman for Mr. Bossert did not comment, and a spokesperson for Mr. Sessions did not respond to an inquiry. But Matthew Miller, the Justice Department spokesman under former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., expressed vindication.

“Their opposition to trying terrorists in federal court was always based on nothing but politics, and it was always bound to collapse the minute a Republican became president and had to face reality,” Mr. Miller said.

He predicted that under the next Democratic president, some Republicans would revive the issue “to score political points.”

Among the Republicans who have been strikingly quiet on the topic this year is the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. He once led the charge, telling fellow Republicans in 2010 that they could reap political gains by campaigning on the issue. And he repeatedly followed that playbook himself.

In 2011, for example, when two Iraqi refugees in Kentucky were charged with committing terrorism offenses abroad, Mr. McConnell denounced the move. “The perfect place for these terrorists is at Guantánamo,” he told Fox News.

And in 2014, when American commandos captured Abu Ahmed Khattala, a Libyan suspect in the Benghazi attacks, Mr. McConnell maintained that interrogating him under law enforcement procedures would be a mistake because the United States needed to learn who else was involved in the attack.

But, following its procedures, the F.B.I. first questioned Mr. Khattala for intelligence purposes, and then, after advising him of his rights, started over for information that could be used in court. At his continuing trial in Washington last week, an agent who interrogated Mr. Khattala testified that the F.B.I. had succeeded in getting him to identify Mr. Imam, the just-captured second Benghazi suspect.

“Mr. Imam, we didn’t know who he was until Abu Khattala told us,” the F.B.I. agent said.

In an email, a spokesman, Don Stewart, said that Mr. McConnell’s position on sending foreign terrorism suspects to Guantánamo had not changed. But Mr. Stewart also said that Mr. McConnell had never had a blanket policy. He pointed out that the truck attack suspect, Mr. Saipov, was probably ineligible for wartime detention because no evidence had emerged that he was part of an organization with which the United States is at war.

That did not stop Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, from saying that Mr. Saipov, who waived his Miranda rights and spoke freely to F.B.I. agents, could and should be placed in military custody based on his support for the Islamic State.

Mr. Graham, a lonely voice in loudly criticizing Mr. Trump’s decision to stick with the civilian system, insisted in an interview that Mr. Saipov should have been interrogated in military custody. Mr. Graham scoffed at the notion that the F.B.I. would learn all he knew — especially once he had a lawyer.

But he also acknowledged that some of his colleagues who once shouted in unison with him were now quiet.

Instead of trying to prevent arguments, we should be modeling courteous conflict and teaching kids how to have healthy disagreements.
If kids don’t learn to wobble, they never learn to walk; they end up standing still.","It turns out that highly creative adults often grow up in families full of tension. Not fistfights or personal insults, but real disagreements. When adults in their early 30s were asked to write imaginative stories, the most creative ones came from those whose parents had the most conflict a quarter-century earlier. Their parents had clashing views on how to raise children. They had different values and attitudes and interests. And when highly creative architects and scientists were compared with their technically skilled but less original peers, the innovators often had more friction in their families. As the psychologist Robert Albert put it, “the creative person-to-be comes from a family that is anything but harmonious, one with a ‘wobble.’ ”

Wilber and Orville Wright came from a wobbly family. Their father, a preacher, never met a moral fight he wasn’t willing to pick. They watched him clash with school authorities who weren’t fond of his decision to let his kids miss a half-day of school from time to time to learn on their own. Their father believed so much in embracing arguments that despite being a bishop in the local church, he had multiple books by atheists in his library — and encouraged his children to read them.

If we rarely see a spat, we learn to shy away from the threat of conflict. Witnessing arguments — and participating in them — helps us grow a thicker skin. We develop the will to fight uphill battles and the skill to win those battles, and the resilience to lose a battle today without losing our resolve tomorrow. For the Wright brothers, argument was the family trade and a fierce one was something to be savored. Conflict was something to embrace and resolve. “I like scrapping with Orv,” Wilbur said.

The Wright brothers weren’t alone. The Beatles fought over instruments and lyrics and melodies. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony clashed over the right way to win the right to vote. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak argued incessantly while designing the first Apple computer. None of these people succeeded in spite of the drama — they flourished because of it. Brainstorming groups generate 16 percent more ideas when the members are encouraged to criticize one another. The most creative ideas in Chinese technology companies and the best decisions in American hospitals come from teams that have real disagreements early on. Breakthrough labs in microbiology aren’t full of enthusiastic collaborators cheering one another on but of skeptical scientists challenging one another’s interpretations.

If no one ever argues, you’re not likely to give up on old ways of doing things, let alone try new ones. Disagreement is the antidote to groupthink. We’re at our most imaginative when we’re out of sync. There’s no better time than childhood to learn how to dish it out — and to take it.

As Samuel Johnson was growing up, his parents argued constantly. He described a family as “a little kingdom, torn with factions and exposed to revolutions.” He went on to write one of the greatest dictionaries in history, one that had a lasting impact on the English language and wasn’t supplanted until the Oxford English Dictionary appeared more than a century later. Who would be more motivated and qualified to clean up a messy language than someone whose household was filled with it?

Children need to learn the value of thoughtful disagreement. Sadly, many parents teach kids that if they disagree with someone, it’s polite to hold their tongues. Rubbish. What if we taught kids that silence is bad manners? It disrespects the other person’s ability to have a civil argument — and it disrespects the value of your own viewpoint and your own voice. It’s a sign of respect to care enough about someone’s opinion that you’re willing to challenge it.

We can also help by having disagreements openly in front of our kids. Most parents hide their conflicts: They want to present a united front, and they don’t want kids to worry. But when parents disagree with each other, kids learn to think for themselves. They discover that no authority has a monopoly on truth. They become more tolerant of ambiguity. Rather than conforming to others’ opinions, they come to rely on their own independent judgment.

It doesn’t seem to matter how often parents argue; what counts is how they handle arguments when they happen. Creativity tends to flourish, Mr. Albert, the psychologist, found, in families that are “tense but secure.” In a recent study of children ages 5 to 7, the ones whose parents argued constructively felt more emotionally safe. Over the next three years, those kids showed greater empathy and concern for others. They were friendlier and more helpful toward their classmates in school.

Instead of trying to prevent arguments, we should be modeling courteous conflict and teaching kids how to have healthy disagreements. We can start with four rules:

• Frame it as a debate, rather than a conflict.

• Argue as if you’re right but listen as if you’re wrong.

• Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person’s perspective.

We’re just in hoary old Hollywood, where showing a problem tends to be confused with addressing it. All we know about the family across the way — they’re the Mayerses — is that they’re new homeowners and that they’re black. And boy, are they restrained. When racists scream at her, Mrs. Mayers doesn’t scream back. She merely continues to pin the laundry on the clothesline. When she experiences a customized price hike at the grocery store (for her, every item is suddenly $20), she relents and makes the sort of stoic exit that a movie like this needs to double as a triumph of dignity.

Meanwhile, Mr. Mayers barely gets a line. But he mows a mean lawn. Their kid spends the movie playing with Nicky, who’s mandated to do it by his aunt. The mandate extends to Mr. Clooney, whose sense of social progressivism hits a ceiling. The way the Mayers family functions isn’t all that different from how Dianne Reeves’s jazz singing and the footage of the actual Annie Lee Moss’s testimony are deployed in Mr. Clooney’s 2005 docudrama, “Good Night, and Good Luck.”

They were flicking at progressivism that the movie didn’t have the political bandwidth to get into. But the difference is that both women (neither of whom achieves character status) are part of the movie’s wider sanctimony in recreating Edward R. Murrow’s battle in the 1950s with Senator Joseph McCarthy and his televised anti-Communist witch hunt. It’s righteousness on Ambien. But I put up with the movie’s turning Ms. Reeves and the footage of Moss into weapons: They served the movie’s thematic strategy. Unlike, “Suburbicon,” it had an argument. McCarthyism really is bad.

Yet it seems that in his films, “dignified” is the only way Mr. Clooney wants to imagine black people. Anytime a movie or television show retreats into certain American pasts, I’m both annoyed and relieved. “Back then” can provide cover for an all-white cast. It can feel like an excuse or a hide out. But filmmakers might want to be careful about where the time machine sends them. Sofia Coppola’s went back to the Civil War, for “The Beguiled.” Rather than deal with the moral centrality of slavery, she simply freed the slaves herself. Sometimes you get very good filmmaking anyway. You also get gentrification.

Mr. Clooney has directed six movies; five are set in the middle of the previous century. And “Suburbicon” clarifies why. Race is a blind spot. None of the scenes with the Mayerses go on for more than 90 seconds; most last less than 15. And all are intended as a moral counterpoint to the darkening frivolity going on at the Lodges’. The Times’s Manohla Dargis got at this inequality in her review of the film. The casting telegraphs the movie’s priorities. The black actors — Karimah Westbrook, Tony Espinosa and Leith M. Burke — may not be as famous as the movie’s white stars, but Mr. Clooney hasn’t given them a chance to show whether they’re also as good.

In September, after the “Suburbicon” premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, he told David Sims, of The Atlantic, that he knows his approach is imperfect. “In all fairness, there are a lot of people better qualified to make the African-American story in suburbia, I think,” Mr. Clooney said.

“There’s a version of this film I’d like to see from the other side that could be better represented by someone who can speak to that better than me, and probably should.” He went on: “I think my version was what I know, which is white angst and the fear of losing your place to minorities.” He also said that he’d like to see others directors — Ava DuVernay or Steve McQueen, say — do a version of this story.

Sure, it’s possible that the white riots happening in “Suburbicon” reflect the current tour of white nationalist pop-up events. And perhaps somewhere inside this movie lives a farce that reckons with white indifference in the face of national catastrophe. But no one had the audacity to find it. The movie is the catastrophe, instead. During the era in which this movie is set, you would get dramas like Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s “No Way Out,” from 1950, or “Pressure Point,” a social drama from 1962 that Stanley Kramer had a hand in. They both star Sidney Poitier, and neither is afraid of at least trying to see race “from the other side.” The violent, relentless depiction of racism in “No Way Out,” complete with a race riot, is actually still pretty shocking. They’re as square as the movies Mr. Clooney tends to make, but they’re also daring, however imperfectly, to look right at the present rather than hunkering down in the past.

The big surprise of Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” is its conception of a racism that doesn’t need lynch mobs or a Confederate flag to make its point. Good, liberal white people — the ones for whom “I voted for Obama” is supposed to be an icebreaker — inflict as much harm as obvious bad ones. Mr. Clooney is not humanizing the Mayerses, per se. He is using them. The sad thing is that he didn’t need to. The black characters have nothing to do with the plot of this movie. They’re here almost against their will, kept in the white-controlled existential purgatory that Mr. Peele’s movie identifies as the sunken place.

By the final bogusly optimistic shot, it’s obvious what “Suburbicon” wants you to know: This movie voted for Obama.

If Hollywood movies are in trouble, something as confused as this one signals a hastening of their demise. Most of me will always want some version of this middlebrow entertainment in my life. But if fighting to keep that kind of movie alive also means fighting for the cynicism of “Suburbicon,” the rest of me wants to say get out.",George Clooney’s Awkward White Guilt in ‘Suburbicon’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/movies/george-clooney-suburbicon-racism.html

Mr. Northam holds a 26-point lead among voters from Northern Virginia; voters from that area said they backed Mrs. Clinton by 31 points. It’s a pattern up and down the ballot.

The pattern has also been fairly common beyond Virginia this year. In special congressional elections, Republicans have fallen far short of Mr. Trump’s strong showing in white working-class areas, while Democrats have struggled to exceed Mrs. Clinton’s showing in the areas where she excelled, like Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District.

But the Virginia contest seems to have a distinct dynamic.

Even if Mr. Gillespie loses by a small margin, his campaign could be judged a success, given national political conditions and Virginia’s Democratic lean.

Mr. Northam entered the race as a clear if modest favorite. Virginia, with a high percentage of college-educated voters, backed Mrs. Clinton by a five-point margin in November, and the national political environment would seem to be very favorable to a Democrat.

The party out of power has generally won the Virginia governor’s race, and Republicans have struggled in this year’s special elections. Mr. Trump’s approval rating has consistently been in the 30s, and Democrats have a considerable lead on the generic congressional ballot. These conditions are consistent with a so-called wave election, like the ones that swept Democrats into power in the House in 2006 and back out in 2010.

But Mr. Trump’s approval rating was at 39 percent in the Upshot/Siena survey, with his disapproval at 51 percent. These figures are somewhat better for Mr. Trump than those of most other surveys — perhaps in part because this poll tries to capture likely voters in an off-year election, and those voters are considerably older and whiter than the overall adult population.

The poll was sampled from an L2 voter file, and it’s weighted to a likely electorate. It supposes a turnout of around 2.4 million votes, up somewhat from the 2.24 million cast in the 2013 governor’s race. But higher or lower turnout would not necessarily be a clear advantage for either side, according to our results. The Democratic strength among well-educated voters — and the robust Democratic turnout in the primary for this race — gives the party more strength among high-turnout voters than has been the case in recent elections.

About 14 percent of respondents were undecided or refused to answer, while another 2 percent backed the Libertarian candidate Cliff Hyra. The relatively high proportion of undecided voters is partly because the sample includes a large number of less likely voters, who are vastly more likely to be undecided than the likeliest voters. Many public polls sample only frequent voters, or screen their sample down to the likeliest voters. Mr. Northam would have led by three points, 46 to 43, if the sample had counted only voters who were “almost sure” or “very likely” to vote.

How the Poll Has Changed

The poll is the first Upshot/Siena survey since the 2016 presidential election, when polls generally overstated Mrs. Clinton’s support in the decisive battleground states.

Mr. Trump led by four points in our final Florida survey in 2016, and he was tied in our final North Carolina survey.

But the Upshot/Siena survey also had Mrs. Clinton up by seven points in earlier polls of North Carolina and Pennsylvania, taken soon after the third debate, when she still had a wide lead in national and battleground state polls. The apparent shifts over the last few weeks of the race make it more difficult to assess the performance of these surveys.

But a close analysis of last year’s surveys, combined with insights from across the survey industry, has helped inform two initial changes to the Upshot/Siena poll since last November’s election.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

First, the poll is weighted by self-reported education to match estimates based on the census’ Current Population Survey. There’s considerable evidence that the failure to weight by education was a major reason state pre-election polls were off the mark, especially in the Rust Belt states.

It’s not so clear that education weighting would have considerably improved the performance of Upshot/Siena surveys. That’s because the Upshot/Siena sample design and weighting scheme was already intended to properly represent low-turnout voters, who tend to be less educated.

The education weight had no effect on the results of this Virginia survey.

Second, we sampled and weighted to a likely electorate, rather than registered voters. Similarly, the modeled turnout score — our estimate for the probability that a voter will turn out, based on past voting record and other measures — now represents 60 percent of our estimate that a respondent will turn out, up from 50 percent in 2016. The remaining 40 percent of the estimate is based on respondents’ answers to several questions about their interest in politics, the coming election and their intention to vote.

Over all, these changes would have eliminated about half of the bias and one-third of the error in our final three surveys in 2016. (That may not be generalizable to other elections.)

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

“I see all these programs as a unit of sorts,” said Houston’s director, Cristina Rivera-Garza, “a group interested in developing the writers of the 21st century: bilingual, diverse and representative of the communities thriving in the United States.”

The Houston and Cal State programs are also developing activist efforts to support local Hispanic populations (Houston’s has grown by more than 200,000 from 2000 to 2016; Los Angeles County’s by about 600,000). Cal State’s program director, Alex Espinoza, said its students will help residents in largely Spanish-speaking East L.A. write biographical narratives that counter those “too often generalized in the media” — and by the Trump administration.

Indeed, these programs could be seen as something of an artistic challenge to the administration’s stance on Hispanic immigrants, represented by its plans to revoke the DACA program protecting undocumented students from deportation, the proposed Mexican border wall, and the removal this year of the White House Spanish-language website.

Collectively, the programs could play a significant role in developing young writers who publicly voice varied aspects of the Hispanic experience.

The Juárez-El Paso geography — two communities intertwined culturally and economically, separated by a parched Rio Grande barely waist deep — is a topic the students and professors have explored in their literary work. Perhaps the starkest difference between the cities is the drug-related violence on the Juárez side, which they depict with disturbing visceral images and blunt, uncensored vocabulary.

Juárez-El Paso is the largest metropolitan area on the border, with a combined population of more than two million, but the walk from downtown Juárez to downtown El Paso takes less than half an hour.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Alessandra Narváez-Varela used to walk across that border almost every day from Juárez to classes at the University of Texas, and to help out in the restaurant her family owns in El Paso. She has a B.S. in biology and a B.A. in creative writing. She spent a year in medical school, but “it didn’t feel like it was supposed to feel,” she said. Poetry did. Now 31, in El Paso’s bilingual M.F.A. program, she is writing to reconcile her dual identity and to give voice to women’s issues, especially involving female anatomy, that initially drew her to medicine. “Once you have that kind of conversation with the body you can’t let it go,” she said.

Oddly, while Ms. Narváez-Varela’s deepest roots lie in Spanish, she did not feel confident composing poetry in her native language. Her college writing had always been in English. “Maybe the Spanish speaker in me felt relegated to second-class-citizen status after adopting English as the language for my poetry,” she said.

I attended a presentation Ms. Narváez-Varela gave at a national writer’s conference in Los Angeles in which she explained how a workshop in the program had helped her find her Spanish voice.

She had written a poem in Spanish called “Ovarian Cancer,” filled with graphic imagery (she compared cancer to a bleeding fetus). Classmates had told her the beat pattern didn’t flow and criticized her use of rhyme. Ms. Narváez-Varela realized she had been unconsciously translating from English. She projected on a screen a copy of the poem, hand-edited by classmates, and an English translation, pointing out to the audience phrases she had originally conceived in English.

“Spanish, and the way it’s used to create music in poetry, differs radically in terms of syllables and rhyme,” she discovered. “It was a humbling workshop for me, but an enlightening one, too.”

Ms. Narváez-Varela went on to explore Mexican and American identities using Spanglish, the mixing of languages in the same sentences. In her poem “Real Mexican,” she describes, in raw and troubling language, a Mexican-American ex-convict so confused about his Hispanic identity he doesn’t know what name to call himself. In the opening line the character says: “Tony, Toño, Antonio, Anthony, it doesn’t matter, honey....”

“I had never before adopted a persona that explored Spanglish’s complexity and its meaning to me as a Mexican citizen naturalized in the U.S.,” Ms. Narváez-Varela said. “I realized this was a projection of my own anxieties as a Mexican-American. I had unconsciously judged others by the way they spoke Spanglish.” She said she was trying to show how the character’s use of Spanglish “is a vital manifestation of his identity as a marginalized member of both societies.”

Writing the poem helped her see the artistry of “a language as valid and beautiful as English or Spanish, as hybrid as African-American English, and therefore as deserving of a place in poetry.” Huizache, a journal of Latino literature, has just published “Real Mexican.”

Many important Hispanic fiction writers have attended traditional M.F.A. programs. I spoke with three of the masters — Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz and Esmeralda Santiago — about how they bridge two languages in their writing and about their graduate school experience. Each said that their M.F.A. programs did not recognize the Spanish-speaking side of their identities, either by assigning Latino authors or by supporting the Spanish element of their work.

Photo

Ms. Cisneros, who is Mexican-American, described an interaction with her thesis adviser at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop when she began writing “The House on Mango Street.”

She had written the novella in English but inflected it with Spanish phrasings. The adviser criticized her for overusing the word “little,” unaware how frequently the suffix “ito” — for little or cute — is used in Spanish.

The incident, she said, impeded her connection to Spanish. “I didn’t realize it until after I’d left Iowa,” Ms. Cisneros said. “I was writing a letter in Spanish and I thought, this is the voice of ‘The House on Mango Street.’”

In her choice of a single word in her native language, Ms. Cisneros was able to greatly affect meaning.

When she named the young narrator of “The House on Mango Street” Esperanza, she wasn’t just giving her a pretty name. “Esperanza” can mean waiting, expectation or hope in English. In the story, the girl poetically expresses a blend of feelings about her name, saying, “In Spanish, it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color.”

“I wanted it to be a traditional name that wouldn’t translate well into U.S. culture,” Ms. Cisneros said, “as well as one that would mean wish, desire and hope.”

Mr. Díaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Dominican-American writer, attended Cornell University’s M.F.A. program and now teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In graduate education, he advocates for “ties to scholars working on the intersections of languages, on Creoles, on multilingualism.”

He explained his own mental translation process this way: “If I’m writing a character who is Spanish dominant, they talk and think within me in Spanish and I translate most of it into English. Some words refuse translations — sometimes it’s the joy of the word, or the energy it pulses with in the original Spanish sentence.” For example, Mr. Diaz freely employs English expletives in his work, but sometimes opts for rough Spanish equivalents.

Ms. Santiago, author of the memoir “When I Was Puerto Rican” and an M.F.A. graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, writes entire drafts bilingually. “I write as fast as I can and don’t worry whether what appears on the page is in English or in Spanish,” she said. “Later, when I’m editing, I will translate almost all of the Spanish into English if it’s for publication in that language. English and Spanish are for me the same language.”

•

In the El Paso program, faculty members strive to respond effectively to students who write in English, Spanish or both. Professors try to accommodate students in individual conferences by working in their preferred language. “I’ll speak in English and they’ll speak in Spanish,” said Daniel Chacón, one of 10 faculty members. “Then I might reiterate and clarify in Spanish.”

Whatever their level of proficiency, students must grapple with both languages. “They have to make the effort to bridge the gap,” said the director, José de Piérola. “It can be a shock to be stressed in this way, but it makes you grow.”

In one of Mr. de Piérola’s workshops, a student who spoke little Spanish led a group critique of a student’s short story. The story was in English, but he could not understand the group members who spoke in Spanish, and had to turn for explanations to fully bilingual classmates.

Many of the readings are available in translation, but even the students who feel challenged reading in the second language are encouraged to wrestle with the original texts. Some rely on tools like Google Translate, despite its limitations for interpreting literary language.

“When the Spanish speakers read American poets in English and vice versa, it changes their relationship to their own tradition,” Ms. Cote-Botero said.

She described how she might teach students to experiment with their writing by contrasting English and Spanish versions of the sonnet. She explained that Shakespeare standardized the English line using a steady five-beat pattern. “It’s closest to English speech and to the heartbeat,” she said.

One widely quoted example is Shakespeare’s opening line “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” The Spanish form, on the other hand, is based on a 14-syllable line. When students “mix the two, interesting things appear,” she said. By remaining “inside the boundaries of your own tradition you’re more at risk for repeating yourself.”

With a bilingual approach, Mr. Chacón said, “you can play with your own language a little more. James Joyce was able to play with language because he grew up with Gaelic and paid attention to its sound.”

To expose his students to writing styles in other languages, he adds to his reading lists translations of Japanese Zen koans and the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.

By encouraging students to explore different literary traditions and settings, the El Paso program is about more than just two languages.

Looking back as she approaches graduation next month (her thesis is a book of poetry about women), Ms. Narváez-Varela said that writing bilingually has pushed her beyond her comfort zone. This was a key reason she chose the program, and she hopes to carry that experience into a community college teaching position.

Since the procedure carries some risks, including death, stents should be used only for people who are having heart attacks, she added.

Mr. Stevens had a blocked artery, but the new report gave Dr. Nallamothu second thoughts.","The new study, published in the Lancet, stunned leading cardiologists by countering decades of clinical experience. The findings raise questions about whether stents should be used so often — or at all — to treat chest pain.

“It’s a very humbling study for someone who puts in stents,” said Dr. Brahmajee K. Nallamothu, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan.

Dr. William E. Boden, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine, called the results “unbelievable.”

Dr. David Maron, a cardiologist at Stanford University, praised the new study as “very well conducted” but said that it left some questions unanswered. The participants had a profound blockage but only in one artery, he noted, and they were assessed after just six weeks.

“We don’t know if the conclusions apply to people with more severe disease,” Dr. Maron said. “And we don’t know if the conclusions apply for a longer period of observation.”

For the study, Dr. Justin E. Davies, a cardiologist at Imperial College London, and his colleagues recruited 200 patients with a profoundly blocked coronary artery and chest pain severe enough to limit physical activity, common reasons for inserting a stent.

All were treated for six weeks with drugs to reduce the risk of a heart attack, like aspirin, a statin and a blood pressure drug, as well as medications that relieve chest pain by slowing the heart or opening blood vessels.

Then the subjects had a procedure: a real or fake insertion of a stent. This is one of the few studies in cardiology in which a sham procedure was given to controls who were then compared to patients receiving the actual treatment.

In both groups, doctors threaded a catheter through the groin or wrist of the patient and, with X-ray guidance, up to the blocked artery. Once the catheter reached the blockage, the doctor inserted a stent or, if the patient was getting the sham procedure, simply pulled the catheter out.

Neither the patients nor the researchers assessing them afterward knew who had received a stent. Following the procedure, both groups of patients took powerful drugs to prevent blood clots.

The stents did what they were supposed to do in patients who received them. Blood flow through the previously blocked artery was greatly improved.

When the researchers tested the patients six weeks later, both groups said they had less chest pain, and they did better than before on treadmill tests.

But there was no real difference between the patients, the researchers found. Those who got the sham procedure did just as well as those who got stents.

Cardiologists said one reason might be that atherosclerosis affects many blood vessels, and stenting only the largest blockage may not make much difference in a patient’s discomfort. Those who report feeling better may only be experiencing a placebo effect from the procedure.

“All cardiology guidelines should be revised,” Dr. David L. Brown of Washington University School of Medicine and Dr. Rita F. Redberg of the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in an editorial published with the new study.

Clinical guidelines in the United States say stenting is appropriate for patients with a blocked artery and chest pain who have tried optimal medical therapy, meaning medications like those given to the study patients.

But those guidelines were based on studies in which patients simply said they felt better after having stents inserted.

“It was impressive how negative it was,” Dr. Redberg said of the new study. Since the procedure carries some risks, including death, stents should be used only for people who are having heart attacks, she added.

Stents came into wide use in the 1990s and became the treatment of choice because they were less invasive than bypass surgery. But there have long been questions about their effectiveness.

A large, federally funded study with Dr. Maron as a co-principal investigator, which does not have an untreated control group, is now underway to determine whether medications can be just as effective as stenting or coronary bypass in preventing heart attacks.

In 2007, another large study led by Dr. Boden — also without an untreated control group — found stents did not prevent heart attacks or deaths from heart disease.

The explanation, researchers said, was that atherosclerosis is a diffuse disease. A few arteries might be blocked today, and then reopened with stents. But tomorrow a blockage might arise in another artery and cause a heart attack.

Relieving chest pain, though, seemed a different goal to many cardiologists. After all, the heart is a muscle, and if a muscle is starved for blood, it aches.

Many patients have coronary arteries that are 80 to 90 percent blocked. Surely opening those vessels should make the patients feel better.

The idea that stenting relieves chest pain is so ingrained that some experts said they expect most doctors will continue with stenting, reasoning that the new research is just one study.

Even Dr. Davies hesitated to say patients like those he tested should not get stents. “Some don’t want drugs or can’t take them,” he said.

Stenting is so accepted that American cardiologists said they were amazed ethics boards agreed to a study with a sham control group.

But in the United Kingdom, said Dr. Davies, getting approval for the study was not so difficult. Neither was it difficult to find patients.

“There are many people who are open to research, and if you tell them you are exploring a question, people agree,” he said. Nonetheless, it took him three and a half years to find the subjects for his study.

Ethics boards at many American hospitals probably would resist, since giving such patients fake procedures “flies in the face of guidelines,” Dr. Boden said.

Placebo effects can be surprisingly powerful, said Dr. Neal Dickert, Jr., a cardiologist and ethicist at Emory University.

A few years ago, researchers — at the insistence of the Food and Drug Administration — did a study to test an invasive procedure to treat high blood pressure. The control group got a sham procedure.

The method was becoming popular in Europe, but the study found that blood pressure dropped just as much in those who had the fake treatment.

Dr. Dickert said he hoped the new stent study will show cardiologists that they need to do more studies with sham procedures.

“This may turn out to be an important moment,” he said.

But getting them underway in the United States may not be easy. Ethics boards at hospitals and universities are likely to resist, as are patients.

“It’s not just up to us,” said Dr. David Goff, director of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Still, the results of the new research have at least one heart specialist rethinking his practice.

Dr. Nallamothu got an advance look at the new paper on Tuesday. Coincidentally, he had a patient, Jim Stevens, 54, a lawyer in Troy, Mich., scheduled to receive a stent that day.

Mr. Stevens had a blocked artery, but the new report gave Dr. Nallamothu second thoughts. “I took him off the table,” he said.

He explained to Mr. Stevens and his wife that he did not need a stent. “I was surprised,” Mr. Stevens said.

In the end, her only opponent was Tim Ryan, a young congressman and former high school quarterback star from Ohio’s 13th District, the ailing industrial region surrounding Youngstown and Akron. Ryan offered a splash-of-cold-water speech just before the vote: “We got wiped out,” he said, according to a recording of his remarks. “We’re toxic in the Midwest, and we’re toxic in the South.”

Pelosi won easily, but fully a third of the Democratic caucus voted against their leader, and Ryan’s insurrection seemed to have left a mark: After the election, three well-liked and nonrebellious members — Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Hakeem Jeffries of New York and David Cicilline of Rhode Island — were chosen by the caucus to help manage the rebranding of the party. The three of them spent the first half of 2017 dutifully interviewing nearly every member of the caucus and conducting more than a dozen listening sessions with authors, pollsters and former Obama cabinet secretaries. They hosted a dinner at which the party’s various factions — the Progressive Caucus, the Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the conservative Blue Dogs and the New Democrats, among others — mingled as if meeting for the first time.

In late July, Pelosi, Bustos, Jeffries and Cicilline stood on a stage with six other Democrats under a wiltingly hot summer sky in the city park of Berryville, Va. — a town of 4,306 residents in a purple district within easy driving distance of Washington — and unveiled their new agenda, titled “A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.” The phrase, which had been poll-tested by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an intentional echo of F.D.R.’s New Deal — and, less intentionally, of a Papa John’s pizza slogan. But its biggest debt was to the author of “The Art of the Deal,” and to his crimson-jowled populism.

“A Better Deal” called for retraining in America’s fading manufacturing sector, renegotiating trade deals, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and fighting the corporate consolidation that had affected the prices of everything from eyeglasses to beer. None of the 10 speakers invoked President Barack Obama. In fact, one of the key provisions in “A Better Deal” — renegotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients — was an implicit rebuke of the former president, who had agreed with the pharmaceutical industry to freeze Medicare drug prices in exchange for its support of the Affordable Care Act.

But even before the rollout, Pelosi diminished the substance of “A Better Deal” in an interview with The Washington Post, clarifying that it was not “a course correction, but it’s a presentation correction.” A Quinnipiac poll in August found that only 33 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of independents had a favorable opinion of the new Democratic agenda. The self-consciousness of the rebranding, one congressman mused to me at the time, “seems like what you would do in a different era.”

There was a stiff-jointedness to the whole spectacle, a sense of the Democrats’ trying to regain the use of muscles they had let atrophy over the previous eight years. Obama, after all, used to make this sort of thing look easy. Conflating the American story with his own — “This is who we are” — the president conveyed, even in policy irresolution, an unshakable sense of his and America’s place in the world. “I love the guy, I miss him,” Scott Peters said of Obama. “But organizationally, the party is in disarray. We’re at the lowest level of elected officeholders since Hoover. We got a bit lazy and found ourselves relying on Barack Obama’s charisma, and it left us in bad shape.”

Barring seismic developments, the G.O.P. is still likely to control both the White House and the Senate until at least January 2021. But nine months into Trump’s presidency, the chances of the Democrats’ retaking the House are much better. Multiple polls in recent months have shown generic Democratic candidates beating generic Republicans by as many as 15 points — a spread that, in past elections, correlated with winning more than enough seats for the Democrats to gain a House majority next year. And if they do, the consequences will be enormous. A Democrat-controlled House in 2019 would very likely derail the Republican legislative agenda. It could also conceivably set the stage for impeachment proceedings against the president — a move that many Democrats have openly proposed for months now.

But the Democrats’ path back from the wilderness is not a short one. No president since Ronald Reagan has won the presidency as convincingly, twice over, as Obama did — but those victories papered over an extraordinary decline in his party that became suddenly unignorable on Nov. 9, 2016. The Democratic National Committee today is an understaffed, demoralized bureaucracy. It has raised less than half of what its Republican counterpart has taken in so far this year. (Other party organizations — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — are faring better.)

Democratic presidents have generally been less than attentive to the financial and electoral health of their party, during and after their presidencies. The Northwestern political-science professor Daniel J. Galvin writes in his 2010 book, “Presidential Party Building,” that since John F. Kennedy, each of them “neglected, exploited or undercut his party’s organizational capacities.” Galvin found that this maltreatment was because such presidents had operated with “deep and durable majorities” in Congress. After the Democrats lost theirs in 1994, President Bill Clinton awakened to the virtues of party-building. Galvin predicted that Obama would most likely have sufficient reason to do the same.

Instead, Obama was every bit as indifferent as his predecessors. After he took office, his campaign’s formidable grass-roots organization, rechristened Organizing for America, became what some party leaders complained was a “shadow organization” that drained resources from the D.N.C. while championing the president rather than the Democratic Party as a whole. The president did not have anywhere near the kind of close relationship with the last D.N.C. chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, that George W. Bush had with the Republican National Committee chairmen Ed Gillespie and Ken Mehlman.

In 2012, Obama’s campaign chose not to contribute any money to the D.S.C.C. during that cycle — and then, emerging from its victory that year with a $20 million debt, the campaign promptly offloaded it onto the D.N.C. In early 2014, Obama assured Senate Democrats that keeping the Senate majority was his “No. 1 priority.” Months passed without any further action. Finally, two months before the midterms, Obama informed Harry Reid by phone that he was authorizing a $5 million transfer of D.N.C. funds to Senate election efforts. Reid tersely replied, “It shouldn’t have been this hard.”

Few of the Obama campaigns’ innovations have meaningfully outlasted his presidency. Their once-pioneering digital-organizing operation, for example, went largely to ground in 2016, while the party failed to fully grasp even the basics, like the usefulness of digital advertising. “What I can tell you,” says Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who oversaw an analysis of the party’s shortcomings in the last election cycle, “is that our candidates and their staff told us that the Republicans did much better digitally than we did. And they spent more than us on digital.” (Teddy Goff, Obama’s former digital director, says: “I sincerely wish the technology built in the two Obama campaigns had been put to better use for 2016 and races down the ballot.”)

State Democratic Party leaders complain about O.F.A. — rebranded again recently as Organizing for Action — hoarding campaign resources to little end. And Priorities USA, the extravagantly funded super PAC that was started to support Obama’s 2012 campaign, never built the kind of entrenched ground-level presence maintained by its analogues on the right. In contrast, Americans for Prosperity, the conservative network financed by David and Charles Koch, spent the Obama years establishing a network of more than three million activists in 36 states and mobilizing them to protest against Obamacare, environmental regulations and tax increases — becoming what the group’s president, Tim Phillips, described to me as “a state-based long-game organization that would always be there.” The current chairman of Priorities USA, Guy Cecil, acknowledges the disparity: “Most of our activities, most of our structures, are built around individual fights, or individual candidates, or individual organizations, and I think that’s put us at a disadvantage.”

Organizational and technological lapses do not fully account for the Democratic Party’s travails. “All that stuff is like the field-goal team,” the Obama strategist David Axelrod told me. “None of it will help you if you haven’t already moved 80 yards down the field. Being technologically proficient wouldn’t have saved Obama if he didn’t also have a consistent, compelling message.”

But that message had grown threadbare by 2016. No longer was it sufficient to campaign on hope and change, or even on the president’s successful efforts in 2009 to stave off a deep recession. The uneven economic recovery raised questions about the party’s obliviousness to the impunity of Wall Street and the gap between the megawealthy and everyone else. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman who was an author of “A Better Deal,” admits, “We developed a blind spot for the economic challenges that still remained unmet.”

By the end of Obama’s presidency, the Democratic Party had lost nearly a thousand seats in state legislatures across America. It had forfeited its majority in both the House and the Senate. A mere 16 of the nation’s 50 governors were Democrats — and that number dwindled to 15 in August, when Jim Justice of West Virginia announced with a grinning Donald Trump at his side that he, too, had decided to become a Republican.

A few days after the election, Ian Russell quit his job as the deputy executive director of the D.C.C.C. and cashed in his frequent-flier miles on a trip to Ireland. He watched Trump’s swearing-in on his phone in a Dublin pub over a pint of Guinness, and then a few more. The following morning, he threw his bags in a rental car and began a sort of weeklong post-traumatic odyssey, rambling westward to the coast.

Russell, now 33, had spent the past six years at the D.C.C.C. trying to help the Democrats regain the House majority that they lost to the Republicans in the 2010 midterm election. During every election cycle, political journalists and donors would file into one of the drab conference rooms inside the D.N.C. headquarters near the Capitol and watch as D.C.C.C. officials like Russell unveiled maps and polling data in support of the claim that this election cycle — unlike the last one — was going to break for the Democrats. Each time, Russell maybe half-believed it.

But election night left him reeling. It wasn’t just that Trump had upset Clinton — including in Russell’s home state, Michigan — or that the Democrats emerged 24 seats short of a House majority. What gnawed at him was a fear that Trump might actually win over Democratic voters more lastingly. Benton Harbor, a few miles down the road from Russell’s hometown in the western part of the state, lost its last Whirlpool manufacturing facility years ago. The childhood friends of his who remained in the area had renounced the Democrats and were now Trump voters. “Trump could transform American politics,” he remembers thinking at the time. “He could truly scramble things.”

But Russell’s fears of a unifying, postpartisan pragmatist in chief swiftly proved unjustified. Rather than focusing on jobs and infrastructure projects, Trump immediately set in motion an attempt to repeal Obamacare and ordered a travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, which was met with demonstrations at airports across the country. On Jan. 30, the nonpartisan Hill analyst Stuart Rothenberg published a column headlined “Trump’s Fast Start Likely Puts the House in Play in 2018.” Rothenberg reasoned that overly aggressive new presidents tended to be judged harshly by the electorate in the middle of their first term. “The House map favors Republicans, but the midterm dynamic could well prove more powerful,” he wrote, listing 20 Republican seats — out of 24 the Democrats would need to flip the House — that, if typical midterm election patterns held, would most likely be imperiled. “Nothing is yet guaranteed, but don’t be surprised if the House is up for grabs in the fall of 2018.”

Late on his last evening in Ireland, Russell was drinking a final Guinness and listening to a passable folk band at the Palace Bar in Dublin while halfheartedly scrolling through the news back home on his phone when he came across Rothenberg’s column. He read through to the end with an accelerating heartbeat. It seemed big news to him that Rothenberg, a dispassionate prognosticator, had confidently issued such a prediction just 10 days into Trump’s presidency.

Back in Washington, Russell joined a relatively new political media consulting firm, Beacon Media, and started hunting for prospective 2018 House candidates. In early March, he traveled to California’s Orange County — historically a G.O.P. stronghold, though its wealthy population included growing numbers of Asian-Americans who tended to vote Democratic. In Irvine he met with Dave Min, a wry 41-year-old law professor who had worked on the Hill as a senior policy adviser to Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, and at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.

Min, the father of three young children, had never considered running for political office before. But he was also a son of Korean immigrants and was appalled by the Trump administration’s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the United States. The incumbent congresswoman of California’s 45th District, Mimi Walters, was a little-known two-term Republican who had never faced serious opposition. She had won by nearly 18 points in 2016, but Clinton beat Trump in the district by more than five points. A strong anti-Trump sentiment in 2018 could work to Min’s benefit. In April, he told Russell that he was in.

Russell then traveled to the Illinois suburbs just west of Chicago. Like California’s 45th District, the Sixth District of Illinois had been reliably Republican for decades. But Clinton beat Trump there by seven points, and already its six-term congressman, Peter Roskam, was avoiding public appearances lest he be called upon to answer for the president. The progressive women’s group Emily’s List had referred Russell to Kelly Mazeski, a longtime public servant on local boards and commissions who had already decided to challenge Roskam. Mazeski was a breast-cancer survivor whose platform, she told me recently, was “health care, health care, health care.” Russell helped Mazeski time her announcement for May 4, the day Roskam and his fellow House Republicans voted for a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Scores of candidates were announcing their intentions in terrain recently considered inhospitable to Democrats: West Virginia, Texas, Kansas. Some aspirants Russell met lacked the talent to match their enthusiasm. Others were hot property and elected to go with one of Beacon Media’s competitors. But by Labor Day, Russell and his firm had picked up 10 Democratic challengers. Among them were a few beguiling dark horses, like a 46-year-old physician and former Y.M.C.A. national health officer from Portage, Mich., named Matt Longjohn. Undeterred by his lack of political experience, Longjohn was challenging Fred Upton, a Republican who had represented Michigan’s Sixth District for three decades.

Russell himself grew up in the Sixth District and cast his first ballot as a registered voter against Upton in 2002. Back then, the incumbent seemed invincible. But now, after leading the committee that wrote the legislation seeking to eviscerate Obamacare, Upton was avoiding town halls and any other public events.

Still, when I met Russell recently, his optimism was tempered by previous electoral disappointments. The Democratic Party now has more candidates than it can support, and next spring is likely to be a season of what national Democratic officials tactfully refer to as “messy primaries.” And even with Trump as a foil, Russell’s candidates were struggling to make a case for themselves. “Right now it’s such a target-rich environment for us,” he told me. But “we’re having trouble explaining why we’re the heroes and the Republicans are the villains. At some point, our narrative will have to become more coherent than it is now.”

In pursuit of the 24 seats Democrats need to win the House, the D.C.C.C. intends to target 80 Republican-held districts — a dozen more than the party went after in its 2006 bonanza year, when it captured a majority after gaining 31 seats. Many of next year’s seem to be fanciful propositions, or strategic plays designed to force the G.O.P. to spend resources where it would rather not. In other cases, the D.C.C.C. is counting districts held by controversial Republicans — Chris Collins of New York, with his aggressive advocacy of a biotech firm in which he held substantial investments; Duncan D. Hunter of California, with the possibility of a federal indictment for supposed campaign fund malfeasances hanging over his head — who nonetheless appear safe, at least for the moment. But four Republican representatives in potential swing districts — Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dave Reichert, Charlie Dent and Pat Tiberi — have already announced their retirement in advance of 2018, and more are expected to follow before the end of the year.

Only two times in the last century (during the Great Depression and after the Sept. 11 attacks) has a president’s party not suffered electoral losses midway into his first term. Those losses — an average of 32 House seats in each such midterm since 1862 — increase to 36 when the president’s approval rating is under 50. President Trump’s polling average has never once exceeded a favorability rating of 48 percent, and it now hovers at about 37 percent.

“I think the best thing the Democrats can do,” Zac Petkanas, formerly the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign, told me, “is find as many people with a pulse, with a D next to their names, in as many districts as possible, and run on Obamacare and standing up to Trump.” But so much of the politics, and political mood, of Trump’s presidency is off the map of previous experience that other Democrats have seemed at times at a loss for how to respond. What to make of the late August NBC poll, for instance, that showed Democrats being viewed unfavorably by 54 percent of those surveyed, which was better than Republicans (61) and Trump (61), but also Pelosi (64)? Was that good news or bad news? And what about the D.C.C.C. focus groups and polls yielding the conclusion that voters broadly dislike Trump but are also put off by candidates who profess to be “standing up to Trump,” on the grounds that such resistance will only guarantee more dysfunction in Washington?

Republicans are hopeful that, Trump being the exception to almost every political rule, the historical trends of wave elections will also not apply to him. “Clinton came up against a wave in 1994 because he had campaigned as a centrist but then led with gays in the military and Hillarycare,” Karl Rove, the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, told me. “The 2006 election was a wave because Republicans were defending the Iraq war and crippled by a late-breaking ethics scandal. Democrats faced a wave in 2010 because of Obamacare. So it’s been issues that have driven wave elections. This time around, I think it’s more a personal antagonism to Trump. And the question is, how critical will that be in shaping the attitudes of swing voters?”

But by Rove’s own analysis, two of the last three wave elections were triggered by health care policies that did not approach the deep unpopularity of the G.O.P.’s attempts this year to repeal or otherwise roll back Obamacare. And Trump’s base cannot be counted on to prevent a wave in 2018, because a key constituency — less-educated white voters — is a group that tends not to show up during midterms. They may have even less motivation to do so next year, considering Trump’s periodic denunciations of the Republican lawmakers who will need their votes.

But in four special elections to fill seats vacated by House Republican incumbents this year, the Democrats fell short — and in the case of Georgia’s Jon Ossoff, lost by four points even after raising an unheard-of $23 million. His was the most expensive House race ever, and the fact that Democratic donors spent so heavily on a loss may help explain why the party’s fund-raising has diminished since then. The Democrats’ base — young and nonwhite voters — is no better than Trump’s at showing up for midterm elections and is unhelpfully clustered in urban districts. Many suburban and rural districts were artfully gerrymandered by Republican state legislators after the 2010 census and have proved impenetrable since then; they aren’t likely to change hands without a healthy number of recent Republican voters being persuaded to vote Democratic.

There is also a less quantifiable problem, the one that vexed Pelosi’s team in the months after the election: the Democratic Party’s chronic difficulty explaining just what it stands for. “There’s a deep worldview among conservative intellectuals that moved its way through a fear of fascism in the 1940s, through think tanks and campaigns and the California tax revolt of the 1970s,” Felicia Wong, president of the progressive Roosevelt Institute, says. “And basically the Democrats don’t have that. The New Deal was one thing, and the Great Society was another thing. The party never fully recognized that Jim Crow and segregation were economic decisions. That left Democrats with an incoherent economic argument. The result is that they lack a historical vocabulary.”

Questions about the interplay of race and economics, of course, aren’t just historical after the 2016 election — as much as politicians and operatives might want them to be. Plenty of progressives hold the view, as the MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid has argued on Twitter, that white working-class voters “resent the changes that racial and religious multiculturalism have brought to societies where people like them have been the majority.” But a former colleague of Reid’s at MSNBC, Krystal Ball, now president of the People’s House Project — which seeks to elect Democratic congressional candidates in G.O.P. districts — insists that the primary motivation of these voters is economic. “People who are holding onto their livelihoods by their fingernails thought that at least Trump gave a crap,” she says. “Maybe it was a pack of lies he was selling them, but at least he didn’t hold them in contempt. And frankly there’s a lot of contempt from certain corners of our party. And a billion dollars’ worth of ads saying we’re not elitists won’t change that.”

Early on the morning of July 27, a group of House Democrats held a private gathering in the Capitol basement with a special guest: Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and former Obama chief of staff, who over a decade ago, when he was an Illinois congressman, served as chairman of the D.C.C.C. Looking ahead to 2018, Emanuel offered a broad-brushstroke plan of attack: “Find the specific issues that resonate in your district,” he said, according to one meeting participant’s notes. “We want to appeal to Trump voters who are already pulling away from him.” In particular, “Suburbs are our best opportunities.” On the matter of ideological purity, he was blunt: “It’s not a question of left versus center — it’s forward versus backward.”

If this advice sounded familiar, it was because Emanuel advocated the same strategy a dozen years earlier, when he was trying to lift his party out of the trough it had occupied since the Newt Gingrich-led takeover of the House by the Republicans in 1994. Emanuel focused on recruiting more centrist candidates who were well liked in their districts rather than on ideological darlings of the national party. “The people who criticized me back in 2006 were from my own party,” he told me recently. “When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at: ‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

The election cemented Emanuel’s legend as a tactician — none of the Democrats attending the July 27 meeting expressed skepticism about his advice — but his strategy has never sat well with the party’s progressive activists. “I would just point to the fact that Rahm Emanuel’s Democrats who won in 2006 couldn’t hold those seats,” Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (P.C.C.C.), which supports, trains and funds candidates, told me.

She was referring to the nearly a dozen Democrats who rode the 2006 wave into Congress, only to wash back out of it with the Tea Party wave four years later. (Three more had lost in 2008.) “I would suggest a counterfactual,” she went on: “If we had true economic populist champions who made the case to the American people about fighting for a strong economic agenda, we might have had more lasting success.” Or as the P.C.C.C.’s other founder, Adam Green, put it to me: “If there’s a Democratic wave in 2018, progressives won’t just ride that wave — we will cause that wave.”

Of course, activists like Green and Taylor also vowed to be the tip of the party’s spear in the previous cycle, with not much to show for it. Indeed, the Breitbart chairman and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon scornfully likens the Democrats’ ideological tussles to a “pillow fight,” further charging that progressives will never accomplish their goals “until they have a Breitbart on the left,” he told me. “Our stock in trade is going after the Republican establishment. There’s no one like that on the other side.”

Most if not all Democrats are more than happy to watch Bannon’s kamikaze antics wreak havoc on the opposition. Still, some in the party rue the lack of pugnacity on their own side. “There are two types of Democrats,” David Krone, Harry Reid’s former chief of staff, told me one afternoon this summer in the Midtown Manhattan office where he now works as a consultant for an investment firm. “There are killers, and there are whiners. Unfortunately, we have too many of the latter and not enough of the former.”

Krone considers piety an obstacle to progressive policies. “Democrats are not that pure,” he told me, with a biting smile. “All those guys have a transactional component to them.” Under Reid’s leadership, the Democrats managed to pass important legislation like the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act while also thwarting a stream of conservative bills generated by the Republican-controlled House. But it was also Reid who held his colleagues to the deal that garnered the pharmaceutical industry’s support for Obamacare by agreeing to take Medicare drug prices off the table. When the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for outside-group contributions, Reid did not join the chorus of bemoaners. Instead, he ordered up a super PAC, called the Senate Majority PAC, to help keep the Senate in Democratic hands during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. “Reid just never pretended to be something he wasn’t,” Krone said. “You don’t want to pass health care? Fine. Don’t make deals. Keep losing.”

In the Democratic Killers Hall of Fame, Krone places Emanuel and Pelosi. But lately, Krone observed, the party seemed to be tilting toward the whiners — beginning with the excuses offered for Hillary Clinton’s defeat. “It’s insane,” he said. “They freaking lost! They can blame anyone they want to, but they fail to look in the mirror.”

The 2018 cycle, Krone argued, was no time for squeamishness. Again he cited the example of his former boss Reid, who, like many Democrats in 2010, was a heavy underdog going into his final Senate race. Rather than be cowed by a Republican field that, at the peak of the Tea Party movement, had been infiltrated by the party’s fringe, Reid turned that to his advantage. His campaign waded into the Republican primary, targeting the most formidable G.O.P. opponents one by one until the only one left standing was Sharron Angle: a Tea Party favorite who once crusaded against water fluoridation and claimed multiple American cities were under the rule of Shariah law. Reid beat her easily.

By way of contrast, Krone pointed to Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin senator who, with John McCain, was a standard-bearer for campaign-finance reform, as well as a crusader for civil liberties during the Bush years. Feingold lacked Reid’s appetite for the jugular, losing to Ron Johnson in 2010 and then again in 2016. “He had his foot on Johnson’s neck, and then he let up, because he was up in the polls,” Krone lamented. “They don’t hand out participation trophies in politics.” If the party limited itself to high-minded campaigning and legislating, “We’ll lose again, and Kennedy” — the Supreme Court justice — “will retire, and Trump will get to appoint another conservative crazy, and the Democrats will wonder how things got to be so horrible.”

Still, the party faces a conundrum in its pursuit of Trump voters whose anxieties aren’t just economic but cultural as well. Prevailing in some red districts may require, at minimum, tempering the party’s progressivism on social issues. “When anybody talks about a so-called litmus test for candidates, that upsets me,” Representative Cheri Bustos told me. “I’m from Illinois, where I’m the only downstate Democrat in our entire delegation. I’ve been a Democrat my whole life, and my core values are very much in line with what hard-core Democrats believe. I don’t ever lie about my views. However, I also don’t talk about issues that are by their very nature divisive. If asked, I’ll answer I’m pro-choice. But then I’ll get back to the economy.”

But a week after Bustos and I spoke, the D.C.C.C.’s chairman, Ben Ray Luján, enraged liberal groups by saying that his organization would not oppose House candidates in favor of restricting abortion. Seeking to douse the fire, Meredith Kelly, the D.C.C.C. communications director, released a statement clarifying that the D.C.C.C. listed abortion rights as among the “fundamental tenets of the Democratic Party” and that the recruits it was backing “represent the values of the party.”

Adam Green of the P.C.C.C. was adamant on the prospect of anti-abortion recruits: “We wouldn’t welcome candidates who are pushing anti-choice policies into the big tent any more than we would welcome racists and people who want to deregulate Wall Street.” Green wasn’t buying the implication by Bustos and other moderates that the Democratic Party will regain a majority only if it backs away from progressive ideals. He urged me to talk to Rick Nolan, a progressive rural Minnesota congressman who, he said, “wins the right way.”

Nolan is a folksy 73-year-old journeyman politician and businessman who has long advocated a single-payer health system. He also hunts, fishes, makes his own maple syrup and in other ways stays attuned to the culture of Minnesota’s Eighth District. Taking Green’s advice, I asked Nolan whether he would welcome an anti-abortion candidate into the Democratic caucus. “Wholeheartedly,” he said. “If there’s a fault today among Democrats, it’s that they’ve got the worst litmus test known to humankind. If we want to achieve the goals progressives want, we’ve got to get back into the majority. Democrats are damned fools if they don’t see that.”

There was one thing on which the Democrats I interviewed, across the spectrum — Adam Green, David Krone, Krystal Ball, Meredith Kelly — agreed: that I should watch a YouTube ad that was posted in June on behalf of a 52-year-old Wisconsin ironworker named Randy Bryce. Bryce, whose prodigious mustache has earned him the nickname Ironstache, is aiming to unseat the current officeholder of Wisconsin’s First District, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House. The emotionally charged ad announcing his campaign culminates in a challenge: “Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C.”

One rainy late summer afternoon, I met up with the ad’s creator, a 42-year-old Army veteran named Bill Hyers, in a Washington hotel bar overcrowded with well-dressed young professionals. Hyers was sipping an old-fashioned when I arrived. He was dressed in a T-shirt and khaki shorts, his preferred business attire. Hyers has successfully managed the campaigns of well-established Democratic politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and his own politics are straightforwardly liberal. At the same time, he harbors a Holden Caulfield-esque disdain of insincerity and believes that this quality, more than whining or ideological perfectionism, explains his party’s state of decline.

“What’s terrible about Democrats like Rahm Emanuel,” Hyers said, “is that it matters more to them if you’re a candidate who can raise money from very wealthy people than if you have an argument to make. They look at everything through the old Clinton triangulation strategy. Put out very carefully prepared statements. Don’t let anyone get to your right. Deny and ignore. Never have an honest dialogue. It was a bad strategy back in the ’90s. But it’s even worse today, because we can now have 24-7 access to candidates, and people can see when they’re not being authentic. Everything Hillary Clinton did was carefully scripted — they could see that.”

Hyers’s client Bryce has been the undisputed breakout star of the 2018 cycle so far; the announcement ad has attracted millions of views. (Such enthusiasm, it should be said, does not yet make Bryce any less of a long shot: The D.C.C.C. does not currently include Wisconsin’s First District among its 80 targeted seats.) The afternoon we met, Hyers showed me a rough cut of an ad for his newest client, a former Army champion boxer and ex-opioid addict from Staten Island named Boyd Melson — known in the ring as the Rainmaker — who is running for New York’s 11th District. Melson’s YouTube rollout, like Bryce’s, is replete with stirring proletarian imagery: neighborhoods festooned with American flags, an aloof Republican incumbent dodging town halls, Melson alone in the ring pummeling the air with slow-motion jabs. It suggests a trailer for “Rocky Goes to Washington.”

“I can only take a little credit for them,” Hyers admitted after the two-and-a-half-minute ad came to an end. Bryce’s and Melson’s ads, he told me, had a co-producer: Matt McLaughlin, a veteran of TV advertising who “didn’t know campaigns and politics, but he knows art.” Hyers did not think the party’s need for “authentic candidates” and a little theatrical verve were incompatible. If anything, the role the confluence of those two perceived assets played in Trump’s victory is one of the few inarguable lessons of the 2016 election.

This lesson, however unacknowledged, is playing out across the 2018 electoral landscape. In Kentucky, a former Marine fighter pilot named Amy McGrath appears in a bomber jacket, declaring that her “new mission” is to “take on a Congress full of career politicians.” Assessing her candidacy’s apparent long odds, she says, with a cockeyed grin, “We’ll see about that.” Another web ad shows a dashing scientist in a white lab coat: Hans Keirstead, a pioneering stem-cell researcher now running to represent California’s 48th District and billing himself as the very definition of a “problem solver.”

In mid-August, I spoke to Ian Russell’s latest client, a telegenic Marine veteran and two-term state representative from Lewiston, Me., named Jared Golden. Lewiston today is a hollowed-out exoskeleton of a textile mill town. “Our way of life is under attack here,” Golden said. “We’re a classic case of the America that’s being left behind. The social-identity issues that have been emphasized in Portland don’t resonate in rural Maine. It’s damaged the Democratic brand here, to be honest. We’re a community of hard-working people who may not be highly educated, but that doesn’t mean we’re not intelligent. The majority of the folks here voted for Donald Trump, and I can tell you that the description of them as a basket of deplorables is just dead wrong.”

Golden told me that his neighbors had until recently thought of themselves as Democrats. Golden himself still is. When we spoke, he had just decided to run in Maine’s Second District against the Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin. Golden would be the fifth Democrat to enter the race. He seemed to have little use for the national party’s “A Better Deal” pitch, telling me, “It’s going to take more than a glossy new policy document to take back the U.S. House.”

What, then, would it take? A few days after I spoke with Golden, Ian Russell traveled to Lewiston and shot his candidate’s announcement ad. It mixes twilit images of small-town Maine with footage of the candidate in combat fatigues; later, he jogs down a country road wearing a T-shirt that says, “Pain Is Weakness Leaving the Body.” The ad excoriates the Republican incumbent but also bipartisan trade deals and unnamed political leaders who push “issues that don’t impact your life.”

The first issue of Education Life, a black-and-white tabloid of 80 pages, featured an article with the headline “The Care and Feeding of Undergraduates.” It talked about the fancy new stadiums mushrooming across the country, the abundance of career-related programs and the stressed-out students hunkered down in the library in hopes of securing a high-paying corporate job. The year was 1986. Gordon Gekko was just around the corner.

As I step down as editor of Education Life after almost 20 years, two-thirds of its life span, I’ve been reflecting on the evolution of higher education (our longstanding focus), or its lack thereof. In 2017, students are still stressed out, the amenities arms race has not abated and the liberal arts continues to lose ground to business, and now tech.

Plus ça change. . .

With their glacial pace toward progress, their hunger for prestige and their liberal partisanship, colleges and universities are hair-pullingly flawed enterprises. Just look at the bounty of ivory tower hand-wringers on Amazon with “reform” in the title. There are just too many colleges out there, all vying for “the best” students. There are too many large lecture halls, and too many lost students. It costs too much.

Photo

But while college is under siege as never before — in a first, a majority of Republicans hold negative views of higher education, according to a July Pew Research Center survey — American academe remains the envy of the world, and we too often fail to celebrate its success in growing our children, training our doctors, inspiring our innovators and fueling our urban economies. It’s a tall order. State funding of public universities is on track to reach zero in less than 20 years in some states and as soon as six in Colorado and nine in Alaska, as Laura Pappano wrote last year in an article on the plight of public universities.

Ed Life, in the in-house vernacular, has tried to explain this complex world.

A 2014 Education Week column called the section a “slightly eccentric aunt” (ouch!) as well as “a welcome visitor every three months” and unique among newspaper supplements as a repository of quality journalism. Just consider the contributors, among them Frank McCourt, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Lawrence H. Summers, Clayton M. Christensen, Steven Pinker, David Leonhardt, Duff McDonald, James Traub, Michael Winerip, Caitlin Flanagan, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, Brian Stelter, Andrew Ross Sorkin (at age 22!).

As I leaf through back issues, flipping through the college careers of Gen X-ers to millennials to Gen Ys, I see much that provides perspective on what campuses wrestle with even today:

In 2008, Kevin Sack soaked up pregame rituals in Gainesville, Fla., to report on how colleges wage battle against binge drinking, as insidious now as it was a decade ago. His opening passage:

It is 10:30 a.m., two hours before the Florida Gators will kick off to Ole Miss, and Max, a 19-year-old freshman, is laboring to explain how he feels about the drinking age. “Per-son-al-ly,” he says, punching out each slurred syllable, “I do agree the age should be lowered. It will cut down on binge drinking.” He throws an arm around a fraternity brother. “But we take care of each other. We will not let anyone drink under the influence.” He pauses. “I mean drive under the influence. I’m sorry. I’m drunk already. It’s been a long morning.”",Saying Farewell to Education Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/saying-farewell-to-education-life.html

And for all his intelligence and focus, Mr. Akhtar seldom bucks the formula to provide answers.","With that breakout work, Mr. Akhtar showed a gift for explosive terseness, packing fraught layers of meaning into the interactions of a handful of precisely drawn characters who turned ideological stereotypes inside out and back again. His command of a wide reach within close quarters was confirmed in his equally compact “The Invisible Hand,” which managed to be both a high-stakes hostage thriller and a Shavian debate on capitalism and Islam.

“Junk” finds Mr. Akhtar filling a much bigger canvas. It has a cast of nearly two dozen (with an even greater roster of characters). And it runs two and a half hours, making it the longest of Mr. Akhtar’s plays.

But with expansion has come dilution, and a sense that characters and themes are being stretched into thin transparency. This is not to say that Mr. Akhtar seems lost in the larger space afforded by this play-by-play account of one man’s bid to become a master of the universe. On the contrary, “Junk” follows a labyrinthine, economically dense plot with remarkable briskness, efficiency and accessibility.

Still, these assets never quite erase the feeling that what we’re watching is a tale we’ve frequently been entertained and alarmed by during the past three decades. Memorable onstage variations include two British imports that flopped on Broadway: Caryl Churchill’s “Serious Money,” a dazzlingly mannered account (in rhyming couplets!) of a hostile takeover, and Lucy Prebble’s spectacularly flamboyant “Enron.”

On screen, there was pre-eminently Oliver Stone’s “Wall Street” (1987), which created a new genre of Hollywood biz flicks, with such worthy 21st-century descendants as “Margin Call,” “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “The Big Short.” And insider-y boardroom back stories are perennials on best-seller lists.

At their best, these works have been enlivened by piquant details that summon the quirks and ravening egos of predators in power suits. With glory-courting characters inspired not only by Mr. Milken but also by the mayor-to-be Rudolph Giuliani and the infamous stock trader Ivan Boesky, “Junk” might have easily been a parade of similarly outsized personalities in overpriced clothes with big shoulder pads.

Mr. Akhtar deliberately and honorably chose not to pursue that route. In prefatory notes in the script, he says, “The insinuation of the mid-1980s in costume and design must not be overdone.” The play is intended, he writes, as “a ritual enactment of an origin myth.”

The myth, in this case, is the culture of debt, which Mr. Akhtar posits is one in which we are still immersed. He does so without undue speechifying or instructional exposition, as he chronicles Merkin’s takeover by proxy of a third-generation Pennsylvania steel company, led by a clueless family scion (Rick Holmes).

The script is refreshingly nonjudgmental. At one point, Merkin complains about how reporters always go for “the simple story,” with a good guy and bad guy, adding, “They don’t understand how the real world works.”

Photo

Accordingly, every major character is allowed to present the viability of his or her viewpoint. Whether old-guard Protestant patriarchal types or rule-bending Jewish parvenus (who face anti-Semitic barbs now and then), none of them are unconditionally lovable or loathable.

Unfortunately, none of them are entirely convincing either. This is partly a matter of casting. Mr. Pasquale (“The Bridges of Madison County”) renders Merkin as a handsome cipher. You never sense the obsessive and infectious passion that drives him. (His code name in his insider trading deals, by the way, is Moby Dick).

As a reporter determined to strip Wall Street to its seamy underbelly, Teresa Avia Lim never conveys anything like rabid ambition. In contrast, Michael Siberry, who plays her white-shoed love interest, is a blustery, sputtering figure, a persona that feels out of sync with the old-order propriety he is meant to embody.

In supporting roles, Matthew Saldivar (as a crafty lawyer), Matthew Rauch (as a crude tyro on the rise) and Joey Slotnick (as the Boesky stand-in) at least have expressive physical presences. But no one emerges as a fully defined individual.

And while Mr. Akhtar may have rejected many of the outer trappings of the Wall Street potboiler, he still hews to many of its clichés. That includes a woman being brought to orgasm by the idea of her decrepit lover’s financial power, and the antihero Merkin solemnly lying to his wife (Miriam Silverman) in the manner of Michael Corleone.

And while the script offers some amusing lessons in shading language with hopeful sounding words to pitch a deal, Mr. Akhtar’s dialogue lacks its usual original snap. “When did money become the thing — the only thing?” Ms. Lim’s character asks in the opening monologue.

It’s an ever-intriguing question, but you’ve heard it before. And for all his intelligence and focus, Mr. Akhtar seldom bucks the formula to provide answers.

“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

Top Women Contenders

Mary Keitany (Kenya)

She’s the three-time defending champion. Only she and Grete Waitz have won three or more in a row. (Waitz won three in a row from 1978 to 1980 and then five in a row from 1982 to 1986.) Last year, Keitany won by 3 minutes 34 seconds — the largest margin of victory since 1980. Keitany also holds the women-only marathon world record — 2 hours 17 minutes 1 second — which she set in April at the London Marathon, breaking Paula Radcliffe’s 12-year-old mark.

Edna Kiplagat (Kenya)

She won this race in 2010, but has been back only once since (13th in 2014). She was the 2011 and 2013 world champion, the only back-to-back winner. She was second at this year’s world championships. She also won this year’s Boston Marathon. At 37, she is still in excellent form.

Mare Dibaba (Ethiopia)

The 2015 world champion and bronze medalist at the Rio Olympics. Her 2015 title, at the Bird’s Nest Stadium in Beijing, was a sprint win over three other women. She competed briefly for Azerbaijan in 2009, but quickly returned to her native country.

Buzunesh Deba (Ethiopia)

Based in the Bronx, she was second in this race in 2011. She won the 2014 Boston Marathon after the original winner, Rita Jeptoo, was disqualified for doping. She hasn’t really sparkled since then, but is still only 30.

Shalane Flanagan (United States)

She was the silver medalist in the 10K at the Beijing Olympics (upgraded from bronze because of doping). She was second in her marathon debut in New York in 2010. She dropped out of consideration for this year’s Boston Marathon with a fracture in her back.

Top Men Contenders

Lelisa Desisa (Ethiopia)

He was the winner of the Boston Marathon in 2013, the year of the bombing. He endeared himself to the people of Boston by presenting his winner’s medal back to the city to honor the victims. He also gave his racing bib to two of the victims. “Sport holds the power to unify people,” he said. “Sport should never be used as a battleground.”

He returned to win Boston in 2015 as well. He has been second (2014) and third (2015) in New York, but has never won here. He won the silver medal at the 2013 world championships.

Meb Keflezighi (United States)

At 42, Keflezighi plans to retire after this race, his 26th marathon. A fan favorite for years, he was born in Eritrea and came to the United States at age 12.

He won New York in 2009, and Boston in 2014. He won a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics and competed in three Olympics, including Rio. He holds the 40-and-over record for New York, which is 2:13:32.

He is the only American to win Boston since 1983, and the only American to win New York since 1982. He is the only man from any country to win New York, Boston and an Olympic marathon medal.

But he isn’t really a contender to win this year; he told Sports Illustrated: “Maybe top 10. To be on the podium would be huge.”

Ghirmay Ghebreslassie (Eritrea)

The defending champion and the young superstar of the sport. He won New York last year at age 20, making him the youngest male winner. He won the 2015 world championships at 19, the youngest winner for that competition. He was fourth in the Rio Olympics, almost a disappointment.

Wilson Kipsang (Kenya)

His past efforts at this have been quite successful, and during my recent visit to Pyongyang I saw signs that sanctions were biting.

But the goal appears doomed: Almost no expert believes that sanctions will force Kim Jong-un to give up his nuclear weapons or halt his missile program. That puts us on a collision course, for North Korea seems determined to develop a clear capacity to target the U.S. with nuclear weapons, while the White House hints that it would rather have a war than allow the North to become a nuclear threat.

“Our president has been really clear about this,” H. R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, said on Fox News. “He is not going to permit this rogue regime, Kim Jong-un, to threaten the United States with a nuclear weapon. And so he is willing to do anything necessary to prevent that from happening.”

The whispers in Washington are that “anything necessary” includes airstrikes on North Korea, such as a strike on a missile as it is being prepared for launch. When I asked North Korean officials what would happen in those circumstances, they answered unambiguously: war.

Tammy Duckworth, a former military pilot who is now a Democratic senator from Illinois, says that from what she hears, the chance is greater than 50/50 that the president will order a strike.

“I see a change in posture,” she told me. “I am extremely worried that we’ve moved beyond ‘Let’s prevent war’ to ‘It’s acceptable to do a first strike.’”

Duckworth and other Senate Democrats have introduced legislation that would prevent the president from making a pre-emptive strike on North Korea without congressional approval, barring an imminent threat to the U.S. or its allies.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, has said that Trump told him he’d choose a war with North Korea over allowing it to continue on its course.

“There is a military option: to destroy North Korea’s program and North Korea itself,” Graham told the “Today” show, relaying a conversation with Trump. “If thousands die, they’re going to die over there. They’re not going to die here — and he’s told me that to my face.”

Graham said that if North Korea continues to test intercontinental ballistic missiles, a war is “inevitable.”

This may be a bluff, but, if not, war is coming, for almost every expert believes that North Korea will continue its testing.

Trump didn’t create the problem, and it’s real: We should fear North Korea’s gaining the capacity to destroy U.S. cities. Eerily, on my last visit, North Koreans repeatedly said that a nuclear war with the U.S. was not only survivable but winnable.

The U.S. must now choose among three awful options: 1) A “freeze for a freeze” deal, which Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seems to be pursuing; 2) Long-term deterrence, just as we have deterred North Korea for decades from using its chemical and biological weapons; 3) A conventional war that might escalate into a nuclear exchange.

Security experts overwhelmingly say the least terrible choice is the deal for a freeze on North Korean testing in exchange for reductions in sanctions or U.S.-South Korean military exercises, but at this point it’s not clear that either Washington or Pyongyang would agree to such an arrangement. Deterrence is next best, and war is the worst option. But that’s the option Trump seems headed toward.

North Korea may also inflame the situation with provocations at any time, such as firing a long-range missile into the sea near Guam, or conducting an atmospheric nuclear test that would send radioactive fallout drifting toward the United States. Trump may also shoot down a North Korean missile over international waters; that’s less provocative than a strike on North Korean territory, but I’d still expect a military response. And there’s a constant risk of miscalculations and incidents that spiral out of control.

Fourteen years ago, America stumbled into a devastating war with Iraq without thinking through the consequences. This feels like déjà vu — only potentially far more devastating.

Adjusting times for temperatures would lead to smaller changes among women. Paula Radcliffe of Britain (who has won the New York race three times) would remain the record-holder.

The interactions between climate and a sport like long-distance running are only going to get more pronounced as the climate changes. Over the last 50 years, the temperature has exceeded 60 degrees on just 5 percent of the days during the first week of November, when the New York race is typically held. By 2050, this is projected to rise to 18 percent of days, and by 2090 it is expected to be 38 percent.

How will runners and organizers react? National governments, city planners and large corporations are all realizing that a warmer world will force them to change the ways they do business.

Marathons will be no exception. The organizers of the New York race will probably not want their event to be one where it is difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for people to set their personal best or to lower the world record. So they may want to adapt by moving the marathon to later in the year.

At the same time, runners may switch from the New York City Marathon to others held in cooler climates to find the perfect temperature at just the right time of year. Could a Montreal Marathon be among the world’s most prestigious by 2050?

Athletic equipment companies will surely develop new technologies to aid adaptation as well. For runners, the breathable mesh and cooling towels of today could easily be traded in for shirts with built-in air-conditioners. Seem far-fetched? They already exist. Indeed, I was one of the authors of a recent study of just how powerful a role technology can play in helping people adapt to warmer temperatures. For example, the rise of air-conditioning has reduced the mortality consequences of extremely hot days in the United States by more than 70 percent since 1960.

Marathons and marathon runners appear likely to be able to adapt to climate change with relative ease through changes in when, where and how. But in many other areas of our lives, the costs of climate change are expected to be greater. More intense hurricanes, and the increased occurrence of extremely hot days, will elevate risks to life and property, which can only be offset through costly adaptation efforts. These include building more expensive housing, accelerating the deployment of air-conditioning and making painful decisions to move away from current homes — as well as acceptance of increased risks.

In this way, the climate choice in front of us is similar to the one faced by people training for a marathon. More time spent training makes for a faster marathon. It’s not a great idea to show up on the day of the race without having invested much in your performance. The time for that is well in advance of the big day.

In the case of climate change, we can devote resources now to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we face lower costs in the future. As with so many things in life, both marathons and the climate problem are subject to an old rule — no pain, no gain.",Your Race Against Time: How Climate Affects the Marathon,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/upshot/your-race-against-time-how-climate-affects-the-marathon.html

The governor’s race, although reminiscent of 2016, hasn’t quite polarized voters to the same extent.

White working-class voters said they backed Mr. Trump by a 48-point margin, 67 percent to 19 percent, somewhat wider than Mr. Gillespie’s 40-point edge.

Mr. Northam holds a 26-point lead among voters from Northern Virginia; voters from that area said they backed Mrs. Clinton by 31 points. It’s a pattern up and down the ballot.

The pattern has also been fairly common beyond Virginia this year. In special congressional elections, Republicans have fallen far short of Mr. Trump’s strong showing in white working-class areas, while Democrats have struggled to exceed Mrs. Clinton’s showing in the areas where she excelled, like Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District.

But the Virginia contest seems to have a distinct dynamic. Mr. Gillespie, with establishment roots as a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has run a campaign plainly intended to rally Mr. Trump’s supporters, making the question of whether he can approach Mr. Trump’s strong tallies somewhat more interesting.

If Mr. Gillespie prevails or runs well ahead of Mr. Trump, it might be interpreted as a sign that establishment Republicans can excel by embracing Mr. Trump’s message.

Even if Mr. Gillespie loses by a small margin, his campaign could be judged a success, given national political conditions and Virginia’s Democratic lean.

Mr. Northam entered the race as a clear if modest favorite. Virginia, with a high percentage of college-educated voters, backed Mrs. Clinton by a five-point margin in November, and the national political environment would seem to be very favorable to a Democrat.

The party out of power has generally won the Virginia governor’s race, and Republicans have struggled in this year’s special elections. Mr. Trump’s approval rating has consistently been in the 30s, and Democrats have a considerable lead on the generic congressional ballot. These conditions are consistent with a so-called wave election, like the ones that swept Democrats into power in the House in 2006 and back out in 2010.

But Mr. Trump’s approval rating was at 39 percent in the Upshot/Siena survey, with his disapproval at 51 percent. These figures are somewhat better for Mr. Trump than those of most other surveys — perhaps in part because this poll tries to capture likely voters in an off-year election, and those voters are considerably older and whiter than the overall adult population.

The poll was sampled from an L2 voter file, and it’s weighted to a likely electorate. It supposes a turnout of around 2.4 million votes, up somewhat from the 2.24 million cast in the 2013 governor’s race. But higher or lower turnout would not necessarily be a clear advantage for either side, according to our results. The Democratic strength among well-educated voters — and the robust Democratic turnout in the primary for this race — gives the party more strength among high-turnout voters than has been the case in recent elections.

About 14 percent of respondents were undecided or refused to answer, while another 2 percent backed the Libertarian candidate Cliff Hyra. The relatively high proportion of undecided voters is partly because the sample includes a large number of less likely voters, who are vastly more likely to be undecided than the likeliest voters. Many public polls sample only frequent voters, or screen their sample down to the likeliest voters. Mr. Northam would have led by three points, 46 to 43, if the sample had counted only voters who were “almost sure” or “very likely” to vote.

How the Poll Has Changed

The poll is the first Upshot/Siena survey since the 2016 presidential election, when polls generally overstated Mrs. Clinton’s support in the decisive battleground states.

Mr. Trump led by four points in our final Florida survey in 2016, and he was tied in our final North Carolina survey.

But the Upshot/Siena survey also had Mrs. Clinton up by seven points in earlier polls of North Carolina and Pennsylvania, taken soon after the third debate, when she still had a wide lead in national and battleground state polls. The apparent shifts over the last few weeks of the race make it more difficult to assess the performance of these surveys.

But a close analysis of last year’s surveys, combined with insights from across the survey industry, has helped inform two initial changes to the Upshot/Siena poll since last November’s election.

First, the poll is weighted by self-reported education to match estimates based on the census’ Current Population Survey. There’s considerable evidence that the failure to weight by education was a major reason state pre-election polls were off the mark, especially in the Rust Belt states.

It’s not so clear that education weighting would have considerably improved the performance of Upshot/Siena surveys. That’s because the Upshot/Siena sample design and weighting scheme was already intended to properly represent low-turnout voters, who tend to be less educated.

The education weight had no effect on the results of this Virginia survey.

Second, we sampled and weighted to a likely electorate, rather than registered voters. Similarly, the modeled turnout score — our estimate for the probability that a voter will turn out, based on past voting record and other measures — now represents 60 percent of our estimate that a respondent will turn out, up from 50 percent in 2016. The remaining 40 percent of the estimate is based on respondents’ answers to several questions about their interest in politics, the coming election and their intention to vote.

Over all, these changes would have eliminated about half of the bias and one-third of the error in our final three surveys in 2016. (That may not be generalizable to other elections.)

Afghan and American forces have struggled to clear the surroundings of Kunduz City after the Taliban briefly overran the city twice in the past two years.

Following the first fall of the city, in 2015, American gunships mistakenly targeted the Doctors Without Borders hospital in the province, killing 42 people and destroying much of the hospital. Then, last year, American aircraft were involved in another deadly episode involving civilians, killing 33.

American airstrikes have more than doubled since President Trump announced in August a new strategy for Afghanistan. According to the United States Air Force, American aircraft dropped about 900 munitions in August and September, compared to about 260 for the same period last year.

Afghan officials have praised the strikes, saying they have helped fend off Taliban advances and decreased the risk that militants would take over cities and districts, but others have said the civilian toll from the airstrikes is unacceptably high.

Residents of Gharaw Qishlaq, a village in the Chardara district, said heavy fighting between the Taliban and Afghan commandos had continued for days, and Taliban targets in the village had been struck repeatedly.

“At night, they bombed many times in our area,” said Abdul Qayoum, a tailor in the village who lost three cousins in the airstrikes. “In the morning, after prayer, people got out to see what happened. My dad went, but I didn’t go. Then we heard another strike. When I came out, I saw people carrying bodies on carts.”

In a separate development in Kabul, a court sentenced seven bodyguards for the country’s vice president, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, to eight years in prison for abducting and raping a political rival.

Ahmad Ishchi, a former governor of Mr. Dostum’s home province of Jowzjan, claimed in December that he had been abducted by the vice president and his bodyguards from a sports event, and then raped with the tip of a gun.

The case, which has tested the government’s will to hold the powerful accountable, forced Mr. Dostum to go into de facto exile in Turkey. He tried to return once, but his plane was forced to turn around.

Although Mr. Dostum has refused to answer to questions from the country’s attorney general, seven of his guards submitted to questioning.

Baktash Ishchi, the son of Mr. Ishchi, said he and his father were present in the court during the sentencing on Saturday, when the judge sentenced the bodyguards to three years in prison for abduction and illegal detention and five years for rape.

“In total, 10 people, including Dostum, are involved in this case,” said Baktash Ishchi. “Some of them, including Dostum, were not present for investigations.

Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.

Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.

But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.

Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.

The most remarkable sign of Amazon’s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.

The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.

On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google’s pending appearance before Congress.

Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share — surpassing Wall Street’s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue — up 24 percent — while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.

In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company’s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.

Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.

With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company’s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion — or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.

Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.

While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year.

The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.

Microsoft executives credited much of the company’s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft’s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.

She was inspired by the national uproar over sexual harassment, but did not really think about joining that larger conversation. The post was intended for her family and friends, and they responded immediately. “I was feeling really loved and supported,” Ms. Kohler said in an interview.

But such is the nature of Facebook that others quickly read it as well, including an associate of Mr. Ratner’s. His attorney, Martin Singer, called before lunch. “I was totally caught off guard,” Ms. Kohler said.

This week, even as accusations against the director alleging sexual harassment and misconduct were being published by The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, Mr. Ratner sued Ms. Kohler for defamation. He said that her post was “entirely false, fabricated and fictional,” and that it had hurt his professional standing and caused “emotional distress.” Through a spokesman, the director declined to comment.

“He forced himself on me after I said no and no and no again,” she wrote in the Facebook post, which was reviewed by The New York Times.

“There were only two people there, Brett Ratner and Melanie,” Ms. Kaplan said. “No other witnesses. One is telling the truth, and one is not. So the question is, why is Melanie going to come out with it now, other than with the goal she has — to help other women, and to make sure Brett Ratner or anyone else is unable to do this again?”

Mr. Ratner’s suit may not only be the first; it might also be something of a test case for the whole concept of pushing back in court. To the extent the suit draws attention to accusations that might have gotten little publicity without corroboration, it may backfire on the director and set a precedent that others are reluctant to emulate.

Mr. Singer explained in an interview last week, before the suit was filed, how he policed the internet on behalf of Hollywood stars.

“I have hundreds of high-profile clients,” he said. He did not name any, but they include Arnold Schwarzenegger, John Travolta, Charlie Sheen and, for a time, Bill Cosby.

“People write bad things about them all the time on social media,” Mr. Singer said. “You have to figure out when to deal with it and when not to deal with it.”

Two-thirds or three-quarters of the time, he said, he asks someone to take something down and they don’t. “I reach out, they give me the finger” he said, and “say, ‘I’m not doing anything.’”

“They make it a bigger story,” he continued. “We write websites a letter, and then they post that letter,” as a sort of thumbing of the nose.

It’s impossible to tell how many cease-and-desist or so-called demand letters are being issued now, although noses are being thumbed as readily as ever.

Yashar Ali, a contributor to HuffPost who was pursuing a sexual misconduct story, got a warning from a lawyer. The lawyer said that his client was innocent of any allegations and that the letter “may not be printed or published without my prior written consent.” Mr. Ali gleefully posted the letter on Twitter, although he blacked out the names first.

When Mr. Singer was interviewed, little had been published about Mr. Ratner, who is probably best known for the “Rush Hour” buddy cop movies. But Twitter was bubbling with anonymous secondhand allegations of unsavory behavior.

Mr. Singer dismissed such posts as beneath his attention. “Anonymous postings, that’s a problem forever. People hide themselves all the time,” he said. “There’s a lot of nut cases out there.”

That’s the fear among actors who said they had done nothing wrong but had gotten on the wrong side of a few of their fans. One actor, who was criticized on Twitter by an anonymous account for being overfriendly with female fans, responded with a tweet about bringing in lawyers. He now regrets drawing any attention.

“‘I didn’t do it’ is the exact same answer an innocent person would give as well as a guilty person,” he wrote in an email. “Nobody has time for a judge or a jury, just an accuser and an executioner.” He asked to remain anonymous because, he said, it would end his career if he publicly spoke up.

Mr. Singer said he wasn’t sure the downfall of the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein had made a difference in the volume of assertions by victims.

“We were dealing with this back in the MySpace days” more than a decade ago, he said. But he added: “Do I think people may be more emboldened? Yes, they may.”

Other lawyers said that, at least for the moment, the landscape had changed significantly.

“There is less fear in making these assertions in various arenas, whether it’s through traditional media, social media or privately,” said Miles Feldman of the Los Angeles law firm Raines Feldman, which handles dozens of online defamation cases a year. “As a result, we’re seeing a serious uptick in inquiries and requests for action.”

But that is true of the victims as well, suggesting that all sorts of lawyers will be busy in the years to come.

Debra Katz, a Washington-based specialist in harassment and employment discrimination, acknowledged the appeal of taking complaints online.

“It’s a sweeter form of justice to out someone as a sexual harasser in a Facebook post than go through a lengthy, painful and expensive trial,” she said. Nevertheless, “there’s not a lawyer who specializes in sexual harassment cases whose phone is not ringing off the hook.”","As Sex Accusations Flood Social Media, Lawyers Gear Up for Suits",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/technology/sex-accusations-social-media-lawsuits.html

The luxury automaker BMW has issued two recalls involving about one million cars and sport utility vehicles that are at risk of catching fire even when they are not in use.

The first recall covers more than 672,000 cars. It includes several BMW 3 Series models from 2006-11 with wiring and electrical conductors in the climate control system that are vulnerable to overheating, BMW told the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration on Thursday.

The second, larger recall involves the 2008-11 128i and various other 2007-11 models with six-cylinder engines, such as the 328i and the 525i. In these vehicles, the heater designed to keep the positive crankcase ventilation from freezing has the potential to short-circuit, causing the parts inside its valve to melt. The crankcase ventilation system helps gases escape from an internal combustion engine.

More than 740,000 vehicles are included in this group.

The risk of fire is “extremely rare,” Hector Arellano-Belloc, a BMW spokesman, said in an email.

The company said it was asking car owners “in an abundance of caution” to keep their affected vehicles parked outdoors until they are repaired, he said. He said the company knew of three injuries that may be related to the climate control system wiring, but no injuries related to the P.C.V. heater.

The beginning of helping yourself recover is to never give a deposit in cash or write a check. Never. When a dress is ordered, a customer usually pays a deposit of 50 percent; always put it on a credit card so the payment can be disputed in case the store closes before delivering the goods.

Connie Gable, the vice president of customer relations for Maggie Sottero, a manufacturer of wedding dresses said, “You will never get your deposit back if you paid in cash. Nobody will give cash back.”

But credit card companies will usually return money on a credit card. And always save the deposit receipt. It is likely to come in handy and save you money as you begin your search for another dress.

Help on the Internet

When you choose and order your dress, make sure to note the name on the label.

Social media can then play a big role in quickly finding another dress. Join Facebook and other social media groups of women and stores that are created specifically to help. Go to those sites and search for your particular designer and dress.

For example: the Facebook group for Alfred Angelo Disney dresses has women searching for gowns as well as some who have dresses to sell; one woman is looking for a dress No. 2506 in size 6; another is selling her dress No. c254 in size 16.

One bride was able to find an Alfred Angelo flower girl dress from someone in Britain on Facebook. It was a perfect match to the one she had ordered in Florida. She bought the new one using a credit card and had it sent to her via FedEx.

Preownedweddingdresses.com and tradesy.com are both good sources to search by designer and size as well.

Contact Other Stores

Look for other stores that sold the brand you ordered and call them.

Go to the company site and use the store locator to find stores.

For Lazaro, Blush or Hayley Paige, go to jlmcouture.com.

For Morilee by Madeline Garnder: morilee.com.

For Randy Fenoli: randyfenolibridal.com.

For Maggie Sottero, Midgley-Sottero or Rebecca Ingram: maggiesottero.com.

For Allure, Allure Couture, Madison James or Wilderly Bride: allurebridals.com.

If they have pieces from their stock that can replace your dress, they will ship them. Sometimes a store will have the same dress but in ivory, for example, rather than the white you originally ordered; buy it in another color if it’s your dream dress. Remember: Larger sizes can be altered down so, ask not only about your size, but also the ones near yours.

Renee Jon, a dressmaker who alters wedding dresses and makes custom designs, works out of her home in Chino Hills, Calif. She helped during the recent Alfred Angelo closing. “If a bride had a receipt for a deposit from Angelo and found a dress in my inventory, I gave her an extra discount,” Ms. Jon said.

Many others will do the same.

Different Brand, Same Look

The manager of a store can give you the name of the wholesale sales representative the store works with for the dress you are looking for. Ask the wholesale rep to help locate the dress you want. The wholesaler may have recently shipped inventory to stores not on your radar.

Misty Cushing, a bride-to-be in Las Vegas, had ordered a dress last summer in Ohio (where her family lives) for her March 2018 wedding. She lost the dress in the Alfred Angelo closure but did get her deposit back. She then bought a similar dress by a different manufacturer (Morilee) at a store in Las Vegas.

“The entire bridal industry stepped up,” she said. “The original store credited my deposit back to my credit card; I had a photo of the dress with me to show the store in Las Vegas. They found a Morilee dress that almost matched my original choice. The bridal shops really try to make brides happy. It’s an art that’s been lost on our society.”

Morilee sold her the wedding dress at a 20 percent discount because she had her deposit receipt. And, Mitchel Udell, an owner of Morilee said even though there is usually a rush charge for a bride who needs her dress quickly, “we waived the rush charge for anyone caught in the closing.”

Jillian Forsberg is the sales manager at the Dress Gallery, a 6,000-square-foot store in Wichita, Kan., that dresses 1,500 brides a year. “We’ve had other designers go out of business but never anything on the scale of the Alfred Angelo closing,” she said. “We still had some Angelo dresses in our stock and we were able to sell the exact ones to about five girls who contacted us from all over the country.” They sold them at wholesale if a deposit receipt was shown.

Once the designer goes out of business, the samples already in stores are of no use, she explained, since these dresses have been tried on and are not new. The Dress Gallery shipped dresses all over the country to people who could use such samples, she said.

When Alfred Angelo went out of business, David’s Bridal, another national chain of dress stores, gave 30 percent discounts toward a new gown, also waiving the usual rush fee (with proof of deposit).

(Many middle-class families could also see tax savings under the plan.)

“There is a difference between directing institutions to make sure they’re using their resources toward their stated mission — missions of education, missions of access — versus directing institutions toward filling gaps in Washington, and this seems to be the latter,” Sean Decatur, president of Kenyon College, said Friday.

Supporters of the proposed tax said it was an acknowledgment that universities increasingly were being run like businesses, with tuition continuing to rise and administrative ranks growing, especially at the wealthiest institutions.

Representative Tom Reed, a New York Republican whose district includes Cornell University, supports the proposed tax, though his main wish is to force schools with large endowments to spend more of them on tuition assistance. Like other proponents of an endowment tax, he noted that private foundations, which also are nonprofits under the tax code, already pay a tax of 1 to 2 percent on their investment income.

“Rather than fight for special treatment, universities should join me in recognizing that young adults are facing a college debt crisis as a result of the uncontrolled escalating costs,” Mr. Reed said in an email. “We should work together to solve this runaway price issue once and for all.”

The tax would affect about 140 colleges and universities, according to a list compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education.

Universities have been fiercely protective of their endowments, and have ramped up lobbying efforts to keep control over them.

Some argued Friday that the tax plan would put a damper on gifts, because donors would not want to see the impact of their gifts diminished by the tax.

Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a trade group, said colleges and universities should be treated differently from foundations. “Private foundations give money away, that’s not the purpose of colleges and universities,” Mr. Hartle said. “If you wanted to treat them the same, you’d apply this to all colleges and universities regardless of the value of their endowments, not just a handful of private ones.”

At Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., which has an endowment of more than $200 million, the president, Elizabeth Kiss, said that most students were minorities and 40 percent had incomes low enough to qualify for federal Pell grants. Because of the endowment, she said, “We are able to give financial aid to basically pretty much all of our students.”

The tax, she said, would amount to a $350,000 cut to an overall budget of $52 million. “This is an institution that had a 1 percent pay raise this year, so it’s not like we’re fat cats,” Ms. Kiss said.

A spokesman for Yale University, Tom Conroy, said that the plan would impose a permanent tax on student aid, teaching, research and community services at Yale. He pointed out that the universities with the wealthiest endowments are also those that have the resources to offer need-blind admissions and the strongest support to poor and middle-income students.

“It is disappointing that the legislation relies so heavily on colleges and universities, and especially the universities with some of the strongest records on financial aid, to raise revenue to enable tax cuts,” Mr. Conroy said. “We hope that the House of Representatives will reconsider these proposals.”

Ivy League schools generally have the biggest endowments, and they have been growing fatter since 2008, in part through high-earning investments like commercial real estate, venture capital and hedge funds.

At Yale, for instance, the endowment, helped by an 11.3 percent return on investments after fees, grew to $27 billion in the 2017 fiscal year. Harvard’s endowment, helped by an 8.1 percent return, stood at $37 billion.

The size of some of the endowments suggests that they could weather a 1.4 percent tax on earnings. But some university officials said that they must spend carefully to withstand occasional market downturns, and that large portions of many endowments have spending restrictions placed by donors.

A 2015 study by the Congressional Research Service found that in the previous fiscal year, colleges spent an average of 4.4 percent of their endowments, and the average rate of investment return was 15.5 percent. Larger institutions, which were more invested in hedge funds and private equity, had higher returns.

Yale’s endowment was nearly $2 million per student that year. Princeton’s was more than $2.6 million, and Harvard’s was nearly $1.3 million, according to the study. Harvard alone held 7 percent of all endowment assets that year, the report said.

At Cornell, the endowment typically goes toward financial aid, or helping cover faculty salaries and research, the president, Martha E. Pollack, said on Friday. If the tax goes through, Cornell would have to make the money up somewhere else, she said.

“This is very very serious for us; we’re estimating at this point that it would cost us approximately $10.5 million a year,” Dr. Pollack said. “And, as far as I can tell, it doesn’t satisfy any real policy objectives. It’s just a transfer of money from universities to permit a tax cut elsewhere in the system.”",Swelling College Endowments Tempt Lawmakers Looking for Tax Dollars,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/college-endowments-tax.html

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily. I also enjoyed the moment of thought I had to give to the cleverly written 10D, when I realized that CLOCKS are not seen in casinos purposely, so that gamblers will lose track of time and bet more.

While there are the inevitable “Infinity” rooms on view in Chelsea, the shows give her paintings a new forcefulness; with their fluctuating rhythms and imaginative images, they could even win over fans who only have eyes for her Instagrammable environments.

On all fronts, Ms. Kusama has a formidable urge toward art and fame fueled by what seems to be a steely will and also a great mental focus — partly a function of psychological imbalances that have led to periods of hospitalization. (She began to experience visual and auditory hallucinations as a child and they continue.) She has characterized art as her chance for salvation both here and in the afterlife.

Today, young women are more likely to attend college than young men, while young men are more likely to live with their parents, and it’s not only student loan debt that’s driving them home. Economic shifts that have decreased employment in blue-collar jobs but increased opportunity in female-dominated sectors have had a psychic as well as financial impact. Care jobs are not jobs men are generally willing to take, in part because of the depressed pay, but also because of social constraints: Nursing, elder care and child care are women’s work.

A desire to reclaim this psychic masculinity is why Mr. Trump fetishizes a specific (and specifically white) kind of rough-hewed American maleness while embodying an envy-inducing lack of obligation. The white working men of Trump speeches have the kind of dirty-fingernail jobs so revered in the American imagination: coal miners, firefighters, autoworkers. In real life, more Trump voters work in cubicles than in coal mines. But the point was never Mr. Trump’s understanding of reality. It was his grasp of white male aspiration and identity.

Mr. Trump’s own life and actions paint an appealing picture of masculine entitlement for those who want power without the shackles of responsibility. He may not be the smartest or most qualified guy in just about any room, but his money allowed him to marry and reproduce with a succession of models, star in a reality television show, live in vulgar gold-plated glory, say whatever offensive thing danced through his brain and still make a successful run for president. It was a plus that in the three Trump marriages, there have been no “power couple” partnerships of equals, just Mr. Trump on “The Howard Stern Show” talking about his wife’s breasts and bragging that he never changed a diaper.

Most American men are unable to actually achieve this level of authority minus accountability; as a result, admiration for men like Mr. Trump gets paired with an “if I can’t have it, no one can” nihilism. White male power remains a dominant force in America, but it is no longer the only force that matters. For many men, this is not a leveling of the playing field, but a plundering of what was rightly theirs.

Resentful of the changing order of things, some men have simply leaned in to chaos: If the system no longer serves them, it will at least be fun to blow it all up. Which is exactly why the old rules of political engagement don’t work with Mr. Trump or his base.

The president is a perfect figurehead for this bizarre moment: a man who carries all of the negative characteristics of stereotypical masculinity while adopting almost none of the virtues, occupying the most powerful and exclusively male seat of power in the nation (and perhaps in the world), who ascended in large part because a yawning fear of female power kept one of the best-qualified candidates in history out of office. He is ego unchecked, narcissism in place of dignity.

In a 1961 essay for Vogue, Joan Didion wrote that people with “self-respect have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things.” The piece went on to say, “In brief, people with self-respect exhibit a certain toughness, a kind of moral nerve; they display what was once called character.” Character, she wrote, is “the willingness to accept responsibility for one’s own life.”

Our current president, who can’t even accept responsibility for his own social media use or admit that all-caps tweeting might suggest he’s angry about continuing criminal investigations and low poll numbers, may indeed be a new low. Mr. Trump has ushered in a fresh era of noxious manhood wherein bullying is conflated with toughness and self-interest is more important than self-respect. But all is not lost. Every generation believes it is uniquely observing diminishing standards of behavior, even while by most measures, life improves. Plenty of American men are doing exactly the opposite of Mr. Trump and embracing the more productive characteristics of masculinity while rejecting the malicious ones. And the virtues of self-respect — toughness, moral nerve, character — have never been, unlike the presidency, male-only business.",What Donald Trump Thinks It Takes to Be a Man,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-masculinity.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

That’s when Stage 2 is set to go down, per Irving’s instructions to Angela over breakfast ribs. With Elliot’s shipping counter-maneuvers and new tendency to randomly “show up” threatening the plan, Irving has either handed the keys to Wellick or set him up to take the fall. (Perhaps both.) We talked last week about Irving’s manipulative skill and here he reeled in Wellick like a rageful Swedish fish, using the man’s destiny-and-gods rhetoric against him. “This is the moment you were born for,” he says.

I want my family sent to Ukraine, Wellick says. Tell my wife about the plan.

“Of course,” Irving replies softly, Bobby Cannavale managing to convey both pity and pragmatism in one pregnant pause. (Remember Agent Santiago is one of the few people who knows Joanna is dead, which means that Irving does, too.)

Speaking of tragic families, the episode’s other major thread involved the beginning of a possible reconciliation between Darlene and Elliot, as we returned — after last week’s detour into the life and times of Tyrell Wellick, lumberjack fugitive — to the tense reunion at the FBI safe house.

Darlene blamed her hacking of Elliot’s computer on the fact that Mr. Robot was not to be trusted, a cagey diversion that also happens to be true. Soon they were walking Flipper and planning a sibling project, which in the Alderson clan means one of you staking out the other in case his sinister alter ego sneaks off to smash the world’s economy. (“It’s weird but I guess we passed weird a long time ago,” Darlene notes.) The gambit reveals that Angela is in league with Mr. Robot.

A theme this season has been the slow but steady revelation of how badly Darlene, too, has been scarred by the disintegration of her family. Her trauma lacks the Gothic edge of Elliot’s certainly, but it was devastating enough to drive her to murder.

The episode opened with her confessing her sins to a subway pickpocket, requesting the return of only a Polaroid of the Aldersons in happier times. “Metadata is story behind the data,” Elliot tells us later. When people post pictures to on social media, they don’t realize they’ve handed over a wealth of private information “all hidden inside the photograph’s metadata,” he said.

So what story is hidden within Darlene’s analog photo, or at least in its surpassing meaningfulness to her? That the only thing that Darlene cares about is her memory of a time when her family was intact, at least, and perhaps even happy. A time before her father’s death or Elliot’s mental break, before cellphone photos or cataclysmic hacks.

Perhaps it’s that while she’s tellingDom that her cooperation with the F.B.I. means that “I’m gonna lose my brother,” when the time comes to effectively sever that tie, she won’t be able to go through with it.

A Few Thoughts While We Turn In Our I.D. Badge

• Angela confirmed that she got Elliot the E Corp job because “it was the best way to manage him.” We all saw how that worked out, so now she’s having him banned from the building. I know this random employee doesn’t matter to you, she told Pryce, but while Angela may believe think that, it’s not really true, is it? Pryce told Whiterose he knows who was behind the 5/9 hack back in Season 1.

• By the way how is Elliot not collapsing, working with Wellick every night and at E Corp during the day? Or Angela either, for that matter? Probably best not to ponder this aspect too deeply.

• So what’s in Angela’s hypodermic, anyway? One shot and Dr. Jekyll reverts to Hyde.

• What was your read on the fsociety wannabe taken in by the F.B.I.? A Dark Army patsy offered up to distract law enforcement from Stage 2?

In some studies, processed red meat in large amounts is associated with an increased relative risk of developing cancer. The absolute risk, however, is often quite small. If I ate an extra serving of bacon a day, every day, my lifetime risk of colon cancer would go up less than one-half of 1 percent. Even then, it’s debatable.

Nevertheless, we’ve become more and more susceptible to arguments that we must avoid certain foods completely. When one panic-du-jour wanes, we find another focus for our fears. We demonized fats. Then cholesterol. Then meat.

For some people in recent years, gluten has become the enemy, even though wheat accounts for about 20 percent of the calories consumed worldwide, more than pretty much any other food. Fewer than 1 percent of people in the United States have a wheat allergy, and fewer than 1 percent have celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that requires sufferers to abstain from gluten. Gluten sensitivity (the catchall disorder that leads many Americans to abstain from gluten) is not well defined, and most people who self-diagnose don’t meet the criteria.

Nonetheless, at least one in five Americans regularly chooses gluten-free foods, according to a 2015 poll. Sales of products with gluten-free labels rose to $23 billion worldwide in 2014, up from $11.5 billion worldwide in 2010.

Gluten-free diets can lead to deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin B, folate and iron. Compared with regular bagels, gluten-free ones can have a quarter more calories, two and a half times the fat, half the fiber and twice the sugar. They also cost more.

The hullabaloo over gluten echoes the panic over MSG that began roughly half a century ago, and which has yet to fully subside. MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is nothing more than a single sodium atom added to glutamic acid — an amino acid that is a key part of the mechanism by which our cells create energy. Without it, all oxygen-dependent life as we know it would die.

A 1968 letter in The New England Journal of Medicine started the frenzy; the writer reported feeling numbness, weakness and palpitations after eating at a Chinese restaurant. A few limited studies followed, along with a spate of news articles. Before long, nutrition experts and consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader were calling for MSG to be banned. The Food and Drug Administration never had to step in; food companies saw the writing on the wall, and dropped MSG voluntarily.

Many people still wrongly believe that MSG is poison. We certainly don’t need MSG in our diet, but we also don’t need to waste effort avoiding it. Our aversion to it shows how susceptible we are to misinterpreting scientific research and how slow we are to update our thinking when better research becomes available. There’s no evidence that people suffer disproportionately from the afflictions — now ranging from headaches to asthma — that MSG-averse cultures commonly associate with this ingredient. In studies all over the world, the case against MSG just doesn’t hold up.

Too often, we fail to think critically about scientific evidence. Genetically modified organisms are perhaps the best example of this.

G.M.O.s are, in theory, one of our best bets for feeding the planet’s growing population. When a 2015 Pew poll asked Americans whether they thought it was generally safe or unsafe to eat modified foods, almost 60 percent said it was unsafe. The same poll asked scientists from the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same question. Only 11 percent of them thought G.M.O.s were unsafe.

Most Americans, at least according to this poll, don’t seem to care what scientists think. In fact, Americans disagree with scientists on this issue more than just about any other, including a host of contentious topics such as vaccines, evolution and even global warming.

If people want to avoid foods, even if there’s no reason to, is that really a problem?

The answer is: yes. Because it makes food scary. And being afraid of food with no real reason is unscientific — part of the dangerous trend of anti-intellectualism that we confront in many places today.

Food should be a cause for pleasure, not panic. For most people, it’s entirely possible to eat more healthfully without living in terror or struggling to avoid certain foods altogether.

In the end, her only opponent was Tim Ryan, a young congressman and former high school quarterback star from Ohio’s 13th District, the ailing industrial region surrounding Youngstown and Akron. Ryan offered a splash-of-cold-water speech just before the vote: “We got wiped out,” he said, according to a recording of his remarks. “We’re toxic in the Midwest, and we’re toxic in the South.”

Pelosi won easily, but fully a third of the Democratic caucus voted against their leader, and Ryan’s insurrection seemed to have left a mark: After the election, three well-liked and nonrebellious members — Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Hakeem Jeffries of New York and David Cicilline of Rhode Island — were chosen by the caucus to help manage the rebranding of the party. The three of them spent the first half of 2017 dutifully interviewing nearly every member of the caucus and conducting more than a dozen listening sessions with authors, pollsters and former Obama cabinet secretaries. They hosted a dinner at which the party’s various factions — the Progressive Caucus, the Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the conservative Blue Dogs and the New Democrats, among others — mingled as if meeting for the first time.

In late July, Pelosi, Bustos, Jeffries and Cicilline stood on a stage with six other Democrats under a wiltingly hot summer sky in the city park of Berryville, Va. — a town of 4,306 residents in a purple district within easy driving distance of Washington — and unveiled their new agenda, titled “A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.” The phrase, which had been poll-tested by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an intentional echo of F.D.R.’s New Deal — and, less intentionally, of a Papa John’s pizza slogan. But its biggest debt was to the author of “The Art of the Deal,” and to his crimson-jowled populism.

“A Better Deal” called for retraining in America’s fading manufacturing sector, renegotiating trade deals, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and fighting the corporate consolidation that had affected the prices of everything from eyeglasses to beer. None of the 10 speakers invoked President Barack Obama. In fact, one of the key provisions in “A Better Deal” — renegotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients — was an implicit rebuke of the former president, who had agreed with the pharmaceutical industry to freeze Medicare drug prices in exchange for its support of the Affordable Care Act.

But even before the rollout, Pelosi diminished the substance of “A Better Deal” in an interview with The Washington Post, clarifying that it was not “a course correction, but it’s a presentation correction.” A Quinnipiac poll in August found that only 33 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of independents had a favorable opinion of the new Democratic agenda. The self-consciousness of the rebranding, one congressman mused to me at the time, “seems like what you would do in a different era.”

There was a stiff-jointedness to the whole spectacle, a sense of the Democrats’ trying to regain the use of muscles they had let atrophy over the previous eight years. Obama, after all, used to make this sort of thing look easy. Conflating the American story with his own — “This is who we are” — the president conveyed, even in policy irresolution, an unshakable sense of his and America’s place in the world. “I love the guy, I miss him,” Scott Peters said of Obama. “But organizationally, the party is in disarray. We’re at the lowest level of elected officeholders since Hoover. We got a bit lazy and found ourselves relying on Barack Obama’s charisma, and it left us in bad shape.”

Barring seismic developments, the G.O.P. is still likely to control both the White House and the Senate until at least January 2021. But nine months into Trump’s presidency, the chances of the Democrats’ retaking the House are much better. Multiple polls in recent months have shown generic Democratic candidates beating generic Republicans by as many as 15 points — a spread that, in past elections, correlated with winning more than enough seats for the Democrats to gain a House majority next year. And if they do, the consequences will be enormous. A Democrat-controlled House in 2019 would very likely derail the Republican legislative agenda. It could also conceivably set the stage for impeachment proceedings against the president — a move that many Democrats have openly proposed for months now.

But the Democrats’ path back from the wilderness is not a short one. No president since Ronald Reagan has won the presidency as convincingly, twice over, as Obama did — but those victories papered over an extraordinary decline in his party that became suddenly unignorable on Nov. 9, 2016. The Democratic National Committee today is an understaffed, demoralized bureaucracy. It has raised less than half of what its Republican counterpart has taken in so far this year. (Other party organizations — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — are faring better.)

Democratic presidents have generally been less than attentive to the financial and electoral health of their party, during and after their presidencies. The Northwestern political-science professor Daniel J. Galvin writes in his 2010 book, “Presidential Party Building,” that since John F. Kennedy, each of them “neglected, exploited or undercut his party’s organizational capacities.” Galvin found that this maltreatment was because such presidents had operated with “deep and durable majorities” in Congress. After the Democrats lost theirs in 1994, President Bill Clinton awakened to the virtues of party-building. Galvin predicted that Obama would most likely have sufficient reason to do the same.

Instead, Obama was every bit as indifferent as his predecessors. After he took office, his campaign’s formidable grass-roots organization, rechristened Organizing for America, became what some party leaders complained was a “shadow organization” that drained resources from the D.N.C. while championing the president rather than the Democratic Party as a whole. The president did not have anywhere near the kind of close relationship with the last D.N.C. chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, that George W. Bush had with the Republican National Committee chairmen Ed Gillespie and Ken Mehlman.

In 2012, Obama’s campaign chose not to contribute any money to the D.S.C.C. during that cycle — and then, emerging from its victory that year with a $20 million debt, the campaign promptly offloaded it onto the D.N.C. In early 2014, Obama assured Senate Democrats that keeping the Senate majority was his “No. 1 priority.” Months passed without any further action. Finally, two months before the midterms, Obama informed Harry Reid by phone that he was authorizing a $5 million transfer of D.N.C. funds to Senate election efforts. Reid tersely replied, “It shouldn’t have been this hard.”

Few of the Obama campaigns’ innovations have meaningfully outlasted his presidency. Their once-pioneering digital-organizing operation, for example, went largely to ground in 2016, while the party failed to fully grasp even the basics, like the usefulness of digital advertising. “What I can tell you,” says Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who oversaw an analysis of the party’s shortcomings in the last election cycle, “is that our candidates and their staff told us that the Republicans did much better digitally than we did. And they spent more than us on digital.” (Teddy Goff, Obama’s former digital director, says: “I sincerely wish the technology built in the two Obama campaigns had been put to better use for 2016 and races down the ballot.”)

State Democratic Party leaders complain about O.F.A. — rebranded again recently as Organizing for Action — hoarding campaign resources to little end. And Priorities USA, the extravagantly funded super PAC that was started to support Obama’s 2012 campaign, never built the kind of entrenched ground-level presence maintained by its analogues on the right. In contrast, Americans for Prosperity, the conservative network financed by David and Charles Koch, spent the Obama years establishing a network of more than three million activists in 36 states and mobilizing them to protest against Obamacare, environmental regulations and tax increases — becoming what the group’s president, Tim Phillips, described to me as “a state-based long-game organization that would always be there.” The current chairman of Priorities USA, Guy Cecil, acknowledges the disparity: “Most of our activities, most of our structures, are built around individual fights, or individual candidates, or individual organizations, and I think that’s put us at a disadvantage.”

Organizational and technological lapses do not fully account for the Democratic Party’s travails. “All that stuff is like the field-goal team,” the Obama strategist David Axelrod told me. “None of it will help you if you haven’t already moved 80 yards down the field. Being technologically proficient wouldn’t have saved Obama if he didn’t also have a consistent, compelling message.”

But that message had grown threadbare by 2016. No longer was it sufficient to campaign on hope and change, or even on the president’s successful efforts in 2009 to stave off a deep recession. The uneven economic recovery raised questions about the party’s obliviousness to the impunity of Wall Street and the gap between the megawealthy and everyone else. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman who was an author of “A Better Deal,” admits, “We developed a blind spot for the economic challenges that still remained unmet.”

By the end of Obama’s presidency, the Democratic Party had lost nearly a thousand seats in state legislatures across America. It had forfeited its majority in both the House and the Senate. A mere 16 of the nation’s 50 governors were Democrats — and that number dwindled to 15 in August, when Jim Justice of West Virginia announced with a grinning Donald Trump at his side that he, too, had decided to become a Republican.

A few days after the election, Ian Russell quit his job as the deputy executive director of the D.C.C.C. and cashed in his frequent-flier miles on a trip to Ireland. He watched Trump’s swearing-in on his phone in a Dublin pub over a pint of Guinness, and then a few more. The following morning, he threw his bags in a rental car and began a sort of weeklong post-traumatic odyssey, rambling westward to the coast.

Russell, now 33, had spent the past six years at the D.C.C.C. trying to help the Democrats regain the House majority that they lost to the Republicans in the 2010 midterm election. During every election cycle, political journalists and donors would file into one of the drab conference rooms inside the D.N.C. headquarters near the Capitol and watch as D.C.C.C. officials like Russell unveiled maps and polling data in support of the claim that this election cycle — unlike the last one — was going to break for the Democrats. Each time, Russell maybe half-believed it.

But election night left him reeling. It wasn’t just that Trump had upset Clinton — including in Russell’s home state, Michigan — or that the Democrats emerged 24 seats short of a House majority. What gnawed at him was a fear that Trump might actually win over Democratic voters more lastingly. Benton Harbor, a few miles down the road from Russell’s hometown in the western part of the state, lost its last Whirlpool manufacturing facility years ago. The childhood friends of his who remained in the area had renounced the Democrats and were now Trump voters. “Trump could transform American politics,” he remembers thinking at the time. “He could truly scramble things.”

But Russell’s fears of a unifying, postpartisan pragmatist in chief swiftly proved unjustified. Rather than focusing on jobs and infrastructure projects, Trump immediately set in motion an attempt to repeal Obamacare and ordered a travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, which was met with demonstrations at airports across the country. On Jan. 30, the nonpartisan Hill analyst Stuart Rothenberg published a column headlined “Trump’s Fast Start Likely Puts the House in Play in 2018.” Rothenberg reasoned that overly aggressive new presidents tended to be judged harshly by the electorate in the middle of their first term. “The House map favors Republicans, but the midterm dynamic could well prove more powerful,” he wrote, listing 20 Republican seats — out of 24 the Democrats would need to flip the House — that, if typical midterm election patterns held, would most likely be imperiled. “Nothing is yet guaranteed, but don’t be surprised if the House is up for grabs in the fall of 2018.”

Late on his last evening in Ireland, Russell was drinking a final Guinness and listening to a passable folk band at the Palace Bar in Dublin while halfheartedly scrolling through the news back home on his phone when he came across Rothenberg’s column. He read through to the end with an accelerating heartbeat. It seemed big news to him that Rothenberg, a dispassionate prognosticator, had confidently issued such a prediction just 10 days into Trump’s presidency.

Back in Washington, Russell joined a relatively new political media consulting firm, Beacon Media, and started hunting for prospective 2018 House candidates. In early March, he traveled to California’s Orange County — historically a G.O.P. stronghold, though its wealthy population included growing numbers of Asian-Americans who tended to vote Democratic. In Irvine he met with Dave Min, a wry 41-year-old law professor who had worked on the Hill as a senior policy adviser to Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, and at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.

Min, the father of three young children, had never considered running for political office before. But he was also a son of Korean immigrants and was appalled by the Trump administration’s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the United States. The incumbent congresswoman of California’s 45th District, Mimi Walters, was a little-known two-term Republican who had never faced serious opposition. She had won by nearly 18 points in 2016, but Clinton beat Trump in the district by more than five points. A strong anti-Trump sentiment in 2018 could work to Min’s benefit. In April, he told Russell that he was in.

Russell then traveled to the Illinois suburbs just west of Chicago. Like California’s 45th District, the Sixth District of Illinois had been reliably Republican for decades. But Clinton beat Trump there by seven points, and already its six-term congressman, Peter Roskam, was avoiding public appearances lest he be called upon to answer for the president. The progressive women’s group Emily’s List had referred Russell to Kelly Mazeski, a longtime public servant on local boards and commissions who had already decided to challenge Roskam. Mazeski was a breast-cancer survivor whose platform, she told me recently, was “health care, health care, health care.” Russell helped Mazeski time her announcement for May 4, the day Roskam and his fellow House Republicans voted for a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Scores of candidates were announcing their intentions in terrain recently considered inhospitable to Democrats: West Virginia, Texas, Kansas. Some aspirants Russell met lacked the talent to match their enthusiasm. Others were hot property and elected to go with one of Beacon Media’s competitors. But by Labor Day, Russell and his firm had picked up 10 Democratic challengers. Among them were a few beguiling dark horses, like a 46-year-old physician and former Y.M.C.A. national health officer from Portage, Mich., named Matt Longjohn. Undeterred by his lack of political experience, Longjohn was challenging Fred Upton, a Republican who had represented Michigan’s Sixth District for three decades.

Russell himself grew up in the Sixth District and cast his first ballot as a registered voter against Upton in 2002. Back then, the incumbent seemed invincible. But now, after leading the committee that wrote the legislation seeking to eviscerate Obamacare, Upton was avoiding town halls and any other public events.

Still, when I met Russell recently, his optimism was tempered by previous electoral disappointments. The Democratic Party now has more candidates than it can support, and next spring is likely to be a season of what national Democratic officials tactfully refer to as “messy primaries.” And even with Trump as a foil, Russell’s candidates were struggling to make a case for themselves. “Right now it’s such a target-rich environment for us,” he told me. But “we’re having trouble explaining why we’re the heroes and the Republicans are the villains. At some point, our narrative will have to become more coherent than it is now.”

In pursuit of the 24 seats Democrats need to win the House, the D.C.C.C. intends to target 80 Republican-held districts — a dozen more than the party went after in its 2006 bonanza year, when it captured a majority after gaining 31 seats. Many of next year’s seem to be fanciful propositions, or strategic plays designed to force the G.O.P. to spend resources where it would rather not. In other cases, the D.C.C.C. is counting districts held by controversial Republicans — Chris Collins of New York, with his aggressive advocacy of a biotech firm in which he held substantial investments; Duncan D. Hunter of California, with the possibility of a federal indictment for supposed campaign fund malfeasances hanging over his head — who nonetheless appear safe, at least for the moment. But four Republican representatives in potential swing districts — Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dave Reichert, Charlie Dent and Pat Tiberi — have already announced their retirement in advance of 2018, and more are expected to follow before the end of the year.

Only two times in the last century (during the Great Depression and after the Sept. 11 attacks) has a president’s party not suffered electoral losses midway into his first term. Those losses — an average of 32 House seats in each such midterm since 1862 — increase to 36 when the president’s approval rating is under 50. President Trump’s polling average has never once exceeded a favorability rating of 48 percent, and it now hovers at about 37 percent.

“I think the best thing the Democrats can do,” Zac Petkanas, formerly the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign, told me, “is find as many people with a pulse, with a D next to their names, in as many districts as possible, and run on Obamacare and standing up to Trump.” But so much of the politics, and political mood, of Trump’s presidency is off the map of previous experience that other Democrats have seemed at times at a loss for how to respond. What to make of the late August NBC poll, for instance, that showed Democrats being viewed unfavorably by 54 percent of those surveyed, which was better than Republicans (61) and Trump (61), but also Pelosi (64)? Was that good news or bad news? And what about the D.C.C.C. focus groups and polls yielding the conclusion that voters broadly dislike Trump but are also put off by candidates who profess to be “standing up to Trump,” on the grounds that such resistance will only guarantee more dysfunction in Washington?

Republicans are hopeful that, Trump being the exception to almost every political rule, the historical trends of wave elections will also not apply to him. “Clinton came up against a wave in 1994 because he had campaigned as a centrist but then led with gays in the military and Hillarycare,” Karl Rove, the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, told me. “The 2006 election was a wave because Republicans were defending the Iraq war and crippled by a late-breaking ethics scandal. Democrats faced a wave in 2010 because of Obamacare. So it’s been issues that have driven wave elections. This time around, I think it’s more a personal antagonism to Trump. And the question is, how critical will that be in shaping the attitudes of swing voters?”

But by Rove’s own analysis, two of the last three wave elections were triggered by health care policies that did not approach the deep unpopularity of the G.O.P.’s attempts this year to repeal or otherwise roll back Obamacare. And Trump’s base cannot be counted on to prevent a wave in 2018, because a key constituency — less-educated white voters — is a group that tends not to show up during midterms. They may have even less motivation to do so next year, considering Trump’s periodic denunciations of the Republican lawmakers who will need their votes.

But in four special elections to fill seats vacated by House Republican incumbents this year, the Democrats fell short — and in the case of Georgia’s Jon Ossoff, lost by four points even after raising an unheard-of $23 million. His was the most expensive House race ever, and the fact that Democratic donors spent so heavily on a loss may help explain why the party’s fund-raising has diminished since then. The Democrats’ base — young and nonwhite voters — is no better than Trump’s at showing up for midterm elections and is unhelpfully clustered in urban districts. Many suburban and rural districts were artfully gerrymandered by Republican state legislators after the 2010 census and have proved impenetrable since then; they aren’t likely to change hands without a healthy number of recent Republican voters being persuaded to vote Democratic.

There is also a less quantifiable problem, the one that vexed Pelosi’s team in the months after the election: the Democratic Party’s chronic difficulty explaining just what it stands for. “There’s a deep worldview among conservative intellectuals that moved its way through a fear of fascism in the 1940s, through think tanks and campaigns and the California tax revolt of the 1970s,” Felicia Wong, president of the progressive Roosevelt Institute, says. “And basically the Democrats don’t have that. The New Deal was one thing, and the Great Society was another thing. The party never fully recognized that Jim Crow and segregation were economic decisions. That left Democrats with an incoherent economic argument. The result is that they lack a historical vocabulary.”

Questions about the interplay of race and economics, of course, aren’t just historical after the 2016 election — as much as politicians and operatives might want them to be. Plenty of progressives hold the view, as the MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid has argued on Twitter, that white working-class voters “resent the changes that racial and religious multiculturalism have brought to societies where people like them have been the majority.” But a former colleague of Reid’s at MSNBC, Krystal Ball, now president of the People’s House Project — which seeks to elect Democratic congressional candidates in G.O.P. districts — insists that the primary motivation of these voters is economic. “People who are holding onto their livelihoods by their fingernails thought that at least Trump gave a crap,” she says. “Maybe it was a pack of lies he was selling them, but at least he didn’t hold them in contempt. And frankly there’s a lot of contempt from certain corners of our party. And a billion dollars’ worth of ads saying we’re not elitists won’t change that.”

Early on the morning of July 27, a group of House Democrats held a private gathering in the Capitol basement with a special guest: Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and former Obama chief of staff, who over a decade ago, when he was an Illinois congressman, served as chairman of the D.C.C.C. Looking ahead to 2018, Emanuel offered a broad-brushstroke plan of attack: “Find the specific issues that resonate in your district,” he said, according to one meeting participant’s notes. “We want to appeal to Trump voters who are already pulling away from him.” In particular, “Suburbs are our best opportunities.” On the matter of ideological purity, he was blunt: “It’s not a question of left versus center — it’s forward versus backward.”

If this advice sounded familiar, it was because Emanuel advocated the same strategy a dozen years earlier, when he was trying to lift his party out of the trough it had occupied since the Newt Gingrich-led takeover of the House by the Republicans in 1994. Emanuel focused on recruiting more centrist candidates who were well liked in their districts rather than on ideological darlings of the national party. “The people who criticized me back in 2006 were from my own party,” he told me recently. “When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at: ‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

The election cemented Emanuel’s legend as a tactician — none of the Democrats attending the July 27 meeting expressed skepticism about his advice — but his strategy has never sat well with the party’s progressive activists. “I would just point to the fact that Rahm Emanuel’s Democrats who won in 2006 couldn’t hold those seats,” Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (P.C.C.C.), which supports, trains and funds candidates, told me.

She was referring to the nearly a dozen Democrats who rode the 2006 wave into Congress, only to wash back out of it with the Tea Party wave four years later. (Three more had lost in 2008.) “I would suggest a counterfactual,” she went on: “If we had true economic populist champions who made the case to the American people about fighting for a strong economic agenda, we might have had more lasting success.” Or as the P.C.C.C.’s other founder, Adam Green, put it to me: “If there’s a Democratic wave in 2018, progressives won’t just ride that wave — we will cause that wave.”

Of course, activists like Green and Taylor also vowed to be the tip of the party’s spear in the previous cycle, with not much to show for it. Indeed, the Breitbart chairman and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon scornfully likens the Democrats’ ideological tussles to a “pillow fight,” further charging that progressives will never accomplish their goals “until they have a Breitbart on the left,” he told me. “Our stock in trade is going after the Republican establishment. There’s no one like that on the other side.”

Most if not all Democrats are more than happy to watch Bannon’s kamikaze antics wreak havoc on the opposition. Still, some in the party rue the lack of pugnacity on their own side. “There are two types of Democrats,” David Krone, Harry Reid’s former chief of staff, told me one afternoon this summer in the Midtown Manhattan office where he now works as a consultant for an investment firm. “There are killers, and there are whiners. Unfortunately, we have too many of the latter and not enough of the former.”

Krone considers piety an obstacle to progressive policies. “Democrats are not that pure,” he told me, with a biting smile. “All those guys have a transactional component to them.” Under Reid’s leadership, the Democrats managed to pass important legislation like the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act while also thwarting a stream of conservative bills generated by the Republican-controlled House. But it was also Reid who held his colleagues to the deal that garnered the pharmaceutical industry’s support for Obamacare by agreeing to take Medicare drug prices off the table. When the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for outside-group contributions, Reid did not join the chorus of bemoaners. Instead, he ordered up a super PAC, called the Senate Majority PAC, to help keep the Senate in Democratic hands during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. “Reid just never pretended to be something he wasn’t,” Krone said. “You don’t want to pass health care? Fine. Don’t make deals. Keep losing.”

In the Democratic Killers Hall of Fame, Krone places Emanuel and Pelosi. But lately, Krone observed, the party seemed to be tilting toward the whiners — beginning with the excuses offered for Hillary Clinton’s defeat. “It’s insane,” he said. “They freaking lost! They can blame anyone they want to, but they fail to look in the mirror.”

The 2018 cycle, Krone argued, was no time for squeamishness. Again he cited the example of his former boss Reid, who, like many Democrats in 2010, was a heavy underdog going into his final Senate race. Rather than be cowed by a Republican field that, at the peak of the Tea Party movement, had been infiltrated by the party’s fringe, Reid turned that to his advantage. His campaign waded into the Republican primary, targeting the most formidable G.O.P. opponents one by one until the only one left standing was Sharron Angle: a Tea Party favorite who once crusaded against water fluoridation and claimed multiple American cities were under the rule of Shariah law. Reid beat her easily.

By way of contrast, Krone pointed to Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin senator who, with John McCain, was a standard-bearer for campaign-finance reform, as well as a crusader for civil liberties during the Bush years. Feingold lacked Reid’s appetite for the jugular, losing to Ron Johnson in 2010 and then again in 2016. “He had his foot on Johnson’s neck, and then he let up, because he was up in the polls,” Krone lamented. “They don’t hand out participation trophies in politics.” If the party limited itself to high-minded campaigning and legislating, “We’ll lose again, and Kennedy” — the Supreme Court justice — “will retire, and Trump will get to appoint another conservative crazy, and the Democrats will wonder how things got to be so horrible.”

Still, the party faces a conundrum in its pursuit of Trump voters whose anxieties aren’t just economic but cultural as well. Prevailing in some red districts may require, at minimum, tempering the party’s progressivism on social issues. “When anybody talks about a so-called litmus test for candidates, that upsets me,” Representative Cheri Bustos told me. “I’m from Illinois, where I’m the only downstate Democrat in our entire delegation. I’ve been a Democrat my whole life, and my core values are very much in line with what hard-core Democrats believe. I don’t ever lie about my views. However, I also don’t talk about issues that are by their very nature divisive. If asked, I’ll answer I’m pro-choice. But then I’ll get back to the economy.”

But a week after Bustos and I spoke, the D.C.C.C.’s chairman, Ben Ray Luján, enraged liberal groups by saying that his organization would not oppose House candidates in favor of restricting abortion. Seeking to douse the fire, Meredith Kelly, the D.C.C.C. communications director, released a statement clarifying that the D.C.C.C. listed abortion rights as among the “fundamental tenets of the Democratic Party” and that the recruits it was backing “represent the values of the party.”

Adam Green of the P.C.C.C. was adamant on the prospect of anti-abortion recruits: “We wouldn’t welcome candidates who are pushing anti-choice policies into the big tent any more than we would welcome racists and people who want to deregulate Wall Street.” Green wasn’t buying the implication by Bustos and other moderates that the Democratic Party will regain a majority only if it backs away from progressive ideals. He urged me to talk to Rick Nolan, a progressive rural Minnesota congressman who, he said, “wins the right way.”

Nolan is a folksy 73-year-old journeyman politician and businessman who has long advocated a single-payer health system. He also hunts, fishes, makes his own maple syrup and in other ways stays attuned to the culture of Minnesota’s Eighth District. Taking Green’s advice, I asked Nolan whether he would welcome an anti-abortion candidate into the Democratic caucus. “Wholeheartedly,” he said. “If there’s a fault today among Democrats, it’s that they’ve got the worst litmus test known to humankind. If we want to achieve the goals progressives want, we’ve got to get back into the majority. Democrats are damned fools if they don’t see that.”

There was one thing on which the Democrats I interviewed, across the spectrum — Adam Green, David Krone, Krystal Ball, Meredith Kelly — agreed: that I should watch a YouTube ad that was posted in June on behalf of a 52-year-old Wisconsin ironworker named Randy Bryce. Bryce, whose prodigious mustache has earned him the nickname Ironstache, is aiming to unseat the current officeholder of Wisconsin’s First District, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House. The emotionally charged ad announcing his campaign culminates in a challenge: “Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C.”

One rainy late summer afternoon, I met up with the ad’s creator, a 42-year-old Army veteran named Bill Hyers, in a Washington hotel bar overcrowded with well-dressed young professionals. Hyers was sipping an old-fashioned when I arrived. He was dressed in a T-shirt and khaki shorts, his preferred business attire. Hyers has successfully managed the campaigns of well-established Democratic politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and his own politics are straightforwardly liberal. At the same time, he harbors a Holden Caulfield-esque disdain of insincerity and believes that this quality, more than whining or ideological perfectionism, explains his party’s state of decline.

“What’s terrible about Democrats like Rahm Emanuel,” Hyers said, “is that it matters more to them if you’re a candidate who can raise money from very wealthy people than if you have an argument to make. They look at everything through the old Clinton triangulation strategy. Put out very carefully prepared statements. Don’t let anyone get to your right. Deny and ignore. Never have an honest dialogue. It was a bad strategy back in the ’90s. But it’s even worse today, because we can now have 24-7 access to candidates, and people can see when they’re not being authentic. Everything Hillary Clinton did was carefully scripted — they could see that.”

Hyers’s client Bryce has been the undisputed breakout star of the 2018 cycle so far; the announcement ad has attracted millions of views. (Such enthusiasm, it should be said, does not yet make Bryce any less of a long shot: The D.C.C.C. does not currently include Wisconsin’s First District among its 80 targeted seats.) The afternoon we met, Hyers showed me a rough cut of an ad for his newest client, a former Army champion boxer and ex-opioid addict from Staten Island named Boyd Melson — known in the ring as the Rainmaker — who is running for New York’s 11th District. Melson’s YouTube rollout, like Bryce’s, is replete with stirring proletarian imagery: neighborhoods festooned with American flags, an aloof Republican incumbent dodging town halls, Melson alone in the ring pummeling the air with slow-motion jabs. It suggests a trailer for “Rocky Goes to Washington.”

“I can only take a little credit for them,” Hyers admitted after the two-and-a-half-minute ad came to an end. Bryce’s and Melson’s ads, he told me, had a co-producer: Matt McLaughlin, a veteran of TV advertising who “didn’t know campaigns and politics, but he knows art.” Hyers did not think the party’s need for “authentic candidates” and a little theatrical verve were incompatible. If anything, the role the confluence of those two perceived assets played in Trump’s victory is one of the few inarguable lessons of the 2016 election.

This lesson, however unacknowledged, is playing out across the 2018 electoral landscape. In Kentucky, a former Marine fighter pilot named Amy McGrath appears in a bomber jacket, declaring that her “new mission” is to “take on a Congress full of career politicians.” Assessing her candidacy’s apparent long odds, she says, with a cockeyed grin, “We’ll see about that.” Another web ad shows a dashing scientist in a white lab coat: Hans Keirstead, a pioneering stem-cell researcher now running to represent California’s 48th District and billing himself as the very definition of a “problem solver.”

In mid-August, I spoke to Ian Russell’s latest client, a telegenic Marine veteran and two-term state representative from Lewiston, Me., named Jared Golden. Lewiston today is a hollowed-out exoskeleton of a textile mill town. “Our way of life is under attack here,” Golden said. “We’re a classic case of the America that’s being left behind. The social-identity issues that have been emphasized in Portland don’t resonate in rural Maine. It’s damaged the Democratic brand here, to be honest. We’re a community of hard-working people who may not be highly educated, but that doesn’t mean we’re not intelligent. The majority of the folks here voted for Donald Trump, and I can tell you that the description of them as a basket of deplorables is just dead wrong.”

Golden told me that his neighbors had until recently thought of themselves as Democrats. Golden himself still is. When we spoke, he had just decided to run in Maine’s Second District against the Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin. Golden would be the fifth Democrat to enter the race. He seemed to have little use for the national party’s “A Better Deal” pitch, telling me, “It’s going to take more than a glossy new policy document to take back the U.S. House.”

What, then, would it take? A few days after I spoke with Golden, Ian Russell traveled to Lewiston and shot his candidate’s announcement ad. It mixes twilit images of small-town Maine with footage of the candidate in combat fatigues; later, he jogs down a country road wearing a T-shirt that says, “Pain Is Weakness Leaving the Body.” The ad excoriates the Republican incumbent but also bipartisan trade deals and unnamed political leaders who push “issues that don’t impact your life.”

The bears in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, in and around the park, are healthy now, and they have increased to at least 700 today from fewer than 150 in 1975, when they were listed as endangered.

But a genetic lifeline from Glacier bears, which are also related to the grizzlies of Canada, will mean a good deal more diversity to help assure the bears’ future. It’s so important that researchers have talked about trucking grizzly bears from the north to add to the Yellowstone gene pool.

“Because Yellowstone is a bit lower in genetic diversity, hundreds of years from now they might be less able to adapt to changing conditions — changing climate, changing food sources and disease resistance,” Dr. van Manen said.

While no one knows what advantageous traits the Glacier grizzlies might have in their genes, increasing diversity is the best way to assure resilience against those types of hazards.

Currently, the nearest interloper from the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem has bridged the 70-mile gap by working his way south. That grizzly is in the mountains near Butte, Mont., some 50 miles from the perimeter of the Yellowstone ecosystem.

Biologists and conservationists are rooting for a natural reunion between the two largest populations of grizzlies in the country, Dr. van Manen said.

In a study published in Ecosphere, researchers tracked grizzly bears from the northern and southern populations as they moved through western Montana, including the rugged Big Belt mountains near this city, which sits between the two national parks.

The effort to follow these nomadic bears was aided by satellite data collars and new, more powerful data analysis techniques. Some 124 males were monitored from 2000 to 2015, some for more than one year.

GPS collars can track a bear almost in real time, providing richly detailed information on the corridors and habitats they use that need to be protected.

While much of the land between the two parks is publicly owned and wild, it becomes a gauntlet in some places as bears migrate into towns, cities, ranches and farms.

The bears are likely to seek out dog food, beehives, garbage, chickens and even apple trees, getting into trouble that may require trapping and relocating them. Highway crossings, especially on I-90 and I-15, pose a serious risk.

Conservation groups and biologists say it’s a race against time to protect some of the open land between the two parks and to assure permanent transit routes for wildlife through land purchases or conservation easement.

Residential housing development north of Yellowstone around Bozeman, for example, is soaring.

“Even one house per square mile can be a problem for bears,” said Jodi Hilty, a wildlife biologist in Canmore, Canada. “At the same time, this is one of the most intact mountain ecosystems in the world.”

Dr. Hilty heads the group Yellowstone to Yukon, which seeks to link bears and other Yellowstone wildlife with populations in Glacier National Park and in vast tracts of wilderness in Canada. Protecting migration corridors between Yellowstone, Glacier and Canada would benefit not just bears, she said, but cougars, wolverines and other animals.

The Fish and Wildlife Service has removed the protections afforded under the Endangered Species Act from the Yellowstone grizzly because the population has grown so large. Dr. van Manen said that the number of grizzlies may exceed 1,000.

Environmentalists have sued the agency over its decision. They argue that climate change is a wild card that might someday cause the Yellowstone bear population to collapse.

With the bears delisted, some are concerned about plans by Montana officials to allow the hunting of Yellowstone grizzlies. Dr. David Mattson, a retired wildlife biologist, said that there is a good chance that “Montana will institute a more lethal regime, whether by sport hunting or by other means, that will compromise these prospects.”

The state has said it would not allow hunting in areas where the two populations might reconnect.

As bears explore far beyond their core habitats, people not accustomed to grizzlies need to be educated about bear-proofing garbage cans and sealing off beehives and chicken coops with electric fencing, Dr. van Manen said.

Carrying pepper spray has already become indispensable for hikers, hunters and others in many parts of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.

In 2016, four grizzlies were killed after confronting hunters in “defense of life” scenarios. Recently, a game warden near Cody, Wyo., shot and killed a female grizzly when it charged at him, leaving her cubs orphans.

Generally, though, the news for the big bear is good, said Dr. van Manen.

“There is strong scientific evidence that the recovery process that was put into place starting in the mid 1970s has paid off,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary effort for recovery of a species that has ability to kill people.

More than 16 million millennial women are now mothers, according to Pew, a number that grows by more than a million every year.

Eighty-two percent of children born each year are born to millennial mothers. That’s five out of every six babies. And their parents — let’s call them “parennials” — are challenging all sorts of commonly held beliefs about the American family.

Let’s examine their innovations one at a time.

#HASHTAGBABY

Parennials spent their formative years steeped in personal technology. As a result they’re “high-information parents,” said Rebecca Parlakian, the program director for Zero to Three, an organization that has been studying new parents since 1977.

“The good news is that parents know more about child development than ever before,” she said. “Google is the new grandparent, the new neighbor, the new nanny.”

The bad news is that parents feel overwhelmed by the volume of information, confused about the “right way” to do things and harshly judged by friends and relatives.

Kate Flynn, 32, lives in Brooklyn with her 11-month-old daughter, Isla, and her college sweetheart, Michael. Like many new parents, she felt unprepared for the responsibility. “We feel like kids who aren’t old enough to have kids,” she said.

To compensate, she relies on technology, from chat rooms to child development apps like Wonder Weeks and WebMDBaby.

“I’ll be on the phone with my mom and say, ‘The app is telling me that she is starting her 9-month sleep progression,’” Ms. Flynn said. “I just found out that Wonder Weeks only goes to when the child is one. I don’t know if that’s liberating or scary.”

Many parennials, accustomed to chronicling every fab appetizer and every failed job interview, give their children YouTube channels from the first sonogram and hashtags when they’re born.

Sara Mauskopf, 32, a onetime employee of Google from Philadelphia who is now a partner with Ms. Halsall in Winnie, a parenting start-up, even named her daughter with her social media profile in mind.

“I knew I wanted to name her Brynn, but when considering middle names, there were a couple of ‘A’ names we were thinking about. We chose Brynn Avery because I could get the Twitter handle @BrynnAvery,” Ms. Mauskopf said.

Others, like Kassandra Ortiz, 26, a stay-at-home mother of two in Brooklyn, are warier. After being stalked online by a classmate who posted her photo along with comments about what he wanted to do to her, Ms. Ortiz considers herself “overly protective” of her children.

“I like taking pictures of my kids walking away, so I avoid showing their faces,” Ms. Ortiz said. “I have this fear that if I post a picture on Instagram, then my child will become a meme.”

Goodbye, ‘Mom’ and ‘Dad.’ Hello, ‘Co-Parents.’

Brad Harrington, the executive director of the Boston College Center for Work & Family, has found that a third of millennial families follow traditional gender roles and are comfortable with their decision. Another third of them say spouses should share chores equally and feel they achieve this goal, while the final third strive for this equality but the female partner, in reality, does more.

“For 30 years we’ve been asking, ‘Can women have it all?’” Mr. Harrington said. “Now we’re asking if men can have it all.”

Gabe Wells, 33, a loan officer, was born in Iowa and moved to Portland, Ore., with his wife, Caitlin, who was his girlfriend at the time. When she became pregnant, the two went through a “rough patch,” he said, and went into counseling.

“The No. 1 thing I learned is that my language changed,” he said. “I don’t say ‘mother’ and ‘father’ anymore. I say ‘co-parent.’ It sounds odd to people in the Midwest, but it’s more reflective of what we’re trying to do.”

They realize 50-50 is “a pipe dream,” he said. “But If we can trade off going 60-40, that’s great.”

Co-parenting does come with downsides. Ms. Parlakian of Zero to Three said she’s begun to detect a new theme in her annual surveys of parents. She calls it “gate-keeping,” when the less-involved parent tries to step up but the primary parent slaps the partner down, saying “You did it the wrong way” or “Why did you put the baby in that?”

“Given the statement ‘I would like to be more involved with raising my child but my parenting partner interferes with my involvement,’ nearly half the dads agree,” Ms. Parlakian said, “while only 16 percent of moms do.”

From her experience running Winnie, Ms. Halsall has concluded that “millennial dads are different than their elders, in that they see it as a positive masculine trait to be involved with their children,” she said.

“The idea that women are more proactively issuing feedback to their co-parents that are male to me sounds very encouraging. It’s an indication that they see each other as partners.”

Can Granny Pay the Rent?

New parents of all ages often face money woes, but with parennials these challenges can feel particularly acute because they reached childbearing age during the Great Recession, are saddled with college debt and are perhaps job-hopping or part of the gig economy.

As a result, many parennials rely on their own baby boomer parents for financial support. Ms. Ortiz has started a photography business on the side while her husband, who hopes to get into real estate, drives for Uber. To make ends meet, they get financial help with rent from her mother-in-law.

“Money has always been an issue, but we do our best and hope God will provide,” Ms. Ortiz said. “I don’t know if it’s a millennial thing, but we spend so much money eating out. We’d be better off if we didn’t.”

Jess Laird, 31, grew up in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan with parents who were “broke actors,” she said, so she’s used to money struggles. She was working full-time when she had her first child at 29, but wanted to spend more time with her daughter. Since then, she has worked at a start-up that went out of business and now freelances remotely. She is still paying off her undergraduate loans, and her husband, Morgan, is doing the same with his law school debt.

With so much financial pressure, they rely on her mother for child care.

“Other moms I talk to who are 35 or 40 seem to be more settled financially,” she said. “It feels weird when I say, ‘My mom is taking care of my kid.’ I even use the word ‘mother’ because it sounds more adult.”

Losing Their Religion

Gender roles are not the only thing being challenged by parennials; other social norms are experiencing upheaval as well. Pew has found that almost four in 10 Americans married since 2010 have a spouse who is a different religious group, double the number from 1960. Nine in 10 millennials approve of interracial marriage or cross-cultural marriage.

The disdain of Andrew Moore, 33, and his wife, Rachel, 31, for religion has caused friction with his family, who were missionaries. “My mom just doesn’t talk about it,” said Mr. Moore, a physical scientist who is the father of Harrison, 2. “My father asked me, not long after I told him I was nonreligious, whether I would raise my children Christian. I was, like, ‘No, man, I don’t believe it.’”

The one thing they’re teaching him, he said, is “Some people get value from religion, and he might, too, as long as he realizes that what’s good for him might not be great for another.”

This sense of fluidity, of improvisation, of “making it work” in the words of one couple, or “getting by” in the words of another, appears to be an early, unifying theme of millennial parents. Maybe it’s their uncertain economic status, their sense of experimentation, or simply the times they grew up in, but many parennials seem less rigid than their elders.

“I thought we were supposed to do things a certain way,” said Ms. Flynn of Brooklyn, who had multiple jobs and multiple apartments when she was in her 20s. “Have the career, the house, the green grass, and then the kid. But that didn’t happen. My life has a different plan.

Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, N.E.R.D. snaps back to life, Bruce Springsteen contributes a song to a film about veterans coping with PTSD, and Feist honors Leonard Cohen.

Prettymuch, ‘Open Arms’

Kudos to whatever musicologist-historian is masterminding the rise of the new boy band Prettymuch. Maybe it’s Simon Cowell, who signed the group. Or maybe its ILYA, the Max Martin associate who produced (and contributed writing to) this song, the group’s third. Whoever it is, that person is savvily backdooring the sound and attitude of 1990s male R&B singing groups into modern pop. “Would You Mind,” the first Prettymuch single, contained some subtle nods to Bell Biv DeVoe’s “Poison” and Boyz II Men’s “Motownphilly.” And “Open Arms” has some strategic references to Shai’s “If I Ever Fall in Love.” Shuttling between pure a cappella and a spare, sharp beat, the group performs what feels like a deconstruction of that classic, emphasizing taut five-part harmonies doled out in tight bursts. The singing is mature, the attitude is poised, the eyes are on history. JON CARAMANICA

N.E.R.D and Rihanna, ‘Lemon’

Beginning in the early 2000s, N.E.R.D — Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo (the production duo the Neptunes) and Shae Haley — created inventive and pugnacious punk-funk born from hip-hop DNA. “Lemon” is its first single since its last album, in 2010 (not counting some songs for “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water”). It features a beat that throbs and tinkles, Mr. Williams barking and jabbing as if in a boxing ring, and also Rihanna, rapping with tremendous attitude. “Lemon” also appears to mark the beginning of a full-fledged return of N.E.R.D (which stands for No One Ever Really Dies) which, in addition to releasing this song, is performing its first concert in years this weekend at ComplexCon in Long Beach, Calif. J.C.

Stella Donnelly, ‘Boys Will Be Boys’

A delicate waltz by the Australian songwriter Stella Donnelly carries a bitter reproach to blaming the victims of sexual assault. “Why was she all alone/Wearing her shirt that low?” she sings, and then her voice rises and roughens. “They said boys will be boys/Deaf to the word no.” She released the song earlier this year on an EP, “ Thrush Metal,” but the video clip appears right in time to reinforce the #MeToo movement. JON PARELES

Willow, ‘Oh No!!!!’

On her 17th birthday, Oct. 31, Willow Smith released her second album, “The 1st,” produced and written almost entirely on her own. It’s a daring, accomplished, stripped-down album a world away from any R&B expectations. The songs are far closer to the bare-bones settings and emotional volatility of early PJ Harvey, along with some of the metaphysical musings of late-1960s psych-folk. “Oh No!!!!” is one of its tormented love songs, wondering, “Why can’t I control it?” and arguing with itself over a clattering beat and dissonant guitar, an unresolved flare-up of romantic anxiety. J.P.

Bruce Springsteen, ‘Freedom Cadence’

A chant long used by marching soldiers, and updated with each new war, “Freedom Cadence,” supplied the words and melody of Bruce Springsteen’s song for the closing credits of “Thank You for Your Service,” a film about Iraq veterans coping with PTSD. “Freedom is won/through the blood of someone’s son,” he sings. It’s a lo-fi production, with piano, harmonium, banjo and a somber, simple drumbeat in the murky mix alongside the voice of Mr. Springsteen, alone and then joined by others including Adam Schumann, the soldier whose story underlies the film. It trudges onward, elegiac and determined. J.P.

Brian Blade and the Fellowship Band, ‘Within Everything’

With Brian Blade’s Fellowship Band, which has been together in one form or another for 20 years, the jazz combo becomes a kind of traveling backyard communion. In this music — Southern and ungothic, slow and almost hymnal — you hear dreams passed around between companions, atrophied memories held together in communal trust. On “Body and Shadow” — the Fellowship’s fourth album, out next week — Mr. Blade, a renowned drummer, lets his knack for ground-opening syncopations take a back seat; his compatriots forgo the kind of high-flown soloing that he’s so good at conjuring. Instead, coming to the fore is a rich shadow play of harmonies and earth tones. Together, Dave Devine’s guitar, Chris Thomas’s bass, Melvin Butler’s tenor saxophone and (on tracks other than this) Myron Walden’s bass clarinet make a sound like damp wood underfoot, welcoming your step on a trail you’ve long known. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Sam Smith, ‘Burning’ (Live From the Hackney Round Chapel)

Admire the patience of Sam Smith ’s bassist and backup singers in this live rendition of “Burning,” a despondent hymn of lost love tinged with nicotine addiction. Despite the tremulous purity of his voice, he claims to be smoking “oh, more than 20 a day” since the breakup, and as he yearns for a reunion, he offers, “Wish we could smoke again just for a day.” Reinforcing his loneliness, he’s accompanied for nearly the entire song only by piano chords; the others don’t join him until three minutes into the song, for one chorus, and then they’re silent again. J.P.

Feist, ‘Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye’

In a quiet tribute from one Canadian songwriter to another, Feist sings Leonard Cohen’s fond and profound farewell to a lover, “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye,” with quiet longing. Her version is both close to and distant from his; an acoustic guitar is the only instrument, while her layered voices portray her close attention to the song’s shifting moods. J.P.

Tee Grizzley, ‘Win’

The most striking aspect of Tee Grizzley’s breakout single, “First Day Out,” was its breathlessness. He raps with something more than urgency — it’s more like insistence. That song, an unexpected hit last year, felt like a barreling train that refused to slow down. On “Win,” his best song since, he hasn’t let up a bit, success be damned: “Without me my family wouldn’t have food/Anybody going ‘gainst me gotta lose.” Even though Tee Grizzley moves bullishly, what enlivens his verses are the quick flashes of mordant wit: “The Mustang used to always run out of gas/now I’m in that Wraith, touch the paint and it’s a body bag.” J.C.

Cam, ‘Diane’

The good old country cheating song gets even more twisted in “Diane”: an apology by a deceived lover, who knows she didn’t see any “gold wedding band,” to her lover’s wife. “I promise I didn’t know he was your man,” she sings. It’s not a lament: it’s a gallop, quick-strummed and belted. “All of those nights that he’s given to me/I wish I could give them back to you,” Cam offers, in a kind of adulterous humblebrag, over an arrangement that’s closer to the E Street Band than to Loretta Lynn. J.P.

Empyrean Atlas, ‘Echolocation’

Depending on the tune, the interwoven triple-guitar gamesmanship of Empyrean Atlas can run in few different directions: toward the mathy post-punk of Horse Lords or Battles, toward warmly anesthetic ambience (say, Pink Floyd meets Bradford Cox), or toward West African high life. On “Echolocation,” the clangy, lapping repetitions feel most in line with that last influence. The quintet’s movements are coiled and contained, but pulsing with small, ecstatic fibrillations.

A prankster who liked to provoke — as the anonymous street artist Banksy has done since the 1990s — Mr. Hambleton came to public attention in the mid- to late 1970s by painting faux crime-scene outlines of bodies on pavement and adding “blood,” hoping to make people believe that a serial murderer was on the loose.

He began this “Image Mass Murder” series in his hometown, Vancouver, British Columbia, and then took it down the West Coast and across North America. He carried squeeze bottles filled with white paint for the outline and red paint for the make-believe blood.

“I remember stumbling on one of them and thinking it was a real crime scene,” Penny Arcade, the performance artist, says in “Shadowman,” a forthcoming documentary about Mr. Hambleton, directed by Oren Jacoby. After seeing another outline, she says, she realized that “this may be something else, but I didn’t have any language for it.”

Mr. Hambleton studied maps to determine where, in each city, he would strike next.

“I began to think I was murdering people, going back to my hotel covered in paint, blood, blood-red paint,” he says in the documentary, adding, “Blood has a beautiful color.”

Announcing that “Dick Trace-It,” also known as Richard Hambleton, was the private detective trying to solve the “murders” in Vancouver, he posted 4,000 fake wanted posters seeking the apprehension of “Mr. Reee” for the crimes.

In 1980, soon after moving to the Lower East Side, he started another urban art project, installing full-size photographic images of himself, dressed up in a suit and tie and staring, on walls around the city and elsewhere. He called it “I Only Have Eyes for You.” The images were printed on paper that stretched when moistened and faded to white shadows after three months.

His early “Shadowman” period led to shadow images of bucking horses and riders on walls and canvases. By 1984, he had turned to the Marlboro Man, the cowboy figure whose macho image promoted cigarettes for decades. Mr. Hambleton, who smoked, toyed with the image, painting shadow figures over it, sometimes mixing tobacco with black paint for what he called a “black lung” effect.

Richard Art Hambleton was born in Vancouver on June 23, 1952. His parents, Arthur and Vale Hambleton, survive him, as do two sisters and a brother.

After graduating from the Emily Carr University of Art & Design in Vancouver, he started the Pumps Center for Alternative Art, a gallery, performance and video space, in the same city.

By the mid-1980s he had begun his transition to creating enormous seascapes, among them turbulent ocean-wave paintings. “I wanted to do something that was a different sensibility,” he says in the documentary. “It’s about love.”

Reviewing an exhibition of Mr. Hambleton’s paintings at the Piezo Electric Gallery in the East Village in 1985, Michael Brenson of The New York Times wrote that the violence inherent in his early “Shadowman” work had not fully left him.

“There are three paintings called ‘Rainstorm,’ in which raging water seems to be rushing toward us from within the canvas,” Mr. Brenson wrote. “In each of the paintings, sea and sky rage a bit more until they seem on the point of swallowing everything.”

Mr. Hambleton soon moved into his “beautiful” period, painting landscapes with gold and silver leaf and tinted varnishes.

Photo

But by the early 1990s he had begun to withdraw from the art scene. Mr. Haring had died of AIDS at 31, Mr. Basquiat of a drug overdose at 27, and Mr. Hambleton, Ms. Woodward said, had become “paranoid about gallery culture and the impact on the artist and his freedoms.”

His life had begun to unravel. His drug use continued. His skin cancer worsened. He lived in increasing squalor.

“His goal was to reach the sublime,” Ms. Woodward said. “He used drugs to get there. It was just who he was.”

In 2009, two art entrepreneurs cajoled him into producing some new work, paintings of shadowy figures wearing suits, which were added to a retrospective exhibition in New York sponsored by Giorgio Armani. For his documentary, Mr. Jacoby filmed Mr. Hambleton as he procrastinated and battled with his anxious patrons.

The show, which traveled to Europe the next year, was successful, and a comeback seemed possible. But the moment did not last long. While Mr. Hambleton kept painting almost until he died, he was becoming increasingly frail. His cancer was eroding his face. His back was bowed and lopsided from his spinal conditions. He used his folding bicycle as a walker. At times he was homeless.

“At least Basquiat, you know, died,” he says bitingly in the documentary, during a scene shot in 2014. “I was alive when I died, you know. That’s the problem.”","Richard Hambleton, ‘Shadowman’ of the ’80s Art Scene, Dies at 65",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/obituaries/richard-hambleton-dead-shadowman-of-the-80s-art-scene.html

Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always.

Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure.

In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best.

As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao — sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment — joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.

Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?

Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help.

What’s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out.

The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers.

Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rosé or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered.

In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It’s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else.

That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate.

Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencías from Spain, rieslings — all are fine choices.

These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do.

For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold.

Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of.

The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardèche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called “a feeling of over the river and through the woods.”

Tejal’s second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment.

The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast.

Pete brought a rosé sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedès region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast.

His other wine was an inspired selection, a 2013 Tinto, or red, from the intriguing Barraida region of Portugal from Sidónio de Sousa, made from the baga grape. It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal.

Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled.

This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh.

Florence’s white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip.

Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect “sinister,” but even so, it was easily tolerable.

My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d’Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily sémillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

My red was a 2015 Cahors from Château Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina.

Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. “I realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,” she said.

She’s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream. Otherwise, I live by the last rule.

Rule No. 4: Choose wines that you like; everybody else will like them, too.

Recipe Pairing: Cornbread Madeleines With Jalapeño

A recent dinner at Gloria, an intimate new seafood restaurant in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, started on a fine note. Warm rounds of individual jalapeño-studded cornbread were served while we sipped cocktails. Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections. Phil Johnson, an owner of Gloria, provided the recipe. But for Thanksgiving, instead of the four-inch cornbread disks served at the restaurant, I baked the batter in madeleine pans. I then froze the little cakes, so I would have them for the holiday. (I will reheat them covered in foil on a baking sheet at 275 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.) The madeleines would welcome any quaff, cider or beer, not just wine. And the batter can also be baked in cast-iron corn stick molds, though the yield would be fewer, about 15. FLORENCE FABRICANT

Consider Alabama’s football equipment truck, which seems relatively modest — until someone blows the horn that mimics an elephant’s call. Penn State’s truck has neon blue underbody lights and a football-style “face mask” on its front bumper, and Utah wrapped even the top of its equipment truck so television blimps could glimpse, and broadcast, the university’s branding.

Notre Dame is so proud of its truck that it drove it to Savannah, Ga., in January 2016 and parked it in front of a five-star prospect’s home on the eve of national signing day as part of the Irish’s last-minute recruiting pitch.

“It does serve as a drivable billboard in a sense,” Chip Robertson, the assistant athletic director for equipment operations at the University of Texas, said of his university’s newly redesigned truck, which bears the image of the landmark UT Tower. “Fans enjoy seeing it on the road and also love to take pictures in front of it wherever it stops.”

The customization craze is hardly reserved for the bigger programs, though. East Carolina, of the American Athletic Conference, has used a truck fully adorned in its distinctive purple, and replete with purple LED running lights, since 2014.

“Why are we doing it?” said Greg Herring, East Carolina’s associate athletic director for marketing and fan engagement. “Because everybody does it.”

There is incentive beyond just keeping up with the competition. Thanks in part to conference realignment, teams are traveling more than ever, and their equipment has to meet them at every stop. Herring said East Carolina’s truck would visit 15 states this season, on trips covering more than 7,600 miles.

That creates invaluable opportunity for brand reach. East Carolina only pays for new vinyl on its truck — the truck itself is lent by a local company, ELS Freight, which voluntarily painted the cab purple — at a cost of about $10,000.

“I can’t think of anything that gives you more exposure,” Herring said. “Other than being on television for those games.”

But a certain one-upmanship was also inevitable. Fans have taken notice. In 2013, two friends from Ann Arbor, Mich., Jason Pinder and Jason Burt, started posting photos to Twitter of the various equipment trucks they would see parked outside Michigan Stadium on game day. Today, their feed, @NCAAFBALLTRUCKS, has more than 3,200 followers.

“Now every time we go to Michigan, there are five, six, seven different groups of fans taking pictures of the trucks,” Pinder said.

Harmon Hodge, 60, a Southern Mississippi football fan from Lilburn, Ga., runs what some might call a football equipment truck fan site. He posts pictures of trucks — some of them years old — from the Southeastern Conference to the Southland Conference.

“All the schools are starting to get them,” Hodge said. “Even the smaller schools are getting involved in this.”

Hodge said he thought that Ohio State might have been the first to fully decorate its truck, sometime in the mid-2000s, but he could not be sure. But it was Army’s truck, born in 2010, that took things to a new level.

Donated to the program by Navistar Defense, which designs and manufactures military vehicles, and with detailing by Central Auto Body in Chicago, the truck weighs 35 tons empty. The hand-painted murals on the cab (including a muscular arm hanging out Chisholm’s driver’s side window) cost more than $80,000, according to Nick Determan, an assistant athletic director at Army.

Seven years later, fans still gawk at the behemoth, which lives outside Gate 1 of Michie Stadium when it’s not on the road.

“Just this morning when I pulled into work, there were people taking pictures with it,” Determan said. Monken, the Army coach, calls it “a work of art.”

There is some practical need for the biggest rigs available. Army’s truck, for instance, carries not only the football equipment but also gear for the band, the cheerleaders, the training staff and the Black Knights’ radio broadcasters — a load that can add up to 30,000 pounds.

Trucks are occasionally lent out for fan events, food drives and other needs. Texas universities, for example, sent their trucks to Houston as part of the relief effort after Hurricane Harvey, and Kansas State’s ferried hay bales across the state last spring to help farmers recover from wildfires.

Not everyone is happy to see one roll up, however; when the former Syracuse athletic director Mark Coyle left to take the same post at Minnesota, the Gophers sent their football equipment truck to upstate New York to serve as his moving van, adding salt to the wound.

But more often than not, the trucks that hit the road every fall might be used to drive home another message: intimidation.

“We try to be first-class in everything we do,” Army’s Determan said. “There’s not a better example than that truck leading the way.

Imagine a world where power literally flows from women’s hands, where the mere touch of a woman’s fingers can shock, stun and ultimately kill. Naomi Alderman’s new novel, “The Power,” conjures up such a world, and the consequences are electrifying. John Grisham returns with a legal thriller centered on for-profit law schools; James McBride tries his expert hand at short fiction; and Edward St. Aubyn reimagines King Lear as that contemporary version of king, a media mogul. In nonfiction, “Sticky Fingers” tells the story of a real-life media giant, Jann Wenner, the founder of Rolling Stone; and Peter Manseau explores the eerily lit world of 19th-century spirit photography.

STICKY FINGERS: The Life and Times of Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone Magazine, by Joe Hagan. (Alfred A. Knopf, $29.95.) Hagan attempts to explain why a mere rock magazine editor — Wenner founded Rolling Stone in San Francisco in 1967 — matters to the history of the 20th century. “Hagan has delivered a supple, confident, dispassionately reported and deeply well-written biography,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “It’s a big book, one that no one will wish longer, but its chapters move past like a crunching collection of singles and not a thumb-sucking double album. It’s a joy to read and feels built to last.”

THE ROOSTER BAR, by John Grisham. (Doubleday, $28.95.) Grisham’s latest legal thriller was inspired by an essay by Paul Campos in The Atlantic condemning the student-entrapping practices of many for-profit law schools. Grisham has translated the ethical and economic issues raised by Campos into a high drama featuring three students who come up with a scheme of their own. Our reviewer Janet Maslin calls it a “buoyant, mischievous” book, written with a sense that “this reliable best-selling author is feeling real pleasure, and not just obligation, in delivering his work.”

FIVE-CARAT SOUL, by James McBride. (Riverhead, $27.) In his delightful first story collection, the author of the National Book Award-winning novel “The Good Lord Bird” (and a biographer of James Brown) continues to explore race, masculinity, music and history. McBride’s stories often hum with sweet nostalgia, and some even dispatch a kind of fairy-tale moral.

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

On Monday morning, after America learned that Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort’s lobbying partner, Rick Gates, had been indicted and turned themselves in to federal authorities, the president tried to distance himself from the unfolding scandal. “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” the president wrote in one tweet. A few minutes later, he added, in another, “Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”

At almost the exact same time, news broke suggesting that the F.B.I. has evidence of collusion. We learned that one of the Trump campaign’s foreign policy aides, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his attempts to solicit compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Despite Trump’s hysterical denials and attempts at diversion, the question is no longer whether there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but how extensive it was.

In truth, that’s been clear for a while. If it’s sometimes hard to grasp the Trump campaign’s conspiracy against our democracy, it’s due less to lack of proof than to the impudent improbability of its B-movie plotline. Monday’s indictments offer evidence of things that Washington already knows but pretends to forget. Trump, more gangster than entrepreneur, has long surrounded himself with bottom-feeding scum, and for all his nationalist bluster, his campaign was a vehicle for Russian subversion.

We already knew that Manafort offered private briefings about the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The indictment accuses him of having been an unregistered foreign agent for another Putin-aligned oligarch, the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Trump wasn’t paying Manafort, who reportedly sold himself to the candidate by offering to work free. But he intended to profit from his connection with the campaign, emailing an associate, “How do we use to get whole?” If there were no other evidence against Trump, we could conclude that he was grotesquely irresponsible in opening his campaign up to corrupt foreign infiltration.

But of course there is other evidence against Trump. His campaign was told that Russia wanted to help it, and it welcomed such help. On June 3, remember, the music publicist Rob Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr. to broker a Trump Tower meeting at which a Russian source would deliver “very high level and sensitive information” as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. responded with delight: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”

The guilty plea by Papadopoulos indicates what information Trump Jr. might have been expecting. An obscure figure in foreign policy circles, Papadopoulos was one of five people who Trump listed as foreign policy advisers during a Washington Post editorial board meeting last year. A court filing, whose truth Papadopoulos affirms, says that in April 2016, he met with a professor who he “understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials.” The professor told him that Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, including “thousands of emails.” (The Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta had been hacked in March.)",The Plot Against America,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/mueller-manafort-indictment.html

Al Arabiya said that the anticorruption committee has the right to investigate, arrest, ban from travel, or freeze the assets of anyone it deems corrupt.

The Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, the de facto royal hotel, was evacuated on Saturday, stirring rumors that it would be used to house detained royals. The airport for private planes was closed, arousing speculation that the crown prince was seeking to block rich businessmen from fleeing before more arrests.

Prince Alwaleed was giving interviews to the Western news media as recently as late last month about subjects like so-called crypto currencies and Saudi Arabia’s plans for a public offering of shares in its state oil company, Aramco.

He has also recently sparred publicly with President Donald J. Trump. The prince was part of a group of investors who bought control of the Plaza Hotel in New York from Mr. Trump, and he also bought an expensive yacht from him as well. But in a twitter message in 2015 the prince called Mr. Trump “a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.”

Mr. Trump fired back, also on Twitter, that “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money.”

As president, Mr. Trump has developed a warm, mutually supportive relationship with the ascendant crown prince, who has rocketed from near obscurity in recent years to taking control of the country’s most important functions.

But his swift rise has also divided Saudis. Many applaud his vision, crediting him with addressing the economic problems facing the kingdom and laying out a plan to move beyond its dependence on oil.

Others see him as brash, power-hungry and inexperienced, and they resent him for bypassing his elder relatives and concentrating so much power in one branch of the family.

Before sparring with Mr. Trump, Prince Alwaleed was publicly rebuffed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who rejected his $10 million donation for the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York because the prince had also criticized American foreign policy.

As powerful as the billionaire is, he is something of an outsider within the royal family — not a dissident, but an unusually outspoken figure on a variety of issues. He openly supported women driving long before the kingdom said it would grant them the right to do so, and he has long employed women in his orbit.

In 2015 he pledged to donate his fortune of $32 billion to charity after his death. It was unclear Saturday whether Saudi Arabia’s corruption committee might seek to confiscate any of his assets.

Saudi Arabia is an executive monarchy without a written Constitution or independent government institutions like a Parliament or courts, so accusations of corruption are difficult to evaluate. The boundaries between the public funds and the wealth of the royal family are murky at best, and corruption, as other countries would describe it, is believed to be widespread.

The arrests came a few hours after the king replaced the minister in charge of the Saudi national guard, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, who controlled the last of the three Saudi armed forces not yet considered to be under control of the crown prince.

The king named Crown Prince Mohammed the minister of defense in 2015. Earlier this year, the king removed Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as head of the interior ministry, placing him under house arrest and extending the crown prince’s influence over the interior ministry’s troops, which act as a second armed force.

Rumors have swirled since then that King Salman and his favorite son would soon move against Prince Mutaib, commander of the third armed force and himself a former contender for the crown.","Saudi Arabia Arrests 11 Princes, Including Billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-waleed-bin-talal.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

The Playlist: The Return of the Real Boy Band and 10 More New Songs

Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, N.E.R.D. snaps back to life, Bruce Springsteen contributes a song to a film about veterans coping with PTSD, and Feist honors Leonard Cohen.

Prettymuch, ‘Open Arms’

Kudos to whatever musicologist-historian is masterminding the rise of the new boy band Prettymuch. Maybe it’s Simon Cowell, who signed the group. Or maybe its ILYA, the Max Martin associate who produced (and contributed writing to) this song, the group’s third. Whoever it is, that person is savvily backdooring the sound and attitude of 1990s male R&B singing groups into modern pop. “Would You Mind,” the first Prettymuch single, contained some subtle nods to Bell Biv DeVoe’s “Poison” and Boyz II Men’s “Motownphilly.” And “Open Arms” has some strategic references to Shai’s “If I Ever Fall in Love.” Shuttling between pure a cappella and a spare, sharp beat, the group performs what feels like a deconstruction of that classic, emphasizing taut five-part harmonies doled out in tight bursts. The singing is mature, the attitude is poised, the eyes are on history. JON CARAMANICA

N.E.R.D and Rihanna, ‘Lemon’

Beginning in the early 2000s, N.E.R.D — Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo (the production duo the Neptunes) and Shae Haley — created inventive and pugnacious punk-funk born from hip-hop DNA. “Lemon” is its first single since its last album, in 2010 (not counting some songs for “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water”). It features a beat that throbs and tinkles, Mr. Williams barking and jabbing as if in a boxing ring, and also Rihanna, rapping with tremendous attitude. “Lemon” also appears to mark the beginning of a full-fledged return of N.E.R.D (which stands for No One Ever Really Dies) which, in addition to releasing this song, is performing its first concert in years this weekend at ComplexCon in Long Beach, Calif. J.C.

Stella Donnelly, ‘Boys Will Be Boys’

A delicate waltz by the Australian songwriter Stella Donnelly carries a bitter reproach to blaming the victims of sexual assault. “Why was she all alone/Wearing her shirt that low?” she sings, and then her voice rises and roughens. “They said boys will be boys/Deaf to the word no.” She released the song earlier this year on an EP, “ Thrush Metal,” but the video clip appears right in time to reinforce the #MeToo movement. JON PARELES

Willow, ‘Oh No!!!!’

On her 17th birthday, Oct. 31, Willow Smith released her second album, “The 1st,” produced and written almost entirely on her own. It’s a daring, accomplished, stripped-down album a world away from any R&B expectations. The songs are far closer to the bare-bones settings and emotional volatility of early PJ Harvey, along with some of the metaphysical musings of late-1960s psych-folk. “Oh No!!!!” is one of its tormented love songs, wondering, “Why can’t I control it?” and arguing with itself over a clattering beat and dissonant guitar, an unresolved flare-up of romantic anxiety. J.P.

Bruce Springsteen, ‘Freedom Cadence’

A chant long used by marching soldiers, and updated with each new war, “Freedom Cadence,” supplied the words and melody of Bruce Springsteen’s song for the closing credits of “Thank You for Your Service,” a film about Iraq veterans coping with PTSD. “Freedom is won/through the blood of someone’s son,” he sings. It’s a lo-fi production, with piano, harmonium, banjo and a somber, simple drumbeat in the murky mix alongside the voice of Mr. Springsteen, alone and then joined by others including Adam Schumann, the soldier whose story underlies the film. It trudges onward, elegiac and determined. J.P.

Brian Blade and the Fellowship Band, ‘Within Everything’

With Brian Blade’s Fellowship Band, which has been together in one form or another for 20 years, the jazz combo becomes a kind of traveling backyard communion. In this music — Southern and ungothic, slow and almost hymnal — you hear dreams passed around between companions, atrophied memories held together in communal trust. On “Body and Shadow” — the Fellowship’s fourth album, out next week — Mr. Blade, a renowned drummer, lets his knack for ground-opening syncopations take a back seat; his compatriots forgo the kind of high-flown soloing that he’s so good at conjuring. Instead, coming to the fore is a rich shadow play of harmonies and earth tones. Together, Dave Devine’s guitar, Chris Thomas’s bass, Melvin Butler’s tenor saxophone and (on tracks other than this) Myron Walden’s bass clarinet make a sound like damp wood underfoot, welcoming your step on a trail you’ve long known. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Sam Smith, ‘Burning’ (Live From the Hackney Round Chapel)

Admire the patience of Sam Smith ’s bassist and backup singers in this live rendition of “Burning,” a despondent hymn of lost love tinged with nicotine addiction. Despite the tremulous purity of his voice, he claims to be smoking “oh, more than 20 a day” since the breakup, and as he yearns for a reunion, he offers, “Wish we could smoke again just for a day.” Reinforcing his loneliness, he’s accompanied for nearly the entire song only by piano chords; the others don’t join him until three minutes into the song, for one chorus, and then they’re silent again. J.P.

Feist, ‘Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye’

In a quiet tribute from one Canadian songwriter to another, Feist sings Leonard Cohen’s fond and profound farewell to a lover, “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye,” with quiet longing. Her version is both close to and distant from his; an acoustic guitar is the only instrument, while her layered voices portray her close attention to the song’s shifting moods. J.P.

Tee Grizzley, ‘Win’

The most striking aspect of Tee Grizzley’s breakout single, “First Day Out,” was its breathlessness. He raps with something more than urgency — it’s more like insistence. That song, an unexpected hit last year, felt like a barreling train that refused to slow down. On “Win,” his best song since, he hasn’t let up a bit, success be damned: “Without me my family wouldn’t have food/Anybody going ‘gainst me gotta lose.” Even though Tee Grizzley moves bullishly, what enlivens his verses are the quick flashes of mordant wit: “The Mustang used to always run out of gas/now I’m in that Wraith, touch the paint and it’s a body bag.” J.C.

Cam, ‘Diane’

The good old country cheating song gets even more twisted in “Diane”: an apology by a deceived lover, who knows she didn’t see any “gold wedding band,” to her lover’s wife. “I promise I didn’t know he was your man,” she sings. It’s not a lament: it’s a gallop, quick-strummed and belted. “All of those nights that he’s given to me/I wish I could give them back to you,” Cam offers, in a kind of adulterous humblebrag, over an arrangement that’s closer to the E Street Band than to Loretta Lynn. J.P.

Empyrean Atlas, ‘Echolocation’

Depending on the tune, the interwoven triple-guitar gamesmanship of Empyrean Atlas can run in few different directions: toward the mathy post-punk of Horse Lords or Battles, toward warmly anesthetic ambience (say, Pink Floyd meets Bradford Cox), or toward West African high life. On “Echolocation,” the clangy, lapping repetitions feel most in line with that last influence. The quintet’s movements are coiled and contained, but pulsing with small, ecstatic fibrillations.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — This is a perfect puzzle for a Friday. It’s a puzzle by Kameron Austin Collins and Brendan Emmett Quigley and, if I can make a recommendation, it is best done curled up on the couch with a fine beverage, and the knowledge that the weekend is at hand. Maybe there’s some music playing in the background, and some good chocolate nearby. All I know is that I smiled all the way through this puzzle, and I hope you did, too.

The reason I smiled is because this was the most satisfying tug-of-war I’ve been a part of in a long time. I didn’t know all the answers. Well, my brain did, mostly, but the answers weren’t always at the surface. I had to dig for some of them, and work the grid for others.

I loved SPARE ME, TOE NAIL, NUT MEAT, BANK VAULT, BEAT A DEAD HORSE, GOOGLE HANGOUTS, PLUS ONE and UGLY CRY. Meaty, lively entries (I was actually surprised that there were only two debuts today), and a mostly clean grid. Sneaky clues that are just out of reach, but which fall upon second look. Maybe a third look. But that’s the Friday for me.

Tricky Clues

16A: They’re not wrong. If you think of your digits — your fingers and toes — exactly half of them will have a TOE NAIL, hopefully.

22A: The trick to a clue like “You, overseas” is to know that it is asking you for the word “You” in a foreign language (hence the clue word “overseas”). Got that? Good. Now your job is to figure out which language. There are a lot to choose from. TOI, for example, means “you” in French, but that’s not the answer. Now, if you know about the lean and hungry CASSIUS, who went on to be one of the recipients of Julius Caesar’s famous “Et tu”’s, you can fill that in, and that gives you the S. The only language I know that has a word meaning “you” that begins with an S is German, and the word is SIE. UPDATE: I have since been informed by an alert commenter that the Turkish words for “you” are SIZ and SEN, so I sit corrected.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

“Frankly, I think all states are going to have to do that,” Ms. Dhingra said.
Ms. Dhingra suggested that the session might become mainly a chance for Democrats to prove themselves responsible, rather than as a lunge toward California-like status.
“There’s diversity of views in all caucuses, and so nothing’s guaranteed in life,” Mr. Inslee said.","Perhaps most ambitious of all, Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, harbors dreams of enacting a muscular carbon pricing plan along with California, Oregon and officials in Canada. In an interview, Mr. Inslee said the special election in Eastside Seattle could open the way for broad action, including taxing carbon but also joint initiatives on energy efficiency, research and clean water.

“We intend to make a full-scale effort in the next session of the Legislature if we win,” he said. “It will be a bell in the night, showing hope for the country, rejecting the Trump agenda of denying climate science.”

A coastal alliance, Mr. Inslee added, especially when cities such as Seattle and Portland, Ore., and throughout California are booming economically, would help make the case to a national audience that addressing climate change through energy policy is good for business and job creation.

“The more we can have uniformity in a carbon pricing system or regulatory system, the better,” he said.

Both parties see Democrats as favored to win the district, which voted heavily for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Republicans held the area’s State Senate seat largely because of the personal popularity of an incumbent lawmaker, Andy Hill, who died of lung cancer last fall.

Despite their dominance at the federal level and in most state capitals, West Coast Republicans have been driven to the point of extinction as the party’s standing has plummeted in prosperous cities and suburbs, from San Diego to Seattle. Their candidate in the State Senate race, Jinyoung Lee Englund, a polished former political operative, has strained to set herself apart from the national party, declaring that she did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 and pleading with voters to embrace divided government in Olympia.

Ms. Englund, 33, has campaigned explicitly against the “blue wall” scenario, warning that voters should not let Washington “go the way of California” and other one-party states. She expressed deep skepticism of Mr. Inslee’s climate proposals and suggested Democrats were mainly focused on trying to raise general revenue by another name. Republican groups have aired commercials saying that “Seattle liberals” could wreak havoc on the state’s finances if Democrats are allowed to govern unchecked.

“You don’t want to go the way of Oregon,” Ms. Englund said in an interview. “Washingtonians are more independent.”

Ms. Englund rebuked Democrats for what she characterized as using the state government as a partisan bludgeon. “I think that’s wrong,” she said. “The role of a state senator is not to go and lambaste what’s happening nationally.”

But the 45th District, a diverse suburban patchwork that stretches across the high-tech haven of Redmond and into more rural territory beyond — north and east of Bellevue — is emblematic of the territory that has lurched away from the Republican Party over the last year, recoiling from Mr. Trump’s brand of hard nationalism. Manka Dhingra, the Democratic candidate, has led in the polls by a comfortable but not overwhelming margin.

Ms. Dhingra, 43, a gregarious career prosecutor, has pledged support for an array of Democratic wish-list policies — though in a nod to the district’s moderate history, her campaign literature promises “independent leadership.” She has endorsed a carbon tax and applauded the state’s insistent litigation against the White House. Ms. Dhingra said in an interview that state government should take comprehensive action to check “what’s coming out of Washington, D.C.”

“Frankly, I think all states are going to have to do that,” Ms. Dhingra said. “We have to make sure immigrants feel safe. We have to make sure women’s health care is protected.”

Republican leaders in the state concede the national backdrop has made a tough race even harder. Rob McKenna, a former state attorney general who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Inslee in 2012, said an upset is possible but called the “Trump factor” a drag on Ms. Englund.

Mr. McKenna cautioned that even a Democratic victory should not be overinterpreted as a political turning point. A setback for Republicans, he said, would not change the fundamental character of the state, which he described as more politically competitive and fiscally conservative than its coastal neighbors.

Photo

“This is a state that is still, more or less, 50-50,” Mr. McKenna said, predicting of Democrats: “They’ll have difficulties, because they’ll be reluctant to risk their majorities in the House and the Senate.”

Other local leaders are less sure, holding up the Seattle area as an illustrative example of an upwardly mobile metropolitan area shifting to the left. If Republicans have staked their message, in large part, on suburban distrust of the big city, the region is increasingly knitted together by a thriving tech economy at companies like Amazon and Microsoft, and an expanding rapid transit rail network that is tying people closer to Seattle.

Dow Constantine, the King County executive and a Democrat, said that the once very real political divisions of the region — Democratic-leaning Seattle on the West Side of Lake Washington, Republican-leaning enclaves to the east — have been shattered by demographic change, too, especially as the immigrants who came to work in tech jobs encouraged others in the countries they left to follow them.

“The comical attempts to demonize Seattle in the 45th District race, I think, will be shown to have been a poor strategy,” Mr. Constantine said.

The area’s shifting identity has been on vivid display in this election: As Ms. Dhingra went door to door on Wednesday in Duvall, a growing outer suburb built across rolling farmlands, some voters sounded eager to repudiate Republicans. Patty Andrus, a retired special education teacher, described Ms. Dhingra’s campaign as a corrective to Mr. Trump’s election.

With a Democratic takeover in Washington State, she said, “I would stand up taller.”

Even some Republican-leaning voters who back Ms. Englund say they are uneasy about Mr. Trump. “She seems sensible and levelheaded,” Ed Whitehead, the retired owner of a printing company, said of Ms. Englund after she stopped at his door in Sammamish.

Mr. Whitehead, who said he voted for Mr. Trump, said these days he is “not so sure” about the president.

Still, amid their exuberance, Democrats concede it could take time to assemble substantial policy achievements. Should they win, Democrats would be governing with the slimmest possible majority and with just one short legislative session before the next election in 2018. And like Democrats in other parts of the nation, they are divided. In 2013, two Democratic state senators crossed the aisle to caucus with the Republicans, creating a coalition majority, and wounds still linger from the 2016 presidential election, when Senator Bernie Sanders won in the Democratic caucuses but then lost to Hillary Clinton in the primary election.

Ms. Dhingra suggested that the session might become mainly a chance for Democrats to prove themselves responsible, rather than as a lunge toward California-like status. The Democratic caucus, she noted, is not homogeneous: “You have rural-area Democrats who have different priorities.”

Mr. Inslee, too, said Democrats should temper their expectations, even as he made plain his excitement about governing with a freer hand.

“There’s diversity of views in all caucuses, and so nothing’s guaranteed in life,” Mr. Inslee said. “But what this does is, it takes the shackles off the doors.”","Poised for West Coast Dominance, Democrats Eye Grand Agenda",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/washington-state-west-politics-democrats.html

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

Two days after a pickup truck struck and killed eight people in Lower Manhattan in what the authorities called a terrorist attack, runners preparing for the New York City Marathon on Sunday sought to beat back anxiety as the police announced additional security measures.

Competitors picking up their race materials on Thursday chatted excitedly about the course and the doughnuts, beer, pizza and other rewards they would treat themselves to after they crossed the finish line.

But many also admitted that the attack, which occurred on a bike path along the Hudson River, rattled them and left them hoping race organizers and the police were doing everything possible to keep the event safe.

Paul L. Wachtel, of the City College of New York, called Dr. Minuchin “one of the founders of family therapy.” Discussing that branch of psychiatry in his review, also in The Times Book Review, of “Institutionalizing Madness: Families, Therapy and Society” (1989, with Joel Elizur), Professor Wachtel invoked the “no man is an island” metaphor.

“Family therapists,” he wrote, “are disciples not so much of Freud as of John Donne.”

Dr. Minuchin explored what he called psychosomatic families, finding that their common characteristics included avoidance of conflict and an ostensible civility that masked submerged anger.

A child may become anorexic as a result of rifts between her parents, he said in 1974. “So the child doesn’t fight; she doesn’t say, ‘No, I won’t,’ ” he explained. “She just doesn’t eat.”

He added: “We work with the family to get their conflicts out into the open, so that everybody can see that their problem isn’t that they have a little girl who won’t eat, but that the family is enmeshed — they are all into each other’s lives so much that the system simply can’t work. The children have no rights as children; the parents have no rights as parents.”

Dr. Minuchin said it made no sense to blame parents for their children’s psychosomatic disorders.

“There’s no perfect family; it’s a myth,” he said. “One set of circumstances might lead to an anorexic child, another to a depressive. Perfect parenting is an impossible thing, like being a perfect president or something like that. It’s trying to do good through a series of mistakes. It’s part of the human condition.

“No one,” he added, “knows how to do it right.”

Dr. Minuchin, a son of Jewish immigrants from Russia, was born on Oct. 13, 1921, in San Salvador de Jujuy, Argentina, north of Buenos Aires. His father, Mauricio, owned a small store and, after it failed during the Depression, herded horses. His mother was the former Clara Tolachier.

Salvador Minuchin was inspired to help young delinquents after a high school teacher, quoting the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, described them as victims of society. He later became active in leftist protests opposing the military government’s seizure of Argentine universities and was jailed for several months.

After earning a medical degree from the National University of Córdoba in Argentina, he enlisted in the Israeli Army during the 1948 war for independence.

Dr. Minuchin studied child psychiatry in the United States with Dr. Nathan Ackerman, who later established what is now the Ackerman Institute for the Family in Manhattan. He returned to Israel to treat Holocaust orphans and children displaced by wars, then came back to New York to train in psychoanalysis at the William Alanson White Institute.

He went on to work as a child psychiatrist at the Wiltwyck School for delinquent boys in the Hudson Valley, where he developed his theory of what became known as structural family therapy. He recounted his experiences with several co-authors in “Families of the Slums” (1967).

In the mid-1960s, Dr. Minuchin was the director of psychiatry at Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia, director of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.

He retired as the clinic’s director in 1975 and served as director emeritus and head of training until 1983.

LONDON — Saudi Arabia announced the arrest on Saturday night of the prominent billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, plus at least 10 other princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers.

The announcement of the arrests was made over Al Arabiya, the Saudi-owned satellite network whose broadcasts are officially approved. Prince Alwaleed’s arrest is sure to send shock waves both through the kingdom and the world’s major financial centers.

He controls the investment firm Kingdom Holding and is one of the world’s richest men, owning or having owned major stakes in News Corp, Citigroup, Apple, Twitter and many other well-known companies. The prince also controls satellite television networks watched across the Arab world.

The sweeping campaign of arrests appears to be the latest move to consolidate the power of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , the favorite son and top adviser of King Salman.

At 32, the crown prince is already the dominant voice in Saudi military, foreign, economic and social policies, stirring murmurs of discontent in the royal family that he has amassed too much personal power, and at a remarkably young age.

The king had decreed the creation of a powerful new anti-corruption committee, headed by the crown prince, only hours before the committee ordered the arrests.

Al Arabiya said that the anticorruption committee has the right to investigate, arrest, ban from travel, or freeze the assets of anyone it deems corrupt.

The Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, the de facto royal hotel, was evacuated on Saturday, stirring rumors that it would be used to house detained royals. The airport for private planes was closed, arousing speculation that the crown prince was seeking to block rich businessmen from fleeing before more arrests.

Prince Alwaleed was giving interviews to the Western news media as recently as late last month about subjects like so-called crypto currencies and Saudi Arabia’s plans for a public offering of shares in its state oil company, Aramco.

He has also recently sparred publicly with President Donald J. Trump. The prince was part of a group of investors who bought control of the Plaza Hotel in New York from Mr. Trump, and he also bought an expensive yacht from him as well. But in a twitter message in 2015 the prince called Mr. Trump “a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.”

Mr. Trump fired back, also on Twitter, that “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money.”

As president, Mr. Trump has developed a warm, mutually supportive relationship with the ascendant crown prince, who has rocketed from near obscurity in recent years to taking control of the country’s most important functions.

But his swift rise has also divided Saudis. Many applaud his vision, crediting him with addressing the economic problems facing the kingdom and laying out a plan to move beyond its dependence on oil.

Others see him as brash, power-hungry and inexperienced, and they resent him for bypassing his elder relatives and concentrating so much power in one branch of the family.

At least three senior White House officials, including the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were reportedly in Saudi Arabia last month for meetings that were undisclosed at the time.

Before sparring with Mr. Trump, Prince Alwaleed was publicly rebuffed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who rejected his $10 million donation for the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York because the prince had also criticized American foreign policy.

As powerful as the billionaire is, he is something of an outsider within the royal family — not a dissident, but an unusually outspoken figure on a variety of issues. He openly supported women driving long before the kingdom said it would grant them the right to do so , and he has long employed women in his orbit.

In 2015 he pledged to donate his fortune of $32 billion to charity after his death. It was unclear Saturday whether Saudi Arabia’s corruption committee might seek to confiscate any of his assets.

Saudi Arabia is an executive monarchy without a written Constitution or independent government institutions like a Parliament or courts, so accusations of corruption are difficult to evaluate. The boundaries between the public funds and the wealth of the royal family are murky at best, and corruption, as other countries would describe it, is believed to be widespread.

The arrests came a few hours after the king replaced the minister in charge of the Saudi national guard, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, who controlled the last of the three Saudi armed forces not yet considered to be under control of the crown prince.

The king named Crown Prince Mohammed the minister of defense in 2015. Earlier this year, the king removed Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as head of the interior ministry, placing him under house arrest and extending the crown prince’s influence over the interior ministry’s troops, which act as a second armed force.

Rumors have swirled since then that King Salman and his favorite son would soon move against Prince Mutaib, commander of the third armed force and himself a former contender for the crown.

Soon I started looking for him whenever I arrived. If I saw him approaching the bar, I would pour his drink, anticipating his order, and watch his face light up when I pushed it toward him. He must have eavesdropped too, because he started calling me by name, waiting for me if I was serving someone else and hanging around after I had served him.

When I collected beer glasses, he would lope up behind me and put his chin on my shoulder like an overgrown puppy. I would turn my head and kiss him on the cheek, his eyes would crinkle into a smile, and then he would swing around on his crutches and head back to his friends. If he was sitting on a bar stool and I walked past, he would put one arm out and catch me by the waist.

“Nicky, my adorable!” he would say.

“Mikey, my beautiful!” I would reply.

I would ruffle his nonexistent hair, and he would grin bashfully and let me go. He never asked anything more of me. It was the gentlest friendship I had ever experienced.

When he returned to the hospital for more operations, I visited him. I would sneak in joints and we would sit on the fire escape, smoking. I never asked him about the cancer, the operations or his prognosis. I didn’t want to be nosy; I figured he would tell me what he wanted to, and the rest was his business.

One evening the landlord of the pub threw a fund-raising event for cancer research. First prize in the raffle was dinner for two at a Michelin-starred restaurant. By accident or design, Mikey won it. At the end of the evening, he hopped up to me, put his arm around my waist and whispered into my ear, “Will you come with me?”

I saved my tip money so we could take a taxi to the restaurant. Formal attire was required, so Mikey dug out a tie and an outrageous purple and green plaid suit, which he wore with the trouser leg tucked into his waistband to hide his stump. The restaurant was filled with dapper-looking businessmen dining in bored composure with clients or wives.

Mikey and I felt spot-lit in the middle of the room — the skinny blond chick in a floaty goth dress with multiple ear piercings, and the dude in the loud suit with half a leg. It was obvious we didn’t belong, and we milked it for all it was worth.

The waiters gave us special treatment, perhaps relieved by the break in the monotony, showering us with attention as if aware that this was a once-in-a-lifetime event, which it was. The meal was seven courses, throughout which a jazz band played on the far side of an empty dance floor.

“Do you think anyone ever actually dances?” Mikey said after we finished dessert.

“I shouldn’t think so,” I replied, looking around at the formality of the patrons, who were studiously ignoring both the jazz band and the waiters, as if displaying any interest might betray a lack of savoir-faire.

“Would you like to dance?” Mikey asked, a gleam in his eye.

“Can you?”

“If you don’t mind holding me up.”

I followed him to the dance floor, where he handed his crutches to a waiter. The sleepy jazz band perked up. Mikey put his arms around my shoulders and leaned heavily on me, and the two of us made slow, three-legged progress around the floor, hugging each other to keep our balance.

Everybody watched us while pretending not to. I giggled, feeling like we were in a movie. Mikey looked like he was on the greatest adventure of his life, and I felt happier than I have ever felt, before or since, while dancing with a man.

In the taxi afterward, just before he dropped me home, Mikey kissed me on the lips. His mouth was soft and cushiony. When I pulled back, he looked at me with an expression I couldn’t quite interpret — a combination, perhaps, of respect and regret.

Mikey asked me out a second time, to a party some friends of his were giving at their house. I went but felt awkward all evening, as if I were an impostor. These people had known Mikey forever, and I was taking him away when there seemed to be a tacit need for them to spend as much time with him as possible.

I left feeling as if my presence in Mikey’s life had been an intrusion. Unable to label what I was to him, and certain I was monopolizing his attention unfairly, I pulled back.

Another guy started drinking nightly at the pub; this one who wore a bandanna like a pirate and rode a motorcycle. I wanted to learn how to ride a motorcycle, so this seemed like a good enough reason to start dating him.

I didn’t explain this new relationship to Mikey, nor did he ask.

When I turned 21 later that year, I gave a birthday party to which Mikey came. He caught me alone during the course of the evening, while the biker was occupied buying pints at the bar.

“I bought this for you,” he said, handing me a small black jewelry box. Inside was a gold pin in the shape of a tiger with diamonds for eyes. I opened and closed my mouth, unable to find any words.

“I want to give you my blessing,” Mikey said. “You have my blessing.”

A few months later Mikey died. I didn’t go to the funeral because I was unsure of his friends’ feelings toward me. I was just some girl who had trespassed out from behind the bar, who had briefly become something unnamable in Mikey’s life.

I didn’t believe I had the right to grieve for someone who had not quite been my friend, not quite my boyfriend, not quite anything I could put a label on. I felt ashamed and embarrassed, but I couldn’t articulate why.

Twenty years later I went back to the pub, hoping to discover where Mikey had been buried. I wanted to tell him I had loved him but hadn’t known how to have platonic love with a man. I wanted to apologize for coming into his life with my mixed signals so soon before he died.

I wanted to tell him I wished I had been brave enough to ask questions about how he felt, what he was going through, how I could be a friend to him. I wanted to say I was sorry if anything I had done, or any way I had behaved, had hurt him. I wanted to ask him to forgive me for being so young, so thoughtless, so insecure, so naïve.

But the pub had changed ownership and nobody had heard of a kid named Mikey who loped around on one leg, a boy with a ready smile and sweet heart. A boy who makes me cry even when I think of him now.","Recognizing What They Had, 20 Years Too Late",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/style/modern-love-recognizing-what-they-had-20-years-too-late.html

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job.","Take the median lifetime earnings of business majors, the most popular undergraduate degree. The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”",Six Myths About Choosing a College Major,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/choosing-a-college-major.html

For the most part, Americans don’t see the need for an advanced degree when there are so many professional opportunities waiting for them. For some, the price is just too high when they have so much student debt already.

“You can believe that U.S. bachelor’s students, if they’re good, can go get a job at Microsoft or Google with a bachelor’s degree,” said Edward D. Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington.

Hadi Partovi, a tech investor, received his master’s in computer science from Harvard in the 1990s. His roommate did not. They both got job offers from the same company. “Master’s grads are valued more, but not enough more for American students to get a master’s degree,” said Mr. Partovi, a founder of Code.org, a nonprofit that promotes computer science in grade school and high school.

Universities and employers are eager to tap the pool of international talent that helps them stay competitive globally, and graduate programs have a financial incentive in attracting them: Demand from abroad is so high, administrators don’t see a need to offer as much tuition assistance.

There’s concern, though, that the current climate around immigration could jeopardize that flow of talent. Incidents of xenophobia, hostile political rhetoric and President Trump’s attempts at banning travelers from some Muslim-majority countries may be weighing on the minds of potential applicants.

The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, for example, saw a 30 percent decrease in international applications to its professional master’s program for this semester, according to the dean, Joseph J. Helble. Dr. Helble surveyed more than two dozen engineering deans earlier this year, and three quarters of them said they, too, had seen significant drops in international graduate applications. But enrollment, he said, was not off.

Still, trends are not clear.

“If there are one or two more years of comparable 20 to 30 percent decreases in international applications, we’re very concerned about our ability to conduct research and spin off and start companies,” he said. “We’re concerned from a competitive perspective.”

Dan Spaulding, who oversees human resources at Zillow Group, the online real estate company, said that in specialized areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, his company favors graduate degrees, but for the vast majority of its technical jobs, a bachelor’s degree in computer science is adequate. He said he has heard concerns from students and managers about an international chill, but for now the supply of students with computer science skills hasn’t been affected.

“A great many of them are coming in with programming skills first and looking to radiate out into other business disciplines, product management, product design,” he said. “I just think going deep academically is not a priority for as many computer science students today.”

In 1994, only about 40 percent of students who were enrolled in computer science Ph.D. programs were from outside the country, according to the Computing Research Association survey.

As the economy improved, the percentage of Americans in graduate programs dropped. “Going to grad school became less of a priority for so many students,” said Stuart Zweben, co-author of the survey and professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University. “You had to really be interested in research or something special.”

The balance of computer science graduate programs began to tilt toward so-called nonresident aliens in the late 1990s, when well-capitalized dot-coms began scouring for programmers, sometimes encouraging summer interns to drop out of school, Dr. Zweben said.

Students from other countries have long seen graduate school as their best path to employment and residency in the United States, and for the industry connections they are not likely to find in their home countries.

“It’s easier to get access from here,” said Ms. Joshi, who is president of the N.Y.U. finance club. She wanted to attend N.Y.U. so she could merge her background in information technology with her interest in the financial industry. She has regular exposure to industry speakers and recruiters.

Her decision paid off. Ms. Joshi, 25, has accepted an offer to work in risk management at American Express once she completes her master’s. She will apply for Optional Practical Training, a program that allows her to work in the United States for a year, with an option of extending her stay for up to another 24 months.It will be up to her employer whether it wants to sponsor her for an H1-B visa after that, allowing her to stay longer. President Trump has ordered a review of the H1-B program, and floated the idea of adjusting the current lottery system to favor higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.

The Tandon School recently started “A Bridge to N.Y.U. Tandon,” aimed at preparing students with non-STEM backgrounds like liberal arts for master’s programs. Katepalli R. Sreenivasan, the dean, believes this could attract Americans who have not yet found decent jobs.

Like Rachel, he reads lips. Communicating on the phone with a deaf person is often not ideal, so we used video chat or email to correspond and give creative notes. I went to London to work with James and his colleagues for a few days, and interacting in person helped our process — but I could say that about any collaboration.

“When I work with voice-over, I’m hardly ever able to work out what’s being said from the voice track alone,” James explained. “I can hear when something is being said, but not so much what is being said. So I use a combination of the audio track, the transcript with timings, and timeline markers. The audio waveform, which I can see on the computer screen, helps me to sync things up. If I still can’t work it out, there’s usually a friendly producer nearby who can help me fill in the gaps.”

At one point, before we had a crucial sound cue built in, James threw in some sound cues himself, but the volume levels were really loud so he could hear them. When we watched and listened to that version together, the hearing collaborators dove for the volume. We all laughed about it and James apologized, but it taught us a lesson: James’s sound cues were the only ones we felt as well as heard. That mattered for our sound design. In the moment when Rachel’s cochlear implants are turned on, we aimed to have a sound cue that jolted us physically.

We also wanted an acoustically extraordinary setting. Since there is a detail in Rachel’s op-ed about her first experiences hearing live music after getting her implant, we asked her where those experiences happened and which ones were the most impactful. The Santa Fe Opera, near her home in New Mexico, was at the top of her list. It generously opened its doors, and the back wall of its open-air stage, so we could film Rachel there with a twilit desert backdrop.

While the animations were being developed, we landed a partnership with the technical wizards at Lytro to create our live-action scenes. Their light field technology can bring an extraordinary amount of depth and detail to a virtual reality image. The biggest VR camera we use regularly at The Times is about the size of a basketball. Lytro’s camera is the size of a sumo wrestler. It gathers about 475 times more visual information than we do for a standard VR piece. Lytro’s system also features Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF), which enables the viewer in aheadset to move around within the piece. If you are standing in front of a person, you can close the distance to them or step farther away. If you are watching an animation, you can crouch down or swivel to the side to see what the image looks like from a different angle. This freedom of movement increases the sense that you are right there with Rachel. It’s what we call “presence” — the magic of VR.

During this process, we were also working closely with Brendan Baker, a sound designer whom I knew from his work on the podcast “Love + Radio,” which is known for its innovative use of sound in storytelling. I thought of him as the mad scientist of the podcast world, which was exactly what we needed to create a sound design that could accurately represent the sounds that Rachel was hearing when she first turned on her cochlear implant. The production company Q Department came in on the back end to spatialize the sound design so the sound would adjust as you moved your head in the headset.

When Rachel got that playlist from her friends, she was trying to do something she hadn’t done before: hear music. In working on this piece, we were trying to do some things we hadn’t done before. We were trying to create a VR piece that was animated, that incorporated new 6DoF technologies and that told Rachel’s story with the depth and sensitivity it deserved. In the VR department, our jobs are the most exciting when we can use a new technology to shine a light on an important story.

Regina LaBelle, who was chief of staff in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Barack Obama, said the recommendations recognized “the importance of proper and appropriate treatments” for addiction, particularly medications that help people avoid cravings and symptoms of withdrawal. But, she added, “There needs to be more funding for this.”

The head of the commission, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, suggested in a television interview Sunday that Mr. Trump would soon ask Congress to allocate far more money for fighting the nation’s addiction problem. “I would say that you’re going to see this president initially ask for billions of dollars to deal with this,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”

The White House issued a statement thanking the commission and saying it would review the recommendations.

It is hard to determine how much money is truly needed. When Senate Republicans added $45 billion in addiction treatment funds to an Obamacare repeal bill that ultimately failed, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, said that amount was akin to “spitting in the ocean.”

More Reporting on Opioids

Richard Frank, a health economics professor at Harvard Medical School who worked in the Obama administration, estimated that it could cost roughly $10 billion a year to provide medication and counseling to everyone with opioid use disorder who is not already in treatment. Treating opioid-dependent newborns, meeting the needs of children in foster care because of their parents’ addiction and treating hepatitis C and other illnesses common among opioid addicts would cost “many billions more,” Mr. Frank said.

Mr. Frank also cautioned that block grants would not work if the administration decided to include federal Medicaid funding for addiction treatment in them. “When one starts to carve out certain services as grants, as opposed to insurance funding, one undermines the insurance,” he said. “It is a method of killing Medicaid with 1,000 nicks.”

Some of the commission’s other recommendations included making it easier for states to share data from prescription drug monitoring programs, which are electronic databases that track opioid prescriptions, and requiring more doctors to check the databases for signs of “doctor shopping” before giving a patient opioids.

The commission encouraged the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to review policies that it claimed discouraged hospitals and doctors from prescribing alternatives to opioids, especially after surgery. According to the commission’s report, C.M.S. pays a flat, “bundled” payment to hospitals after patients undergo surgery, which includes treatment for pain. Because they get a flat fee, hospitals are encouraged to use cheap products – and most opioid medications are generic and inexpensive.

“Purchasing and administering a non-opioid medication in the operating room increases the hospital’s expenses without a corresponding increase in reimbursement payment,” the report said.

More broadly, the report said the federal government as well as private insurers should do a better job of covering a range of pain-management and treatment services, such as non-opioid medications, physical therapy and counseling. And it recommended that the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies eliminate any reimbursement policies that limit access to addiction medications and other types of treatment, including prior authorization requirements and policies that require patients to try and fail with one kind treatment before getting access to another.

One prevention measure the commission did not embrace is expanding syringe exchange programs, which public health experts say save money and lives by reducing the spread of H.I.V. and hepatitis C with contaminated syringes.

“I was hoping to see that in this report,” Ms. LaBelle said.

The commission’s members – Mr. Christie, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican; Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat; Pam Bondi, the Republican attorney general of Florida; Patrick Kennedy, a former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island and Bertha Madras, a Harvard professor – all voted for the final recommendations, which came about a month later than expected.

His voice quaking with emotion, Mr. Kennedy said during the commission’s meeting Wednesday that Congress needed to appropriate sufficient funds for the initiative, suggesting at least $10 billion.

”This town doesn’t react unless it hears from real people“ who will vote in the next election, he said, nodding to guests who had testified about their families’ searing experiences with addiction, stigma, lack of treatment options and the refusal of insurance companies to cover treatment.

Mr. Kennedy also noted that insurance coverage is crucial to fighting addiction; in another commission meeting earlier this year, he took Republicans to task for working to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut Medicaid.",Panel Recommends Opioid Solutions but Puts No Price Tag on Them,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/health/opioids-trump-commission.html

We spend time ruminating on how to get ourselves unstuck and then, as if by magic, we figure it out and the puzzle falls for us. That’s a good feeling.

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

But that last sentence in the instructions bothered me: “When the puzzle is done, six familiar 15-letter phrases will read through the openings across and down.” What could that mean? I stared at my mostly finished grid and then I saw it. Running down the center of the grid was the phrase HEAVY METAL BANDS. And across the center of the top three grids was POINT BLANK RANGE.

O.K., Mr. Arbesfeld, now I’ve got you. Across the middle of my grid, I had ___ OPTIC CABLE, so I filled in FIBER across the middle of grid No. 4. Sure enough, it was an answer and I conquered that grid.

Since this is the first appearance of a Walls and Doors puzzle, I asked Mr. Arbesfeld to tell me a bit about how it came to be:

Constructor Notes

I got the idea initially from a Sunday puzzle back in January called “Rolling in the Aisles,” in which the word HA was used as a rebus for Down clues, but yet blocked off from the accompanying Across clues. It seemed to me that the Across clues had walls, while the Down clues had doors. I think this also struck a chord for me because of the 2016 election, in which one candidate talked of building walls while the other wanted to open doors. And finally, there’s a Jackson Browne song I love with the same title. I initially created it in a more traditional crossword puzzle manner for a Thursday, but found that it was too easy. So then I hit upon the idea of making each of the nine 5x5 sections its own puzzle, with the six interlocking 15-letter entries running through. This seemed much more suitable as a Sunday Variety puzzle, so I presented it to Will Shortz as such.

I really enjoyed this puzzle, with its roller coaster ride of mulling over clues and conquering grids. I would definitely do one of these again.",Variety Puzzle: Walls and Doors,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/crosswords/variety-puzzle-walls-and-doors.html

“Everyone says how great we’ve managed doing a long-distance relationship, but it’s been extremely hard and painful,” Ms. Spagnola said.","“I was mesmerized by the best-looking guy I’d ever seen,” she said. “I told my friends, ‘We have to go over there now.’ I quickly retreated to my cabin, did a beauty transformation and went with my friends to Guido’s boat.”

Mr. Wolff was equally charmed. “She wore a captain’s hat and a green bikini,” he said. “I knew she was the pretty girl that people wanted to talk to, so I left her a little space.”

Hours later, the two boats traveled together to the evening activity, which was a party at Fort George, an abandoned castle overlooking the Adriatic Sea. “Her table was next to mine,” Mr. Wolff said. “I was so attracted to her. I never lost sight of her.”

They drank and danced, and at midnight they kissed. “I remember looking out onto the crowd, being very happy, and thinking this is exactly where I want to be,” Ms. Spagnola said. “Kissing him felt very special.”

It was that kind of special that transcended back to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, where Ms. Spagnola was living while finishing her law degree at Brooklyn Law School. Her mother visited the day after she returned home.

“I didn’t think she would meet anyone, it was a singles trip, and she went with friends,” said Victoria Spagnola, 57. “But she couldn’t stop talking about this man she met. She was 100 percent sure she loved him. She had boyfriends before, but she had never spoken about anyone the way she was speaking about Guido. When she said he was from Amsterdam, I thought, ‘How are they going to do this? Is it just vacation thing? Who is going to move where?’”

Photo

And thus, problem No. 1: location. Ms. Spagnola grew up in Todt Hill, Staten Island. Her parents also own an apartment in Murray Hill in Manhattan. Her mother is a retired accountant, and her father, Fred Spagnola, 58, is a financial adviser for UBS. She and her brother, who went to school in Manhattan, had strong ties to New York. Moving to Amsterdam for love seemed impulsive.

Mr. Wolff grew up in Abcoude, a small town in the Netherlands, until he was 4. Then he moved to Madrid with his older brother and parents. “My mother was a homemaker and my father was the C.E.O. of a record label,” he said. They returned to his hometown six years later, and by then there were four Wolff children.

Still love has a way of steering the ship, so to speak, and after that first kiss, the couple’s course was set.

When the night was over, they departed to their separate yachts, hoping they would continue finding each other along the same route and schedule.

“I was the captain of our boat and in charge of docking the ship,” he said. “I’d always be looking for hers and park as close to hers as possible. Somehow we end up finding each other at every party.”

Except for the final night, which was filled with mishaps. Each thought the other was going to a specific event and, without cellphone reception, there was no way to connect.

“I was so upset I couldn’t find him,” Ms. Spagnola said.

Mr. Wolff was at another party looking for her.

“We didn’t have any goodbye or closure,” she said. “I didn’t have his phone number. I wasn’t sure how he spelled his first name. All I remembered was Wolff had two Fs.”

Photo

Upon arriving home, though, she saw that Mr. Wolff had sent her a message on Facebook.

“I was really sad about not saying goodbye,” Mr. Wolff said. “On the last day, every boat goes back to their original harbor. Ours weren’t together. When I arrived back in Amsterdam, I looked at Yacht Week’s app, which was connected to Facebook. I went through 500 photos looking for her, none of which had names on them, but I found her.”

His message, according to Ms. Spagnola, read: “If we didn’t say a proper goodbye, then it wasn’t a goodbye.”

She replied, and phone numbers were exchanged. The next several days turned into a texting frenzy. Then came the phone calls and Skyping. Two months later, Mr. Wolff was visiting her in New York.

“You always have to be cautious with your heart, but I didn’t want any regrets not following it,” he said. “I might as well go and see if she felt the same.”

Ms. Spagnola did. “When I saw him again, I knew I was looking at the man I would marry,” she said. “It was one of the happiest weeks of my life.”

Mr. Wolff stayed with Ms. Spagnola for 10 days, during which time they each said “I love you.” The two also went to see a lawyer who informed them about visas, immigration laws and working internationally.

Their desire to be with each other superseded the obvious roadblocks.

In November 2013, she visited him in the Netherlands, and again for the New Year’s holiday. In March 2014, Mr. Wolff stayed with her for three months. That October, Ms. Spagnola passed the bar and Mr. Wolff visited to celebrate.

“They were so committed to each other from the start,” the bride’s mother said. “It was true love. You could see it. They looked at each other like no one else was in the room.”

But the couple understood they would not often actually be in the same room, let alone live together full time.

“I lived in constant fear we wouldn’t be together,” Mr. Wolff said. “There’s also the fear of not knowing when you’ll see the other person or that you’ll lose them because they’re not in the same city or even the same country with you.”

Ms. Spagnola felt similarly. “I never knew you could miss someone so much that it caused physical pain,” she said. “Guido had unwavering confidence in us and the value of our love.”

In December 2013, Mr. Wolff obtained a sales job with a denim company that would sponsor him to work in the United States.

The couple found an apartment in Williamsburg.

On a cold, foggy day in February 2015, while walking on the Brooklyn Promenade, Mr. Wolff dropped to one knee and proposed with a diamond ring he had designed.

“Even though we spent so much time being separated, I wanted her to know this was forever,” he said.

Things seemed to be going well until that September, when Mr. Wolff, who planned to study for an M.B.A., received a scholarship to Hotelschool The Hague, one of the best hospitality schools in the world, in Amsterdam.

He was hesitant to leave. “When you only get to be with someone for a week or two at a time, there’s the fear you won’t get a chance to really know them because you’re only seeing them for such short periods,” he said. “We never got to have a normal rhythm of life. I wasn’t sure leaving would be the best thing for our relationship.”

Photo

Ms. Spagnola refused to let him miss the opportunity. “It was an 18-month program,” she said. “I knew he couldn’t pass it up, so I really encouraged him to take it. ”

For the next four months the couple fell back into a long-distance relationship, each visiting the other monthly. In January 2016, Ms. Spagnola, unable to live without him, found work by persuading a law firm that it needed an international person in its Amsterdam location. Another visa, this time for her, was obtained.

“Everyone told me not to go, but I would have regretted not meeting the people who made him the person that I love,” she said.

After a year, Ms. Spagnola was unfulfilled with her job. Knowing that Mr. Wolff would return to New York after graduating from school in September, she came home in May 2017. Mr. Wolff was able to secure a job in New York as an account executive at Harver, a Dutch technology company.

“Everyone says how great we’ve managed doing a long-distance relationship, but it’s been extremely hard and painful,” Ms. Spagnola said.

Eduard Sabbagh, who was part of the groom’s boat and a guest at the wedding, saw the couple’s determination from the beginning. “Within a week the relationship escalated very quickly,” he said. “It was difficult, but they did it. If Guido sets his mind to something, he’ll figure it out. They’re very similar in that respect.”

The couple were married Oct. 7 before 190 guests at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan. The Rev. Andrew King, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony.

Later in the evening, guest were greeted by two trumpeters in medieval attire at the Metropolitan Club on 60th Street. The couple’s 15 bridesmaids and groomsmen descended the grand stairwell of the club, and then waited as the newly Mr. and Mrs. Wolff entered the reception.

“They were instantly drawn to each other,” said Morgan Manousos, who was on the bride’s boat when the couple first met. “It didn’t matter there was an ocean between them and different continents, they both love fiercely.”

Indeed, in the last four years, between the two of them, they have taken the eight-hour flight between New York and Amsterdam more than 35 times.

I’d never read an “Odyssey” that sounded like this. It had such directness, the lines feeling not as if they were being fed into iambic pentameter because of some strategic decision but because the meter was a natural mode for its speaker. The subtle sewing through of the fittingly wavelike W-words in the first half (“wandered ... wrecked ... where ... worked”) and the stormy S-words that knit together the second half, marrying the waves to the storm in which this man will suffer, made the terse injunctions to the muse that frame this prologue to the poem (“Tell me about ...” and “Find the beginning”) seem as if they might actually answer the puzzle posed by Homer’s polytropos and Odysseus’s complicated nature.

Complicated: the brilliance of Wilson’s choice is, in part, its seeming straightforwardness. But no less than that of polytropos, the etymology of “complicated” is revealing. From the Latin verb complicare, it means “to fold together.” No, we don’t think of that root when we call someone complicated, but it’s what we mean: that they’re compound, several things folded into one, difficult to unravel, pull apart, understand.

“It feels,” I told Wilson, “with your choice of ‘complicated,’ that you planted a flag.”

“It is a flag,” she said.

“It says, ‘Guess what?’ — ”

“ ‘ — this is different.’ ”

Although translation might seem a natural step for a scholar preoccupied by the connections between antiquity and later texts, Wilson was dissuaded from pursuing it. “My colleagues told me: ‘You really shouldn’t be doing that kind of thing before tenure. Before tenure you have to write, you know, the right kind of book’ ” — the right kind being one on a subject that your discipline has yet to exhaust. Wilson did write a range of books before tenure, most on canonical texts: her study of suffering and death in literature; a monograph on Socrates. But, not heeding her colleagues’ advice, she began to translate Greek and Roman tragedies. A selection of Seneca’s plays appeared in 2010; four plays by Euripides in 2016. Both projects were outgrowths of her old desire to “spend a little bit longer” with these authors.

I asked Wilson why translation isn’t valued in the academy.

“Because there is no perception that it’s serious intellectually. It’s imagined as a subset of outreach. That you’re going to be communicating with the masses, which is less important than being innovative within your field. And even though I think translation is a way of being innovative within your field, my colleagues don’t see it that way.”

Photo

One way of talking about Wilson’s translation of the “Odyssey” is to say that it makes a sustained campaign against that species of scholarly shortsightedness: finding equivalents in English that allow the terms she is choosing to do the same work as the original words, even if the English words are not, according to a Greek lexicon, “correct.”

“What gets us to ‘complicated,’ ” Wilson said, returning to her translation of polytropos, “is both that I think it has some hint of the original ambivalence and ambiguity, such that it’s both ‘Why is he complicated?’ ‘What experiences have formed him?’ which is a very modern kind of question — and hints at ‘There might be a problem with him.’ I wanted to make it a markedly modern term in a way that ‘much turning’ obviously doesn’t feel modern or like English. I wanted it to feel like an idiomatic thing that you might say about somebody: that he is complicated.”

I asked: “What about the commentator who says, ‘It does something that more than modernizes — it subverts the fundamental strangeness of the way Odysseus is characterized.’ I’m sure some classicists are going to say it’s flat out wrong, ‘Interesting, but wrong.’ ”

“You’re quite right,” she replied. “Reviewers will say that.”

How, I asked, would she address such a complaint from someone in her field?

“I struggle with this all the time,” Wilson said. “I struggled with this because there are those classicists. I partly just want to shake them and make them see that all translations are interpretations.” Most of the criticism Wilson expects, she says, will come from “a digging in of the heels: ‘That’s not what it says in the dictionary, and therefore it can’t be right!’ And if you put down anything other than what’s said in the dictionary, then, of course, you have to add a footnote explaining why, which means that pretty much every line has to have a footnote. ...” Wilson paused. “That goes to what this translation is aiming to do in terms of an immersive reading experience and conveying a whole narrative. I don’t know what to say to those people, honestly.” Wilson laughed her buoyant laugh. “I need to have a better answer to them, because they will certainly review it, and they will certainly have a loud voice. They just seem to be coming from such a simple and fundamental misunderstanding.”

“Of what?”

“Of what any translation is doing.”

What a translation is doing — and what it should do — has been a source of vigorous debate since there were texts to translate. “I’m not a believer,” Wilson told me, “but I find that there is a sort of religious practice that goes along with translation. I’m trying to serve something.”

Early arguments about translation were over the Old Testament. One tale has it that an Egyptian king of the third-century B.C. wanted a Greek copy of the Pentateuch — the five books of Moses — for the Library of Alexandria. Some 70 Jewish elders said to be “skilled in the Scriptures and in both languages” were sent from Jerusalem. Each worked in a separate room to translate in isolation. When finished, they compared their work. The 70 translations? Identical, “in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end,” according to one account. The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word. Called “Septuagint” after its 70 translators, this Greek version became a foundational text, both for the early Christian church and for the impossible standard to which all subsequent translations are held: faithfulness. Later Bible translators failed to meet that mystical standard. The Catholic Church took 1,200 years to accept Jerome’s Latin version (“tainted with Judaism,” was the charge, as it relied on Hebrew sources). The first English Bible’s translator, John Wycliffe, was disinterred and his bones were burned for the heresy of translating into English, and his successor, William York Tyndale, was excommunicated, sentenced to death by strangulation and burned at the stake.

Although you can understand, if not condone, how murderous rage at a translator might arise if a believer supposed a sacred text to have been desecrated by a translator’s hand, it is somewhat surprising that similar vehemence can greet translations of secular canonical texts. Perhaps the most famous such expression is in Matthew Arnold’s “On Translating Homer,” his series of lectures in 1860 when he was Oxford professor of poetry. In them, he offered a takedown of existing translations of Homer and then asked “in what faithfulness exists”: “The translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities ... that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, that he is eminently noble.”

Most every Homeric translation since has been scrutinized against his quartet of qualities. Wilson is not persuaded.

“These are not good criteria,” Wilson told me. “I think he was a terrible reader of poetry. It’s not like he ever translated Homer. I think he had a good ‘classics major’ undergraduate kind of Greek, but I think it’s all to do with a particular notion of aesthetics and class, the whole ‘plainness and nobility.’ It’s about noblesse oblige and you’re going to be the kind of gentleman who’s going to have gone to Rugby and that will be the kind of language that we speak: the classy kind of language. And projecting all of that back on to the classics. This is what ‘sweetness and light’ is. It’s describing a boys’ club. I think it’s very interesting that’s still with us. Those are the four? It’s just the boys’ club.”

“I do think that gender matters,” Wilson said later, “and I’m not going to not say it’s something I’m grappling with. I’m trying to take this task and this process of responding to this text and creating this text extremely seriously, with whatever I have, linguistically, sonically, emotionally.”

At the center of each of Homer’s epics is a warrior. In the “Iliad,” it is Achilles, the greatest of the Greeks, a demigod almost invulnerable to death. Although the war is begun over a woman, Helen, stolen from her Greek husband by a Trojan, the “Iliad” is a poem about and presided over by men. Zeus is the poem’s prevailing god, and what men do, or are willing to do, in love and war and in the friendships that arise in war and its losses, are the poem’s preoccupations.

In the “Odyssey,” preoccupations shift, radically. Zeus is replaced by Athena as the dominant god of the tale; the poem begins not with Odysseus but with his wife, Penelope, who has been without him for 20 years, in a kingdom overrun by suitors for her hand, whom the conventions of hospitality ensure she cannot simply expel. The reader doesn’t even see Odysseus until the fifth of the poem’s 24 books, where we learn that he has been living on an island with Calypso, a goddess, for seven years; that, earlier, he was detained by another goddess, Circe, with whom he also shared a bed; that the Sirens, as he navigates, call to him, desiring him; that a young princess falls in love with him; that, on all sides, women are temptresses, and whereas he submits, we are to understand that Penelope, alone, assailed, remains faithful.

“In the second-wave feminist scholarship in classics,” Wilson told me, “people were very keen to try to read Penelope as, ‘Let’s find Penelope’s voice in the “Odyssey,” and let’s celebrate her, because look, here she is being the hero in an epic in ways we can somehow unpack.’ I find that’s a little simplistic. What happens to all the unelite women?”

In the episode that Wilson calls “one of the most horrible and haunting of the whole poem,” Odysseus returns home to find that his palace has been overrun by suitors for his wife’s hand. Though she has resisted them, the women in her palace have not. Odysseus, after slaying the suitors, tells his son, Telemachus, to kill the women. It is an interesting injunction from Odysseus, who himself, during his 10 years of wandering, was serially unfaithful. In Robert Fagles’s much-praised translation of the poem, Telemachus says, before he executes the palace women on his father’s command: “No clean death for the likes of them, by god!/Not from me — they showered abuse on my head, my mother’s too!/You sluts — the suitors’ whores!”

But Wilson, in her introduction, reminds us that these palace women — “maidservants” has often been put forward as a “correct” translation of the Greek δμωαι, dmoai, which Wilson calls “an entirely misleading and also not at all literal translation,” the root of the Greek meaning “to overpower, to tame, to subdue” — weren’t free. Rather, they were slaves, and if women, only barely. Young female slaves in a palace would have had little agency to resist the demands of powerful men. Where Fagles wrote “whores” and “the likes of them” — and Lattimore “the creatures” — the original Greek, Wilson explained, is just a feminine definite article meaning “female ones.” To call them “whores” and “creatures” reflects, for Wilson, “a misogynistic agenda”: their translators’ interpretation of how these females would be defined.

They both got job offers from the same company. “Master’s grads are valued more, but not enough more for American students to get a master’s degree,” said Mr. Partovi, a founder of Code.org, a nonprofit that promotes computer science in grade school and high school.

Universities and employers are eager to tap the pool of international talent that helps them stay competitive globally, and graduate programs have a financial incentive in attracting them: Demand from abroad is so high, administrators don’t see a need to offer as much tuition assistance.

There’s concern, though, that the current climate around immigration could jeopardize that flow of talent. Incidents of xenophobia, hostile political rhetoric and President Trump’s attempts at banning travelers from some Muslim-majority countries may be weighing on the minds of potential applicants.

The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, for example, saw a 30 percent decrease in international applications to its professional master’s program for this semester, according to the dean, Joseph J. Helble. Dr. Helble surveyed more than two dozen engineering deans earlier this year, and three quarters of them said they, too, had seen significant drops in international graduate applications. But enrollment, he said, was not off.

Still, trends are not clear.

“If there are one or two more years of comparable 20 to 30 percent decreases in international applications, we’re very concerned about our ability to conduct research and spin off and start companies,” he said. “We’re concerned from a competitive perspective.”

Dan Spaulding, who oversees human resources at Zillow Group, the online real estate company, said that in specialized areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, his company favors graduate degrees, but for the vast majority of its technical jobs, a bachelor’s degree in computer science is adequate. He said he has heard concerns from students and managers about an international chill, but for now the supply of students with computer science skills hasn’t been affected.

“A great many of them are coming in with programming skills first and looking to radiate out into other business disciplines, product management, product design,” he said. “I just think going deep academically is not a priority for as many computer science students today.”

In 1994, only about 40 percent of students who were enrolled in computer science Ph.D. programs were from outside the country, according to the Computing Research Association survey.

As the economy improved, the percentage of Americans in graduate programs dropped. “Going to grad school became less of a priority for so many students,” said Stuart Zweben, co-author of the survey and professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University. “You had to really be interested in research or something special.”

The balance of computer science graduate programs began to tilt toward so-called nonresident aliens in the late 1990s, when well-capitalized dot-coms began scouring for programmers, sometimes encouraging summer interns to drop out of school, Dr. Zweben said.

Students from other countries have long seen graduate school as their best path to employment and residency in the United States, and for the industry connections they are not likely to find in their home countries.

“It’s easier to get access from here,” said Ms. Joshi, who is president of the N.Y.U. finance club. She wanted to attend N.Y.U. so she could merge her background in information technology with her interest in the financial industry. She has regular exposure to industry speakers and recruiters.

Her decision paid off. Ms. Joshi, 25, has accepted an offer to work in risk management at American Express once she completes her master’s. She will apply for Optional Practical Training, a program that allows her to work in the United States for a year, with an option of extending her stay for up to another 24 months.It will be up to her employer whether it wants to sponsor her for an H1-B visa after that, allowing her to stay longer. President Trump has ordered a review of the H1-B program, and floated the idea of adjusting the current lottery system to favor higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.

The Tandon School recently started “A Bridge to N.Y.U. Tandon,” aimed at preparing students with non-STEM backgrounds like liberal arts for master’s programs. Katepalli R. Sreenivasan, the dean, believes this could attract Americans who have not yet found decent jobs.

In some studies, processed red meat in large amounts is associated with an increased relative risk of developing cancer. The absolute risk, however, is often quite small. If I ate an extra serving of bacon a day, every day, my lifetime risk of colon cancer would go up less than one-half of 1 percent. Even then, it’s debatable.

Nevertheless, we’ve become more and more susceptible to arguments that we must avoid certain foods completely. When one panic-du-jour wanes, we find another focus for our fears. We demonized fats. Then cholesterol. Then meat.

For some people in recent years, gluten has become the enemy, even though wheat accounts for about 20 percent of the calories consumed worldwide, more than pretty much any other food. Fewer than 1 percent of people in the United States have a wheat allergy, and fewer than 1 percent have celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that requires sufferers to abstain from gluten. Gluten sensitivity (the catchall disorder that leads many Americans to abstain from gluten) is not well defined, and most people who self-diagnose don’t meet the criteria.

Nonetheless, at least one in five Americans regularly chooses gluten-free foods, according to a 2015 poll. Sales of products with gluten-free labels rose to $23 billion worldwide in 2014, up from $11.5 billion worldwide in 2010.

Gluten-free diets can lead to deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin B, folate and iron. Compared with regular bagels, gluten-free ones can have a quarter more calories, two and a half times the fat, half the fiber and twice the sugar. They also cost more.

The hullabaloo over gluten echoes the panic over MSG that began roughly half a century ago, and which has yet to fully subside. MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is nothing more than a single sodium atom added to glutamic acid — an amino acid that is a key part of the mechanism by which our cells create energy. Without it, all oxygen-dependent life as we know it would die.

A 1968 letter in The New England Journal of Medicine started the frenzy; the writer reported feeling numbness, weakness and palpitations after eating at a Chinese restaurant. A few limited studies followed, along with a spate of news articles. Before long, nutrition experts and consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader were calling for MSG to be banned. The Food and Drug Administration never had to step in; food companies saw the writing on the wall, and dropped MSG voluntarily.

Many people still wrongly believe that MSG is poison. We certainly don’t need MSG in our diet, but we also don’t need to waste effort avoiding it. Our aversion to it shows how susceptible we are to misinterpreting scientific research and how slow we are to update our thinking when better research becomes available. There’s no evidence that people suffer disproportionately from the afflictions — now ranging from headaches to asthma — that MSG-averse cultures commonly associate with this ingredient. In studies all over the world, the case against MSG just doesn’t hold up.

Too often, we fail to think critically about scientific evidence. Genetically modified organisms are perhaps the best example of this.

G.M.O.s are, in theory, one of our best bets for feeding the planet’s growing population. When a 2015 Pew poll asked Americans whether they thought it was generally safe or unsafe to eat modified foods, almost 60 percent said it was unsafe. The same poll asked scientists from the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same question. Only 11 percent of them thought G.M.O.s were unsafe.

Most Americans, at least according to this poll, don’t seem to care what scientists think. In fact, Americans disagree with scientists on this issue more than just about any other, including a host of contentious topics such as vaccines, evolution and even global warming.

If people want to avoid foods, even if there’s no reason to, is that really a problem?

The answer is: yes. Because it makes food scary. And being afraid of food with no real reason is unscientific — part of the dangerous trend of anti-intellectualism that we confront in many places today.

Food should be a cause for pleasure, not panic. For most people, it’s entirely possible to eat more healthfully without living in terror or struggling to avoid certain foods altogether. If there’s one thing you should cut from your diet, it’s fear.","Relax, You Don’t Need to ‘Eat Clean’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/opinion/sunday/relax-you-dont-need-to-eat-clean.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

There are tools that can help. Mr. Campagna organizes projects on Google Drive spreadsheets that he shares with his wife. Smartphone apps like HomeZada and BrightNest can also help you keep tabs on a to-do list that never ends.

Still, you need to know what to do — from the roof down to the basement, and out to the backyard. Here is how to get started.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

CHECK THE EXTERIOR

Start by giving the outside of your house a checkup. Walk around the perimeter and look for cracks in the siding or peeling paint. Are the windowsills in good condition? Check the roof for missing or broken tiles. Fix problems while the days are still relatively warm. After a rainstorm, walk around the house and look for any signs that water might not be draining properly, like pooling water or damaged gutters or downspouts.

“The objective is to get as much of the water away from your house as possible,” said Scott Johnson, the director of operations for WIN Home Inspection, a network of more than 190 home inspection firms in 33 states.

THE GUTTERS

Of all the fall chores, cleaning the gutters and downspouts is among the most critical. Your gutters direct water away from your roof and siding, and down into the drainage system. Clogged gutters can cause your roof to leak and lead to ice dams in cold weather. So clean them or hire someone to do the job after the leaves fall. “When the gutters aren’t kept clean, the moisture just sits on the rooftop,” said Dina Dwyer-Owens, a co-chair of the board of directors of the Dwyer Group, a parent company of home-repair franchises including Mr. Handyman and Mr. Rooter.

Just don’t do the work too soon. Clean the gutters before the last of the leaves fall, and you could find yourself back up on that ladder a few weeks later. “I think I did it a little too early,” said Mr. Campagna of West Orange, N.J., who rushed to clean his gutters before Mrs. Campagna, 30, gave birth to their first child in October. “That was a rookie mistake.” And a wasted Saturday afternoon.

If you plan to do the work yourself, be careful on that ladder. Ladder mishaps sent nearly 176,000 people to the hospital in 2013, according to the National Safety Council. If your ladder has seen better days, consider an upgrade. (These fiberglass models are recommended by Wirecutter, the New York Times’s product review site.)

If you hire a professional, expect to spend around $150 for the job, according to HomeAdvisor.

THE WINDOWS AND DOORS

If you have window air-conditioning units, take them out and store them until next summer. But handle those unwieldy appliances with care to avoid injury.

Or you could leave them in place. Ms. Levy of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, covers the outside of her window units with an insulated sheath and wedges towels between the sill and the unit to keep drafts out.

Next, swap out screens for storm doors and windows. “It’s something that we automatically do when it starts getting cold out,” Ms. Levy said. While you’re changing out the screens for glass, check your windows and doors for drafts. Add weather stripping or caulk wherever cold air seeps in.

SMOKE ALARMS

Three out of five home-fire deaths happen in properties without working smoke alarms, according to the United States Fire Administration. So make sure yours work. Change the batteries in all your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors once a year; the day you set the clocks back is a good one to do it.

Check the manufacturing date, too, and replace any detectors that are more than 10 years old. Any reliable model will do, but if you’re interested in one that will alert you to problems when you’re away, a smart smoke alarm like the Nest Protect is sensitive to slow- and fast-burning fires, and has apps that will alert you anywhere in the world if something’s amiss.

Laundry dryers cause 2,900 home fires a year nationally and failing to clean them is the leading culprit, according to the United States Fire Administration. So call a professional once a year to service your dryer vent and help remove lint, debris and other hazards that could spark a fire.

THE CHIMNEY

Heat, smoke and dangerous gases from your fireplace and heating system travel up your chimney and out of your house, keeping the air inside breathable. A dirty chimney could affect air quality and also pose a fire hazard.

So keep your chimney clean. The Chimney Safety Institute of America recommends having it inspected annually and cleaned as needed. “In general, with chimneys and fireplaces, the more you use it, the more likely you need it to be swept,” said Mr. Johnson, of WIN Home Inspection. Expect to spend between $125 and $200 on a chimney sweep, according to Angie’s List.

THE HEATING SYSTEM

If you were going on a long road trip, you would get your car tuned up before you started your journey, not afterward. The same goes for your heating system. Call a plumber or a furnace repair company to prepare your boiler or furnace for winter before the cold weather arrives.

Your contractor should clean the equipment, make sure it is working properly and let you know if it needs any repairs. “The heating system ain’t going to break down when it’s 80 degrees out,” said Kerry O’Brien, the president of T.F. O’Brien Cooling and Heating in New Hyde Park, N.Y. “You don’t want to be stuck when it’s five degrees in the middle of the night” with a heating system that won’t turn on.

THE PIPES

No one wants a frozen pipe, so keep an eye on yours. Drain the outside water faucets and shut them off before the first freeze. On very cold nights, open cabinets beneath the sink to let warm air in and, if you are especially worried about freezing pipes, let a slow drip of water run through them. Resist the urge to turn down the thermostat to save money – you want to keep the pipes warm. Extreme weather “is not a time to start trying to save on your energy bill,” Mr. O’Brien said. “Crank your heat up during those weeks.”

PUT THE GARDEN TO BED

By November, you may not be thinking much about your hydrangeas, but they still need you. Prune your shrubs and hedges now. Cut foliage away from the house so that ice or snow on the branches won’t damage your siding or let water into your home.

But use restraint, so as not to cut off next spring’s bloom. “Try to contain yourself. Cut back half of what you want to cut back,” said Jan Johnsen, a landscape designer in Mount Kisco, N.Y.

If you have trees on your property, the battle of the leaves may feel endless, but ignore the pile on your lawn and it could mold and suffocate your grass. But before you succumb to the mighty leaf blower and start blasting away, consider a more measured approach. Rake up most of the leaves and use them as mulch for your flower beds. Mow the rest in place with your lawn mower. By mowing over the leaves, you help break them down so they can decompose and feed the grass. All that foliage “is not garbage, it’s black gold,” Ms. Johnsen said. “There’s a reason the leaves fall to the earth.”

THE PATIO

Empty ceramic pots of soil and store them in your garage or basement for the winter so they do not crack in freezing temperatures. Drain the hoses and store them, too. Shut down the sprinkler system and call the pool maintenance company to close up your pool, if you have one. But wait for a crisp sunny to day to cover patio furniture — you don’t want to trap any moisture under the tarp.

STOCK UP ON FIREWOOD

If you plan to build a fire this winter, order seasoned firewood in the fall. Stack it loosely on pallets to keep moisture at bay. Cover the pile with a plastic tarp. You can store wood in an unheated garage, but do not store more than a week’s supply in the house, as the wood could attract insects, according to Michigan State University Extension.

BRACE FOR WINTER WEATHER

If you have a snowblower, check it. You may need to have it serviced, and many local repair companies will pick up and drop off a blower as part of the service. “Start it up, run it for a couple of minutes and make sure it’s O.K.,” said Rich Janow, 74, who has lived in a six-bedroom house in South Orange, N.J., for 32 years with his wife, Nancy Chiller Janow, 64. “Do it now so that if you have a problem and you need the repair people to fix it, you have enough time before the really bad weather sets in.”

If you don’t have a snowblower, now is the best time to buy one, when it’s early in the season. (Wirecutter has some suggestions.)

If you have a portable generator, check that, too. If you don’t have one, now is a good time to consider investing in one. Update your emergency supply kit with flashlights, fresh batteries, a first-aid kit, food, water and a portable radio.

Stock up on Snow Melt and make sure your shovels are in good condition before the weatherman tells you snow is imminent. Make sure the supplies are accessible (and you remember where you put them) before the snow starts falling. Otherwise, you may find yourself digging your way to that shovel.

If the winter is a snowy one, use a roof rake to remove excess snow from your roof, and stay on the lookout for ice dams, accumulations of ice and snow along your eaves that could damage your gutters, roof and siding.

STAY ON TRACK

Learn how your house works and you may find that maintenance is something you actually – gasp — enjoy. “For me, it’s been such a great love affair,” said Judy E. Mendoza, 69, a saleswoman for Halstead who has lived in a three-bedroom house in East Hampton for 27 years and starts preparing for winter in July. “I’ve enjoyed taking care of the house, and the house has taken care of me.”

Imagine a world where power literally flows from women’s hands, where the mere touch of a woman’s fingers can shock, stun and ultimately kill. Naomi Alderman’s new novel, “The Power,” conjures up such a world, and the consequences are electrifying. John Grisham returns with a legal thriller centered on for-profit law schools; James McBride tries his expert hand at short fiction; and Edward St. Aubyn reimagines King Lear as that contemporary version of king, a media mogul.

STICKY FINGERS: The Life and Times of Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone Magazine, by Joe Hagan. (Alfred A. Knopf, $29.95.) Hagan attempts to explain why a mere rock magazine editor — Wenner founded Rolling Stone in San Francisco in 1967 — matters to the history of the 20th century. “Hagan has delivered a supple, confident, dispassionately reported and deeply well-written biography,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “It’s a big book, one that no one will wish longer, but its chapters move past like a crunching collection of singles and not a thumb-sucking double album. It’s a joy to read and feels built to last.”

THE ROOSTER BAR, by John Grisham. (Doubleday, $28.95.) Grisham’s latest legal thriller was inspired by an essay by Paul Campos in The Atlantic condemning the student-entrapping practices of many for-profit law schools. Grisham has translated the ethical and economic issues raised by Campos into a high drama featuring three students who come up with a scheme of their own. Our reviewer Janet Maslin calls it a “buoyant, mischievous” book, written with a sense that “this reliable best-selling author is feeling real pleasure, and not just obligation, in delivering his work.”

FIVE-CARAT SOUL, by James McBride. (Riverhead, $27.) In his delightful first story collection, the author of the National Book Award-winning novel “The Good Lord Bird” (and a biographer of James Brown) continues to explore race, masculinity, music and history. McBride’s stories often hum with sweet nostalgia, and some even dispatch a kind of fairy-tale moral.

While Keflezighi was in high school, Bob Larsen, then the track coach at U.C.L.A., watched him in a meet and saw fortitude that hinted at great distance-running potential. In the fall of 1993, Larsen visited the family’s three-bedroom apartment in Southern California.

“I get there and I am just really wowed by the family and what they’ve accomplished with so little,” Larsen said. “I offered a full scholarship.

The next year, Keflezighi returned to the marathon as a competitor with four names scribbled on his bib — honoring the people killed at the race as well as a law enforcement officer who was slain by the bombers during a subsequent manhunt. Although far from a favorite, Keflezighi won — the first American man to do so in more than 30 years.

When he was shown crossing the Boston finish line in a tribute video during a New York Road Runners award ceremony on Thursday in Central Park, his father stood, raised his left fist in the air and burst into tears. His mother cried, prayed and made the sign of the cross. That was the only one of Keflezighi’s marathons that his parents missed.

There are far easier things to do than find an international ape smuggler.

For six months I searched for illicit dealers selling gorillas, orangutans, bonobos or chimps. Thousands have been lost in an underground business that makes millions of dollars off endangered animals and caters to rich pet collectors and unscrupulous zoos. Many apes are traumatized, and even if they are eventually rescued they’re “all goofed up,” in the words of one specialist, having endured serious abuse at the hands of their captors.

I began at the source, motoring hundreds of miles upriver in a precarious, pencil-thin canoe in the Democratic Republic of Congo to an area where many bonobos have disappeared. Then I traveled to Thailand, where some of the biggest wildlife gangs operate. When I finally found an ape trafficker and had him on the phone, I stumbled over what, exactly, to say. All my instincts told me to hammer him with questions like: Where are you getting your apes from? Who are you? But my role was to observe his illicit operation firsthand, which meant not scaring him off. It was a journalistic pickle.

The trafficker introduced himself as “Tom,” clearly a fake name. He had been discovered by Daniel Stiles, a well-known wildlife researcher in Kenya and a source of mine for years. Mr. Stiles had seen Tom’s online advertisements and arranged a deal. The plan was to meet in Bangkok, where Mr. Stiles would give Tom around $15,000 for two endangered baby orangutans, enabling the Thai authorities to swoop in and arrest the smuggler. I would report the events as they unfolded, without getting involved in any exchanges or arrests.

But the plan quickly raised some journalistic questions. Mr. Stiles mentioned to Tom that he might bring a friend named Jeffrey with him to check out the orangutans.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

Roy E. Wright, who has directed the flood insurance program for FEMA since June 2015, acknowledged in an interview on Friday that major changes were called for and said some were already in the works. The program’s rate-setting methods, for example, are 30 years old, he said, and new ones will be phased in over the next two years. But other changes — like cutting off coverage to homes that are repeatedly flooded — would require an act of Congress.

“The administration feels very strongly that there needs to be reform this year,” he said. “I believe strongly that we need to expand flood coverage in the United States, and the private insurers are part of that.”

The federal program was created to fill a void left after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, when multiple levees failed, swamping an area bigger than West Virginia and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. Insurers, terrified of the never-ending claims they might have to pay, started to exclude flooding from homeowners’ insurance policies. For decades, your only hope if your home was damaged in a flood was disaster relief from the government.

Policymakers thought an insurance program would be better than ad hoc bailouts. If crafted properly, it would make developers and homeowners pay for the risks they took.

When Congress established the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968, it hoped to revive the private flood-insurance market. Initially about 130 insurers gave it a shot, pooling their capital with the government. But there were clashes, and eventually the government drove out the insurers and took over most operations.

Since 1983, Washington has set the insurance rates, mapped the floodplains, written the rules and borne all of the risk. The role of private insurers has been confined to marketing policies and processing claims, as government contractors.

That worked for a few decades. But now, relentless coastal development and the increasing frequency of megastorms and billion-dollar floods have changed the calculus.

“Put plainly, the N.F.I.P. is not designed to handle catastrophic losses like those caused by Harvey, Irma and Maria,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in a letter to members of Congress after the three huge hurricanes barreled into the United States this season.

Mr. Mulvaney called on Congress to forgive $16 billion of the program’s debt, which both houses agreed to do.

The program, however, needs more than a financial lifeline: Without major, long-term changes, it will just burn through the $16 billion in savings and be back for more.

The White House is hoping to lure companies back into the market, letting them try to turn a profit on underwriting flood policies instead of simply processing claims for the government.

One measure proposed by the Trump administration is for the government to stop writing coverage on newly built houses on floodplains, starting in 2021. New construction there is supposed to be flood-resistant, and if the government retreats, private insurers may step in. Or so the theory goes.

“The private market is anxious, willing and completely able to take everything except the severe repetitive-loss properties,” said Craig Poulton, chief executive of Poulton Associates, which underwrites American risks for Lloyd’s of London, the big international insurance marketplace.

“Severe repetitive-loss properties” is FEMA’s term for houses that are flooded again and again. There are tens of thousands of them. While they account for fewer than 1 percent of the government’s policies, they make up more than 10 percent of the insurance claims, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, which sued FEMA to get the data.

The Trump administration has also proposed creating a new category of properties that are at extreme risk of repeat flooding and that could have their insurance cut off the next time they flooded.

That might sound harsh. Environmental groups, though, argue it’s worse to repeatedly repair doomed houses on flood-prone sites as oceans warm and sea levels rise. The Natural Resources Defense Council argues that the flood-insurance program should buy such properties so the owners can move somewhere safer.

The program, however, has only limited authority to make such purchases; homeowners need to line up funding through other government agencies. As a result, such buyouts are rare.

“I have mounds and mounds of paper, and I’m still waiting,” said Olga McKissic of Louisville, Ky., who applied for a buyout in 2015 after her house flooded for the fifth time. “I want them to tear it down.”

Ms. McKissic even had her house classified as a severe repetitive-loss property, thinking FEMA would give it higher priority. But FEMA has not responded to her application. Instead, it doubled her premiums.","A Broke, and Broken, Flood Insurance Program",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/a-broke-and-broken-flood-insurance-program.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Our back-and-forth continued over the years: at faculty lunches, in Israel, in arguments before the Supreme Court, in books, articles and letters — and in personal conversations. He once, quite appropriately, chided me for my “chutzpah” — one of his favorite Yiddishisms — for challenging him to debate Catholic theology after he had implied in an article that neither the Constitution nor Catholic doctrine would be violated by the execution of an innocent defendant, as long as he had been given due process! The closest he ever came to complimenting me was when he wrote, “You are not as nasty a guy as my right-wing friends believe.” Nor was he as nasty as some of my left-wing friends believe, despite the surliness he occasionally insisted on inserting into some of his judicial opinions.

Reading “Scalia Speaks” — the marvelous collection of his speeches, lovingly compiled by his son and a former law clerk — brought Nino back to life for me. His words, even when read, are provocations to argue, disagree and think. They cannot be read passively. They cry out for dialogue. They demand answers — or surrender.

So here are my answers, to which, in fairness to my departed opponent, I try to append what he might have said in rebuttal.

The central thrust of Justice Scalia’s speeches — indeed of his entire judicial career — was an attack on the concept of a “living Constitution” that “evolves” over time to meet the changing needs of the public. He insisted on going “back to the good, old dead Constitution,” as he once put it in an NPR interview. In the speeches contained in this book, he uses the slightly less inflammatory term “static Constitution.” But it comes down to the same point. Here in Justice Scalia’s words:

“Let me begin by telling you what originalism is. The Constitution, as you know, contains a number of broad provisions, which are necessarily vague in their application: due process of law, equal protection of the laws, cruel and unusual punishments, the freedom of speech, to name a few. Originalism gives to those terms the meaning they were understood to have when the people adopted them. Is the death penalty cruel and unusual punishment? A hard question, perhaps, for the non-originalist. I have sat with four colleagues who thought it was. But for the originalist the answer is easy: At the time the people ratified the Eighth Amendment — the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause — no one thought it forbade the death penalty.”

The same would be true of “equal protection” and other broad provisions of the Constitution.

So, in my classroom debate with the justice, I challenged him with the Supreme Court’s 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which ended racial segregation of public schools in the Southern states. As a matter of indisputable historic fact, following the Civil War the “people” who “adopted” the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment had to take into account what would surely be the continued segregation of public schools, and not only in the Deep South. Had they suggested that the Equal Protection Clause meant the immediate end of all segregated public education, the amendment itself would never have become a reality. All that the proponents — even the most radical among them — could hope for was that over time, attitudes toward racial differences would “evolve” and that the powerful words “equal protection of the laws” would eventually be interpreted to require public schools to be equal and not separate, instead of “separate but equal” as the Supreme Court had permitted in 1896.

I asked Justice Scalia, whether if had he been on the court in 1954, he could have joined the unanimous court without violating his principle of originalism. He was both candid and self-effacing in his response, saying that no theory of constitutional interpretation — including originalism — was perfect. But he still insisted that originalism was “better” and “safer” than any other theory, because it precluded honest judges from substituting their own philosophies for those of the founding generation. In his own provocative words: “Show Scalia the original meaning, and he is prevented from imposing his nasty, conservative views upon the people. He is handcuffed. And if he tries to dissemble, he will be caught out.”

But was he really handcuffed?

Consider the monumental case of Bush v. Gore, which may have decided the 2000 presidential election. In my book “Supreme Injustice,” I once again challenged Justice Scalia. I showed that until Bush v. Gore, Justice Scalia had taken an extremely narrow view of “equal protection,” rejecting the notion that judges should depart from its original understanding in the 14th Amendment as referring to racial inequality. He had railed against imposing “progressively higher degrees” of equality in other contexts. He wrote that when a practice “not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down.” In so writing, Justice Scalia could easily have been describing Florida’s practice of allowing manual recounts in the case of contested election results. But when Bush v. Gore came before the court, he voted to strike down this recount process as violative of — you guessed it — the Equal Protection Clause, citing the unfairness of imposing “arbitrary and disparate treatment” to ballots throughout the state.

I was surprised, though I shouldn’t have been, when Justice Scalia responded to my calling him out on this inconsistency in a letter that acknowledged the problem, with a touch of humility and humor:

“If my joining the equal-protection opinion was a mistake, I will be delighted if it is the worse one I make on the job.... I have frankly not revisited the issue, or read the extensive commentary (mostly critical, I gather) concerning it. At the time, however, I thought that ground correct. Even if you think that was wrong, considering the severe time constraints, the pressure to come out with a near-unanimous opinion, and the fact that it did not determine my vote in the case, you should cut me some slack.”

I had also criticized him for granting the stay that effectively ended the recount and the election, pointing out that he routinely voted against granting stays even in capital punishment cases. He responded: “As for the stay: I think I can persuade you it was proper. We will talk about it some time — as you say, before senility.”

We did get to talk about it, but the argument persisted.

Liberal constitutional lawyers will continue to debate Justice Scalia many years after his death, because when it comes to jurisprudence, he was the most transformative jurist of our generation. His views cannot be ignored. That is his enduring legacy. But he was more than an influential justice. He was a great man, who lived life to the fullest — as a devout Catholic, a proud Italian-American, a devoted family man, a loyal friend, and a person of humor and culture who fondly remembered his roots in Queens and New Jersey. “Scalia Speaks” gives us a glimpse of the man, as I came to know and respect him, despite — no, because of — our arguments.","Antonin Scalia’s Speeches, Collected for Argument’s Sake",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/books/review/antonin-scalia-speaks-speeches-alan-dershowitz.html

Volkswagen’s Audi luxury brand also continues to grow. Its sales climbed 9.6 percent in October from a year earlier, to 19,425 vehicles, and were up 6 percent in the first 10 months the year.

Although its United States sales are rising again, Volkswagen is still working through the impact of the diesel scandal. It has agreed to pay $22 billion in settlements and fines in connection with the matter, including $4.3 billion to settle a case that was brought by the Justice Department. It also agreed to compensate American customers and buy back or fix the diesel models equipped with the illegal software.

All told, Volkswagen used the illegal software in some 11 million cars worldwide, including about 600,000 sold in the United States. Affected models included the diesel-powered versions of some of the VW brand’s most popular cars, such as the Golf, Jetta, Beetle and Passat. Certain vehicles sold by Volkswagen’s Audi and Porsche brands were also equipped with the illegal software.

As of August, Volkswagen had repurchased or modified more than 308,000 vehicles in the United States equipped with 2.0-liter diesel engines, at a cost of $6.4 billion, according to an independent auditor monitoring the process. Roughly 200,000 claims for buybacks remain to be processed. The company had also repurchased about 35,000 vehicles with 3.0-liter engines, out of a total of 53,000 claims filed.

While reporting a drop in earnings last week — a decline largely due to diesel settlements — Volkswagen acknowledged that the damage from the scandal was “nowhere near an end.” Diesel cars have been a bigger part of the company’s product mix in Europe than in United States, handicapping a worldwide recovery.

In one good sign on Wednesday, Volkswagen shares climbed to 167.85 euros on the Frankfurt stock exchange, finally exceeding the price at which they were trading before the diesel scandal.

Volkswagen’s revival in the United States is being driven by two new sport-utility vehicles that arrived in showrooms this year. Even before the diesel problems, VW’s United States sales had been declining since 2012 as consumers, spurred by low gasoline prices, flocked to S.U.V.s and turned away from sedans and compact cars. VW, like other automakers, was caught off guard and scrambled to beef up its S.U.V. offerings.

One of the new S.U.V.s, the Atlas, is a full-size model that enables VW to compete with big sellers like the Ford Explorer and Honda Pilot. The 2018 Tiguan is redesign of an existing model. It comes with extra roominess to appeal to American car buyers.

“We can now target the heart of the S.U.V. market,” Hinrich J. Woebcken, president and chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, told reporters last month. “We are at a fundamental turning point for the brand and our strategy for our American customers.”

Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at Edmunds.com, an auto information website, said VW “is not completely out of the woods,” but noted that American consumers had a history of forgiving automakers who had erred. G.M. faced heavy criticism and investigation after it was slow to recall faulty ignition switches that were eventually linked to fatal crashes.

“Americans follow something for a certain amount of time, but won’t turn their backs on a brand like VW for life,” Ms. Caldwell said. “Eventually they forget or forgive.”

For Volkswagen, keeping up the growth in the United States won’t be easy. The VW brand still lacks a compact S.U.V. for the American market, and the next two new models are sedans, the kind of cars fewer and fewer consumers are buying. One is a redesign of the Jetta compact, and the other a new full-size car called the Arteon. Both are due next year.

The slowdown in overall car sales may also pose a headwind. The industry is likely to report a decline this year after seven years of growth and record sales of 15.5 million cars and light trucks in 2016.

To help lure customers, VW has extended the warranty it offers on its 2018 model to six years or 72,000 miles, double what it previously offered.

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

The luxury automaker BMW has issued two recalls involving about one million cars and sport utility vehicles that are at risk of catching fire even when they are not in use.

The first recall covers more than 672,000 cars. It includes several BMW 3 Series models from 2006-11 with wiring and electrical conductors in the climate control system that are vulnerable to overheating, BMW told the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration on Thursday.

The second, larger recall involves the 2008-11 128i and various other 2007-11 models with six-cylinder engines, such as the 328i and the 525i. In these vehicles, the heater designed to keep the positive crankcase ventilation from freezing has the potential to short-circuit, causing the parts inside its valve to melt. The crankcase ventilation system helps gases escape from an internal combustion engine.

More than 740,000 vehicles are included in this group.

The risk of fire is “extremely rare,” Hector Arellano-Belloc, a BMW spokesman, said in an email.

The company said it was asking car owners “in an abundance of caution” to keep their affected vehicles parked outdoors until they are repaired, he said. He said the company knew of three injuries that may be related to the climate control system wiring, but no injuries related to the P.C.V. heater.

It was an awkward juxtaposition, at a time when a growing number of Hollywood figures are being confronted with claims of sexual misdeeds.

Mr. Baldwin has lately come under scrutiny for his friendship with the filmmaker James Toback, who has faced widespread accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Mr. Baldwin said he had “no idea” that Mr. Toback had “done anything criminal.” “If that’s true, that’s news to me,” Mr. Baldwin said. “I never had any idea that Jimmy’s appetites took him in that direction.”

During a tribute on Thursday at the Paley Center for Media, Mr. Baldwin said, “I certainly have treated women in a very sexist way. I’ve bullied women. I’ve overlooked women. I’ve underestimated women. Not as a rule.”

On Saturday, Mr. Baldwin said he would suspend posting at his @AlecBaldwin Twitter account, following criticism of an interview he gave to PBS in which he seemed to blame some of the actresses who have accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct.

“You heard the rumor that he raped Rose McGowan,” Mr. Baldwin said in the interview. “You heard that over and over — we heard that for decades. And nothing was done.”

He added, “Rose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him. And it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case.”

Uncomfortable Monologue of the Week

Mr. David, the creator and star of the HBO cringe-comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” took the stage by joking to the audience, “You tolerate me. You really, really tolerate me.” He then put that proposition to the test with a discomforting monologue that even his cable-TV alter ego would have had trouble getting away with.

“A lot of sexual harassment stuff in the news of late,” the real Mr. David said. “And, uh, I couldn’t help but notice a very disturbing pattern emerging. Which is that many of the predators — not all, but many of them — are Jews.”

After a long grimace, Mr. David said, “I don’t like it when Jews are in the headlines for notorious reasons. I want, ‘Einstein Discovers the Theory of Relativity.’ ‘Salk Cures Polio.’ What I don’t want? ‘Weinstein Took It Out.’”

Mr. David continued to think aloud: “You know, I’ve always, always been obsessed with women, and I’ve often wondered, if I’d grown up in Poland, when Hitler came to power, and was sent to a concentration camp, would I still be checking out women in the camp? I think I would.”

He added, “Of course, the problem is, there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp.”

Imagining how such an interaction might unfold, Mr. David said, “How’s it going? They treating you O.K.? You know, if we ever get out of here, I’d love to take you out for some latkes. You like latkes? What, what’d I say? Is it me or is it the whole thing? It’s ‘cause I’m bald, isn’t it?”

Bernie Sanders Sketch of the Week

Reprising a recurring role from last season, Mr. David played Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, this time as a contestant on a celebrity edition of “The Price Is Right.”

Paired with a baffled civilian contestant (Pete Davidson), Mr. David said, “Thank you, it’s good to be here. I just want to say, this show is a travesty. Consumerism disguised as entertainment. That being said, I do need a new dinette set.”He added, “We’re going to win this thing the Bernie way. Which means if I lose, I’ll bring everyone else down with me.”

Trump Family Sketch of the Week

In a “Weekend Update” deskside segment, Mr. Moffat and Mikey Day played the president’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., speaking out against the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into their father’s presidential campaign.

While Mr. Moffat clumsily mimed his gestures and body language, Mr. Day explained, “We’d like to make it very clear that our father did nothing wrong. Some people who barely worked for him did. But Dad knew nothing about it. And the same goes for Eric and myself.”

Colin Jost, the “Weekend Update” co-anchor, replied, “Well, I definitely believe you that Eric had no idea what was going on.”

“Exactly,” Mr. Day said. “And look, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, we barely knew these guys. And as for the last guy, George — ”

Mr. Moffat confidently interjected, “Doctor Octopus.”

Mr. Day corrected him. “No, buddy, it’s not George Doctor Octopus, it’s George Papadopoulos,” he said.

Mr. Day went onto argue that there should instead be an investigation of Mr. Trump’s Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.

“As we learned from Donna Brazile,” he said. “Crooked Hillary and company did some shady back room deals with the Russians and tried to rig the election in her favor.”

The fact that Trump has tried to govern as more of a conventional conservative than a populist is probably one reason the core now supports him so steadfastly. By letting Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have their way (however unsuccessfully) on policy detail, he’s weakened any appeal to the center he once had, but also sealed partisan loyalties and protected his right flank. The same goes for his promise-keeping, to date, with his religious-conservative supporters: Churchgoing evangelicals, in particular, were quite skeptical of his primary campaign, but now they seem to have accepted a transactional relationship, telling themselves “in Pence we trust.”

But the biggest reason for Trump’s support from core Republicans is likely the simple pull of partisanship. When he wasn’t yet the face of the party, they found various principled and practical reasons to oppose him. But now that he’s their Republican president, all those doubts seem irrelevant, and identifying as a partisan means identifying with him.

This is a difficult environment in which to imagine a primary challenger flourishing. Indeed, it leaves the most common type of anti-Trump Republican politician, the Jeff Flake sort who imagine themselves the tribunes of a more principled and ideologically-consistent conservatism, without any obvious constituency at all — since the supposedly principled and ideologically-consistent conservative voters are now the heart of Trump’s support.

I still think somebody should primary the president, both as a protest against his unfitness and a means of beginning the necessary debate within the party about how its future leaders — the Tom Cotton-Nikki Haley ticket, or the Ivanka-Rubio Duumvirate — might make conservatism great again.

But no rising figure in the G.O.P. is likely to consider sacrificing their career to make a protest or start an intellectual debate — leaving the task to retirees and elder statesmen, to a Flake or a Bob Corker or a John Kasich or even a Mitt Romney. And there is every reason to think that most of them would demur as well, and that the inevitable challenger will look more like the third party challengers of 2016 — an Evan McMullin or a Gary Johnson, or some foolhardy NeverTrump pundit drafted into the lists.

However: It would also be a mistake to assume that the present environment will necessarily persist — that because Trump has held Republicans thus far there is nothing that could shake his 38 percent support. George W. Bush was bonded to the G.O.P. base by partisanship and wartime leadership and shared religious values and his approval still sank to the 20s when events turned sharply against his presidency. Trump does not have nearly as far to fall as Bush, some of his support is soft, he has already lost seven points off his January 2016 approval ratings, and neither war nor economic crisis have really tested him as yet.

What might weaken him further? An economic slowdown. An overseas debacle too significant to be explained away by Fox’s talking heads. The indictment of a family member. A botched nomination the next time a Supreme Court vacancy occurs. Something strange and Trumpy, that cannot yet be foreseen.

Partisanship and incumbency being what they are, even with approval ratings in the twenties Trump would still be the favorite to win his party’s nomination. But the possibilities for a challenger would widen, and so might the list of possible contenders.

Such a contender, though, would need to be shrewd as well as bold. Various obvious lines of attack against Trump are ill-suited for a primary assault. He’s not an ideological conservative was tried and found conspicuously wanting in ’16. Pious attacks on his moral failings, however justified, are likely to also feel like indictments of his voters — whose backing a primary challenger would need to win. And absent something dispositive from Robert Mueller, going all-in on the Russia scandals would link a challenger too closely to the Democrats.

Instead, a primary campaign would need to be waged more in sorrow than in anger, accusing Trump of broken promises, lamenting his administration’s inability to legislate, and promising to carry on certain parts of his agenda (judges, above all) but with more competence and tact. The challenger would need to criticize Trump from the ideological right on some issues, but also reach out to more populist Republicans, especially from Pew’s “Market Skeptic” category, by asking why his infrastructure bill never happened, why his tax cuts haven’t done more for the middle class, why he isn’t doing more to stop outsourcing and bring back the coal industry and so on down the list of (yes, always-implausible) broken promises. And then instead of accusing Trump of being a racist or misogynist or authoritarian (as true as those accusations may be), the challenger would simply lament that after pledging to drain the morass of Washington the president let his administration be taken over by swamp creatures.

The goal would be to create a permission structure for wavering Republican voters, the sort who dislike Trump’s Twitter feed and fret a little about the nuclear codes and say they “somewhat” rather than “strongly” approve of him, but thanking him for waging war on Washington and then moving on to a more competent alternative.

Which also means that such a campaign would make the most sense coming from outside Washington, rather than from one of the senators who have opposed or criticized or resisted Trump to date.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Most of us solve crossword puzzles in our SPARE TIME, but I’ve gotten mail from people who have told me that they solved under their desks during classes to make a boring lecture go faster. In another lifetime, I raced my boss to see who could finish fastest when we should have been working. So clearly, spare time is the not the same as down time. Spare time is all in the eye of the solver.

Roland Huget returns with a wide open grid that has only 60 words in it. The pinwheel design intrigued me, although I felt a bit boxed in by the long, black square “arms” that made, as he admits, the puzzle feel like four mini-crosswords. If I’m going to be boxed in, so to speak, I like to see each sector really shine, and I’m not sure this one did it for me. As always, your mileage may vary, but there are more “RE-” words in here than I like to see (RELET, REVOICE, REBOX, REAWAKENS) and each section has some gluey bits that made me feel as if the majority of the puzzle had been filled using the autofill option in a puzzle constructing software program.

Yes, I know it’s Saturday. There is some nice fill in here (I liked SEAFARERS, GO IT ALONE, SPARE TIME, LOSE A STEP). And PAPETERIE might just become the ETUI of stationery products one day. But I really like some knotty wordplay in my late week cluing, and this seemed mostly definitional. Combine that with the lack of real sparklers in the fill, and the puzzle as a whole feels vaguely disappointing. To me. You might feel otherwise, and that’s perfectly O.K.

Tricky Clues

The Tricky Clues section is generally limited to clues that involve some sort of wordplay, and there wasn’t much of it in today’s puzzle. Even so, here is a selection of clues that might have been speed bumps for some solvers.

41A: Foreign language in the clue = foreign language answer. “Un examen” is “a test” in French, so the answer would be ELEVE, or French for “student.”

36D: “It’s not the main story” is a SUBPLOT.

43D: Now we’re talking, sort of. “It can get the blood flowing” could be anything exciting, but today it’s a STENT.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle was constructed in October 2016 and accepted for publication in February of this year. It is one of a series of open grids that I constructed in the late summer and fall of 2016. This grid has the largest open square count of any I have constructed to date. The layout of the blocks was designed for that purpose. It is as close to being four independent mini-puzzles as you can get, and this fact needs to be taken into account in the cluing so that solvers can gain a foothold. This grid took longer than most to construct, and in the end required compromises, as has been my experience with many puzzles. The Scrabble average often suffers in grids like this because the friendliest letters in the open areas tend to be the ones with the lowest scores. I hope solvers enjoy this one.

At 500 Startups, the tech incubator based in Silicon Valley that funded BrewPublik, Facebook advertising is a topic covered in classes.
But even as the Hubble team gleaned more about what yielded successful Facebook ads, the algorithm could be unpredictable, almost moody.
Hubble’s sales representative at Facebook told him that Siddiqi had figured out the best ways to optimize Facebook advertising campaigns.
When I asked Siddiqi to share his tips for managing Facebook ads, he replied, “Step 1 is meditation.”“It’s like a baby,” Jesse Horwitz told me.","By February 2016, after many nights and weekends of emailing Asian manufacturers and reading up on Food and Drug Administration compliance, the vision of a viable business was coming into focus. The pair had found an F.D.A.-approved manufacturer in Asia and figured out how to meet the necessary regulations. Still, Cogan was reluctant. He had been accepted to Wharton and had even put down a deposit. He believed that was the smarter option. At best, the contact-lens business would become a side project.

Before shelving their venture, they decided to try one more tack. They recruited two friends: Paul Rodgers, a buddy of Horwitz’s from Columbia who knew how to write computer code, and Dan Rosen, a friend of Cogan’s from Bronx Science who was handy with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Together the four built what is known in the world of online retailing as a demand experiment. The technique, credited to Harry’s founders (who give away its basic code), amounts to a two-page website. The first page explained the concept of a monthly subscription for contacts and asked those who were interested to submit their email addresses. Visitors who did so were taken to a second page and were made an offer: Share this referral code with friends, and if enough of them sign up, you’ll get free contacts.

They posted a link to their site on the walls of about 40 Facebook friends. Within a few days, not only had their own friends signed up, but friends of friends of friends had, too — some 2,000 people in all. Some of those distant connections were even evangelizing the company on their own Facebook walls. “It went mini-viral,” Cogan says.

He and Horwitz applied to tech incubators — organizations that invest in and coach young companies in exchange for minority stakes — using the demand experiment as one slide in their 16-page PowerPoint presentation. They pitched a few venture capitalists based in New York as well. They decided that if they were admitted to an incubator, they would work on the project full time. If not, Cogan would go to Wharton. By April, they had not only been called back for interviews with five incubators; venture funds were also offering to invest a total of $3.5 million in their idea.

Cogan dropped his Wharton plans. He and Horwitz ordered 50,000 contact lenses and, with Rosen as creative director and Rodgers as chief technology officer, began working out of their investors’ offices, stacking boxes and boxes of lenses along the walls by their desks. They eventually named their enterprise Hubble, after the orbiting telescope that can see into deep space.

Facebook helped them succeed with their demand test; now it would generate their first sales. During the summer of 2016, a friend of one of Hubble’s prospective investors, a start-up veteran named Joshua Liberson, recommended that the founders try a new type of Facebook advertising called Lead Ads. No outside website was needed: Would-be customers simply clicked a button on the ad to submit their email addresses, directly from Facebook. Hubble directed its ads to ZIP codes in New York and Chicago, where they had already signed up optometrists willing to write prescriptions. After people clicked the ads, Horwitz emailed them to coordinate appointments and take their orders.

When Hubble’s online store opened officially on Nov. 1, 2016, Cogan and Horwitz knew how to run a Facebook advertising campaign, and they were confident it would continue to generate sales. They planned to spend the additional $3.7 million they raised almost entirely on Facebook ads.

In 2017, everyone seems to be wondering: Is Facebook taking over the world? Most of us now realize that the social network has become far more than a repository for selfies and political rants of its more than two billion users. To ad sellers, Facebook is now a gluttonous monster, which, along with Google, is gobbling up the digital advertising business in the United States; according to Pivotal Research Group, the two companies controlled 70 percent of the market and most of the growth in 2016. From the perspective of American intelligence agencies, Facebook is practically a weapon, used by a company linked to the Kremlin to foment extremism and influence the 2016 presidential election with at least $100,000 worth of targeted ads. For those with privacy concerns, Facebook plays the role of Big Brother, compiling ever more data on what we like, what we post and what we buy and even tracking where we are both online and in the physical world by tapping into the GPS locator on our phones.

In considering Facebook’s far-reaching influence, it’s worth keeping in mind the perspective of the more than five million advertisers whose money is financing the social network’s rampant growth. For them, Facebook and Instagram, which the company also owns, are the stuff of fantasy — grand bazaars on a scale never seen before. By advertising directly in users’ news feeds, companies can, at any time of day, target potential customers at moments when they are often bored and open to novelty. What better time to hear a product pitch?

“Facebook created the world’s greatest infomercial,” says Roger McNamee, a founder of Elevation Partners, who invested early in Facebook but has since become critical of the company’s influence. “It’s really inexpensive to produce ads and unbelievably inexpensive to reach exactly the market that you’re looking for.” As a result, Facebook has become especially lucrative for companies trying to sell new products online. The leaders of more than half a dozen new online retailers all told me they spent the greatest portion of their ad money on Facebook and Instagram.

“In the start-up-industrial complex, it’s like a systematic transfer of money” from venture-capital firms to start-ups to Facebook, says Charlie Mulligan, the founder of BrewPublik, which uses a “Beergorithm” to deliver personalized selections of craft beers to customers every month. At 500 Startups, the tech incubator based in Silicon Valley that funded BrewPublik, Facebook advertising is a topic covered in classes. In fact, social-network advertising is an assumed prerequisite for anyone studying marketing at a tech incubator these days — or at any business school across the country. “There is a formula for this stuff,” Mulligan says. “And the reason why there is a formula is because it works.”

The process is easy, cheap and effective. With a few hundred dollars and a morning’s effort, an entrepreneur can place his or her ads before social-media users that same afternoon. Companies unsure which ads are best can upload a handful of them and let Facebook’s artificial-intelligence software test their efficacy. If they don’t know who should see their ads, they can embed code on their websites that enables Facebook to monitor the traffic and then show ads to recent visitors. Or companies can send the email addresses of their existing customers to Facebook, and it will locate their Facebook accounts and put ads in front of so-called Lookalikes, users who like and click on the same things that your proven fan base does. It’s all about as straightforward as setting up an online dating profile. Steph Korey, a founder of Away, a luggage company based in New York that opened in 2015, says that when the company was starting, it made $5 for every $1 it spent on Facebook Lookalike ads.

The ease of opening a business on Facebook has in turn spawned a wild proliferation of specialty digital sellers that depend on the social network’s algorithm to find their early customers. Many of them follow the same playbook and even share a similar aesthetic. They spend money on traditional public relations, on sponsored links that appear next to Google search results and on “influencer” marketing, or giving away their product to people with large social-media followings, in hopes of creating buzz. Then they buy ads on Facebook and Instagram. Inevitably you will encounter them there: They feature a sleek photograph or a video loop of a product — a wood-handled water filter, woolen shoes, an electric toothbrush. At the top, in bold, the company’s name appears, often ringing with the same friendly, typically two-syllable whimsy. Soma. Allbirds. Goby.

“Sometimes we’ll look at each other and say, ‘God, there are just so many of them,’ ” says Ellie Wheeler, a partner at the venture fund Greycroft Partners, which invested in Hubble last year. Her firm has also taken ownership stakes in Thrive Market, which sells health foods; Plated, a meal-kit delivery service; Trunk Club, which mails a box of clothes to its customers; and Eloquii, a fast-fashion retailer specializing in plus sizes.

While not all of these companies and others like them will survive, plenty are encroaching on established brands, which are taking the threat seriously. In July 2016, Unilever, the European consumer-products conglomerate, acquired Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1 billion. In June, Walmart agreed to buy Bonobos, an internet-based apparel brand, for $310 million. Companies that sell products exclusively online continue to grow faster than any other type of retailer in the United States — some 17 percent annually since 2011, more than six times the rate of retail over all, according to Euromonitor International.

And Facebook has even been taking steps to influence offline sales, in order to bring traditional retailers into its orbit. In September, the social network introduced a tool that lets businesses with physical stores show ads to shoppers and their Lookalikes even if they visit the store but don’t buy anything. Day by day, Facebook is extending its reach further and further into the American marketplace.

One afternoon in March, I watched as Rosen selected three new ads from an extensive photo shoot the week before, his third in four months. Rosen resembled a sleep-deprived new parent — mussed hair, dull gaze. He spoke in a monotone. He attributed his fatigue, I would learn later, to Facebook’s artificial-intelligence software that placed Hubble’s ads. Rosen and his colleagues simply referred to it as “the algorithm.”

The basic building block of Facebook advertising is an ad set. It consists of the ads themselves and choices in three other categories: audience, goal and budget. That day, Rosen was designing a set to reach an audience of people on Instagram who had visited hubblecontacts.com in the past 30 days. His goal was “conversions,” or persuading users who had seen the company’s ad to make a purchase. Finally, he set a budget of $1,000 per day. He uploaded the three images. Now they were ready to be tested, to see if any of them were winners in the eyes of users and the algorithm.

What happened at 8 a.m. the next morning, when the ad set became active, was complex — and far removed from human sight. Just before Facebook places an advertisement in a user’s feed, it holds a sort of instantaneous auction to determine which advertiser gets the space. The amount of each advertiser’s bid is influenced by its budget size, of course, but the algorithm also weighs what it knows about the company, the ad and the individual Facebook user. Seeking to act like an intuitive matchmaker, the algorithm draws inferences from personal interests, current online behavior, the user’s potential value to each advertiser and the ad’s general appeal. Sometimes the winner is the advertiser that offered Facebook the most money. Sometimes the algorithm decides you are more likely to click a different ad and awards the space to that advertiser for less money.

This detailed handicapping process involves thousands of advertisers per auction. Millions of auctions take place every minute as users across Facebook load their feeds. The process is never the same twice. The algorithm is constantly learning, using past results to inform how it weighs bids in the next auction. The intent, Facebook says, is to maximize value for everybody: to pair the advertiser with its likeliest customers, and to show ads that users want to see. And, of course, to make money for Facebook.

But from Rosen’s perspective, nothing much had happened before he ambled into the office a little after 10 a.m. Facebook had spent a grand total of $1.86 on his ads. It had shown the first ad to 51 people, the second to 45 and the third to only two. The first ad had been clicked once. Rosen, unperturbed, poured himself a cup of coffee from the single-serve machine. The algorithm takes a little while to get warmed up, he said. “In an hour, it’ll get exciting.”

Twenty minutes later, Rosen refreshed his browser. The Ads Manager window displayed the latest numbers: Rosen could see only the results, not the process that produced them, but it seemed as if the click had inspired the algorithm to favor the first ad. During those 20 minutes, the first ad appeared before 76 more people — that is, it won 76 more auctions than the other two ads. Over the next hour, the algorithm showed the first ad, which featured a photo of colorful Hubble boxes against a blue background, to more and more users; the algorithm had begun to favor it, apparently. As Rosen refreshed his browser, the sensation was like watching a seed sprout. The ad got more views. Some led to clicks. And eventually, sometime between 11:28 a.m. and 11:53 a.m., one of those clicks led to the test’s first sale. Commerce was in bloom.

The moment felt odd. Obviously there was science behind the scenes; the algorithm was a set of rules written by Facebook engineers. But from where Rosen sat, the operation might as well have been run by the Holy Spirit. Facebook’s artificial-intelligence algorithm had wound its way through the server farms, reached out among two billion users, found an individual and showed her a Hubble ad on Instagram — and she used her credit card to buy a subscription for contact lenses.

In quick succession, the first ad generated two more sales. The algorithm started increasing how much it bid on Hubble’s behalf, thus winning even more auctions for ad space and spending more of Hubble’s money on it — first $1 a minute, then $2 a minute, then more than $3. By 2 p.m., Facebook’s A.I. had charged Hubble $306.50 to put that ad in front of 9,684 users. The second ad, after an outlay of $8.03, had been all but abandoned. And the third ad was hardly given a chance: Since 8 a.m., it had appeared before only 30 people.

“No idea why,” Rosen said, shaking his head. Rosen could see all sorts of data arranged in neat rows on Facebook’s Ads Manager program: the number of views, clicks, sales and the average cost, in advertising, of acquiring each new customer. But none of the metrics at Rosen’s fingertips could resolve a fundamental mystery: why the algorithm behaved as it did, why it preferred some ads over others and why the third ad got little attention whatsoever.

The morning’s ads were incredibly similar: “hubblecontacts,” the company’s Instagram handle, appeared at the top, above pictures of boxes in peach, blue, yellow and green. The only differences were that the first ad showed the boxes of contact lenses lined up against a blue background; in the second and third ads, they were set against a split pink-and-blue background and were arranged diagonally in the second and scattershot in the third. But they were all just boxes! Did Instagram users really prefer contact-lens ads with strict rows of boxes or blue backgrounds? Had rules been written into the algorithm favoring orderly arrangements? (The Hubble team knew Facebook favored certain aesthetics.) To what extent was the day’s outcome, apparently set in motion when the first ad happened to get that first click in the morning, actually random? Rosen could only guess.

Advertising has always been an uncertain business. No one has ever known why, exactly, some people respond to an ad in a newspaper or a spot on TV, much less why specific individuals decide to buy products when they do. (The oldest cliché in the ad world, usually attributed to the department-store magnate John Wanamaker: “Half my advertising is wasted. The trouble is, I don’t know which half.”) But to make money in advertising, you don’t have to be all-knowing; your ads simply need to work better than those of a competitor. To this end, advertisers inevitably pursue some combination of two major approaches. They test and refine their messages, trying to craft one as efficient and targeted as possible (junk-mailers of preapproved credit-card offers, for example). Or they showboat, putting on a huge spectacle that’s sure to attract someone (Super Bowl advertisers).

In the early 2010s, direct-to-consumer companies showboated. But lacking the money for big TV ad campaigns, they relied instead on old-fashioned public relations, panache and luck. Warby Parker hired a public-relations firm to pitch its concept to Vogue and GQ and debuted its website on the same day issues reached subscribers. It also held an event featuring bespectacled models at the New York Public Library during Fashion Week. Dollar Shave Club first succeeded on account of the exquisite timing, both commercial and comedic, of its founder, Michael Dubin. He made a funny, low-budget video introducing his company, then uploaded it to YouTube on the same day TechCrunch reported Dollar Shave Club’s first round of venture funding. Within days, after some immediate attention at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., Dubin had three million views online.

Facebook’s sales pitch — putting the right ad in front of the right person, thanks to the wonders of data technology — isn’t exactly new. As far back as 1964, William Allan, a business editor for The Pittsburgh Press, reported that in the near future, “computers will tell businessmen which half of their advertising budgets are being wasted.” Thirty years later, The Economist described an effort to take advantage of American Express’s transactional records: “Powerful data-crunching computers known as massive parallel processors, equipped with neural-network software (which searches, like the human brain, for patterns in a mass of data), hold out a vision of marketing nirvana.” Companies like Acxiom, Experian and Datalogix have been offering similar data-mining services to direct marketers for years. What sets Facebook (and Google) apart are scale and sophistication.

A recent study by a Princeton professor, Arvind Narayanan, and a doctoral candidate, Steven Englehardt, provides a sense of how thoroughly the two online giants monitor user behavior. In early 2016, they examined the top one million websites in the world, using special bots they developed to scour them for tracking mechanisms. Google had trackers on 76 percent of these sites, Facebook on 23 percent of them. (Twitter, in third place, had trackers on just over 12 percent of the sites.) The tech giants can examine all this data looking for patterns and then match them back to prospective customers.

What also sets Facebook and Google apart from their direct-marketing forebears is that they give access to everyday advertisers. Anyone with a credit card can go online and test ads on Facebook’s platform, one of the most sophisticated direct-marketing operations ever. But while average people can use the machine, there’s still a lot of mystery about how it works. The methods and calculations of the algorithm — why it ends up pushing some ads and not others — are all hidden.

Almost as soon as they began, Rosen, Horwitz and the others at Hubble became determined to fathom the algorithm’s secrets — to figure out why some ads succeeded and others didn’t. Soon they were trading hypotheses with other entrepreneurs, cribbing ideas from other companies’ ads and taking a formal approach to testing, rooted in the scientific method. They uploaded ads with identical images but different wordings, for example. The Hubble team wound up concluding all sorts of things. Ads with third-party endorsements — from GQ, say, or BuzzFeed — beat those with their own slogans. Ads featuring close-ups of the Hubble boxes outperformed those with human models. Ads that included a button that said “Shop Now” or “Learn More” fared worse than an ad with no button at all; viewers simply preferred to click anywhere on the picture to go to the website.

But even as the Hubble team gleaned more about what yielded successful Facebook ads, the algorithm could be unpredictable, almost moody. If you kept loading the same ads into the same ad set every day, they stopped performing as well. The founders figured at first that users were tiring of the same ads. But actual viewer numbers revealed that practically no individual user had seen any ad more than once. The algorithm itself seemed to grow bored. At night, meanwhile, the algorithm spent lots of money and rarely found customers. The Hubble executives started shrinking the budgets at 11 p.m., which they called “putting the algorithm to bed.” The algorithm could also be impulsive and streaky — some days it might go on a sudden jag, blowing a thousand dollars in a few hours with nothing to show for it. At any time, any one of the 15 different ad sets might go haywire. Rosen found himself checking the Ads Manager compulsively on his laptop and his iPhone. (Facebook offers an iOS app for advertisers.) “It occupies my brain constantly,” he says. “It’s that feeling of ‘Did you leave the oven on?’ ”

One night we went to a standup-comedy night Rosen hosted at a bar called Muchmore’s in Brooklyn. (For the past four years, he has moonlighted as a comedian.) But while the other comics were onstage, Rosen was on the Ads Manager the whole time. “Who cares about jokes?” he quipped afterward.

Eager for help, Rosen sought guidance from a former Facebook employee named Faheem Siddiqi, who now runs his own marketing agency. Hubble’s sales representative at Facebook told him that Siddiqi had figured out the best ways to optimize Facebook advertising campaigns. But it turned out that Siddiqi and his employees checked the Ads Manager even more compulsively than Rosen — every half-hour, for up to 16 hours a day. When I asked Siddiqi to share his tips for managing Facebook ads, he replied, “Step 1 is meditation.”

“It’s like a baby,” Jesse Horwitz told me. “If you go more than half an hour without checking in on it, it’s probably dead.” (Horwitz, who is married, does not yet have children.)

Middlemen — creative agencies, media planners, publishers — have long ruled the advertising business. Yet until recently they have not been as omnipresent, opaque and inhuman as Facebook. The social giant now dictates, more fully and precisely than ever before, which ads we see and who sees which ads. Some of the implications of this are amusing, others troubling.

In my house, the strange new world of advertising announced itself in the form of a water pitcher. The Soma 6-Cup Pitcher is a paragon of Brooklynite beauty: folksy oak handle, sleek minimalist reservoir, filter cones made out of coconut shells (or something). I had never heard of it before my wife ordered one online. Plenty of my friends hadn’t, either. When our visitors opened the fridge, half of them were like me: Soma ignorant. The other half knew the brand immediately: Hey! You got a Soma? They had seen the pitcher on Facebook, on Instagram, all over the place. What was a familiar brand to some was totally unknown to me and others. We had been divvied up. It’s something I’ve noticed again and again: I see an ad for Aaptiv, a running app; my wife sees ads for a furniture website called Article that I’ve still never visited. Just as Facebook steers conservative and liberal talking points to users who already share those perspectives, we’re being sorted into commercial bubbles as well.

Recently ProPublica, the investigative-journalism nonprofit, showed how bad actors can abuse this process: Facebook’s software gave advertisers the option to target “Jew Haters,” for instance. In a separate investigation, ProPublica found that Facebook made it possible to exclude specific “ethnic affinities” from seeing ads, noting that ads excluding people based on race are prohibited by federal housing and employment laws.

This stereotyping isn’t a glitch of Facebook’s machine-learning process — it’s how the software works. To formulate audiences, the algorithm scours profiles and analyzes them for shared traits and correlations and self-identified interests and, it assumes, our preferences, grouping us into tribes that can be targeted. It’s up to Facebook and advertisers to constrain this amoral process in ethical and lawful ways. Yet the ethics of targeting are not clear-cut. In May, The Australian reported that Facebook employees had prepared a document showing how they could gather details on teenagers during vulnerable moments — when Facebook users feel “stressed,” “insecure,” “defeated” or “worthless.” Is that immoral, or simply crass?

Such challenges are opening a new front for companies and corporate-responsibility watchdogs. Bad human actors don’t pose the only problem; a machine-learning algorithm, left unchecked, can misbehave and compound inequality on its own, no help from humans needed. The same mechanism that decides that 30-something women who like yoga disproportionately buy Lululemon tights — and shows them ads for more yoga wear — would also show more junk-food ads to impoverished populations rife with diabetes and obesity.

“Sometimes data behaves unethically,” Antonio Garcia-Martinez, a former Facebook employee who worked on the advertising team, wrote in an essay in The Guardian. He provided an example from his time at the company: “Someone on the data-science team had cooked up a new tool that recommended Facebook pages users should like. And what did this tool start spitting out? Every ethnic stereotype you can imagine.”

As algorithms sort users in increasingly complex ways — already the multivaried criteria for determining a Lookalike group defies human comprehension — regulators and companies will have to confront how to determine who is being nudged, and why, and whether that’s benefiting the public or exacerbating societal ills. An algorithm that draws its lessons from the present reality can’t be counted on to improve the course of the future on its own.

Facebook’s A.I. isn’t operating unattended, certainly: Garcia-Martinez wrote that Facebook decided not to release the recommendation tool. Facebook points out that it makes efforts to prevent harmful advertising. It does not, for instance, allow ads for payday loans, which prey on the poor. It says it has removed advertisers’ ability to target users by ethnicity when promoting housing, employment or credit; it removed “Jew Haters” and other objectionable categories and said it would increase human review of its ad-targeting options. In response to the report in The Australian, Facebook said the analysis “was intended to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook. It was never used to target ads.”

Yet managing a platform this way — seeing what mischief the algorithm and its users gets up to, then responding with countermeasures — can be difficult to sustain. “This is a whack-a-mole problem, one among many Facebook has,” Garcia-Martinez told me. It makes Facebook, a company still largely controlled by a single man, Mark Zuckerberg, the ultimate arbiter of morality and taste for all two billion of its users. It also means the company has unilateral power to make or break companies when it tweaks its system.

This is not a hypothetical possibility. In 2013, media sites like those measured by the BuzzFeed Partner network, which includes BuzzFeed, Thought Catalog and The New York Times, noticed a huge surge in referrals from Facebook — a jump of more than 50 million page views from August to October. A year later, Facebook announced that it had adjusted its news-feed algorithm to eliminate so-called click bait. Upworthy, a peddler of stories with headlines like “9 Out of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact,” had its total page views decline by half in the span of three months, from 90 million to 48 million visitors. (At the time of these huge shifts, 30 percent of Americans got news from Facebook. In 2017, 45 percent of Americans do, according to Pew Research Center.)

“We always knew that Facebook is sort of like the weather,” says Eli Pariser, Upworthy’s co-founder and president. “There’s going to be sunny days and stormy days.” In response to the algorithm adjustment, Pariser instructed his staff to stop posting as many videos to YouTube, which is owned by Google, and start publishing more videos directly to Facebook instead.

“That certainly served Facebook well,” Pariser admits. “But you know, I also wouldn’t be able to reach 200 million people on any other medium,” he says, citing the reach of Upworthy’s videos on Facebook. The platform may be mercurial, but Upworthy still relies on it.

Imagine, now, that Facebook tweaks its algorithm in a way that — rather than cause wild swings in web traffic​ ​to a purveyor of viral videos — leads to a steep decline in advertising and sales for a consumer-products company, one that happens to be the largest employer in a small town. Or imagine​ ​multiple​ ​companies shaken up by such an adjustment, or an entire industry overhauling its practices​ ​to suit Facebook.​ ​Even the threat and uncertainty of those possibilities could​ ​hurt​ ​businesses, which depend on predictable returns to invest in future projects.

As we delegate more control to artificial intelligence, both businesses as well as users are venturing into uncertain territory. In the meantime, more and more companies — start-ups, mom-and-pop stores, major corporations — are handing their dollars and their data to the social-networking giant. Facebook’s Ads Manager is user-friendly. Sales are plentiful. And if you don’t take advantage of it, your competitors will. How could you not go there?

By mid-March, a few weeks after I first followed Rosen, the Hubble team no longer had 15 Facebook and Instagram ad sets. It had 40 — all pointed at discrete audiences, each with its own handful of ads. But Rosen looked more rested, less frazzled. He explained that he and Paul Rodgers had developed something they called “Robo-Dan,” a few lines of code that checked the Ads Manager every hour, then adjusted the budget as Rosen would. He could wake up and let the ads run (although he had to fight the compulsion to check on Robo-Dan). Soon, he told me, they would upgrade to Robo-Dan 2, which would switch in new ads, taking over the nightly bedtime routine. (With 40 audiences, he told me, going through the process lasted almost as long as an entire episode of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”) Finally, he said, he was getting some distance from Facebook’s everyday machinations. Someday soon, he would be able to go to bed early, he told me. Or have an evening to himself.

But by the end of June, Rosen’s stress-free life was still a dream. A new problem arose: No matter what new ads they put in an ad set, the growth rate of sales declined and the cost per acquisition went up. They began to think it was an audience problem: Had they found all the customers in those groups? With their ad sets going fallow, the Hubble team scrambled to find fresh and fertile ground. Their ideas for new audiences got quirkier, more outlandish. One week they zeroed in on people who like Sweetgreen, the salad chain. Next they went after people who had indicated that they were fans of bottled water, whoever they are. Each group fizzled after a few days — the cost per each new customer climbed higher and higher; sales dwindled. As they searched for more and more audience descriptors, they landed upon a novel idea: They began trading their Lookalike groups with other online retailers, figuring that the kind of people who buy one product from social media will probably buy others. This sort of audience sharing is becoming more common on Facebook: There is even a company, TapFwd, that pools together Lookalike groups for various brands, helping them show ads to other groups.

Cogan and Horwitz have decided that they need to reduce their dependence on Facebook advertising, for the sake of their business and their own sanity. In May, they tested their first 15-second cable-television commercials. With TV, the data is vaguer, and it takes longer to get results back. Yet even though the old medium provides them with less information than Facebook, in some ways the ignorance is bliss. “There’s fewer levers; there’s less to stress out about.” Rodgers says. “You can push the button and get on with your life.”

In August, the Hubble team finally handed over their domestic Facebook advertising work to an outside agency, Ampush, that charges them based on how many new customers sign up. Ten people at Ampush now do the job of Rosen and Robo-Dan. Still, the handoff was bittersweet. “We ran their numbers — it’s something we could beat,” Rosen says, meaning Hubble could get more customers for less money if it did the ad buying in-house. “But it would destroy our lives.”

Thanks largely to Facebook, Hubble is on track to finish its first full year in business having made $20 million in revenue. In August, Hubble raised $10 million, valuing the company at $210 million. In January, Hubble will use those funds to expand its business to Continental Europe. Its advertising strategy? Robo-Dan, with some help from Rosen.

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

Soon I started looking for him whenever I arrived. If I saw him approaching the bar, I would pour his drink, anticipating his order, and watch his face light up when I pushed it toward him. He must have eavesdropped too, because he started calling me by name, waiting for me if I was serving someone else and hanging around after I had served him.

When I collected beer glasses, he would lope up behind me and put his chin on my shoulder like an overgrown puppy. I would turn my head and kiss him on the cheek, his eyes would crinkle into a smile, and then he would swing around on his crutches and head back to his friends. If he was sitting on a bar stool and I walked past, he would put one arm out and catch me by the waist.

“Nicky, my adorable!” he would say.

“Mikey, my beautiful!” I would reply.

I would ruffle his nonexistent hair, and he would grin bashfully and let me go. He never asked anything more of me. It was the gentlest friendship I had ever experienced.

When he returned to the hospital for more operations, I visited him. I would sneak in joints and we would sit on the fire escape, smoking. I never asked him about the cancer, the operations or his prognosis. I didn’t want to be nosy; I figured he would tell me what he wanted to, and the rest was his business.

One evening the landlord of the pub threw a fund-raising event for cancer research. First prize in the raffle was dinner for two at a Michelin-starred restaurant. By accident or design, Mikey won it. At the end of the evening, he hopped up to me, put his arm around my waist and whispered into my ear, “Will you come with me?”

I saved my tip money so we could take a taxi to the restaurant. Formal attire was required, so Mikey dug out a tie and an outrageous purple and green plaid suit, which he wore with the trouser leg tucked into his waistband to hide his stump. The restaurant was filled with dapper-looking businessmen dining in bored composure with clients or wives.

Mikey and I felt spot-lit in the middle of the room — the skinny blond chick in a floaty goth dress with multiple ear piercings, and the dude in the loud suit with half a leg. It was obvious we didn’t belong, and we milked it for all it was worth.

The waiters gave us special treatment, perhaps relieved by the break in the monotony, showering us with attention as if aware that this was a once-in-a-lifetime event, which it was. The meal was seven courses, throughout which a jazz band played on the far side of an empty dance floor.

“Do you think anyone ever actually dances?” Mikey said after we finished dessert.

“I shouldn’t think so,” I replied, looking around at the formality of the patrons, who were studiously ignoring both the jazz band and the waiters, as if displaying any interest might betray a lack of savoir-faire.

“Would you like to dance?” Mikey asked, a gleam in his eye.

“Can you?”

“If you don’t mind holding me up.”

I followed him to the dance floor, where he handed his crutches to a waiter. The sleepy jazz band perked up. Mikey put his arms around my shoulders and leaned heavily on me, and the two of us made slow, three-legged progress around the floor, hugging each other to keep our balance.

Everybody watched us while pretending not to. I giggled, feeling like we were in a movie. Mikey looked like he was on the greatest adventure of his life, and I felt happier than I have ever felt, before or since, while dancing with a man.

In the taxi afterward, just before he dropped me home, Mikey kissed me on the lips. His mouth was soft and cushiony. When I pulled back, he looked at me with an expression I couldn’t quite interpret — a combination, perhaps, of respect and regret.

Mikey asked me out a second time, to a party some friends of his were giving at their house. I went but felt awkward all evening, as if I were an impostor. These people had known Mikey forever, and I was taking him away when there seemed to be a tacit need for them to spend as much time with him as possible.

I left feeling as if my presence in Mikey’s life had been an intrusion. Unable to label what I was to him, and certain I was monopolizing his attention unfairly, I pulled back.

Another guy started drinking nightly at the pub; this one who wore a bandanna like a pirate and rode a motorcycle. I wanted to learn how to ride a motorcycle, so this seemed like a good enough reason to start dating him.

I didn’t explain this new relationship to Mikey, nor did he ask.

When I turned 21 later that year, I gave a birthday party to which Mikey came. He caught me alone during the course of the evening, while the biker was occupied buying pints at the bar.

“I bought this for you,” he said, handing me a small black jewelry box. Inside was a gold pin in the shape of a tiger with diamonds for eyes. I opened and closed my mouth, unable to find any words.

“I want to give you my blessing,” Mikey said. “You have my blessing.”

A few months later Mikey died. I didn’t go to the funeral because I was unsure of his friends’ feelings toward me. I was just some girl who had trespassed out from behind the bar, who had briefly become something unnamable in Mikey’s life.

I didn’t believe I had the right to grieve for someone who had not quite been my friend, not quite my boyfriend, not quite anything I could put a label on. I felt ashamed and embarrassed, but I couldn’t articulate why.

Twenty years later I went back to the pub, hoping to discover where Mikey had been buried. I wanted to tell him I had loved him but hadn’t known how to have platonic love with a man. I wanted to apologize for coming into his life with my mixed signals so soon before he died.

I wanted to tell him I wished I had been brave enough to ask questions about how he felt, what he was going through, how I could be a friend to him. I wanted to say I was sorry if anything I had done, or any way I had behaved, had hurt him. I wanted to ask him to forgive me for being so young, so thoughtless, so insecure, so naïve.

But the pub had changed ownership and nobody had heard of a kid named Mikey who loped around on one leg, a boy with a ready smile and sweet heart. A boy who makes me cry even when I think of him now.","Recognizing What They Had, 20 Years Too Late",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/style/modern-love-recognizing-what-they-had-20-years-too-late.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Global Health Deadly Plague Outbreak in Madagascar Appears to Wane Image Patients in quarantine at a plague treatment center in Toamasina, Madagascar. The outbreak appears to have peaked. Credit Rijasolo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images

The large plague outbreak that began in Madagascar in August appears to be waning, according to government case counts and local news reports.

The outbreak has infected about 1,800 people so far, killing 127 of them.

A World Health Organization spokesman, Tarik Jasarevic, confirmed reports in Malagasy media that both deaths and new cases were declining and most hospitalized patients had recovered, although “we cannot rule out the possibility of further spikes.”

An Oct. 31 situation report from W.H.O.’s Africa region shows cases peaking in mid-October; Madagascar confirmed its first plague death by laboratory testing only on September 11.

The man thought to have triggered the outbreak — who was initially assumed to have malaria — died in August after he rode minibus taxis through two major cities, spreading the disease.

If the outbreak is under control, it will be a testament to the relatively rapid response by health authorities on the Indian Ocean island, assisted by the W.H.O., the International Red Cross, Unicef, Doctors Without Borders, Doctors of the World, the United States Agency for International Development, and other organizations.

The annual plague season typically peaks in December and lasts into April, but this year’s outbreak was unusual. Cases are usually concentrated in the rice-farming central highlands and spread by flea bites, producing in victims the swollen lymph glands of bubonic plague.

This year, most cases were in cities and of the pneumonic variety, which is spread by coughing.

The island’s director of health promotion, Dr. Manitra Rakotoarivony, said on local radio this week that there were “almost no more deaths,” Agence France-Presse reported. Daily bulletins from the National Office for Risk and Disaster Management bore that out.

Health authorities in Madagascar initially closed all schools, sprayed insecticide for fleas and banned public gatherings. Nine treatment centers were designated.

At roadside checkpoints all over the country, newly trained health workers boarded buses and taxis with thermometers to test passengers for fever. (The price for an infrared thermometer soared as high as $70, the AFP said.)

In cities, checkpoints were set up at banks and other buildings with heavy foot traffic.

Although many East African and Indian Ocean nations went on the alert, the disease has not spread to any other countries. A hospitalized Seychelles resident who initially tested positive for plague on his return from Madagascar was later found to be negative by more sophisticated tests.

Some alarmist news reports have suggested that the plague’s spread was driven by the Malagasy ritual of Famadihana, or the “turning of the bones.”

Relatives remove the bodies of their ancestors from family crypts, wrap them in new shrouds, catch them up on family gossip and dance with them . It usually occurs from July to September.

But medical experts dismissed the idea. The disinterred corpses are usually those of ancestors who died at least seven years previously. The withered remains do not attract fleas and, obviously, cannot cough.

Transmission could occur between live humans at the ceremonies, but they are far smaller than the sporting events, concerts and other gatherings that were banned to prevent the outbreak from spreading.

And after really big floods, the program must rely on armies of subcontractors to determine payments, baffling and infuriating policyholders, like Mr. Clutter, who cannot figure out who is opposing their claims, or why.

Roy E. Wright, who has directed the flood insurance program for FEMA since June 2015, acknowledged in an interview on Friday that major changes were called for and said some were already in the works. The program’s rate-setting methods, for example, are 30 years old, he said, and new ones will be phased in over the next two years. But other changes — like cutting off coverage to homes that are repeatedly flooded — would require an act of Congress.

“The administration feels very strongly that there needs to be reform this year,” he said. “I believe strongly that we need to expand flood coverage in the United States, and the private insurers are part of that.”

The federal program was created to fill a void left after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, when multiple levees failed, swamping an area bigger than West Virginia and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. Insurers, terrified of the never-ending claims they might have to pay, started to exclude flooding from homeowners’ insurance policies. For decades, your only hope if your home was damaged in a flood was disaster relief from the government.

Policymakers thought an insurance program would be better than ad hoc bailouts. If crafted properly, it would make developers and homeowners pay for the risks they took.

When Congress established the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968, it hoped to revive the private flood-insurance market. Initially about 130 insurers gave it a shot, pooling their capital with the government. But there were clashes, and eventually the government drove out the insurers and took over most operations.

Since 1983, Washington has set the insurance rates, mapped the floodplains, written the rules and borne all of the risk. The role of private insurers has been confined to marketing policies and processing claims, as government contractors.

That worked for a few decades. But now, relentless coastal development and the increasing frequency of megastorms and billion-dollar floods have changed the calculus.

Unable to Keep Up With the Floods The National Flood Insurance Program has been in the red since 2005, when Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans and it suddenly had to pay out $16.3 billion in claims. $16 billion Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria National Flood Insurance Program: 14 12 Total premiums collected 10 Flood loss claims paid 8 Hurricane Sandy 6 Hurricane Katrina 4 2 0 ’78 ’80 ’85 ’90 ’95 ’00 ’05 ’12 ’17 billion $16 National Flood Insurance Program: 14 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria Total premiums collected 12 Hurricane Katrina Flood loss claims paid 10 8 Hurricane Sandy 6 4 2 0 ’78 ’80 ’85 ’90 ’95 ’00 ’05 ’12 ’17

“Put plainly, the N.F.I.P. is not designed to handle catastrophic losses like those caused by Harvey, Irma and Maria,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in a letter to members of Congress after the three huge hurricanes barreled into the United States this season.

Mr. Mulvaney called on Congress to forgive $16 billion of the program’s debt, which both houses agreed to do.

The program, however, needs more than a financial lifeline: Without major, long-term changes, it will just burn through the $16 billion in savings and be back for more.

The White House is hoping to lure companies back into the market, letting them try to turn a profit on underwriting flood policies instead of simply processing claims for the government.

One measure proposed by the Trump administration is for the government to stop writing coverage on newly built houses on floodplains, starting in 2021. New construction there is supposed to be flood-resistant, and if the government retreats, private insurers may step in. Or so the theory goes.

“The private market is anxious, willing and completely able to take everything except the severe repetitive-loss properties,” said Craig Poulton, chief executive of Poulton Associates, which underwrites American risks for Lloyd’s of London, the big international insurance marketplace.

“Severe repetitive-loss properties” is FEMA’s term for houses that are flooded again and again. There are tens of thousands of them. While they account for fewer than 1 percent of the government’s policies, they make up more than 10 percent of the insurance claims, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, which sued FEMA to get the data.

The Trump administration has also proposed creating a new category of properties that are at extreme risk of repeat flooding and that could have their insurance cut off the next time they flooded.

That might sound harsh. Environmental groups, though, argue it’s worse to repeatedly repair doomed houses on flood-prone sites as oceans warm and sea levels rise. The Natural Resources Defense Council argues that the flood-insurance program should buy such properties so the owners can move somewhere safer.

The program, however, has only limited authority to make such purchases; homeowners need to line up funding through other government agencies. As a result, such buyouts are rare.

“I have mounds and mounds of paper, and I’m still waiting,” said Olga McKissic of Louisville, Ky., who applied for a buyout in 2015 after her house flooded for the fifth time. “I want them to tear it down.”

Ms. McKissic even had her house classified as a severe repetitive-loss property, thinking FEMA would give it higher priority. But FEMA has not responded to her application. Instead, it doubled her premiums.","A Broke, and Broken, Flood Insurance Program",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/a-broke-and-broken-flood-insurance-program.html

Daniel Stiles, a self-styled ape trafficking detective in Kenya, had been scouring Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp for weeks, looking for pictures of gorillas, chimps or orangutans. He was hoping to chip away at an illicit global trade that has captured or killed tens of thousands of apes and pushed some endangered species to the brink of extinction.

“The way they do business,” he said of ape traffickers, “makes the Mafia look like amateurs.”

After hundreds of searches, Mr. Stiles found an Instagram account offering dozens of rare animals for sale, including baby chimpanzees and orangutans dressed in children’s clothes. He sent an email to an address on the account — “looking for young otans” (the industry standard slang for orangutans) — and several days later received a reply.

“2 babies, 7.5k each. Special introductory price.”

The trafficker identified himself only as Tom and said he was based in Southeast Asia. Mr. Stiles knew what Tom was hoping for: to sell the infant orangutans to a private collector or unscrupulous zoo, where they are often beaten or drugged into submission and used for entertainment like mindlessly banging on drums or boxing one another. Such ape shows are a growing business in Southeast Asia, despite international regulations that prohibit trafficking in endangered apes.

Several weeks later, after a few more rounds of text messages with Tom to firm up the details, Mr. Stiles decided to fly to Bangkok.

“I was way out on a limb,” Mr. Stiles admitted later. But he was eager to bring down Tom, who indicated that he could find orangutans and chimps with only a few days’ notice, the mark of a major dealer.","Smuggled, Beaten and Drugged: The Illicit Global Ape Trade",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/africa/ape-trafficking-bonobos-orangutans.html

Instead, ask a professional. Your superintendent or other building staff may do the job, although some buildings do not permit staff to handle air-conditioners. Since people take their units out anytime from Labor Day to Thanksgiving, you should not have too much trouble finding time in the super’s schedule to get the work done.

Just be prepared to pay, since it might be considered an off-the-clock job. “Lots of people will give the super $20 or $100 and have him do it, which is generally fine,” said Daniel Wollman, the chief executive of Gumley Haft, a Manhattan property management company.

Find out if you can store the unit in the basement. If not, be prepared to sacrifice the bottom of a closet to the appliance — or, worse, to pretend that the hulking object on the floor is an end table.

Some New York City companies, like CoolAir in Queens and Air-Wave in the Bronx, will store your air-conditioners in their warehouses. Both companies charge about $279 to remove, clean, store and then reinstall an air-conditioner.

MONDAY PUZZLE — Jay Kaskel takes us another step closer to the most boo-tiful day of the year with a puzzle about a stereotypical witch.

First Witch: When shall we three meet again

In thunder, lightning, or in rain? Second Witch: When the hurly-burly’s done,

When the battle’s lost and won. — Macbeth, Act I, Scene 1

Today’s Theme

Four phrases are reinterpreted as things that might be in the life of a witch. For example, witches cast spells, so “Computer help for a witch?” would be SPELL CHECK. Similarly, WARTS AND ALL at 41A is “How one might be forced to accept a witch?” because a witch has at least one wart. (Practitioners of witchcraft, please do not write to me objecting to this. I know you do not have warts. We’re talking about the cartoon stereotype.)

Tricky Clues

61A: If you are knowledgeable about poetry, KEATS might have been a gimme. I had John DONNE at first, but I know enough about cooking to know that a “Stir-fry vessel” is not a WOD, it’s a WOK.

19D: We’re talking about slang for money here. “Bill worth 100 smackers” is a C SPOT, which must be very rare, since multitudes of relationship experts have written about trying to find it.

Constructor Notes

I originally set out to create a Halloween-themed puzzle that incorporated all the familiar characters associated with Halloween: witches, ghosts, skeletons, vampires and zombies. But the theme never felt tight enough. After a while, I settled on a witch/BROOM HILDA-themed puzzle and sent it off. While Will liked the idea, he felt young solvers might not be familiar with the character. So not only did I have to replace BROOM HILDA at 58-Across, I had to do some serious re-cluing (CHARM SCHOOL, for example, was clued as “Educational institution attended by 58-Across?”) Here’s where things got tricky. One of the original theme entries was WITCH HUNT, which meant I couldn’t use the word “witch” in the clues. “Educational institution attended by a Halloween broom-rider” just didn’t do the trick. It felt too forced. In the end, I simply dropped WITCH HUNT as an answer, and thankfully Will was O.K. with the puzzle having just four main fills. As always, I can’t tell you how much of a treat it is to see one of my puzzles in The New York Times.

Thanks for dropping by, Mr. Kaskel.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember yesterday, when I said that you might as well solve the Friday because it wasn’t as hard as you would imagine it to be and besides, the Saturday puzzle would be much harder? Well, they don’t pay me the medium-sized bucks for nothing. Today’s puzzle by Samuel A. Donaldson and Brad Wilber is a real ... let’s just call it a learning experience, O.K.?

The bottom line on this very worthy puzzle: It’s tough, but it’s not tougher than you. Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11, as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

Kudos to Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Wilber for debuting seven fabulous entries, the best of which, in my opinion, is COSMIC JOKE.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

In her work, Ms. Zenoff suggests people simply say, “I’m in recovery,” without identifying themselves as a member of A.A. or another 12-step program.
According to Facing Addiction, one in three American households have a family member in active addiction, in recovery or lost to an overdose.
It’s so pervasive that when Ms. Zenoff took over the Center for Open Recovery in 2014, her own board members, many in recovery, were reluctant to post their names on the organization’s website.
Stephen Simon, one of the funders behind the Center for Open Recovery, understands the hesitancy.","Speaking up, however, carries real risk. People — especially doctors and pilots and others in similarly sensitive occupations — fear losing jobs, promotions and social standing if they admit they’re in recovery. The paradox is that stigma is most effectively dispelled through openness.

The need has never been greater. Approximately 21 million Americans suffer from substance abuse. On average, 175 die from overdoses every day.

“People are dying who don’t need to die,” Ms. Zenoff said. “If it were safe for more people to say, ‘I’m in recovery,’ I think many more people could say, ‘I need help.’ ”

Other nonprofit groups, like Faces & Voices of Recovery in the District of Columbia, Facing Addiction in Connecticut, and Shatterproof in New York, are also encouraging the 23 million Americans in recovery to be more vocal. Even grieving families are growing more honest in obituaries, mentioning addiction as a cause of death with greater frequency.

This openness flies in the face of tradition. Since Alcoholics Anonymous was founded in 1935, anonymity has been the recovery community’s bedrock. In 12-step meetings, people identify themselves by first names only. Outside “the rooms,” they often don’t reveal that they are members of these programs at all.

As the mother of a young adult in recovery, I’ve seen the miracles these programs make possible. Anonymity creates a sense of safety that recovering addicts desperately need. Twelve-step programs save countless lives. There are many reasons not to tamper with them.

But I’ve also met men and women who are 20, even 30, years sober. They’ve overcome adversity and often trauma to live lives of courage, resilience and grace. I have seen their stories in “The Anonymous People,” a documentary directed by a co-founder of Facing Addiction, Greg Williams.

We need to hear more from them. There’s a way to share these stories while still honoring the traditions. In her work, Ms. Zenoff suggests people simply say, “I’m in recovery,” without identifying themselves as a member of A.A. or another 12-step program.

In fact, many recovering addicts are not in a traditional program. Some manage recovery independently. Others join Refuge Recovery, a program based on Buddhist principles, or Smart Recovery, which encourages reliance on self rather than a “higher power.”

No matter the path, why should they remain silent? “It’s like being a vegan but only being able to talk about it in a kitchen or a hospital,” Ms. Zenoff said, “or with another vegan.”

This spring, the Center for Open Recovery ran posters on San Francisco Muni buses, featuring vibrant people of all races, accompanied by the tagline “This Is Recovery.” For inspiration, the organization looked to the “Silence = Death” posters that raised awareness years earlier, encouraging openness despite the stigma.

At the onset of the AIDS epidemic, many Americans blamed gay men for bringing the fatal disease upon themselves. Unenlightened Americans today consider addiction a moral failing as well, one as likely to spur a trip to prison as to a treatment center.

“The Act Up marches, the AIDS quilt and the posters made people more sympathetic, and made gay people seem more human,” said Daniel Royles, an AIDS historian at Florida International University.

The activists shifted people’s understanding of the disease. After several years of pressure from people with AIDS and their supporters, to give one example, the federal Health Resources and Services Administration spending on AIDS programs increased more than thirteenfold in 1991, to $220.6 million from $16.5 million.

The government hasn’t yet done the same for addiction, even though this treatable disease kills more Americans every year than AIDS at its 1995 peak.

Consider how addiction compares with other diseases: In 2016, the National Institutes of Health devoted $5.6 billion to public research funding on cancer and $3 billion on AIDS. Substance abuse disorders received $1.6 billion, even though one-and-a-half times more people suffer from addiction than from all cancers combined. President Trump’s recent declaration of the opioid crisis as a “public health emergency” provided no immediate additional funding.

Despite the headlines, we’re still a nation in denial. According to Facing Addiction, one in three American households have a family member in active addiction, in recovery or lost to an overdose. But a survey by the organization also showed that nearly half of respondents weren’t convinced it’s an illness — despite a 2016 surgeon general’s report defining addiction as a “chronic neurological disorder.”

Jim Hood, Facing Addiction’s co-founder and chief executive, joked that addiction “is an illness that nobody is ever going to get, nobody ever has and nobody ever has had.”

People in active addiction — who can act in baffling ways — are perhaps less likely to change our perceptions of substance abusers. But what if addiction’s human face was your minister, who’d once struggled with heroin? Or your favorite college professor, who kicked a drinking habit and eventually earned her Ph.D.?

If Americans heard enough stories, would they clamor for more research funding and treatment beds then?

The decision to speak up is personal — and the stigma is real, especially in the workplace. It’s so pervasive that when Ms. Zenoff took over the Center for Open Recovery in 2014, her own board members, many in recovery, were reluctant to post their names on the organization’s website.

Stephen Simon, one of the funders behind the Center for Open Recovery, understands the hesitancy. The co-founder of a San Francisco investment firm and a member of the family that owns the Indiana Pacers basketball team, Mr. Simon, 51, has been sober for five years, after battling opioid painkillers. He’s open with his recovery privately, yet expressed “vulnerability” about speaking publicly. He agreed to be identified here only because of the staggering numbers of people suffering and dying.

“It’s so bad that I think anyone who’s been given a reprieve from the horrific nature of this disease should at least consider talking about it,” Mr. Simon said. “Maybe it will free up dollars or spur people with ideas and influence to bring an end to the epidemic. We can’t even measure what addiction is doing to the collective soul of the world.”",Let’s Open Up About Addiction and Recovery,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/opinion/sunday/drug-addiction-recovery-alcoholism.html

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

“Most of the crew thought that the film was a bit odd while we were making it,” he told The Times of London in 2012. “We doubted that it would ever be shown. And I remember someone asking me what I was doing and I said, ‘It’s sort of a space western and one of the heroes is a dustbin.’ ”

“Star Wars,” the surprise hit of the year, won six Oscars, including the one for Mr. Mollo’s costumes. He accepted it at the award ceremonies flanked by actors dressed as Darth Vader and storm troopers.

John Mollo was born in London on March 18, 1931. His mother, the former Ella Cockell, was an artist. His father, Eugene Mollo, escaped Russia in the 1920s and started a company built around a process for spraying cement.

Mr. Mollo traced his love of military uniforms to his watching the film “Clive of India” (1935) when he was a child and returning home from the movie theater to sketch the costume of King George II of Britain. He grew up in London and near the town of Farnham, in Surrey, and studied in a local school in Godalming before attending an art school in Farnham.

Mr. Mollo served in the King’s Shropshire Light Infantry in Hong Kong, ending his service shortly before the Korean War began.

After returning home, he helped run his father’s cement company and studied military history on the side, conferring with historians and conducting his own research. His other books include “Military Fashion” (1972) and “Uniforms of the Seven Years War” (1977, also with illustrations by Malcolm McGregor).

His first film work came by way of his brother, Andrew, who was also a military historian and film consultant. Andrew recommended him for Tony Richardson’s remake of “The Charge of the Light Brigade” (1968), set in the Crimean War. Mr. Mollo supervised the creation of about 3,000 military uniforms.

Mr. Mollo also designed costumes for science fiction films like Ridley Scott’s “Alien” (1979) and Paul W. S. Anderson’s “Event Horizon” (1997).

Erica Wyatt struggled to pay down her debts and then searched for two years before she managed to get a mortgage from Fifth Third Bank to buy a four-bedroom home for $92,000. The transaction happened only because Ms. Wyatt, a single mother with four children, received $15,000 in down payment assistance.

Ms. Wyatt, who grew up in Detroit, said she was determined to move back into the city after renting a home in a suburb. “I wanted to make sure my children saw that not all of Detroit is bad and there are some beautiful neighborhoods,” said Ms. Wyatt, 39, who works for an insurance company.

Some of the ideas seem like stopgap measures. A social services group’s community of “tiny homes” — 400-square-foot structures with nothing more than a bedroom, a bathroom and small kitchen — is being erected to provide housing to homeless and handicapped people. The project, led by Reverend Faith Fowler, executive director of Cass Community Social Services, is taking place on a plot of vacant land the charitable organization bought from the city.

The dollhouse-like structures — seven so far — are near the organization’s main social services facility, in a rather desolate area of Detroit off Rosa Parks Boulevard. In all, Ms. Fowler hopes to build two dozen small homes, which will be rented for as little as $250 a month and eventually deeded over after seven years to a select group of homeless or poor individuals.

Tiny-house living can take adjustment, even for people with no roof over their heads at all. Ms. Fowler said that one homeless veteran told her the homes were too small to compete with a traditional homeless shelter.

Still, for some, the homes are perfect. One of the first tenants to move in this past summer is a former Methodist minister, David Leenhouts, who was forced to give up his ministry near Cleveland because of health issues that make it difficult for him to walk and talk.

Mr. Leenhouts, who grew up in the Detroit area, said his college-age son told him the small home, with a steepled ceiling, was all he needed because everything is within just a few steps. Mr. Leenhouts, 59, said, “I have no idea where I would be living if I was not chosen for a tiny house.”

That said, a cluster of tiny homes hardly seems scalable in a city as big as Detroit. And almost by definition, a tiny home isn’t a viable option for a family with children.

It’s also an example of why the long-term prognosis for Detroit’s housing market remains uncertain at best. Much of the work underway is taking place block-by-block — much like the tiny-home homeless experiment — and there are a lot of blocks in this 139-square-mile city.

“The pilot programs help some people, but they are on the margin,” said Gregory Markus, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan and executive director of Detroit Action Commonwealth, an advocacy group for low-income residents. “‘The root problem is that Detroit is the poorest big city in America.”’

The national poverty rate is 14 percent, and Detroit’s is 36 percent. Mr. Markus said that, without more jobs, home buying will remain a largely unattainable goal.

Detroit’s population peaked in the 1950s at nearly 2 million and has been falling ever since. The financial crisis and the city’s bankruptcy filing in 2013 hollowed out what was left of its once large, middle-class African-American community. Over the past decade there have been more than 150,000 home foreclosures here.",Detroit: From Motor City to Housing Incubator,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/detroit-housing.html

Mostly Muslims, they earn their keep by performing for Hindus who live in sturdy huts built of stone.

So it came as no surprise when Aamad Khan, a poor singer with deep-set eyes, was summoned to a nearby temple one night to play his harmonium, an air-driven organ. He was told to use his music to inspire the Hindu goddess Durga to enter the body of a local faith healer who happened to smell of alcohol that September evening.

WASHINGTON — Deaths by drug overdose in the United States surged last year by more than 17 percent over 2015, another sign of the growing addiction crisis caused by opioids, according to a report released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Preliminary data from the 50 states show that from the fourth quarter of 2015, through the fourth quarter of 2016, the rate of fatal overdoses rose to nearly 20 people per 100,000 from 16.3 per 100,000.

A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

FRIDAY PUZZLE — There are two kinds of people: Those who like their crosswords knotty and difficult, and those who pray for mercy just so they can make some headway. Eventually, and with enough practice, the mercy-seekers become the challenge-seekers. And then they claim that they have given up on doing the early week puzzles, because those are way too easy.

It’s a fair point. For some solvers, the Monday and Tuesday puzzles don’t present much of a challenge, but those puzzles are not really for them. They are for the people still getting the hang of solving, and for the ones who can appreciate a good, straightforward theme. They are for those who like to start their week on a positive note, with a win.

So the solvers who crave more of a challenge wait all week for the Friday and Saturday puzzles — they might even indulge themselves in a Thursday, with its gimmicky themes — and claim to be disappointed if the Friday is “too easy” for them. Don’t say “No, I would never do that”: I’ve seen you on Twitter.

BRUSSELS — The former president of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, and four former members of his regional government turned themselves in to the Belgian police on Sunday morning, a spokesman for the Brussels prosecutor’s office said.

The spokesman, Gilles Dejemeppe, said that they would be questioned over the next 24 hours by an investigative judge, who will decide whether to keep them in jail or to order any other measures, such as house arrest.

A Spanish judge issued an international arrest warrant on Friday for Mr. Puigdemont and the four former members of his cabinet, who left Catalonia for Brussels. The warrant was sent to the Belgian federal prosecutor.

Mr. Puigdemont told RTBF, a Belgian television broadcaster, on Friday that he was “completely available to cooperate” with the Belgian court system, which he called “the real justice.”

“At this point there are no guarantees of getting a just and independent trial which could escape the enormous pressure and influence of politics on the judicial powers in Spain,” Mr. Puigdemont said.

They found that Armillaria fungi had expanded their genomes by copying certain chunks of it, which meant additional capacity for making new rules of behavior. In a way, the fungus had more genes involved in making it really good at being bad. For example, the team found extra proteins for killing cells and gobbling up the glue that holds plant cell walls together.

They also found special tactics for hiding: Armillaria can reabsorb substances lost in the soil that alert trees of their presence and avoid the tree’s full defenses. This lets them kill trees undetected and start leeching nutrients from the dead stuff before competing bacteria and fungi arrived. And if and when competitors do show up, Armillaria can create a chemical environment intolerable for them.

However they find their hosts, pathogenic Armillaria are ancient. They arrived an estimated 21 million years ago and stuck around for a reason.

In healthy, natural, diverse forests, the fungi absorb carbon and kill only the weakest trees, like gangly, underground forest rangers. But in monocultures made up of genetically identical trees, stresses like drought can cause all the trees to fall weak simultaneously.

“This is how Armillaria can wipe out entire forests,” said György Sipos, a biologist at the University of Sopron in Hungary who led the study with László Nagy, of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

TOKYO — President Trump has spoken with the king of Saudi Arabia to offer a wholehearted endorsement of a drive to modernize the kingdom, as the Saudi authorities arrested scores of prominent business people and ministers in a sweeping anti-corruption crackdown.

In an unusually lengthy and detailed readout of the call made on Saturday, the White House said that Mr. Trump had thanked King Salman for Saudi Arabia’s support in fighting terrorism and for its purchase of military equipment from the United States. And he praised the king’s favorite son and top adviser, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, for his recent calls for tolerance and moderation in Saudi society.

“The king and crown prince’s recent public statements regarding the need to build a moderate, peaceful and tolerant region are essential to ensuring a hopeful future for the Saudi people, to curtailing terrorist funding, and to defeating radical ideology — once and for all — so the world can be safe from its evil,” the White House said in the statement.

The White House statement made no mention of the scores of arrests, including that of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire investor who has held stakes in an array of Western companies, including the News Corporation, Citigroup and Twitter. Prince Mohammed, who has already sidelined rivals to the throne, is viewed as the mastermind behind the crackdown.

Prince Alwaleed sparred with Mr. Trump on Twitter during the presidential election, referring to him as a “disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.” Mr. Trump fired back, also on Twitter, that he was a “dopey prince” trying to “control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money.”

The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said.
Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq.
“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

Any such switch would create a special complication for Connecticut since the northern part of the state is closely tied to Massachusetts, while many residents of the southern section commute to New York City.

The most frequently cited argument against a change is its effect on schoolchildren, who would most likely board buses in the dark on winter mornings. Proponents counter that the whole state of Maine, as well as communities including Boston, are considering pushing school start times back, too.

Plus, opponents say, such a change could create confusion for businesses and chaos for passengers taking Amtrak trains from New York to Boston and trying to figure out what time it is. Broadcast schedules — and with them, teams like the Patriots and the Bruins — could be affected as well.

“Once you start toying with the clocks, there are repercussions that people don’t bear in mind,” said Michael Downing, the author of “Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time.”

Time was kept locally in the United States until 1883, when railroad companies established the time zones. Daylight saving time began in Europe during World War I as an effort to save energy. It was adopted by the United States in 1918 but repealed the following year after strident objections from farmers, who preferred having more light in the morning, not in the evening.

But more cosmopolitan and some Eastern areas, like New York City and the state of Massachusetts, decided to keep it, opening up an inconsistent approach to timekeeping until Congress split the difference in 1966 and set the rule as six months of standard time and six months of daylight saving time. It is now observed between the middle of March and the beginning of November — except in Arizona and Hawaii, which have opted out.

If nothing else, the bills have sparked renewed rumination on time and light here in New England, and many people have their reasons for considering a change.

“Definitely it would mean a longer day of business,” said Lynn Archer, a chef who owns two restaurants in Rockland, Me., and groaned the other day as the harbor there glowed pink during an early evening sunset.

But the idea has left others — including the editorial board of The Bangor Daily News — aghast, saying it would isolate the state and hurt business. Plus, many Mainers are used to things as they are.

Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.

Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.

But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.

Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.

The most remarkable sign of Amazon’s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.

The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.

Next week, Google’s top lawyer, along with general counsels from Facebook and Twitter, will testify in front of lawmakers investigating how Russia used social media and technology platforms in the United States to influence the 2016 election.

On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google’s pending appearance before Congress.

Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share — surpassing Wall Street’s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue — up 24 percent — while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.

In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company’s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.

Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.

With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company’s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion — or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.

Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.

But in the past several years, Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.

While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.

The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.

Microsoft executives credited much of the company’s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft’s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.

The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.

While Microsoft’s attempts at selling some kinds of devices have been a disappointment — its foray into making smartphones was a bomb — its Surface line of computers showed positive results, rising 12 percent to $1.04 billion in revenue.",What Worries?

“There’s diversity of views in all caucuses, and so nothing’s guaranteed in life,” Mr. Inslee said.","Perhaps most ambitious of all, Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, harbors dreams of enacting a muscular carbon pricing plan along with California, Oregon and officials in Canada. In an interview, Mr. Inslee said the special election in Eastside Seattle could open the way for broad action, including taxing carbon but also joint initiatives on energy efficiency, research and clean water.

“We intend to make a full-scale effort in the next session of the Legislature if we win,” he said. “It will be a bell in the night, showing hope for the country, rejecting the Trump agenda of denying climate science.”

A coastal alliance, Mr. Inslee added, especially when cities such as Seattle and Portland, Ore., and throughout California are booming economically, would help make the case to a national audience that addressing climate change through energy policy is good for business and job creation.

“The more we can have uniformity in a carbon pricing system or regulatory system, the better,” he said.

Both parties see Democrats as favored to win the district, which voted heavily for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Republicans held the area’s State Senate seat largely because of the personal popularity of an incumbent lawmaker, Andy Hill, who died of lung cancer last fall.

Despite their dominance at the federal level and in most state capitals, West Coast Republicans have been driven to the point of extinction as the party’s standing has plummeted in prosperous cities and suburbs, from San Diego to Seattle. Their candidate in the State Senate race, Jinyoung Lee Englund, a polished former political operative, has strained to set herself apart from the national party, declaring that she did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 and pleading with voters to embrace divided government in Olympia.

Ms. Englund, 33, has campaigned explicitly against the “blue wall” scenario, warning that voters should not let Washington “go the way of California” and other one-party states. She expressed deep skepticism of Mr. Inslee’s climate proposals and suggested Democrats were mainly focused on trying to raise general revenue by another name. Republican groups have aired commercials saying that “Seattle liberals” could wreak havoc on the state’s finances if Democrats are allowed to govern unchecked.

“You don’t want to go the way of Oregon,” Ms. Englund said in an interview. “Washingtonians are more independent.”

Ms. Englund rebuked Democrats for what she characterized as using the state government as a partisan bludgeon. “I think that’s wrong,” she said. “The role of a state senator is not to go and lambaste what’s happening nationally.”

But the 45th District, a diverse suburban patchwork that stretches across the high-tech haven of Redmond and into more rural territory beyond — north and east of Bellevue — is emblematic of the territory that has lurched away from the Republican Party over the last year, recoiling from Mr. Trump’s brand of hard nationalism. Manka Dhingra, the Democratic candidate, has led in the polls by a comfortable but not overwhelming margin.

Ms. Dhingra, 43, a gregarious career prosecutor, has pledged support for an array of Democratic wish-list policies — though in a nod to the district’s moderate history, her campaign literature promises “independent leadership.” She has endorsed a carbon tax and applauded the state’s insistent litigation against the White House. Ms. Dhingra said in an interview that state government should take comprehensive action to check “what’s coming out of Washington, D.C.”

“Frankly, I think all states are going to have to do that,” Ms. Dhingra said. “We have to make sure immigrants feel safe. We have to make sure women’s health care is protected.”

Republican leaders in the state concede the national backdrop has made a tough race even harder. Rob McKenna, a former state attorney general who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Inslee in 2012, said an upset is possible but called the “Trump factor” a drag on Ms. Englund.

Mr. McKenna cautioned that even a Democratic victory should not be overinterpreted as a political turning point. A setback for Republicans, he said, would not change the fundamental character of the state, which he described as more politically competitive and fiscally conservative than its coastal neighbors.

“This is a state that is still, more or less, 50-50,” Mr. McKenna said, predicting of Democrats: “They’ll have difficulties, because they’ll be reluctant to risk their majorities in the House and the Senate.”

Other local leaders are less sure, holding up the Seattle area as an illustrative example of an upwardly mobile metropolitan area shifting to the left. If Republicans have staked their message, in large part, on suburban distrust of the big city, the region is increasingly knitted together by a thriving tech economy at companies like Amazon and Microsoft, and an expanding rapid transit rail network that is tying people closer to Seattle.

Dow Constantine, the King County executive and a Democrat, said that the once very real political divisions of the region — Democratic-leaning Seattle on the West Side of Lake Washington, Republican-leaning enclaves to the east — have been shattered by demographic change, too, especially as the immigrants who came to work in tech jobs encouraged others in the countries they left to follow them.

“The comical attempts to demonize Seattle in the 45th District race, I think, will be shown to have been a poor strategy,” Mr. Constantine said.

The area’s shifting identity has been on vivid display in this election: As Ms. Dhingra went door to door on Wednesday in Duvall, a growing outer suburb built across rolling farmlands, some voters sounded eager to repudiate Republicans. Patty Andrus, a retired special education teacher, described Ms. Dhingra’s campaign as a corrective to Mr. Trump’s election.

With a Democratic takeover in Washington State, she said, “I would stand up taller.”

Even some Republican-leaning voters who back Ms. Englund say they are uneasy about Mr. Trump. “She seems sensible and levelheaded,” Ed Whitehead, the retired owner of a printing company, said of Ms. Englund after she stopped at his door in Sammamish.

Mr. Whitehead, who said he voted for Mr. Trump, said these days he is “not so sure” about the president.

Still, amid their exuberance, Democrats concede it could take time to assemble substantial policy achievements. Should they win, Democrats would be governing with the slimmest possible majority and with just one short legislative session before the next election in 2018. And like Democrats in other parts of the nation, they are divided. In 2013, two Democratic state senators crossed the aisle to caucus with the Republicans, creating a coalition majority, and wounds still linger from the 2016 presidential election, when Senator Bernie Sanders won in the Democratic caucuses but then lost to Hillary Clinton in the primary election.

Ms. Dhingra suggested that the session might become mainly a chance for Democrats to prove themselves responsible, rather than as a lunge toward California-like status. The Democratic caucus, she noted, is not homogeneous: “You have rural-area Democrats who have different priorities.”

Mr. Inslee, too, said Democrats should temper their expectations, even as he made plain his excitement about governing with a freer hand.

“There’s diversity of views in all caucuses, and so nothing’s guaranteed in life,” Mr. Inslee said. “But what this does is, it takes the shackles off the doors.”","Poised for West Coast Dominance, Democrats Eye Grand Agenda",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/washington-state-west-politics-democrats.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“We were shocked to learn the news that Donna Brazile actively considered overturning the will of the Democratic voters by attempting to replace Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine as the Democratic presidential and vice-presidential nominees,” the statement said. “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”

Contacted on Saturday, Ms. Brazile said she could not talk about the contents of the book because of a nondisclosure agreement with her publisher.

Ms. Brazile’s book, which also disclosed an unusual agreement that gave Mrs. Clinton’s campaign a measure of control over D.N.C. operations a year before she was nominated, says she was concerned about the faltering Clinton campaign, which, she wrote, had taken on “the odor of failure,” The Post reported.

Ms. Brazile’s assertions shed new light on frictions within the Democratic Party, and revive lingering tensions between more mainstream Democrats and the more liberal supporters of Mrs. Clinton’s principal challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Ms. Brazile, according to The Post, got in heated disagreements with top Clinton campaign officials and accused them of treating her like a “slave.”

Ms. Brazile took over the leadership of the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 after Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned from the post following the leaking of emails obtained by Russian hackers that showed that party officials were working together to the detriment of Mr. Sanders’s campaign.

(Many middle-class families could also see tax savings under the plan.)

“There is a difference between directing institutions to make sure they’re using their resources toward their stated mission — missions of education, missions of access — versus directing institutions toward filling gaps in Washington, and this seems to be the latter,” Sean Decatur, president of Kenyon College, said Friday.

Supporters of the proposed tax said it was an acknowledgment that universities increasingly were being run like businesses, with tuition continuing to rise and administrative ranks growing, especially at the wealthiest institutions.

Representative Tom Reed, a New York Republican whose district includes Cornell University, supports the proposed tax, though his main wish is to force schools with large endowments to spend more of them on tuition assistance. Like other proponents of an endowment tax, he noted that private foundations, which also are nonprofits under the tax code, already pay a tax of 1 to 2 percent on their investment income.

“Rather than fight for special treatment, universities should join me in recognizing that young adults are facing a college debt crisis as a result of the uncontrolled escalating costs,” Mr. Reed said in an email. “We should work together to solve this runaway price issue once and for all.”

The tax would affect about 140 colleges and universities, according to a list compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education.

Universities have been fiercely protective of their endowments, and have ramped up lobbying efforts to keep control over them.

Some argued Friday that the tax plan would put a damper on gifts, because donors would not want to see the impact of their gifts diminished by the tax.

Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a trade group, said colleges and universities should be treated differently from foundations. “Private foundations give money away, that’s not the purpose of colleges and universities,” Mr. Hartle said. “If you wanted to treat them the same, you’d apply this to all colleges and universities regardless of the value of their endowments, not just a handful of private ones.”

At Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., which has an endowment of more than $200 million, the president, Elizabeth Kiss, said that most students were minorities and 40 percent had incomes low enough to qualify for federal Pell grants. Because of the endowment, she said, “We are able to give financial aid to basically pretty much all of our students.”

The tax, she said, would amount to a $350,000 cut to an overall budget of $52 million. “This is an institution that had a 1 percent pay raise this year, so it’s not like we’re fat cats,” Ms. Kiss said.

A spokesman for Yale University, Tom Conroy, said that the plan would impose a permanent tax on student aid, teaching, research and community services at Yale. He pointed out that the universities with the wealthiest endowments are also those that have the resources to offer need-blind admissions and the strongest support to poor and middle-income students.

“It is disappointing that the legislation relies so heavily on colleges and universities, and especially the universities with some of the strongest records on financial aid, to raise revenue to enable tax cuts,” Mr. Conroy said. “We hope that the House of Representatives will reconsider these proposals.”

Ivy League schools generally have the biggest endowments, and they have been growing fatter since 2008, in part through high-earning investments like commercial real estate, venture capital and hedge funds.

At Yale, for instance, the endowment, helped by an 11.3 percent return on investments after fees, grew to $27 billion in the 2017 fiscal year. Harvard’s endowment, helped by an 8.1 percent return, stood at $37 billion.

The size of some of the endowments suggests that they could weather a 1.4 percent tax on earnings. But some university officials said that they must spend carefully to withstand occasional market downturns, and that large portions of many endowments have spending restrictions placed by donors.

A 2015 study by the Congressional Research Service found that in the previous fiscal year, colleges spent an average of 4.4 percent of their endowments, and the average rate of investment return was 15.5 percent. Larger institutions, which were more invested in hedge funds and private equity, had higher returns.

Yale’s endowment was nearly $2 million per student that year. Princeton’s was more than $2.6 million, and Harvard’s was nearly $1.3 million, according to the study. Harvard alone held 7 percent of all endowment assets that year, the report said.

At Cornell, the endowment typically goes toward financial aid, or helping cover faculty salaries and research, the president, Martha E. Pollack, said on Friday. If the tax goes through, Cornell would have to make the money up somewhere else, she said.

“This is very very serious for us; we’re estimating at this point that it would cost us approximately $10.5 million a year,” Dr. Pollack said. “And, as far as I can tell, it doesn’t satisfy any real policy objectives.

Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr. declined requests to comment.","Almost exactly 1,000 days before Mr. de Blasio won the Democratic nomination for a second term, he stepped into a Brooklyn hospital and knew he had a problem. Two New York police officers had just been killed — assassinated, really — at point-blank range. Mr. de Blasio had come, as mayors do, to pay his respects. But as he and his entourage squeezed into the hospital’s corridors, something was off. Many of the men and women in blue standing in solidarity with the fallen were facing the wall, their backs to the mayor in protest.

More would turn away from Mr. de Blasio at the officers’ funerals. The head of the police union would say there was “blood on the hands” at City Hall and blame the mayor for racially charged rhetoric on policing, in particular, saying he had told his son Dante, who is half-black, to “take special care” when encountering police. Union leaders said it made cops out to be the bad guys. Now two officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were dead.

It amounted to a political tinderbox for a rookie mayor whom few had expected to win in 2013, when Mr. de Blasio vaulted past a crowded field in a crazy race marked by Anthony Weiner’s implosion and Christine Quinn’s collapse. In his first year, Mr. de Blasio was facing not only a political crisis but also a genuine security situation months after violence had engulfed Ferguson, Mo.

Throughout December of 2014, the mayor and his team huddled deep into the night at Gracie Mansion to come up with a way to defuse the situation. Efforts included enlisting the help of Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, who held mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral the morning after the mayor’s hospital visit, and urged calm in “a city tempted by tension and division.” In a symbolic but unscripted moment, Cardinal Dolan emerged from the church arm in arm with the mayor’s wife, Chirlane McCray, who is African-American.

In the end, riots did not break out, and Mr. de Blasio’s stewardship through a racially fraught situation solidified his standing among his most important constituency, African-American voters, according to his political advisers.

It is true that rank-and-file cops turned on the mayor (a 2016 survey of 6,000 officers by the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association showed Mr. de Blasio with a 96 percent unfavorable rating). But working-class white voters — historically a staple of the police force — have been a shrinking demographic in New York City. The mayor’s campaign estimated only 10 percent of the 2017 primary electorate would be white voters without a college education, and Mr. de Blasio seemed to be willing to lose that group.

Peter Ragone, a top City Hall adviser in 2014 who has stayed close to the mayor, said the political foundation for Mr. de Blasio’s re-election has always been solid despite the naysayers.

“I don’t believe he was ever vulnerable,” Mr. Ragone said flatly.

The city’s economy has been humming. Crime has been dwindling. And Mr. de Blasio delivered on two signature first-term promises: universal prekindergarten for 70,000 students and curtailing stop-and-frisk. More affordable housing is being built and those facing eviction will soon be guaranteed city-provided lawyers.

Crucially, term limits also made waiting for 2021 — when there would be no incumbent mayor — more alluring for officials like Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr.

Mr. Ragone acknowledged that Mr. de Blasio has had his missteps. But he blamed the media and political class for obsessing over trivial matters voters don’t care about: the chauffeured gym trips to the Park Slope YMCA, his supposed nap habits, his allergy to black-tie galas and the Yankees, his persistent lateness early in his term, his eating pizza with utensils. (Mr. de Blasio did take steps to fix his tardiness after he missed the moment of silence for victims of a plane crash, but he has blamed the news media for most of its other criticisms.)

“I have been stunned by the level of cognitive dissonance between the reality that political insiders believe and the reality that the rest of the electorate has believed all along,” Mr. Ragone said. “That somehow going to the gym is more important than universal pre-K, or somehow the fact that he ate a very large messy slice of pizza with a knife and a fork is going to disqualify him in a single voter’s mind.”

It wasn’t so much the pizza that bothered Bradley Tusk as the subpoenas.

Mr. Tusk had served as campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and before that as top deputy to Rod R. Blagojevich, the Illinois governor who went to prison for corruption. He likes to say he’s seen good politicians and bad ones: “I know what it’s like under each.”

In Mr. de Blasio, he saw a bad one — and no one would do more to enlist a challenger to the mayor than Mr. Tusk.

“It seemed to me that we had really lackluster leadership,” he said in an interview.

Mr. Tusk, now a top New York political consultant, had clashed with the mayor up close on behalf of influential clients, including Uber and the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association. Then in April 2016, subpoenas made it clear that federal and state prosecutors were digging into Mr. de Blasio and whether he had inappropriately helped donors seeking favors from the city or skirted campaign donation limits.

Two months later, Mr. Tusk then took the extraordinary step of announcing a public recruiting drive, financed by his own fortune (he struck gold with early equity in Uber), to find a top-tier Democratic challenger to the mayor. Mr. Tusk dangled a super PAC if the right candidate jumped in.

The type of things Mr. Ragone saw as insignificant, Mr. Tusk saw as symbolic of a disengaged executive “who didn’t seem to care that much about the job.” He chafed as the mayor tried and failed to host a presidential forum in Iowa and rolled out a national agenda that went nowhere.

He paid for a poll showing Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Stringer virtually tied — 41 percent to 40 percent. He surveyed other names, too, including Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Diaz Jr., the city’s public advocate Letitia James and even some unlikelier ones, such as the Rev. Al Sharpton and Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC host.

Mr. Tusk would meet with just about every possible challenger (only once each, on the advice of his lawyers), including Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Diaz Jr., Mr. Stringer, Ms. Quinn, and Daniel R. Garodnick, a Manhattan city councilman.

“I think they all felt they would be a better mayor than de Blasio; I think they all would like the job,” Mr. Tusk said. “But it came with a cost.”

In his meeting with Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Tusk said their conversation quickly turned to the fact that the New York mayoralty has historically served as more of a career capstone than as a steppingstone. Mr. Jeffries is now only 47. “Hakeem — that kind of threw him for a loop,” Mr. Tusk recalled. “We both realized at the same time that success for him might not mean success.”

Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr. had the opposite problem: both would have had to risk their current offices to challenge the mayor. Losing meant they’d be out of a job.

If Mr. Tusk was the face of the anti-de Blasio effort, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was stoking the same sentiment behind the scenes. The Cuomo-de Blasio relationship had been strained from the start, but it took a turn for the worse in mid-2015 when the mayor ripped the governor in the press. “If someone disagrees with him openly,” Mr. de Blasio sniped, “some kind of revenge or vendetta follows.”

He was talking about the past. He might as well have been predicting the future.

For the next two years, the two Democrats volleyed acrimony and accusations back and forth. Mr. Cuomo would appear at fund-raisers for Mr. de Blasio’s potential rivals — Mr. Jeffries in 2015 and Mr. Diaz Jr. in 2016 — and foment opposition in phone calls to New York political leaders, according to people familiar with his calls.

Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, said: “The governor has been close with Congressman Jeffries since he was an Assembly member on a professional and personal level, and the same goes for his relationship with Borough President Diaz Jr. And neither were ever going to run for mayor.”

According to Mr. Tusk, Mr. Stringer looked most seriously at the contest.

In August 2016, Mr. Stringer’s office released an audit critical of the mayor, and the comptroller followed it with a speech sketching out his vision while criticizing the current leadership in City Hall. Mr. de Blasio accused him of “grandstanding.”

At about that time, Mr. Stringer was sitting on $1.4 million in his campaign account that could have been spent on a mayoral run, just shy of Mr. de Blasio’s $1.6 million.

Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz Jr. declined requests to comment.

But three people who spoke directly with Mr. Stringer during that time said he was explicit about his interest in entering the race on one very speculative condition: He would run for mayor if Mr. de Blasio was indicted on criminal charges.",How Bill de Blasio Overcame the Haters,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/nyregion/how-bill-de-blasio-overcame-the-haters.html

The liberation of Raqqa, Syria, the Islamic State’s final stronghold, has severely weakened the group as a military threat. But as its members slink off the battlefield to melt into local populations or infiltrate nations in Europe, Africa and around the world, they leave a region in ruins and an almost impossible challenge for the United States.

Over four gruesome years, ISIS swallowed up large areas of Iraq and Syria, taking control of oil fields and using beheadings, rapes and other cruelties to terrorize populations. Now, the degradation of the group has allowed Iran, Russia and others to scramble for advantage. The anti-ISIS coalition is fracturing, reviving divisions and creating conditions that could allow the extremists to regroup. And American leaders seem to have no clear plan to manage this instability or to capitalize on their military success.

One big concern is the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan, which until recently was Iraq’s anchor. Today its future, and that of a unified Iraq, is in doubt. That’s because of an independence referendum in September that was pushed through by Masoud Barzani, then the Kurdish leader, despite warnings from Iraq’s central government, Turkey, Iran and the United States — the Kurds’ main ally — that the vote could lead to Iraq’s dissolution, undermine the anti-ISIS fight and widen divisions even among Kurdish factions.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Baghdad last month to urge the Kurds — who have been among the most capable foes of ISIS — and the central government to settle their differences. After that, the Kurds announced plans to suspend the independence drive and enter talks.

Taiwan’s armed forces, by contrast, have fallen way behind, struggling to recruit enough soldiers and sailors — and to equip those they have.

The 98 specimens that the team had analyzed came from across the northern part of Siberia and had been collected over the course of four decades. The oldest were more than 60,000 years old, and the youngest, a specimen known as “Lonely Boy,” was about 4,000 years old. The genetic data did not provide insight into how old the mammoths were when they died, only their sex.

To obtain the DNA, the team first had to limit contamination. For that, they worked in a clean laboratory and wore lab suits similar to what Ebola doctors wear. They shaved off a few millimeters from the surface of their samples and then drilled into them to extract genetic data. They found that 66 were males and 29 were females.

The biggest limitation in the study is that their explanation for the skew is speculative and based mostly on the behavior of present-day elephants. The thought is that mammoths, like today’s elephants, lived in matriarchal societies where adult females protected the young. But around the ages of 14 or 15 when puberty set in, males left their herd and either became loners or joined bachelor groups, which were often led by inexperienced males. That was when they were more likely to do something risky, and find themselves stuck in frozen muck.

The natural traps buried their bodies quickly, protecting them from scavengers. The researchers said that their findings say nothing about the sex ratio of mammoths when they were alive, which they think may have been 50-50, only that males were more likely to die in ways that kept their remains preserved for thousands of years.

Beth Shapiro, an evolutionary molecular biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study, said she was surprised by the results and that the team’s hypothesis was sensible given what we know about elephant behavior. She added that it would be interesting to see if there is a sex ratio difference for other prehistoric mammals preserved in the permafrost, like bison and horses.

Daniel Fisher, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan, said the hypothesis was well-founded, but that tusks should not have been used in the study because males often broke their tusks while fighting each other, but that did not mean they died.

The authors said that even discounting their tusk fragments and only using teeth, bone and hair samples, they still had more dead males.","Male Mammoths Died in ‘Silly Ways’ More Often Than Females, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/science/mammoth-fossils-males.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“We are adding robots at the choke points and making the lines go really fast,” Mr. Musk told analysts during a webcast on Wednesday. “Speed is the ultimate weapon.”

Getting to market with the Model 3, which will carry a base price of about $35,000, has been a humbling experience so far. Tesla built just 260 Model 3 sedans in its most recent quarter — considerably short of its target of 1,500.

And the sluggish pace has coincided with a rash of job cuts and allegations of lax safety standards on the assembly line from its workers.

While Wall Street analysts and media coverage have focused on the shortfall in Model 3 production, Mr. Musk concentrated Wednesday on the fact that Tesla expected to deliver record numbers of its higher-priced Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles in the last three months of the year.

But the company also reported wider losses than expected for the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Revenue from auto sales increased 8 percent to $2.08 billion, compared with the same period a year ago, but the company lost $619.4 million, versus posting a profit of $21.9 million in the third quarter of 2016.

Tesla shares were off nearly 5 percent in extended trading after the earnings report and the production update, falling below $306, more than 20 percent lower than their midyear peak.

And even as the company is making plans for a factory in China and possibly more plants in the United States, some analysts are questioning Tesla’s overall competence in the intricate processes of mass vehicle production.

One analyst, Clement Thibault of Investing.com, said Wednesday that Tesla’s vertically integrated manufacturing system — which includes building many of its own major components, like batteries and seats — is out of step with tried-and-true industry practices.

“There’s a reason traditional car companies have an established decentralized business model,” Mr. Thibault said. “Tesla believes it can centralize the process, but lacks any real world evidence to back up its claim.”

Since it began production in late summer, Tesla has sold the new Model 3 only to its employees, rather than begin filling the hundreds of thousands of orders from buyers who have put down $1,000 deposits.

While Mr. Musk has said the employee-only sales strategy was meant to reward Tesla’s work force, analysts have surmised that it was also a way to discover and correct quality problems before the vehicle is made available to the public.

The bottom line, however, is that Tesla has yet to prove that it can meet the huge demand it has created for the new Model 3, and that it is capable of joining the big leagues of auto manufacturing.

Further delays will most likely benefit competitors such as General Motors and Nissan, which offer electric vehicles in the Model 3’s price range. And new electrified models are in the works from automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and Toyota.

“At this point in the game, all eyes are on the Model 3,” said Akshay Anand, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. “Tesla needs to ensure its production volume is achieved. But perhaps more importantly, Tesla needs to ensure the vehicle is being produced in a quality manner.”

Tesla is experiencing a number of labor-related issues as it works to increase its annual production output to 500,000 vehicles a year from about 100,000.

Last month, the company fired hundreds of workers for what it described as subpar performance. Mr. Musk said on the webcast that the company was looking to hire new employees with skills better suited to its production goals.

But some workers have said that they were dismissed because they supported a union organizing drive conducted with the help of the powerful United Automobile Workers, which represents hourly employees at the three big Detroit automakers.

One worker, Daniel Grant, said he had supported the union effort because of unsafe conditions in the Tesla factory — and he believed he had been fired for it.

“Management pushed us hard, and it created very real risks for us working on the line,” Mr. Grant said in an email. “That’s why I wore a union T-shirt, and that’s why I handed out fliers.”

The U.A.W. has joined workers to file complaints against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the company of harassing and dismissing employees for their organizing activities.

“I don’t believe I was fired for performance,” said Mr. Grant, who said he had been injured on the job and fired a few days later.

Workers have said that Tesla’s production systems can cause injuries linked to repetitive stress. Other employees say that they were not properly trained to handle some hazardous chemicals, and have experienced burns, rashes and eye injuries.

Tesla has said that the dismissals were based only on performance reviews and that it would never act against employees based on their union views. It will not discuss individual cases.

From the moment Woody Harrelson swaggers into “LBJ,” you can see the glinting intelligence and hear the thudding heartbeat that he brings to the title character. It couldn’t have been easy. He’s nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy — an actor’s landscape — while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson, a transitional, still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions. This was, history tells us, a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, a president who declared an “unconditional war” on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam.

Video

Only some of that history makes it into this disappointing movie, which tracks Johnson’s road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency, an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nation’s healer after John F. Kennedy’s death. It’s a near-miraculous, compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky. One moment it’s 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next, he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office.

Mr. Harrelson makes Johnson an almost predictably entertaining force, and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether he’s barnstorming through politics, slamming down phones, lobbing obscenities, braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier. He’s fun to watch despite the facial makeup, which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasn’t thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in “Point Break.” It’s a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him. I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Lady Bird, only when she started talking.

Directed by Rob Reiner from Joey Hartstone’s script, “LBJ” is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelson’s talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity. Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang, but he’s booming in a vacuum. Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary. That’s too bad, especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies — “Selma,” “Jackie,” “Marshall” — that, both directly and obliquely, speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s.

Taken together, these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black, female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history. They represent, onscreen and off, the very changes that they narrate. With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters, “LBJ” doesn’t look all that different from most other great-man stories. Yet there are moments — Johnson conspiring with a racist power broker played by an excellent Richard Jenkins — when the filmmakers seem ready to shake up the story by laying white, male power bare in all its ugliness.

His past efforts at this have been quite successful, and during my recent visit to Pyongyang I saw signs that sanctions were biting.

But the goal appears doomed: Almost no expert believes that sanctions will force Kim Jong-un to give up his nuclear weapons or halt his missile program. That puts us on a collision course, for North Korea seems determined to develop a clear capacity to target the U.S. with nuclear weapons, while the White House hints that it would rather have a war than allow the North to become a nuclear threat.

“Our president has been really clear about this,” H. R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, said on Fox News. “He is not going to permit this rogue regime, Kim Jong-un, to threaten the United States with a nuclear weapon. And so he is willing to do anything necessary to prevent that from happening.”

The whispers in Washington are that “anything necessary” includes airstrikes on North Korea, such as a strike on a missile as it is being prepared for launch. When I asked North Korean officials what would happen in those circumstances, they answered unambiguously: war.

Tammy Duckworth, a former military pilot who is now a Democratic senator from Illinois, says that from what she hears, the chance is greater than 50/50 that the president will order a strike.

“I see a change in posture,” she told me. “I am extremely worried that we’ve moved beyond ‘Let’s prevent war’ to ‘It’s acceptable to do a first strike.’”

Duckworth and other Senate Democrats have introduced legislation that would prevent the president from making a pre-emptive strike on North Korea without congressional approval, barring an imminent threat to the U.S. or its allies.

Graham said that if North Korea continues to test intercontinental ballistic missiles, a war is “inevitable.”

This may be a bluff, but, if not, war is coming, for almost every expert believes that North Korea will continue its testing.

Trump didn’t create the problem, and it’s real: We should fear North Korea’s gaining the capacity to destroy U.S. cities. Eerily, on my last visit, North Koreans repeatedly said that a nuclear war with the U.S. was not only survivable but winnable.

The U.S. must now choose among three awful options: 1) A “freeze for a freeze” deal, which Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seems to be pursuing; 2) Long-term deterrence, just as we have deterred North Korea for decades from using its chemical and biological weapons; 3) A conventional war that might escalate into a nuclear exchange.

Security experts overwhelmingly say the least terrible choice is the deal for a freeze on North Korean testing in exchange for reductions in sanctions or U.S.-South Korean military exercises, but at this point it’s not clear that either Washington or Pyongyang would agree to such an arrangement. Deterrence is next best, and war is the worst option. But that’s the option Trump seems headed toward.

North Korea may also inflame the situation with provocations at any time, such as firing a long-range missile into the sea near Guam, or conducting an atmospheric nuclear test that would send radioactive fallout drifting toward the United States. Trump may also shoot down a North Korean missile over international waters; that’s less provocative than a strike on North Korean territory, but I’d still expect a military response. And there’s a constant risk of miscalculations and incidents that spiral out of control.

Fourteen years ago, America stumbled into a devastating war with Iraq without thinking through the consequences. This feels like déjà vu — only potentially far more devastating.

Despite the best efforts of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to destroy the Affordable Care Act, the law is not collapsing. And on Wednesday, Americans began signing up for health insurance policies for next year through the online exchanges created by that law.

President Trump’s attempts at sabotage have clearly taken a toll on the A.C.A., or Obamacare. Experts say it is likely that one million to two million fewer people will choose health plans for 2018, compared with 2017. That’s because the administration has reduced the open enrollment period by half, to 45 days.

Others are unaware of when open enrollment started (Nov. 1) and when it will end (Dec. 15 for much of the country). The president’s remarks and actions have also scared insurance companies into raising premiums — by about 37 percent for popular “silver” plans, and by smaller amounts for the “bronze” and “gold” plans — because the administration is cutting payments to insurers, and the companies are expecting fewer healthy people to buy coverage.

That said, a majority of the people who rely on the exchanges will be able to buy affordable health plans, thanks to the protections built into the law. About 80 percent of the people who sign up are expected to qualify for subsidies that will reduce the cost of insurance to $75 a month or less, according to government data. The law provides subsidies to single people who make up to $48,000 a year and families of four earning up to $98,000.

It is important that people examine their options. People’s choices and costs will vary based on where they live, how much they earn, the size of their families and other factors. Experts say many lower-income people will be able to sign up for a bronze-level plan with no upfront cost to them. However, these plans include high deductibles and copays. Silver plans will become much more expensive for many families. That’s because Mr. Trump stopped making the payments to insurers that compensated them for reducing deductibles for low-income customers who sign up for silver plans. So comprehensive gold plans may be cheaper than less generous silver plans in some parts of the country.",Obamacare vs. the Saboteurs,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/opinion/obamacare-vs-the-saboteurs.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

TOKYO — President Trump has spoken with the king of Saudi Arabia to offer a wholehearted endorsement of a drive to modernize the kingdom, as the Saudi authorities arrested scores of prominent business people and ministers in a sweeping anti-corruption crackdown.

In an unusually lengthy and detailed readout of the call made on Saturday, the White House said that Mr. Trump had thanked King Salman for Saudi Arabia’s support in fighting terrorism and for its purchase of military equipment from the United States. And he praised the king’s favorite son and top adviser, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, for his recent calls for tolerance and moderation in Saudi society.

“The king and crown prince’s recent public statements regarding the need to build a moderate, peaceful and tolerant region are essential to ensuring a hopeful future for the Saudi people, to curtailing terrorist funding, and to defeating radical ideology — once and for all — so the world can be safe from its evil,” the White House said in the statement.

The White House statement made no mention of the scores of arrests, including that of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire investor who has held stakes in an array of Western companies, including the News Corporation, Citigroup and Twitter. Prince Mohammed, who has already sidelined rivals to the throne, is viewed as the mastermind behind the crackdown.

Prince Alwaleed sparred with Mr. Trump on Twitter during the presidential election, referring to him as a “disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.” Mr. Trump fired back, also on Twitter, that he was a “dopey prince” trying to “control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money.”

THE PLAZA PENTHOUSE, which encompasses the 19th through 21st floors and offers sweeping Central Park and cityscape vistas, was sold to Mr. Candy in early 2012 for nearly $26 million. But he wasn’t the first to lay claim to it. While the Plaza Hotel was undergoing a partial condominium conversion in early 2007, Andrey Vavilov, a Russian financier, signed a contract to acquire this penthouse, and another, for a total of $53.5 million. He later backed out of the deal, saying that the finished apartments resembled “glorified attic space.” He sued the developer, the Elad Group, over fraud and breach of contract claims; Elad countersued. A settlement was reached in January 2009.

Mr. Candy, who with his older brother, Nick, develops luxury properties — most notably One Hyde Park in Central London — went through with his closing, but he never moved in. He put the unit back on the market months later, for $59 million, after extensive renovations and adding custom furnishings. With no takers, the apartment was eventually reduced to $39.75 million; its monthly carrying charges are $17,736. The buyer was identified as Luxury Team Inc.

According to the most recent listing with Sotheby’s International Realty, this 6,316-square-foot triplex has four bedrooms and five and a half baths. The master suite takes up the entire top floor; it has a terrace that faces the park, a sitting area, walk-in closets and a dressing room, and two marble baths. Three en-suite bedrooms are on the 19th floor, while the entertaining space, which includes a den and an eat-in kitchen, is at the middle level. Elizabeth Sample and Brenda Powers of Sotheby’s were the listing brokers.

THE TOWNHOUSE THAT MS. SWIFT likely purchased was No. 153 on Franklin Street, a cobblestone road. The 27-foot wide, three-story brick townhouse sold for $18 million. The private purchase, according to property records, was made through the limited liability company Euro TriBeCa; that firm has a Nashville address linked to Ms. Swift’s management company, 13 Management.

Tree Paine, a spokeswoman for the singer, did not respond to requests for comment.

The house was fully renovated under the direction of the designer Leopoldo Rosati. It has 5,148 square feet, with four bedrooms and four and a half baths. The home had been in the spotlight about six years ago when it was rented to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Strauss-Kahn had been under house arrest there, accused of assaulting a housekeeper at a New York hotel. (Those charges were later dropped.)

Ms. Swift, whose latest album “Reputation” is due out this month, also owns a penthouse in TriBeCa, at 155 Franklin, and she had been renting a townhouse in the West Village, at 23 Cornelia Street. That property is now for sale, for just under $20 million.

THE PAVAROTTI PIED-À-TERRE, at the Hampton House, at 150 Central Park South, between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, was sold for $9 million. The buyer was Alva Craft, an actress and singer, who was the wife of Robert Craft, an orchestral conductor who died two years ago.

The apartment, unit No. 2301, was first listed for sale in 2014, seven years after Mr. Pavarotti’s death. The price was $13.7 million. It was taken off the market and re-listed in early 2016 for $10.5 million, then later that year offered briefly as a potential combination with a smaller, neighboring apartment, No. 2302, for a total of $20.5 million. Last month’s sale was without a broker.

Mr. Pavarotti had purchased this 2,000-square-foot apartment, with two bedrooms and two baths, more than 30 years ago. His wife said he was drawn, in part, to the apartment’s proximity to the Metropolitan Opera House. It is also close to Carnegie Hall.

THE PENTHOUSE SOLD BY MR. NEWHOUSE is at 105 East 29th Street, a co-op building near Park Avenue South. It closed at $6.8 million, which was not far from the asking price.

According to the listing with Douglas Elliman, the full-floor, loft-like unit measures about 3,400 square feet and has three bedrooms and three and a half baths, with high ceilings and oversize windows. An antique iron staircase leads to a glass-enclosed room and a 1,400-square-foot roof terrace.

Mr. Newhouse was a cousin of S.I. Newhouse Jr., who controlled Condé Nast’s parent company, Advance Publications, and died in early October.

Across town, Ms. Haydon, who ran the Kay Models agency and is the mother of Vanessa Haydon Trump, paid $6.4 million for unit No. 14A and a storage room at 1049 Fifth Avenue, a prewar condominium near 86th Street and facing Central Park.

This 2,458-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms and three and a half baths, along with two wraparound terraces totaling 705 square feet, according to the Douglas Elliman listing.

In Greenwich Village, Ms. Errico, who has starred in several Broadway shows, and Mr. McEnroe, who is a brother of the tennis champion John McEnroe, sold their five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath duplex at 250 Mercer Street for $5.2 million. The 3,883-square-foot apartment also came with a storage unit.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

Adding additional wrinkles, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, above center, said he was considering folding the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s so-called individual mandate into the developing tax plan, which already includes language that would enshrine in federal law certain legal rights for fetuses.

5. A clearer picture is emerging of Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in Manhattan that left eight people dead. An Uzbek who immigrated via a now-controversial diversity lottery program, he led a rootless life and, according to a former friend, had “monsters inside.” Wounded by police gunfire, he was able to make a court appearance.

President Trump urged the death penalty, expressing frustration at the pace of terrorism trials.

He was also angered by the lack of a federal investigation into his political rivals and by the sentencing of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl — who received a dishonorable discharge, but no prison time, for walking off his Army base in Afghanistan in 2009. These grievances led Mr. Trump to issue perhaps the most vocal criticisms of the justice system from an American president.

For the most part, Americans don’t see the need for an advanced degree when there are so many professional opportunities waiting for them. For some, the price is just too high when they have so much student debt already.

“You can believe that U.S. bachelor’s students, if they’re good, can go get a job at Microsoft or Google with a bachelor’s degree,” said Edward D. Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington.

Hadi Partovi, a tech investor, received his master’s in computer science from Harvard in the 1990s. His roommate did not. They both got job offers from the same company. “Master’s grads are valued more, but not enough more for American students to get a master’s degree,” said Mr. Partovi, a founder of Code.org, a nonprofit that promotes computer science in grade school and high school.

Universities and employers are eager to tap the pool of international talent that helps them stay competitive globally, and graduate programs have a financial incentive in attracting them: Demand from abroad is so high, administrators don’t see a need to offer as much tuition assistance.

There’s concern, though, that the current climate around immigration could jeopardize that flow of talent. Incidents of xenophobia, hostile political rhetoric and President Trump’s attempts at banning travelers from some Muslim-majority countries may be weighing on the minds of potential applicants.

The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, for example, saw a 30 percent decrease in international applications to its professional master’s program for this semester, according to the dean, Joseph J. Helble. Dr. Helble surveyed more than two dozen engineering deans earlier this year, and three quarters of them said they, too, had seen significant drops in international graduate applications. But enrollment, he said, was not off.

Still, trends are not clear.

“If there are one or two more years of comparable 20 to 30 percent decreases in international applications, we’re very concerned about our ability to conduct research and spin off and start companies,” he said. “We’re concerned from a competitive perspective.”

Dan Spaulding, who oversees human resources at Zillow Group, the online real estate company, said that in specialized areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, his company favors graduate degrees, but for the vast majority of its technical jobs, a bachelor’s degree in computer science is adequate. He said he has heard concerns from students and managers about an international chill, but for now the supply of students with computer science skills hasn’t been affected.

“A great many of them are coming in with programming skills first and looking to radiate out into other business disciplines, product management, product design,” he said. “I just think going deep academically is not a priority for as many computer science students today.”

In 1994, only about 40 percent of students who were enrolled in computer science Ph.D. programs were from outside the country, according to the Computing Research Association survey.

As the economy improved, the percentage of Americans in graduate programs dropped. “Going to grad school became less of a priority for so many students,” said Stuart Zweben, co-author of the survey and professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University. “You had to really be interested in research or something special.”

The balance of computer science graduate programs began to tilt toward so-called nonresident aliens in the late 1990s, when well-capitalized dot-coms began scouring for programmers, sometimes encouraging summer interns to drop out of school, Dr. Zweben said.

Students from other countries have long seen graduate school as their best path to employment and residency in the United States, and for the industry connections they are not likely to find in their home countries.

“It’s easier to get access from here,” said Ms. Joshi, who is president of the N.Y.U. finance club. She wanted to attend N.Y.U. so she could merge her background in information technology with her interest in the financial industry. She has regular exposure to industry speakers and recruiters.

Her decision paid off. Ms. Joshi, 25, has accepted an offer to work in risk management at American Express once she completes her master’s. She will apply for Optional Practical Training, a program that allows her to work in the United States for a year, with an option of extending her stay for up to another 24 months.It will be up to her employer whether it wants to sponsor her for an H1-B visa after that, allowing her to stay longer. President Trump has ordered a review of the H1-B program, and floated the idea of adjusting the current lottery system to favor higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.

The Tandon School recently started “A Bridge to N.Y.U. Tandon,” aimed at preparing students with non-STEM backgrounds like liberal arts for master’s programs. Katepalli R. Sreenivasan, the dean, believes this could attract Americans who have not yet found decent jobs.

Coghlan’s father, a British officer assigned to the United States during the Revolution, forced her at age 14 to marry the British lieutenant John Coghlan, probably to put an end to her dalliance with Aaron Burr. She detested her husband, ran away and availed herself of an English lord, whereupon her father sent her to a nunnery. After she escaped, he disowned her.

A string of lovers supported her passion for fine things, but one had gambling debts that mounted until he could not afford to pay her bills. Debtors’ prison was looming when her false death notice appeared in the newspapers. But soon she reappeared in Paris, and the pattern of lovers and debtors’ prison resumed. Then she disappeared from the historical record, leaving behind a mystery: Did she die in prison? Or did she get away with faking her own death once more?

Both Cornplanter and Margaret Coghlan met George Washington. It was otherwise for Venture Smith (whose Western African name was Broteer Furro). Brought to New England as a slave when he was a boy, he grew into a formidable man, over six feet tall, 300 pounds, and amazingly strong. He was of steady temper, though he could be pushed too far. When one master and his brother beat him, Smith stacked them on top of each other and stomped both at the same time.

Smith’s son Cuff marched with George Washington, but Smith himself was too absorbed in making a life for his wife and children to participate in the Revolution. By persuading one of his masters to hire him out, he earned the money to buy freedom for himself and his family and to invest in land, including a parcel in Connecticut where he built a three-level home, a barn and a forge. Although he never learned to write, he was adept at complex financial transactions and willingly used his skill to help other free blacks establish themselves.

In old age, stooped and blind, Smith was proud of his achievements but bitter about the obstacles he had faced because he was black. Still, he found reason for gratitude. “My freedom,” he said, “is a privilege which nothing else can equal.”

Closer to the Revolution was Abraham Yates, a shoemaker of deceptively meek appearance who educated himself in the law and, with help from the future New Jersey governor William Livingston, broke through New York’s ruling clans to become an influential politician. During the war he served in New York’s Provincial Congress, helped write New York’s Constitution and corresponded with Washington. Afterward, convinced that the United States Constitution was written for the privileged few, he threw himself into defeating its ratification. Losing the battle did little to deter him, and in the last years of his life, he was still defending the rights of the common man.

In a portrait painted by George Romney, Lord George Germain, another of Shorto’s subjects, wears a silver wig and red jacket. England’s secretary of state for the American colonies has a hint of hauteur about him, but also a sense of doubt.

He may be wondering whether England will defeat the American rebels. Should that fail to happen, Germain would never recover the reputation he’d lost some 20 years before when he had been court-martialed for purportedly refusing a direct order.

As it turned out, Germain’s anxiety was justified. In 1781, it was his duty to deliver news of the American victory at Yorktown to the prime minister, Lord North, who cried out, “Oh God, it is all over!”

George Washington is the hub of Shorto’s book, the figure with whom almost everyone else directly connects. Cornplanter sought his help for the Senecas. Coghlan attended a dinner at which he was present and got his attention when she saucily refused to toast the American cause. Yates exchanged letters with him. Germain was his opponent, and, like Washington, a tall, imposing man who hid vast ambition behind a usually unreadable visage. Shorto captures this resemblance, as well as the noble demeanor that separated Washington from nearly everyone else.

But like many who have written about Washington, Shorto has difficulty describing the president’s inner life. As his soldiers became more professional, Shorto writes, Washington “found himself overcome with emotion, thrilling in his heart at the feeling that he was becoming one with them.” Such a description deserves an example — or at least a footnote. The same is true when Shorto writes that while living in New York as the new president, Washington felt like a “bumpkin.” Perhaps, but where is the proof?

Still, Shorto’s achievement is a remarkable one. The intertwined stories of “Revolution Song” give a sense of how far-reaching a phenomenon the War of Independence was. It leaves to readers the pleasure of judging what each of the figures in the book — or perhaps the combination of them all — contributed to an event that changed the world.","The War of Independence, Seen Through Six Sets of Eyes",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/books/review/russell-shorto-revolution-song.html

• Your turn: Did “Stranger Things 2” recapture the magic of the first season?","Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation newsletter and website.

In the first episode of the new season of “Stranger Things,” we saw a mysterious, inflamed storm bearing down on Hawkins. By the end of the nine-episode run its identity had been revealed: Puberty.

That strangest thing of all shared screen time, of course, with the latest disaster to emerge out of the Hawkins Lab, which loosed malevolent vines and “Demodogs” upon the luckless town and again made poor Will Byers, who really has had a terrible year, captive to an otherworldly demon. Hopper almost died at least once, and Joyce was again pushed to the brink by both her boyfriend Bob’s brutal Demomauling and her son’s tribulations.

But the success of the very good second season of “Stranger Things” is largely thanks to the equal tribute it paid to the often scary convulsions of adolescence, whether it was a heartbroken Mike being a pill to everyone or an equally despondent Eleven shattering windows with her angst.

The nerds left the basement and looked for love amid the monsters, dividing Dustin and Lucas as each pined after the new girl Max. Nancy and Jonathan took their relationship to the next level, with the help of a vodka-swilling conspiracy cupid. Eleven went through a rebellious phase, running away and dabbling in shoplifting as she questioned her own identity, before returning with a moody new “MTV punk” look.

The attention given to their growth and struggles elevated a season that, while suspenseful, was pretty repetitive from a plot standpoint — the lab screwed up, Will was victimized, monsters escaped, Eleven saved the day. For all of the 1980s blockbuster references and “Stranger Things 2” Hollywood sequel marketing, the creators Matt and Ross Duffer clearly get that in TV, investing in your characters is what makes viewers invest in your show.

As with last season, the story got going efficiently. Will beheld a tentacled shadow monster in the Upside Down and Dustin took in a slimy creature whose true nature wasn’t revealed until it feasted on the family pet. (“I’m sorry,” Dustin told Dart as he locked it in the cellar. “You ate my cat.”)

Nancy mourned Barb, getting smashed on Halloween party punch and setting out with Jonathan to get proof of the lab’s complicity in her death. At the rustic Chez Hopper, the chief and Eleven ate TV dinners and had fights fueled by past traumas: She chafed at her captivity by a domineering father figure, shades of Papa Modine, while he fretted about losing another little girl.

Things intensified after Will got terrible advice from Bob about how to deal with monster — basically, face it and tell it to go away — which resulted in the boy becoming part of it instead. The show cleverly played with Will’s connection to the menace, revealing him to be not a “spying” asset but rather a double-agent liability, a threat to manage with tricks and a series of hypodermic needles. (Again: Will’s had a tough time.)

The monster lacked the horrifying, Gothic edge of last year’s Demogorgon. So it was a big spidery storm beast that controlled wicked vines and devil dogs? Or what? And aren’t we full up on smoke/shadow monsters after “Lost,” “Game of Thrones” and probably others I’m forgetting? But its amorphousness did make for some of the season’s most terrifying scenes, such as the moment at the end of the third episode when it invaded Will’s body.

Noah Schnapp in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

As Will, Noah Schnapp was the linchpin of the season after being offscreen for most of the first one. He was a marvel, by turns heartbreaking, explaining to Joyce the hold the monster had on him, and creepy. (“He likes it cold.”) With his sensitive, soulful eyes and bowl-cutted fragility, Will looks like the result of someone at the Hawkins lab splicing D.N.A. of Elliott from “E.T.” and Danny Torrance from “The Shining.” But by the end he was in full Linda Blair mode, raging convincingly against the space-heater exorcism that eventually set him free (for now, at least).

The rest of the kids retained their power to charm even as the show asked more of them, too, this time around, splitting them into subplots that were more emotionally demanding than last year’s bike-bound adventures.

Finn Wolfhard was prickly and tender as Mike, a boy who didn’t know what do to with all of his feelings, culminating in his meltdown with Hopper. Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas) gave a fine portrayal of a fraught rite of passage: The first time your loyalties are torn between your pals and your crush. As Dustin, Gaten Matarazzo carried entire stretches of the show by himself. His fraternal bond with Steve (Joe Keery) — whose redemption was as delightful as it was unexpected — was maybe the most touching love story of the season.

Millie Bobbie Brown proved that she wasn’t a one-season wonder, telegraphing Eleven’s varying shades of pain with great nuance and holding her own with David Harbour through the push-and-pull of their complex, evolving relationship. (Will someone please wipe her bloody nose though?) And while the kids get most of the attention, the show simply doesn’t work without Mr. Harbour’s and Winona Ryder’s deeply felt performances.

The newcomers were more of a mixed bag. Sadie Sink (Max) was a spirited addition to the “party” (the term refers to a team of players collaborating within a role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons). Brett Gelman was sublimely obnoxious as the investigator Murray Bauman. Sean Astin’s flair for openhearted, St. Bernard-like devotion was ideal for Bob the sacrificial galoot.

Dacre Montgomery in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

But after Billy’s (Dacre Montgomery) strong Scorpions-fueled arrival, the show seemed to lose sight of what to do with him. By the end he was an unfocused denim-wrapped bundle of rage and tire squeals. (I did enjoy his final episode moment with Mrs. Wheeler, though.)

Then there was the ill-advised detour into a Pat Benatar video. After Eleven went down the mental misery hole with her addled mother, she was moved to seek out the other lab refugee she saw in the flashbacks, and who we saw, in the season-opening scene, using telepathy to thwart the Pittsburgh police. This was Kali, and it turns out she was not part of a robber gang, as it initially seemed, but was leading a crew of misfits on a revenge quest against those who had persecuted her at the lab.

Kali was the Darth Vader to Eleven’s Luke Skywalker, urging her to give in to her hate and draw her power from the dark side of the Upside Down force. While Eleven flirted with the notion, she ultimately realized that revenge meant orphaning others, the way she had been, and decided to head home and save her friends instead.

A scene from “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

It was perhaps worthwhile, from a character development standpoint, to have Eleven confront and make uneasy peace with her anger, and see what she might have become had she not found such loving support in Hawkins. But from the on-the-nose opening musical cue — Bon Jovi’s “Runaway” as she was literally running away — the episode was a mishmash of bad barrel-fire ’80s urban cliché and overwrought conflict. It didn’t help that the vengeful and manipulative Kali, with her sinister eyeliner, was a clear callback to “Temple of Doom” (Kali ma!), which took heat even in 1984 for its ghoulish depiction of Indian culture. (Tone-deaf exoticism is one reference the Duffer Brothers should have left in the ’80s.)

Eleven got a sweet makeover out of it, at any rate, returning to Hawkins looking like Trinity from the “Matrix.” She arrived just in time to close the interdimensional gate — did we really need Will to give us this obvious bit of strategy? — and get a birth certificate of her very own, completing her transformation from a gifted but tormented science project to Jane Hopper, a real-live girl with a mother and father. Whatever transpires in future “Stranger Things” installments, she’ll have that going for her.



One surprise was how long it took Eleven to rejoin her crew from the first season. They didn’t get together until the very end and even then, spent only minutes in each other’s company. It was an audacious and unexpected choice, as well as a slightly disappointing one given their shared chemistry. (There’s always next year, I guess, as promised by the final shot of a still-raging Upside Down.)

But it was of a piece with a season that throughout poignantly gestured at that fraught time when we all leave the basement and face life’s terrors and thrills on our own, as glimpsed in the culminating sequence at the Snow Ball ’84. After the four boys assembled on the fringes, one by one they left for new frontiers on the dance floor, with mixed results. (Oh Dustin, your time will come.)

It was a remarkable little scene and the perfect ending, capturing the anxiety, excitement, terror and occasional heartbreak that follows when you leave the cocoon of your party and enter a world that only gets stranger.

A Few Thoughts While We Enjoy a Baby Ruth

• “What’s at the X?” Bob wondered as he looked at Will’s map. “Pirate treasure?” You may recall that as Mikey in “The Goonies,” one of the ur-texts of “Stranger Things,” Sean Astin led the hunt for One-Eyed Willy’s loot. It was one of several fun meta moments this season. (See also: Max dismissing Lucas’s description of last season’s events as “a little derivative in parts.”)

• In the premiere recap I doubted that Dr. Owens was truly on Joyce’s side, as he said, but it turns out he more or less was. I probably should have guessed the Duffers would upend expectations attached to the lab doctors, after Matthew Modine’s evil turn, and Paul Reiser, who played a duplicitous character in “Aliens,” another of this series’ touchstones.

• “Mistakes have been made,” Dr. Owens told Nancy and Jonathan. “You killed Barbara,” Nancy countered. “Abundant mistakes,” he replied.

• R.I.P. Barb, finally.

• Your turn: Did “Stranger Things 2” recapture the magic of the first season? Were you fine with Eleven being away from the main action for so long? How many puffs of Farrah Fawcett Hair Spray does it take you to achieve Harrington-like coif perfection?

She went so far as to take profound personal offense that anyone could read Kelly’s remarks, which bizarrely pinned that conflict on a generic failure to compromise, as a minimization of slavery. He was pristine. His critics were pigs.

“General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isn’t perfect, it doesn’t mean it’s not our history,” she said on Tuesday with an impossibly straight face, utterly ignoring Kelly’s “compromise” comment and his gauzy eulogy of Robert E. Lee.

She added that journalists’ refusal to brush off those tangents was the truly “outrageous and absurd” development. Thus she aced her favorite trick: the moral inversion of the universe.

Other press secretaries demonized the media, but not as ambitiously and artlessly as she. On Wednesday, she was reminded of her recent statement that all leaders have flaws, and she was asked to name one of Trump’s.

“Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis,” she said.

She needs a vocabulary lesson. The bloat of Trump’s ego is a flaw. The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw. Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience — or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment — but it’s not a flaw. It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.

When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster. She chalked up that tweet of his about Mika Brzezinski (“bleeding badly from a face-lift”) to a laudably bold retaliation against a merciless adversary, and she used it as a springboard to swoon over him anew. “I think the American people elected somebody who’s tough, who’s smart and who’s a fighter,” she said. “And that’s Donald Trump.”

She zealously parrots his contention that there’s no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesake’s infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as “pretty standard campaign operating procedure.”

She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos — once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign — was trying to coordinate with Moscow. When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had “nothing to do with the president.”

So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own. She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before. So he was — what — grandfathered in? Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.

Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system “a joke” and “a laughingstock.”

“That’s not what he said,” she shot back — it’s like a reflex with her — and later added, “He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.” Wow. Huge difference. Small problem: Acosta’s description of Trump’s remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.

She’s awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.

Besides, she’s serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. (To listen to her pronounce “priorities” is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)

She’s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump’s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place. Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home. Hence her invocation of religion — she’s the daughter of a rather well-known pastor — when asked during one briefing how she’d explain Trump’s worst behavior to her own children.

“When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model,” she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion. “I point to God. I point to my faith. And that’s where I would tell my kids to look.”

Earlier this year, the Edgemont Incorporation Committee commissioned a feasibility study for a new village.
In addition, the new village could explore sharing services with the neighboring village of Ardsley and also offer to buy back services from Greenburgh.","A recent tax reassessment in Greenburgh pushed the assessed values of Edgemont homes up by about 4 percent, effectively raising Edgemont’s share of Greenburgh’s taxes to 26 percent from 24 percent — even though Edgemont makes up just 17 percent of the population.

If Edgemont’s 7,500 residents were removed from Greenburgh’s tax rolls, that could undermine the town’s finances, Greenburgh officials say. Edgemont’s median household income is $201,000, higher than that of the six existing villages in town.

Paul J. Feiner, the Greenburgh town supervisor for more than 25 years, said services in the rest of unincorporated Greenburgh would suffer if Edgemont became a village. The town, he said, stands to lose about $17 million in tax revenue. He predicted that homeowners in a new village of Edgemont would see their property taxes rise as well.

“People in Edgemont love the services they receive, and they are going to mess it up for everybody, including themselves,” said Mr. Feiner, a Democrat, who is running unopposed on Tuesday. “They may not like me, but they are going to make a decision that will last for many decades after I’m town supervisor. It’s really for spite that they will destroy the town.”

Those who favor incorporation say the primary goal is not to save money on taxes. Rather, they want to gain control of land use, planning and budgeting decisions. Separatists also point out that with just 8 percent of Greenburgh’s overall population, they are poorly positioned to effect political change in the town.

“The town government does not really follow a process for governing, and they ignore the law when it’s convenient,” said Jeffrey Sherwin, an entrepreneur and father of two who is helping to lead the campaign here. “The solution provided by New York State is if you’re unhappy, you too can become a village.”

In February, petitions containing the signatures of Edgemont residents who want to form a village were submitted to the Town of Greenburgh; if accepted, voters in the proposed village would decide whether to incorporate in a referendum. But in May, Mr. Feiner rejected the petitions, citing discrepancies in the boundaries of the proposed village. (Village advocates say it would mirror the borders of a local fire district and closely resemble those of the school district.)

Mr. Feiner also questioned the validity of some of the signatures and the total number needed; state law requires signatures from 20 percent of eligible voters in the proposed village.

A group that favors becoming a village, the Edgemont Incorporation Committee, then sued Mr. Feiner, and the question of the petition’s legitimacy is now pending in State Supreme Court. If the petition is deemed sufficient, then a referendum would be held and a simple majority vote would determine Edgemont’s fate.

What seemed to antagonize Edgemont residents the most, however, was something Mr. Feiner did after the petition was submitted. Private investigators were sent to the homes of people who signed the petition, ostensibly to verify information. But those residents were asked to sign affidavits saying they had not been fully informed about the incorporation plan and that they rescinded their signatures.

Mr. Feiner said the intention was simply to assure that the incorporation petition was valid, adding that he regretted “that we didn’t speak to the investigators and have a dry run.”

Earlier this year, the Edgemont Incorporation Committee commissioned a feasibility study for a new village. The study found that residents could maintain the same level of services by spending the same amount on taxes, and it projected that the new village would run a surplus of $2.2 million by 2019.

Jon Lewis, an Edgemont resident who works in municipal finance, said a number of services, including schools, fire protection, water and sewer, would not be affected by incorporation. In addition, the new village could explore sharing services with the neighboring village of Ardsley and also offer to buy back services from Greenburgh. “We are not picking up 7,500 people and moving to a rural area,” he said.

If the effort succeeds, Edgemont would become Greenburgh’s seventh village. The other villages in the town — all incorporated between 1872 and 1910 — are Dobbs Ferry, Ardsley, Irvington, Hastings-on-Hudson, Tarrytown and Elmsford. Each village has its own mayor and board of trustees, with separate police departments and municipal employees overseeing services like public works and recreation.

While residents in the villages can vote for Greenburgh officials and also pay Greenburgh a small town tax (about 2 percent of their property tax bills), they largely identify with their own village affairs.

One development proposal that has inflamed some in the Edgemont community centers on an assisted living complex where a plant nursery now stands. A town ordinance requires that such a residence be within 200 feet of a county or state road, but the proposed location is more than 6,000 feet from such a roadway. The town’s zoning board issued a variance anyway.

“The law was there for a reason,” said Mr. Sherwin, who lives near the proposed senior housing and worries about a potential surge in emergency calls there.

Some town officials believe that complaints about legal settlements and development plans mask a pecuniary motivation on the part of some Edgemont residents.

“You have a wealthier area of the town and they don’t want to pay for services in the lower-income sections of the town,” said Mr. Feiner, referring to summer youth camps run by the Police Department and after-school programs. “We have enormous services and what I hear on street is, ‘Why should I pay for something I’m not using?’”

In Albany, state lawmakers also tried to slow the incorporation effort. In June, Assemblyman Thomas J. Abinanti, a Democrat, introduced a bill, which applied only to Greenburgh, requiring approval by the town board before a referendum on incorporation could proceed. The bill died in committee, but Mr. Abinanti plans to revive it next year with a statewide focus.

“Policy disagreements should not for the basis for a new government,” he said. “It should be based on the need for services.”

Some experts in local government say that if any community could form a new village and not suffer sticker shock, it was Edgemont. The working-class village of Mastic Beach on Long Island struggled with spiraling taxes after it incorporated. But Edgemont, with nearly half the population, expects to reap some $15 million in property taxes a year as an incorporated village — compared to Mastic Beach’s $925,000 in tax revenue in 2015.

“They will have the best financial shot,” said Andy Crosby, an assistant professor of public administration at Pace University. “If you have a very large base for your property taxes, you don’t need the tax rate to be very high to achieve what you want.”",An Upscale Hamlet Weighs Whether to Be a Village (or Not to Be),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/nyregion/secession-edgemont-greenburgh-westchester.html

The 98 specimens that the team had analyzed came from across the northern part of Siberia and had been collected over the course of four decades. The oldest were more than 60,000 years old, and the youngest, a specimen known as “Lonely Boy,” was about 4,000 years old. The genetic data did not provide insight into how old the mammoths were when they died, only their sex.

To obtain the DNA, the team first had to limit contamination. For that, they worked in a clean laboratory and wore lab suits similar to what Ebola doctors wear. They shaved off a few millimeters from the surface of their samples and then drilled into them to extract genetic data. They found that 66 were males and 29 were females.

The biggest limitation in the study is that their explanation for the skew is speculative and based mostly on the behavior of present-day elephants. The thought is that mammoths, like today’s elephants, lived in matriarchal societies where adult females protected the young. But around the ages of 14 or 15 when puberty set in, males left their herd and either became loners or joined bachelor groups, which were often led by inexperienced males. That was when they were more likely to do something risky, and find themselves stuck in frozen muck.

The natural traps buried their bodies quickly, protecting them from scavengers. The researchers said that their findings say nothing about the sex ratio of mammoths when they were alive, which they think may have been 50-50, only that males were more likely to die in ways that kept their remains preserved for thousands of years.

Beth Shapiro, an evolutionary molecular biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study, said she was surprised by the results and that the team’s hypothesis was sensible given what we know about elephant behavior. She added that it would be interesting to see if there is a sex ratio difference for other prehistoric mammals preserved in the permafrost, like bison and horses.

Daniel Fisher, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan, said the hypothesis was well-founded, but that tusks should not have been used in the study because males often broke their tusks while fighting each other, but that did not mean they died.

The authors said that even discounting their tusk fragments and only using teeth, bone and hair samples, they still had more dead males.","Male Mammoths Died in ‘Silly Ways’ More Often Than Females, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/science/mammoth-fossils-males.html

The government of New York City is enormous, with more than 295,000 full-time employees and an annual budget of $85 billion, presenting a host of challenges for any manager. The New York Times asked Nicole Malliotakis , the Republican candidate for mayor, about her approach to management, the experiences that would inform her decisions as a manager of city government and her vision for New York City over the next four years.

Ms. Malliotakis spoke with The Times in a conference room in the Midtown office tower where she has her campaign headquarters. Read a similar interview with Mayor Bill de Blasio , Ms. Malliotakis’ Democratic opponent.

This interview has been condensed and edited.

Q. What in your life, in your work experience, prepares you to lead the biggest municipal government in the United States?

A. First of all, seven years in the Legislature. I have a good understanding of government, just how it works, what needs to be done to get things accomplished. I’ve established good relationships with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and that’s very important, particularly now where we’re seeing a rift between the mayor and the governor. I’ve worked with Governor Cuomo, following what was a crisis situation in my district, with Hurricane Sandy having devastated my district.

Hundreds of families were affected by Hurricane Sandy, and so I had to work under pressure, under a serious devastation in getting my constituents food, water, clothing. Getting them emergency shelter. That is real emergency management, crisis management, on-the-job training that I had during the months following Hurricane Sandy.

Q. What did you learn about what worked in managing a large group of people and what doesn’t work?

A. I was coordinating efforts of hundreds of volunteers at a time, even on various cleanup efforts. I think it’s about having good people helping you. I think with what we see now in the administration is you have ideologues. I really intend on bringing in people in my administration who have, not only a passion for a particular area, but have also the capability to implement things.

When you look at the recovery program, seven years in the Assembly has also trained me to see where there’s mismanagement and where there are things that are inefficient. And if you look at the Hurricane Sandy recovery program, the rebuilding program, Build it Back, that is the poster child of mismanagement.

Q. You said you worked with Governor Cuomo after Sandy. How many times did you speak to Governor Cuomo and —

A. I would work with his agency. I was dealing with, we had a person who was assigned to Staten Island, or we had multiple people that were assigned. So personally speaking, one-on-one with the governor, I had not.

Q. How many employees do you have as an Assembly member?

A. I mean roughly 10 altogether with …

Q. Full-time, paid employees?

A. Full time? Well, you know what the Assembly members’ budget is right?

We just want to establish the baseline here.

All right, so you’re trying to belittle my job, is that what you’re trying to do?

We’re talking about management, and so ...

Management doesn’t necessarily mean the people who are reporting to you. There’s a lot more than that. We utilize volunteers, we utilize interns. That’s important. It’s not just the two full-time, I have what, three full-time people? It’s not just that, I have part-time staff, I’ve got volunteers whom I rely on who serve almost as part-time or full-time staff; it’s just not costing the taxpayer money.

I would say that I do a lot more with less than other Assembly members do who have three or four times the amount of staff that I have. That’s also a major display of my management ability, is to do more with less.

Q. How you would approach managing the enormous operation of city government?

A. First of all, I feel it’s important to surround yourself with people who reflect your work ethic. My chief of staff is one of the hardest. I would put my chief of staff up against anybody else because the hours and the amount of time that he would put in, the dedication to the position. I will be surrounding myself with people who are passionate about the area that they’re focused on. I see a lot of, actually, Democratic colleagues whom I would like to bring into my administration because they are not only passionate but they’re capable. And I think that that’s really important. You don’t want people who are just ideologues, which is what I see right now. You want people who have ideas and have vision and have the ability to implement.

I want to have an open dialogue with my commissioners. So I would like to have a weekly call or biweekly call, depending on — obviously, there’s a lot of agencies — and being really somebody who meets with and is accessible to the leadership of each department. I feel there’s a lot of apathy right now with city workers. And I feel that the rank-and-file doesn’t have a voice or a seat at the table. So, I want to know from the people who are the first line.

Q. How would you do that?

A. I’m going to go personally and will pick a handful of employees who are on the front lines and talk to them. And say, “What are you hearing? What are you experiencing? What is it like out there?” And I feel the second thing that’s very important is the public. I want to have my town halls at the beginning of my term, not at the end of my term. I feel that we need to work closer with the borough presidents. We need to work closer with the City Council members, because they know their community better than anybody else.

I’m not someone who’s looking to be a dictator and force things down throats — but instead I want to have the people and the city workers part of the conversation. Of course, at the end of the day, I make the decision because I’m the executive, but I think that it’s important to listen to the opinions of those who are closest to the ground.

Q. How would you manage a situation in which you have a policy goal in mind that the local officials disagree with, and you’re convinced that you’re right?

I’m going to be listening and getting their take and getting all the information but at the end of the day, you know, I’m the mayor and I’m going to be making those decisions based on what I think overall is right. An effective leader listens and then makes a decision based on having information, all the information.

Q. You would be the youngest mayor in a century. Tell New Yorkers how your age would impact your mayoralty and what about New Yorkers who say they want someone who is more seasoned?

I bring a new, fresh vision. I am among the new crop of leaders who are taking office, and it’s not just happening here in the United States, it’s happening across the world. I mean we just saw the new head of France, we just, I think it was Austria, right, the other day? I’m pretty sure it was Austria, you can look it up later. But we’re seeing leaders of nations who are emerging. It would be good for New York City because I’m going to bring New York City into the 21st century.

We have a lightning round. It’s very fun.

It’s fun? I hope something’s fun today.

We’re going to throw out some words or phrases and we want you to say the first word that pops into your head.

Andrew Cuomo.

Effective manager.

Equity.

Equity? Oh jeez. Equity. Property taxes. The need for equitable property taxes.

Donald Trump.

Q. Do you think that the city has been too lax in allowing the homeless to sleep on the city’s streets, subways, and hasn’t done enough to address both the shelter issue and street homelessness?

A. I do. Look at the disaster that’s been made. When you’re spending nearly double on Department of Homeless Services and the problem’s getting worse. That’s ineffective management. I really feel that they’ve been very lax. I think there needs to be more urgency in transitioning people out of the shelter system.

I don’t agree with reducing the welfare-to-work programs. I feel that we need more. There is a waiting list for vocational training opportunities. We should provide them. I think there’s a lot of things that could be done with existing city and state land that could help relieve the issue. You have a lot of seniors in homeless shelters. You have veterans in homeless shelters. Let’s start with giving property to nonprofits who can provide housing for them as a permanent solution as opposed to what the mayor’s looking to do, to build 90 additional homeless shelters at an expense of hundreds of millions of dollars. You can’t allow people to sleep all over Penn Station. Underneath expressways, there are encampments. This is not acceptable. That’s a breakdown, breakdown of society.

Q. Do you think it’s a problem, then, that the city has a right to shelter?

A. I think it is a major problem. You know, there was legal action, it was upheld. And so it’s something that has to be dealt with. But so we can’t create an environment where people feel that they can sleep on the street, aggressively panhandle, sleep on the subway. There has to be some order as well.

Q. What would you do to establish that order?

A. Well I think we fell behind the 8-ball here because we didn’t build more supportive housing, like we got, there’s a lot of catch-up that needs to be done.

Q. How would you instruct your police commissioner regarding the use of stop and frisk?

A. I think that stop and frisk is a tool that, when used appropriately, it is effective. But in no way should it be a tool that we’re looking to target any particular group. But if someone is stopped and they’re questioned, there’s a reasonable suspicion, I think to frisk is appropriate, but it’s got to be used appropriately.

I’ve spoken to mothers of victims who have been killed by gun violence, and they wished that their perpetrator was stopped, questioned and frisked. So I think we certainly shouldn’t go back to the Bloomberg days of stop and frisk, but we should allow our police, and we should properly train them, and allow them to utilize it as a tool when it’s necessary and there’s reasonable suspicion.

Q. You’ve suggested that crime in the city is higher than the Police Department acknowledges. Do you think that they’re presenting false statistics?

No, I don’t think that they’re presenting false statistics, but look what happened the other day when the mayor’s saying summonses are down 90 percent — that doesn’t mean that public urination has gone down or that smoking marijuana in the street has gone down. That just means that it’s not being enforced. I think it’s great murder is down. But I think when most people walk down the street, they’re not afraid of being murdered, they’re afraid of, women, in particular, are afraid of rape, you know men, afraid of maybe some type of assault.

Q. In a recent poll you performed far better with white voters than with blacks or Hispanics. Why do you think that is?

A. I don’t know. You’d have to ask them. But I do believe that I’ve been getting a great response in the Latino community as I travel around. I’ve done a lot of campaigning. My mother comes around with me, I have Assemblyman Jose Rivera traveling to various events in the Bronx, and we’ve received a great response.

Image Ms. Malliotakis supports President Trump but she says that some of his policies “are not good for New York City.” Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times

Q. Do you think that President Trump has been or will be harmful to New York City?

A. I think that the job of the mayor is to make sure that he’s not harming New York City. I think some of the policies that he’s putting out there are not good for New York City.

Q. Namely?

A. Well, so for example, anything that diminishes services for Medicaid. Anything that’s going to change our tax structure where we can’t write off income tax or property tax is going to be hurtful. Those are my concerns. I’ve already said how I feel about the DACA, that I don’t believe we should be stripping status from DACA recipients.

Q. One of the things that people say about this mayor is that he doesn’t go out and enjoy the city that much. Do you envision yourself out on the town?

A. I’ve never been someone who was into bars or clubs. Even when I was in college. But what I think one of the great experiences of running this campaign has been, being able to go out into the communities and just meeting people, experiencing their culture, trying different restaurants.

You need to ride the subway. You need to take the ferry. I want to be someone who’s out with the people and plan on going to a gym nearby Gracie Mansion. I’m not going to be going to Staten Island to go to the gym. But I still want to be able to do things that I love. CrossFit. Boxing. Yoga. Obviously when time permits. I mean I don’t anticipate a lot of free nights.

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Photo

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

“Hariri didn’t do this for Lebanon, he did this for Saudi against Iran,” said Nabil Idriss, who was tending his son’s fabric shop.","By pushing out Mr. Hariri, analysts said, Saudi Arabia could deny Hezbollah a credible Sunni governing partner — an attempt to isolate it and deny it the fig leaf of a national unity government.

“They concluded that Hariri was serving as more of a cover for Iranian and Hezbollah influence than as a counterweight to them,” said Rob Malley, a former special Middle East adviser to President Barack Obama and the vice president of the International Crisis Group.

Yet the resignation also shows how few options Iran’s opponents have. Without Mr. Hariri in power, the United States and Saudi Arabia lose their main partner in the Lebanese government.

Across the political spectrum, analysts and officials said the resignation ushered in new dangers. If the next government is more pro-Hezbollah, they said, that could lead to devastating sanctions. It could even increase the chances of a new war with Israel, which would see added justification for its argument that there is little distinction between Hezbollah and the Lebanese state.

Mr. Hariri even raised the specter of internal violence. He compared the atmosphere in Lebanon now to the days before the 2005 assassination of his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying he believed his own life was in danger. “I sensed what’s being woven in secret to target my life,” he said.

Mr. Hariri’s father was killed when his motorcade was bombed on Beirut’s seafront. Several Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia in a special United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague, although the militant group has denied involvement in the assassination.

Lebanon, which is governed by a sect-based political system, has long been deeply divided between a bloc aligned with Shiite Hezbollah and Iran, and one aligned with Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni country in the region.

Mr. Hariri headed a 30-member national unity cabinet that was crafted to protect the country from any spillover from the multisided war in neighboring Syria, where Iran backed the government and Saudi Arabia backed the insurgents.

That mission has largely been successful, even though Hezbollah has sided with the Syrian government, Lebanese Sunni militants have joined insurgents there, and well over one million refugees flooded this small Mediterranean country.

In Lebanon’s political system, power is divided between a prime minister, who must be Sunni; a president, who must be Maronite Christian; and a speaker of Parliament, who must be Shiite.

The exercise of real power in the country is a more complicated affair of alliances, rivalries and division of spoils between the leaders of sectarian groups, including former warlords from Lebanon’s civil war.

Hezbollah, which rose to prominence fighting the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, is the strongest because of its powerful militia, which can act independently of the state and in recent years has served as an expeditionary force across Syria.

In recent years Lebanon’s rival blocs have essentially agreed to confine their fight to Syria. But tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have only increased.

In addition to Hezbollah’s decisive role in helping President Bashar al-Assad of Syria hold on to power, Iran has supported several militias in Iraq that have managed to defeat Islamic State forces in that country and remain a fighting force.

Iranian leaders say their interference is needed to stop terrorism, and to create a security zone for their country. The country’s influence started to rise after the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in 2011, leaving behind an incomplete army and a pro-Iranian government.

Iran’s filling of the vacuum created by the departure of the United States military has been an extremely worrying development for Saudi Arabia and some other Arab states, who have seen their efforts to fight proxy wars with Iran largely fail.

And now that the Syrian war seems to be entering a new phase, with Mr. Assad still ruling a devastated country, there are fears that tensions that had been pushed to the back burner — inside Lebanon, between Hezbollah and Israel, and elsewhere — could re-emerge.

The United States has stepped up sanctions on Hezbollah in recent weeks after President Trump criticized Iran and the landmark nuclear deal it reached under Mr. Obama.

“It signals a new phase of escalation,” said Ali Rizk, a pro-Hezbollah Lebanese analyst, adding that the imminent defeat of Islamic State by the United States would put new pressure on what it sees as Shiite extremists. “Lebanon is in for a hard time,” Mr. Rizk said.

The resignation brought sharp words from Israel and Iran. Bahram Ghasemi, a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, said Mr. Hariri’s speech was driven by a Saudi, American and Israeli effort aimed at “creating tension in Lebanon and the region.”

And in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the resignation “a wake-up call for the international community to take action against the Iranian aggression.”

The pressure now is on the Lebanese president, Mr. Aoun, who will hold consultations with Parliament about appointing a caretaker government, said Imad Salamey, an analyst at the American University of Beirut.

“If he indeed is going to bring in a pro-Hezbollah government, then he has to face the consequences,” such as new sanctions, Mr. Salamey said. “It will be a massive U.S. and Saudi response. The economy will collapse for sure.”

In his speech, Mr. Hariri said he wanted to unite Lebanon and free it from outside influence. He pronounced himself “full of optimism and hope that Lebanon will be stronger, free, independent, with no authority over it except that of its own great people.”

But in the streets of Tariq al-Jdeedeh, a mostly Sunni neighborhood of Beirut that is part of Mr. Hariri’s political base, anger and confusion contrasted with the posters of Mr. Hariri that festooned the buildings.

“Hariri didn’t do this for Lebanon, he did this for Saudi against Iran,” said Nabil Idriss, who was tending his son’s fabric shop. “Now with this move, the picture is more transparent than ever.

I knew that much of the conventional language of scriptural translation has the effect of reducing complex and difficult words and concepts to vacuously simple or deceptively anachronistic terms (“eternal,” “hell,” “justification,” to give a few examples). But I had not appreciated how violently those conventions impoverish the text or obscure crucial dimensions of its conceptual world. The books of the New Testament, I came to see, constitute a historical conundrum — not because they come from the remote world of late antiquity, but rather because they often appear to make no sense even in the context of antiquity.

I found myself constantly in doubt, in particular, regarding various constructions concerning words dealing with that which is “koinon,” or “common,” and most especially the texts’ distinctive emphasis on “koinonia.” This is a word usually rendered blandly as “fellowship” or “sharing” or (slightly better) “communion.” But is that all it implies?

After all, the New Testament’s condemnations of personal wealth are fairly unremitting and remarkably stark: Matthew 6:19-20, for instance (“Do not store up treasures for yourself on the earth”), or Luke 6:24-25 (“But alas for you who are rich, for you have your comfort”) or James 5:1-6 (“Come now, you who are rich, weep, howling out at the miseries that are coming for you”). While there are always clergy members and theologians swift to assure us that the New Testament condemns not wealth but its abuse, not a single verse (unless subjected to absurdly forced readings) confirms the claim.

I came to the conclusion that koinonia often refers to a precise set of practices within the early Christian communities, a special social arrangement — the very one described in Acts — that was integral to the new life in Christ. When, for instance, the Letter to the Hebrews instructs believers not to neglect koinonia, or the First Letter to Timothy exhorts them to become koinonikoi, this is no mere recommendation of personal generosity, but an invocation of a very specific form of communal life.

As best we can tell, local churches in the Roman world of the apostolic age were essentially small communes, self-sustaining but also able to share resources with one another when need dictated. This delicate web of communes constituted a kind of counter-empire within the empire, one founded upon charity rather than force — or, better, a kingdom not of this world but present within the world nonetheless, encompassing a radically different understanding of society and property.

It was all much easier, no doubt — this nonchalance toward private possessions — for those first generations of Christians. They tended to see themselves as transient tenants of a rapidly vanishing world, refugees passing lightly through a history not their own. But as the initial elation and expectations of the Gospel faded and the settled habits of life in this depressingly durable world emerged anew, the distinctive practices of the earliest Christians gave way to the common practices of the established order.

Even then, however, the transition was not quite as abrupt as one might imagine. Well into the second century, the pagan satirist Lucian of Samosata reported that Christians viewed possessions with contempt and owned all property communally. And the Christian writers of Lucian’s day largely confirm that picture: Justin Martyr, Tertullian and the anonymous treatise known as the Didache all claim that Christians must own everything in common, renounce private property and give their wealth to the poor. Even Clement of Alexandria, the first significant theologian to argue that the wealthy could be saved if they cultivated “spiritual poverty,” still insisted that ideally all goods should be held in common.

As late as the fourth and fifth centuries, bishops and theologians as eminent as Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose of Milan, Augustine and Cyril of Alexandria felt free to denounce private wealth as a form of theft and stored riches as plunder seized from the poor. The great John Chrysostom frequently issued pronouncements on wealth and poverty that make Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin sound like timid conservatives. According to him, there is but one human estate, belonging to all, and those who keep any more of it for themselves than barest necessity dictates are brigands and apostates from the true Christian enterprise of charity. And he said much of this while installed as Archbishop of Constantinople.

That such language could still be heard at the heart of imperial Christendom, however, suggests that it had by then lost much of its force. It could be tolerated to a degree, but only as a bracing hyperbole, appropriate to an accepted religious grammar — an idiom, that is, rather than an imperative. Christianity was ceasing to be the apocalyptic annunciation of something unprecedented and becoming just the established devotional system of its culture, offering all the consolations and reassurances that one demands of religious institutions. As time went on, the original provocation of the early church would occasionally erupt in ephemeral “purist” movements — Spiritual Franciscans, Russian non-possessors, Catholic Worker houses — but in general, Christian adherence had become chiefly just a religion, a support for life in this world rather than a radically different model of how to live.

That was unavoidable. No society as a whole will ever found itself upon the rejection of society’s chief mechanism: property. And all great religions achieve historical success by gradually moderating their most extreme demands. So it is not possible to extract a simple moral from the early church’s radicalism.

But for those of us for whom the New Testament is not merely a record of the past but a challenge to the present, it is occasionally worth asking ourselves whether the distance separating the Christianity of the apostolic age from the far more comfortable Christianities of later centuries — and especially those of the developed world today — is more than one merely of time and circumstance.",Are Christians Supposed to Be Communists?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/opinion/sunday/christianity-communism.html

Ditto with “Dinkins years” (the “gorgeous mosaic,” tennis rackets, Crown Heights riots), “Giuliani years” (squeegee men, Derek Jeter, Twin Towers) or “Bloomberg years” (bike lanes, luxury condos, waterfront parks). Love ’em or hate ’em, each of them had their drama.

The “de Blasio years”? The mind goes blank. It’s hard to say, four years in, what represents this era. Gourmet food trucks, maybe? Food halls? As the mayors got taller, the mayoralty got smaller.

The public scourges Minnie Mouse and Elmo are confined to mascot ghettos in Times Square known as designated activity zones. There was, if memory serves, a blizzard that everyone freaked out about, although it’s hard to remember when, or why. It’s hard enough to remember just how to spell the mayor’s name. (It’s not “DiBlasio,” but you can be forgiven if you have to Google it.)

Mayor de Blasio’s New York is neither a city on the brink (despite this past week’s deadly terror attack) nor a city reborn. Crime is down, and test scores are up, but few seem to be paying close enough attention to know that.

At last, here’s an image that floods to mind: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

To be fair, no one was shrugging at Terminal 5, the music club on West 56th Street, this past Monday, as the mayor took the stage with his wife, Chirlane McCray, and Senator Bernie Sanders, in what passes for a climactic campaign appearance in a mayoral battle that is shaping up to be as lopsided as ... something incredibly lopsided. Polls show the mayor, seeking a second term, ahead of his Republican challenger 61 percent to 17 percent. (Extra credit if you can name Mr. de Blasio’s Republican challenger — double extra credit if you can spell it: It’s Nicole Malliotakis.)

Despite the presence of Mr. Sanders, the hall was maybe half full. Efforts to get a “four more years!” chant faded quickly as the mayor, looking like a retired Knicks power forward (he is 6-foot-5), rose to tower over the podium in a gray suit and yellow power tie.

“I want to start with a tale of audacity,” Mr. de Blasio said, sounding more amiable than audacious, before ticking off his administration’s accomplishments, which included universal pre-K, two rent freezes and free legal counsel for people facing eviction.

The mayor spoke glowingly of Mr. Sanders as the shining beacon of his own “progressive” politics. (Mr. de Blasio backed Hillary Clinton in 2016.)

“Bernie Sanders defines the idea of audacity,” he said, showing America’s left “that we had a power that we didn’t even know we had.”

A crowd of union members in red jackets sipped beer from plastic cups in the back. That seemed fitting: The affable, jocky Mr. de Blasio, more than any mayor in memory, certainly fits the time-honored political test of “who would you want to have a beer with?” (If you tried to play quarters with Mr. Giuliani, he’d probably arrest you for gambling.)

But the mayor tacitly acknowledged that he is more of a conduit for a political philosophy than a lightning rod.

“The candidate matters,” he said, quoting a Sanders talking point, “but the movement matters even more.”

Mayor de Blasio’s movement, such as it is, has left a mark. Despite howls that changes to policing would send the city spiraling back to the “Death Wish” 1970s, school crime is down and major crimes are down 9 percent during his tenure — with, the administration says, a 93 percent reduction in the “stop and frisk” tactics by police that long have marred the daily life of, in particular, young African-Americans. What’s more, a recent Quinnipiac University survey reported that 82 percent of likely African-American voters expressed a favorable opinion of the mayor.

The problem is that Mr. Giuliani long ago cemented his legacy as the crime fighter mayor in the public imagination, however deserved that may be. Any mayor who follows is simply Crime Fighter 1B.

Mayor Bloomberg never achieved quite the same action-hero persona, but as an archetype of the politician-as-C.E.O., he was nationally famous enough that he is still having to explain why he did not grace the 2016 presidential ticket with his presence.

Mayor de Blasio, in theory, might someday enter the White House (without joining a group tour). But as what, exactly? What is his “brand?” Many of his administration’s headline-making initiatives seem comically pointillist in scope, even absurdist, as if conjured by a late-night Mad Libs sessions in City Hall. Who can forget the crackdown on motorcycle wheelies? The striking down of the ban on ferret ownership? The new curbs on subway pole dancing?

That is the outsider’s view, anyway. To those who work in or around city politics, this administration has been anything but dull. The mayor — at times feisty, at times aloof — has become embroiled in countless headline-grabbing tussles with the tabloids, the police force and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat. He has had to fight off both a state and federal investigation into his fund-raising.

Legacy, however, is about perception, not policy, and when it comes to perception, timing is everything. It is neither fair nor sane to credit (or blame) a mayor with everything that happens in the city on his watch. Everyone does it anyway.

New Yorkers, for example, tend to forget the patronage scandals and crack wars of the years under Mayor Edward I. Koch. What they remember is “Hizzoner,” a cuddly cartoon vision of an irrepressible New Yorker who we think brought New York back from the dead.

Not that Mr. Koch had much to do with the booming stock market, which flooded the streets with Salomon Brothers bonus money that heated up the market for TriBeCa lofts, bad installation art and squid-ink pasta to surface-of-Mercury levels. Mayor Koch was not out there on the floor at Danceteria, teaching a young Madonna her moves, or scribbling rhymes for Slick Rick, or guiding Basquiat’s paintbrush. But it is all part of the lore of the “Koch years.”

Mayor de Blasio, by contrast, inherited a city that was in fine health, but even so, we’re left feeling around for its pulse.

The new mayor had not even moved from his home in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn to Gracie Mansion when celebrated New Yorkers, including David Byrne, the former frontman of the Talking Heads, started to decree the city “over.” In an oft-quoted Guardian essay from 2013, Mr. Byrne decried the sterile, moneyed New York as a lifeless museum city, like Venice — since “most of Manhattan and many parts of Brooklyn are virtual walled communities, pleasure domes for the rich.”

The next year, Moby, the techno pioneer, tea shop entrepreneur and longtime cultural truffle pig, went so far as to declare Los Angeles, not New York, the new mecca for young bohemians, in another Guardian essay. Having done the Horace Greeley thing himself, Moby, a former East Village resident, hailed his new West Coast headquarters as a place where young artists “can really experiment” — and live cheap and fail fast.

This creeping bouge-ification that left the city a sea of chain stores and Starbucks did not happen overnight. But even Mr. Bloomberg had the Strokes.

Those tattooed New York cool kids who haven’t yet decamped for Silver Lake might at least give Mayor de Blasio credit for trying. His tenure has seen the loosening of marijuana enforcement (low-level possession often results in a summons, not arrest, particularly for whites), and the overturning of the oft-derided cabaret law, which made it illegal to dance in bars, going back to the days of the Charleston.

Even so, the aging hipsters who forever croak about the grit and glamour of the bad old days will hardly find solace in a New York where CBGB is still a John Varvatos boutique, smoking remains taboo unless we’re talking lox at Barney Greengrass, and the police hand out $190 tickets for running a red light ... on a bicycle. Sodom and Gomorrah this ain’t.

Maybe we should count it as a blessing that, after a four-decade journey back from the brink, New York as a whole has, for what may be a very brief moment between recessions and terror attacks, the luxury of worrying about small things.

On a recent trip home to Brooklyn on the F train, for instance, I spotted a poster sponsored by the Office of the Mayor. “Midnight Snack,” the message read, over a close-up of a raccoon’s masked face. “Like all New Yorkers, raccoons know where to find a good meal. Please don’t feed NYC’s night life.”

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

The liberation of Raqqa, Syria, the Islamic State’s final stronghold, has severely weakened the group as a military threat. But as its members slink off the battlefield to melt into local populations or infiltrate nations in Europe, Africa and around the world, they leave a region in ruins and an almost impossible challenge for the United States.

Over four gruesome years, ISIS swallowed up large areas of Iraq and Syria, taking control of oil fields and using beheadings, rapes and other cruelties to terrorize populations. Now, the degradation of the group has allowed Iran, Russia and others to scramble for advantage. The anti-ISIS coalition is fracturing, reviving divisions and creating conditions that could allow the extremists to regroup. And American leaders seem to have no clear plan to manage this instability or to capitalize on their military success.

One big concern is the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan, which until recently was Iraq’s anchor. Today its future, and that of a unified Iraq, is in doubt. That’s because of an independence referendum in September that was pushed through by Masoud Barzani, then the Kurdish leader, despite warnings from Iraq’s central government, Turkey, Iran and the United States — the Kurds’ main ally — that the vote could lead to Iraq’s dissolution, undermine the anti-ISIS fight and widen divisions even among Kurdish factions.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Baghdad last month to urge the Kurds — who have been among the most capable foes of ISIS — and the central government to settle their differences. After that, the Kurds announced plans to suspend the independence drive and enter talks. Calming Iraq-Kurds tensions and resolving longstanding grievances, like finding a fair formula for sharing oil profits, while maintaining Kurdistan’s standing as a semiautonomous region should be an American priority.

“Literal people may ask, Why, then, does not woman have the right of suffrage?” it stated. “The answer is easy. She does not want it. Of course, it must be admitted that women, or some women, think they want the ballot. But they do not really want it.”

It continued: “Philosophers have observed that the female desire is invariably kindled by that which is, or seems to be, unattainable.”

The article — which examined a debate between Anthony and Edward Rosewater, a Republican politician and newspaper editor from Omaha — shot down Anthony’s assertion that disenfranchisement was akin to degradation. To be “disfranchised,” it stated, one would have to be robbed of a right “he (or she) already holds.”

It then reinforced a central argument made by those who opposed women’s suffrage: that it would lead to the destruction of the traditional home. “To give woman the ballot, provided woman wanted it, would be to bring desolation and distraction into multitudes of happy homes.”

Ms. Bernikow, whose current work focuses on the effort to achieve women’s suffrage in New York City, said The Times and its editors were “speaking to the status quo.”

“They’re entrenched white men,” she said. “The main boogeyman that they’ve come up with is home life.”

It took another generation for the movement to gain a wider audience, Ms. Bernikow said. Harriot Stanton Blatch, a daughter of the women’s rights pioneer Elizabeth Cady Stanton, broadened the movement from its initial focus on morality — that it was immoral to believe that women were not citizens.

Blatch’s method: Appeal to the court of public opinion by holding open-air meetings, speaking from soapboxes on street corners, and holding parades and marches with banners and pins.

This next iteration of the movement also benefited from a vast network of suffrage-focused media. “They had magazines, ways of distributing information that didn’t depend of the mainstream press, tons of it,” Ms. Bernikow said. “That made a huge difference.”

The earlier revolutionaries were meeting in churches and petitioning the state and federal governments, but not enough citizens were paying attention. Anthony’s 1872 vote and the subsequent trial had a very small audience.

“Until the turn of the 20th century, that’s the kind of movement it was,” Ms. Bernikow said. “You were basically speaking to the converted.”

Women’s activists in the early 1900s also gained support by appealing to working women who were persuaded that having the vote would improve conditions. “That’s a huge number, particularly in New York City — the garment workers,” Ms. Bernikow said.

And marchers took to the streets, “extremely organized in military ranks,” Ms. Bernikow said, disproving stereotypes that were common about women at the time — that they couldn’t be organized and had no discipline.

The Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, the de facto royal hotel, was evacuated on Saturday, stirring rumors that it would be used to house detained royals. The airport for private planes was closed, arousing speculation that the crown prince was seeking to block rich businessmen from fleeing before more arrests.

Prince Alwaleed was giving interviews to the Western news media as recently as late last month about subjects like so-called crypto currencies and Saudi Arabia’s plans for a public offering of shares in its state oil company, Aramco.

He has also recently sparred publicly with President Donald J. Trump. The prince was part of a group of investors who bought control of the Plaza Hotel in New York from Mr. Trump, and he also bought an expensive yacht from him as well. But in a twitter message in 2015 the prince called Mr. Trump “a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.”

Mr. Trump fired back, also on Twitter, that “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money.”

As president, Mr. Trump has developed a warm, mutually supportive relationship with the ascendant crown prince, who has rocketed from near obscurity in recent years to taking control of the country’s most important functions.

Before sparring with Mr. Trump, Prince Alwaleed was publicly rebuffed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who rejected his $10 million donation for the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York because the prince had also criticized American foreign policy.

As powerful as the billionaire is, he is something of an outsider within the royal family — not a dissident, but an unusually outspoken figure on a variety of issues. He openly supported women driving long before the kingdom said it would grant them the right to do so, and he has long employed women in his orbit.

In 2015 he pledged to donate his fortune of $32 billion to charity after his death. It was unclear Saturday whether Saudi Arabia’s corruption committee might seek to confiscate any of his assets.

Saudi Arabia is an executive monarchy without a written Constitution or independent government institutions like a Parliament or courts, so accusations of corruption are difficult to evaluate. The boundaries between the public funds and the wealth of the royal family are murky at best, and corruption, as other countries would describe it, is believed to be widespread.

The arrests came a few hours after the king replaced the minister in charge of the Saudi national guard, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, who controlled the last of the three Saudi armed forces not yet considered to be under control of the crown prince.

The king named Crown Prince Mohammed the minister of defense in 2015. Earlier this year, the king removed Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as head of the interior ministry, placing him under house arrest and extending the crown prince’s influence over the interior ministry’s troops, which act as a second armed force.

Rumors have swirled since then that King Salman and his favorite son would soon move against Prince Mutaib, commander of the third armed force and himself a former contender for the crown.","Saudi Arabia Arrests 11 Princes, Including Billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-waleed-bin-talal.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

About 12 strikes were heard hitting the defense ministry downtown and other targets mostly on the city outskirts. The exchange of fire took place on a day when the region was on edge over the growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Earlier, the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, resigned from a unity government that includes Iran’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah. Speaking from Riyadh, he blamed Iran for interfering in Arab affairs. Iran and Hezbollah read the move as pressure from Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hariri’s patron, to isolate them as part of a campaign to curb Iranian influence.

The Yemeni defense ministry has claimed several times to have fired a Burqan 2 missile at Saudi Arabia, which has acknowledged at least one previous strike.

Residents and travelers in Riyadh reported a loud explosion on Saturday. The Twitter account of King Khalid International Airport issued a message saying airport operations had not been affected.

Videos from the scene showed people rushing to airport windows, smoke and what appeared to be flashes or fires on the ground.

One showed red flares rising toward the sky.

Military analysts at IHS Jane’s have written that the Houthis’ emerging use of ballistic missiles offers some support for American, Saudi and Israeli allegations that Iran is aiding them with parts or technology, but add that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen. Another possibility, the analysts say, is that the missiles were acquired by Yemen from North Korea before the current conflict.

In Sana, jets were heard overhead and residents reported airstrikes. Ali Hassan, a taxi driver, said that roads leading to the defense ministry downtown were closed by the police.

“I saw smoke rising from the ministry,” he said, adding that he also saw an airstrike in another area where a weapon depot was located.

The ministry is in a densely populated area, a World Heritage site known as Bab al-Yemen, which has been targeted before. Saudi-led coalition jets could be heard over Sana. The bulk of airstrikes in retaliation reportedly targeted the outskirts of Sana.

“It is grueling, they tell me, but fortunately, historically that has not been a problem for me,” Mr. Trump said.
In contrast, Mr. Abe and Mr. Xi are newly empowered, with their countries handing them sweeping mandates.
Mr. Trump denied being at a disadvantage when reporters noted on Sunday that Mr. Xi was in a particularly powerful position.","“We’ve dealt ISIS one brutal defeat after another, and it’s about time,” he added, then noting that he had proposed increases in the defense budget. “That’s a lot different than in the past.”

On his way to Japan, Mr. Trump told reporters he would probably meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia next week to discuss the North Korean threat, part of his 12-day, five-country tour through Asia that is also likely to focus heavily on trade.

White House officials had said that a meeting by Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin — who last held face-to-face talks in Hamburg, Germany, in July — was a possibility on the sideline of the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Da Nang, Vietnam.

“We want Putin’s help on North Korea,” Mr. Trump said.

The White House also signaled that Mr. Trump could decide on this trip to designate North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism, a largely symbolic move since it is already among the world’s most heavily sanctioned countries. Still, the gesture would reinforce the administration’s efforts to cast the North as a global pariah.

Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, and other administration officials are looking at the prospect “very closely,” a senior White House official told reporters in Tokyo on Sunday, and a decision will come “very soon.”

The president used his speech on Sunday to call for building a “free and open Indo-Pacific” region, a new approach to Asia that is likely to be seen by China as a challenge. The idea, first proposed by the Japanese and adopted in recent days by Mr. Tillerson, envisions the United States strengthening ties with three other democracies in the region — Japan, Australia and India — to contain a rising China.

“We will seek new opportunities for cooperation and commerce, and we will partner with friends and allies to pursue a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” Mr. Trump said. “We will seek free fair and reciprocal trade.”

Mr. Trump’s trip to the continent will be the longest by an American president in more than 25 years, with additional stops in South Korea, China and the Philippines. Ahead of what his advisers called a grueling schedule of meetings and summits, the president got a chance to relax by playing golf on Sunday afternoon with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at Kasumigaseki Country Club.

The outing was reciprocation for rounds that Mr. Trump hosted in Jupiter, Fla. and nearby West Palm Beach in February for Mr. Abe and Ernie Els, once the world’s top golfer. For Sunday’s round, Mr. Abe invited Hideki Matsuyama, a Japanese golfer ranked fourth in the world. Before the game, the Japanese prime minister presented Mr. Trump with white caps in the style of the president’s trademark red “Make America Great Again” trucker hats; Mr. Abe’s were emblazoned in gold: “Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.”

“Prime Minister Abe is called a trainer of wild animals,” said Fumio Hirai, a commentator on a morning news show on Fuji TV. “And the world is watching how he does with President Trump.”

The already extensive trip grew longer still on Friday when Mr. Trump abruptly announced to reporters that he would attend the East Asia Summit in Manila on Nov. 14, adding a day to his travels.

“It is grueling, they tell me, but fortunately, historically that has not been a problem for me,” Mr. Trump said. “If I don’t stay fresh, you’ll be the first to tell me. I’ll stay fresh.”

White House officials have framed the trip as a chance for Mr. Trump to showcase his warm relationships with world leaders including Mr. Abe and President Xi Jinping of China, as well as to demand trade deals more favorable to the United States after his decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But it will also highlight the uncertainty in the region and around the world about what to expect from the Trump administration, and the degree to which major powers are charting their own course in the absence of clear signals from the United States.

Mr. Trump also makes the trip hobbled by new questions about the Russia investigation back in Washington, sharpened in recent days by revelations that his aides sought to arrange meetings between him and Mr. Putin during the campaign. In contrast, Mr. Abe and Mr. Xi are newly empowered, with their countries handing them sweeping mandates.

Mr. Trump denied being at a disadvantage when reporters noted on Sunday that Mr. Xi was in a particularly powerful position.

“Excuse me, so am I,” Mr. Trump said, citing stock market gains and low unemployment in the United States, and asserting that “ISIS is virtually defeated in the Middle East.”

“We are coming off some of the strongest numbers we’ve ever had, and he knows that and he respects that,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Xi. “We’re going in with tremendous strength.”

Mr. Trump’s ability to stay on message during a lengthy and physically demanding trip will most likely be tested, with many opportunities for gaffes or intemperate language.

On Sunday, North Korea’s state media accused Mr. Trump of provoking the country with “foolish remarks” and said “the only and one way for checking his rash act is to tame him with absolute physical power.” The commentary in North Korea’s state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun added: “We warn Trump’s coteries once again. If they want to avoid ruin, do not make reckless remarks.”

Asked last week whether the president — who likes to refer to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, as “Little Rocket Man” and spoke about raining “fire and fury” on his country — would seek to temper his rhetoric while he traveled through the region, his national security adviser was frank.

“The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously,” Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster told reporters. “I don’t think the president really modulates his language — have you noticed him do that?”",Trump Opens Asia Trip Talking Tough in Campaign-Style Rally,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/asia/trump-asia-japan-korea.html

On Tuesday, water and electricity to the camp were shut off, and detainees were supposed to move to temporary housing in Lorengau, a city close by on the island.

Many of the men refused, citing previous attacks by residents in Lorengau. Instead the migrants barricaded themselves inside, using solar power for their phones and digging wells for water as police cars circled.

“It’s very surprising to see it come to this level,” said Jonathan Pryke, Pacific Islands program director for the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. “It just seems like a complete mess.”

By Thursday, conditions in the camp appeared to have declined.

One detainee, Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran, said the men were experiencing dehydration, hunger, anxiety and the fear of attack and disease.

“Heat, humidity, hunger and incessant mosquitoes are taking their toll,” Mr. Boochani wrote on Facebook. “This is not a hunger strike. It is a situation that the Australian government has created, forcing people into starvation and these harsh conditions by refusing to offer a safe place for resettlement.”

By Friday, detainees said conditions were leading to illness. One asylum seeker, Imran Mohammad, said in a text message that three diabetic men had fallen ill because they were unable to get insulin, and the camp was strewn with garbage.

Who is responsible?

The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea each claim the other is responsible for relocating the men until a permanent solution can be found.

Australia has pledged 250 million Australian dollars, or $193 million, for the men’s food and security at the facilities in Lorengau for the next year.

Julie Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister, said on Thursday that it made “no sense” for the detainees to remain at the camp. But Nat Jit Lam, the regional representative of the United Nations’ refugee agency, said the temporary housing was incomplete and unsafe.

“I will not be bringing any refugee there to stay — not in that state,” Mr. Lam told ABC Radio of Australia.

In a statement issued Thursday, the agency said: “Australia remains responsible for the well-being of all those moved to Papua New Guinea until adequate, long-term solutions outside the country are found.”

What will happen to the detainees?

Australia has consistently said it will not accept the men for resettlement.

They have all been given the option of permanent residency in Papua New Guinea, or applying to resettle in Cambodia or Nauru, the location of a second offshore facility run by the Australian government. None of the men still on Manus have accepted the offer, according to reports.

American officials said dozens if not hundreds of refugees from Manus and Nauru would be accepted in the coming weeks and months. About 50 men already moved to the United States in September under a deal brokered by former President Barack Obama.

Jacinda Ardern, the new prime minister of New Zealand, also said this week she would an honor a predecessor’s pledge to accept 150 refugees. The Australian government has been reluctant to allow New Zealand to accept the men, fearing it would open a legal backdoor to Australia.

If those options do not work out, there is another possibility: Russell Crowe, the Australian actor, offered on Twitter Wednesday to provide housing and jobs for six of the men.

Courting the Superintendents

In Baltimore County and beyond, the digital makeover of America’s schools has spawned a circuit of conferences, funded by Microsoft, Google, Dell and other tech vendors, that lavish attention on tech-friendly educators.

Mr. Dance’s travel schedule sheds light on that world.

Between March 2014, when the laptop contract was announced, and April 2017, when he announced his resignation, Mr. Dance took at least 65 out-of-state trips related to the district’s tech initiatives or involving industry-funded groups, according to a Times analysis of travel documents obtained under public records laws — nearly two trips per month on average. Those trips cost more than $33,000. The Times counted only trips with local receipts, indicating Mr. Dance set foot in the cities.

At least $13,000 of Mr. Dance’s airline tickets, hotel bills, meals and other fees were paid for by organizations sponsored by tech companies, some of which were school vendors, The Times found. The $13,000 is an incomplete number, because some groups cover superintendents’ costs directly, which means school records may not include them.

Another way tech companies reach superintendents is to pay private businesses that set up conferences or small-group meetings with them. Superintendents nationwide have attended these events.

One prominent provider is the Education Research and Development Institute, or ERDI, which regularly gathers superintendents and other school leaders for conferences where they can network with companies that sell to schools.

ERDI offered several service levels this year, according to a membership rate card obtained by The Times. A $13,000 fee for Bronze membership entitles a company to one confidential meeting, where executives can meet with five school leaders to discuss products and school needs. Diamond members could pay $66,000 for six such meetings.

ERDI has offered superintendents $2,000 per conference as participating consultants, according to a Louisiana Board of Ethics filing. And there are other perks.

“Because we are asking for their time and expertise, we commonly offer to pay the cost of their food, transportation and lodging during their participation,” ERDI’s president, David M. Sundstrom, said in an email.

Mr. Dance’s calendar indicated that he had attended at least five ERDI events.

Mr. Dance received payment last year as an adviser for ERDI, according to his most recent district financial disclosure. It lists Dulle Enterprises, a company that owned ERDI in the past, as an employer from which he earned income.

Last February, at an ERDI conference in New Orleans, Mr. Dance met with Curriculum Associates, which makes reading software, as well as DreamBox Learning, a math platform.

At the time, both companies had contracts with the district. A few months after the event, the school board approved additional money for both companies. Each contract is now worth about $3.2 million.

A DreamBox spokeswoman said there was no connection between the meeting and its contract. “Even the appearance of impropriety is something we take very seriously and take steps to avoid,” she said.

A Curriculum Associates spokeswoman said: “These panels are not sales presentations, but rather focus-group opportunities to solicit feedback on products under development.”

Ms. White, the interim superintendent, has been involved with ERDI since 2013, according to Mr. Dickerson. He said Ms. White used vacation time to attend events, where she “provided guidance to education-related companies on goods, services and products that are in development to benefit student performance.”

Asked whether Ms. White had received ERDI payments, Mr. Dickerson said, “Participation in ERDI is done independently of the school system.” In an email, Ms. White said she found ERDI to be a “beneficial professional learning experience.” She didn’t respond to a question about ERDI compensation.

She added, “I do not believe there are any conflicts of interests” related to the district’s tech initiative.

Mr. Sundstrom, ERDI’s president, said education companies pay a fee to attend events “not to meet school leaders or make a sale,” but to get meaningful feedback on their education products from knowledgeable school leaders. He added that school officials do not make purchases at ERDI sessions and that it is their school boards that approve district purchases.

Late Thursday, Twitter employees gathered in private Slack channels and used Twitter to send direct messages to one another to remark on how insecure Mr. Trump’s account had been, according to people involved in the conversations. Hundreds of employees can access the accounts of so-called Very Important Tweeters and can take actions like disabling the accounts, according to the current and former employees.

A Twitter spokeswoman referred to the company’s earlier remarks, noting it was conducting an internal investigation into the matter. On Friday, the company tweeted that it had added new safeguards to prevent a repeat of the incident, and said it would not be able to share all the details of its investigation.

Mr. Trump, for his part, remarked that the incident reflected the impact his Twitter messages have had. He tweeted with gusto on Friday, firing off more than a dozen messages over the course of the day on issues including ISIS and Hillary Clinton.

The discovery that it was a contractor who deleted Mr. Trump’s account is difficult for Twitter, as well as other technology companies. Nearly every major technology company including Google, Facebook and Apple relies on contract employees to fill positions. In general, the jobs tend to be nontechnical roles such as customer support or administrative and operational positions.

Many of these workers are brought on by staffing companies like Accenture, Adecco and Cognizant and work on renewable one-year contracts. Facebook, Twitter and other companies also outsource content review to third-party services like ProUnlimited and Cognizant, which are essentially internet call centers staffed with hundreds of workers who deal with customer service issues.

Many of these people work side by side with full-time employees, but they are often paid significantly less, are identified with different color employee badges, and are not afforded the same perks and amenities that full-time workers have. Many complain of being treated like second-class citizens.

At the congressional hearings this week, Facebook and Twitter had discussed how they planned to hire more people to help prohibit the misuse of their platforms. Facebook said it was hiring an additional 10,000 workers to review flagged content, bringing the total to 20,000 by the end of 2018.

But in a conference call with investors on Wednesday, Facebook said many of the new workers are not likely to be full-time employees; the company will largely rely on third-party contractors.

At Twitter, employees have long expressed concern about the widely available nature of internal tools for handling customer accounts. Disabling an account is typically an easy two- or three-step process, according to current and former Twitter employees. Certain teams at the company — including trust and safety, and operations — have access to all accounts including the highest levels.

Twitter customer support cannot, however, access customers’ private direct messages, nor can it tweet on behalf of other users, these people said.

In the past, Twitter has discussed adding additional layers of security that would prohibit wide internal access to V.I.T. accounts, according to these people. That included a kind of “dual layer” of security, requiring assurances from multiple employees to make significant changes to accounts.

In the end, the company did not follow through with the plans, these people said.

While Keflezighi was in high school, Bob Larsen, then the track coach at U.C.L.A., watched him in a meet and saw fortitude that hinted at great distance-running potential. In the fall of 1993, Larsen visited the family’s three-bedroom apartment in Southern California.

“I get there and I am just really wowed by the family and what they’ve accomplished with so little,” Larsen said. “I offered a full scholarship. Fortunately, a lot of people knew me in San Diego, so they were encouraging. They said: ‘Bob doesn’t give full scholarships. If he’s offering a full, this is special.’ Facetiously a little bit, I say I gave the scholarship not to Meb, I gave it to his family. They have the key on how to motivate sons and daughters.”

Working with Larsen, Keflezighi won four N.C.A.A. distance-running championships.

Keflezighi became an American citizen in 1998 and made his first Olympic team in 2000, in the 10,000 meters.

He would make three more Olympic teams. He ran his first marathon, New York City’s, in 2002, and vowed never to do it again because it was painful and he struggled to finish. Now, he says he is glad he stuck with it. Just two years later, he placed second in the race.

At the 2013 Boston Marathon, Keflezighi attended as a spectator. He was walking to his hotel near the finish line when two bombs exploded there, killing three people and injuring hundreds. The next year, Keflezighi returned to the marathon as a competitor with four names scribbled on his bib — honoring the people killed at the race as well as a law enforcement officer who was slain by the bombers during a subsequent manhunt. Although far from a favorite, Keflezighi won — the first American man to do so in more than 30 years.

When he was shown crossing the Boston finish line in a tribute video during a New York Road Runners award ceremony on Thursday in Central Park, his father stood, raised his left fist in the air and burst into tears. His mother cried, prayed and made the sign of the cross. That was the only one of Keflezighi’s marathons that his parents missed.

More than 16 million millennial women are now mothers, according to Pew, a number that grows by more than a million every year.

Eighty-two percent of children born each year are born to millennial mothers. That’s five out of every six babies. And their parents — let’s call them “parennials” — are challenging all sorts of commonly held beliefs about the American family.

Let’s examine their innovations one at a time.

#HASHTAGBABY

Parennials spent their formative years steeped in personal technology. As a result they’re “high-information parents,” said Rebecca Parlakian, the program director for Zero to Three, an organization that has been studying new parents since 1977.

“The good news is that parents know more about child development than ever before,” she said. “Google is the new grandparent, the new neighbor, the new nanny.”

The bad news is that parents feel overwhelmed by the volume of information, confused about the “right way” to do things and harshly judged by friends and relatives.

Kate Flynn, 32, lives in Brooklyn with her 11-month-old daughter, Isla, and her college sweetheart, Michael. Like many new parents, she felt unprepared for the responsibility. “We feel like kids who aren’t old enough to have kids,” she said.

To compensate, she relies on technology, from chat rooms to child development apps like Wonder Weeks and WebMDBaby.

“I’ll be on the phone with my mom and say, ‘The app is telling me that she is starting her 9-month sleep progression,’” Ms. Flynn said. “I just found out that Wonder Weeks only goes to when the child is one. I don’t know if that’s liberating or scary.”

Many parennials, accustomed to chronicling every fab appetizer and every failed job interview, give their children YouTube channels from the first sonogram and hashtags when they’re born.

Sara Mauskopf, 32, a onetime employee of Google from Philadelphia who is now a partner with Ms. Halsall in Winnie, a parenting start-up, even named her daughter with her social media profile in mind.

“I knew I wanted to name her Brynn, but when considering middle names, there were a couple of ‘A’ names we were thinking about. We chose Brynn Avery because I could get the Twitter handle @BrynnAvery,” Ms. Mauskopf said.

Others, like Kassandra Ortiz, 26, a stay-at-home mother of two in Brooklyn, are warier. After being stalked online by a classmate who posted her photo along with comments about what he wanted to do to her, Ms. Ortiz considers herself “overly protective” of her children.

“I like taking pictures of my kids walking away, so I avoid showing their faces,” Ms. Ortiz said. “I have this fear that if I post a picture on Instagram, then my child will become a meme.”

Goodbye, ‘Mom’ and ‘Dad.’ Hello, ‘Co-Parents.’

Brad Harrington, the executive director of the Boston College Center for Work & Family, has found that a third of millennial families follow traditional gender roles and are comfortable with their decision. Another third of them say spouses should share chores equally and feel they achieve this goal, while the final third strive for this equality but the female partner, in reality, does more.

“For 30 years we’ve been asking, ‘Can women have it all?’” Mr. Harrington said. “Now we’re asking if men can have it all.”

Gabe Wells, 33, a loan officer, was born in Iowa and moved to Portland, Ore., with his wife, Caitlin, who was his girlfriend at the time. When she became pregnant, the two went through a “rough patch,” he said, and went into counseling.

“The No. 1 thing I learned is that my language changed,” he said. “I don’t say ‘mother’ and ‘father’ anymore. I say ‘co-parent.’ It sounds odd to people in the Midwest, but it’s more reflective of what we’re trying to do.”

They realize 50-50 is “a pipe dream,” he said. “But If we can trade off going 60-40, that’s great.”

Co-parenting does come with downsides. Ms. Parlakian of Zero to Three said she’s begun to detect a new theme in her annual surveys of parents. She calls it “gate-keeping,” when the less-involved parent tries to step up but the primary parent slaps the partner down, saying “You did it the wrong way” or “Why did you put the baby in that?”

“Given the statement ‘I would like to be more involved with raising my child but my parenting partner interferes with my involvement,’ nearly half the dads agree,” Ms. Parlakian said, “while only 16 percent of moms do.”

From her experience running Winnie, Ms. Halsall has concluded that “millennial dads are different than their elders, in that they see it as a positive masculine trait to be involved with their children,” she said.

“The idea that women are more proactively issuing feedback to their co-parents that are male to me sounds very encouraging. It’s an indication that they see each other as partners.”

Can Granny Pay the Rent?

New parents of all ages often face money woes, but with parennials these challenges can feel particularly acute because they reached childbearing age during the Great Recession, are saddled with college debt and are perhaps job-hopping or part of the gig economy.

As a result, many parennials rely on their own baby boomer parents for financial support. Ms. Ortiz has started a photography business on the side while her husband, who hopes to get into real estate, drives for Uber. To make ends meet, they get financial help with rent from her mother-in-law.

“Money has always been an issue, but we do our best and hope God will provide,” Ms. Ortiz said. “I don’t know if it’s a millennial thing, but we spend so much money eating out. We’d be better off if we didn’t.”

Jess Laird, 31, grew up in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan with parents who were “broke actors,” she said, so she’s used to money struggles. She was working full-time when she had her first child at 29, but wanted to spend more time with her daughter. Since then, she has worked at a start-up that went out of business and now freelances remotely. She is still paying off her undergraduate loans, and her husband, Morgan, is doing the same with his law school debt.

With so much financial pressure, they rely on her mother for child care.

“Other moms I talk to who are 35 or 40 seem to be more settled financially,” she said. “It feels weird when I say, ‘My mom is taking care of my kid.’ I even use the word ‘mother’ because it sounds more adult.”

Losing Their Religion

Gender roles are not the only thing being challenged by parennials; other social norms are experiencing upheaval as well. Pew has found that almost four in 10 Americans married since 2010 have a spouse who is a different religious group, double the number from 1960. Nine in 10 millennials approve of interracial marriage or cross-cultural marriage.

The disdain of Andrew Moore, 33, and his wife, Rachel, 31, for religion has caused friction with his family, who were missionaries. “My mom just doesn’t talk about it,” said Mr. Moore, a physical scientist who is the father of Harrison, 2. “My father asked me, not long after I told him I was nonreligious, whether I would raise my children Christian. I was, like, ‘No, man, I don’t believe it.’”

The one thing they’re teaching him, he said, is “Some people get value from religion, and he might, too, as long as he realizes that what’s good for him might not be great for another.”

This sense of fluidity, of improvisation, of “making it work” in the words of one couple, or “getting by” in the words of another, appears to be an early, unifying theme of millennial parents. Maybe it’s their uncertain economic status, their sense of experimentation, or simply the times they grew up in, but many parennials seem less rigid than their elders.

“I thought we were supposed to do things a certain way,” said Ms. Flynn of Brooklyn, who had multiple jobs and multiple apartments when she was in her 20s. “Have the career, the house, the green grass, and then the kid. But that didn’t happen. My life has a different plan.

“Having a kid when things are unstable like this,” she said, “feels like a start-up. We kind of know where we are going with this, but we don’t know how it’s going to turn out.”",App Time for Nap Time: The Parennials Are Here,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/style/millennial-parents-parennials.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The Hamar, numbering 45,000 throughout the valley, are known to be pastoralists. The village was overflowing with cattle. As in Dus, the dwellings were simple, built of sticks and grass, and well ordered. Young men tended cattle while a woman skinned and butchered a goat with the help of her toddler, who hung pieces of the animal on a fence beside an AK-47 and a belt of ammo.

“The AK-47 has replaced the spear,” Mr. Jones said.

Mr. Biwa nodded. “As long as you have AK, you are respected,” he said. “Your family feels safe and proud. Someone with no AK, people look down on them. If you do not have AK your family will go to someone who does.”

They were American-made, I was told, gathered during the war in neighboring Sudan.

But they are not cheap,” Mr. Biwa said.

“How much do they cost?” I asked.

“Five cows,” he said.

Beside firearms, I witnessed few other accommodations to the contemporary world in the Omo. Yet for a place so far off the grid, news traveled fast throughout the valley. While in the Hamar village we heard word of a nearby bull-jumping ceremony. The bull jump is a ritual initiation to manhood for both the Hamar and Karo communities. We headed east.

At the end of a long, deeply rutted road we came upon a dusty village in the midst of a celebration. Old men and women gathered in the shade. Young men painted their faces red and white. Young women were draped in skirts and wore large bells wrapped around their calves. Their hair was ornately done in rings caked with ochre-colored mud. Each carried a small horn and blew it incessantly.

When one young woman turned away from me I noticed fresh welts on her bare back, dripping blood; she seemed unaware and continued to dance. Then I saw her approach a young man, stand close in front of him, and blow her horn in his face. She began to jump up and down, her bells clanging, her horn blaring. The young man bent to the ground and picked up a long switch and raised it over his head. The woman blew her horn more insistently, then suddenly stopped. She stared at the young man. He struck her with the whip, which snapped around her body and lashed across her back with a sharp cracking sound. She did not flinch. She lifted her horn, blew it in his face and danced away, fresh blood rising on her back. The same performance was repeated again and again by many of the young women. Their backs were covered in old scars and new welts, yet none of them displayed any outward signs of pain.

As the sun was setting, a dozen bulls were led to a clearing and aligned flank to flank. The women clustered together and began jumping, their bells ringing out, their horns blasting. Others began to chant. Suddenly a naked young man leapt up on the back of the first bull and raced across the spine of each. He jumped down after the last bull, but then he was up again, racing across their backs in the other direction. He repeated the back-and-forth exercise three times. If he fell it would be a disgrace he would carry for life, Mr. Biwa had warned me. But the youth never faltered — the next morning he would awake a man, able to sit among the elders.

The women continued to blow their horns and the celebration continued on into the night. We drove away under a moonless sky, the Southern Cross hanging low, silence filling our car.

The next morning we headed up river to a small village of the Nyangatom people. Relations between Karo and Nyangatom have long been strained. Intertribal conflicts over cattle rustling and grazing land have kept the valley bristling with internal strife for decades, passed down from generation to generation, Mr. Biwa said.

“Where we are going, this was our land until 15 years ago,” Mr. Biwa said as he throttled our engine through the brown water. “The Nyangatom are fierce fighters. They pushed us across the river. Our women tell us we are weak. Not just with their words. They dance — in front of everyone. It is a shame we wear.”

We passed large crocodiles cooling themselves on the muddy banks, their jaws resting open. Black-and-white colobus monkeys leapt from branches of fig trees. A dugout canoe sat unattended on the riverbank. A Goliath heron lumbered into the air.

In time the heavy foliage lining the river thinned, then grew sparse. Thirty-foot cliffs began to rise up and the landscape turned parched. Ahead, on the west bank, bony cattle were drinking from the river, kicking a choking dust high into the sky and across the sun, casting everything in an eerie patina. Atop the cliff, two men stood sentry. One had an AK-47 slung from his shoulder; the other wore what in a more urban setting might have been called a hipster hat. The tribes wore a mishmash of clothing — brightly colored traditional wraps, animal skins and adornments, mixed freely with Chelsea football jerseys, rakish caps and fatigue shorts — creating an all too apt picture of Africa’s disparate influences, all vying for dominance.

The men on the cliff greeted us with stares, and we set out across the arid land. Distant hills of Kenya were visible to the south. Three young girls with water jugs balancing on their heads silently caught up with us. One carried the designs of scarification — small, raised scars created by rubbing charcoal in deliberately administered cuts, causing the skin to welt in intricate patterns. They made this two-mile walk to and from the river twice daily — in Africa carrying water is women’s work.

At the outskirts of the village, a half-dozen expressionless men loitered. The tallest sported a vaguely military-looking beret, worn at a jaunty angle, and an AK-47. The rest held long sticks. Some wore rubber sandals made from scavenged truck ties; the others were barefoot.

Many Nyangatom are seminomadic and this village appeared haphazardly thrown together, as if built in a rush, without care. There was no central meeting area, no sense of organization. Children did not rush to greet us. We huddled with the men in the scant shade of a scraggly date tree. Cigarettes were passed around and smoked.

In time, more than a dozen women emerged from the honeycomb-shaped dwellings that looked as if they could neither contain nor shelter life. One old woman began to chant, then just as suddenly stopped. All wore heavy ropes of beaded necklaces piled high and were wrapped from the waist in once colorful cloth, and several held small children. Fatigue hung in the blistering heat. It would have been difficult to imagine daily life clinging closer to the edge of existence.

“The cradle of mankind is no Garden of Eden,” Mr. Jones said softly as we tracked back cross the barren land to the boat.

Back down the river, the mood was more celebratory — a ceremony was underway in Dus. Two hundred men from Mr. Biwa’s Karo community were gathering in a large semicircle on a bluff above the river. Seating was arranged from the youngest to the most senior elder. I was offered a spot in the dirt much too far along the timeline for my liking.

A bull was being roasted over an open fire in the center of the gathering. Three men with machetes hacked the animal to pieces. Chunks of meat and fat, clinging to large bones, were deposited onto small beds of leaves before the assembled. A part of the animal I couldn’t identify was dropped in front of me. The old man beside me with heavily pierced ears and a pointed stick protruding below his lower lip offered me his knife. He watched as I sliced into the mysterious blob, then grinned as I put it in my mouth. Just beyond the circle a dozen hooded vultures gathered.

When the entire animal had been consumed, one of the elders got up and began to speak.

And after really big floods, the program must rely on armies of subcontractors to determine payments, baffling and infuriating policyholders, like Mr. Clutter, who cannot figure out who is opposing their claims, or why.

Roy E. Wright, who has directed the flood insurance program for FEMA since June 2015, acknowledged in an interview on Friday that major changes were called for and said some were already in the works. The program’s rate-setting methods, for example, are 30 years old, he said, and new ones will be phased in over the next two years. But other changes — like cutting off coverage to homes that are repeatedly flooded — would require an act of Congress.

“The administration feels very strongly that there needs to be reform this year,” he said. “I believe strongly that we need to expand flood coverage in the United States, and the private insurers are part of that.”

The federal program was created to fill a void left after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, when multiple levees failed, swamping an area bigger than West Virginia and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. Insurers, terrified of the never-ending claims they might have to pay, started to exclude flooding from homeowners’ insurance policies. For decades, your only hope if your home was damaged in a flood was disaster relief from the government.

Policymakers thought an insurance program would be better than ad hoc bailouts. If crafted properly, it would make developers and homeowners pay for the risks they took.

When Congress established the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968, it hoped to revive the private flood-insurance market. Initially about 130 insurers gave it a shot, pooling their capital with the government. But there were clashes, and eventually the government drove out the insurers and took over most operations.

Since 1983, Washington has set the insurance rates, mapped the floodplains, written the rules and borne all of the risk. The role of private insurers has been confined to marketing policies and processing claims, as government contractors.

That worked for a few decades. But now, relentless coastal development and the increasing frequency of megastorms and billion-dollar floods have changed the calculus.

Unable to Keep Up With the Floods The National Flood Insurance Program has been in the red since 2005, when Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans and it suddenly had to pay out $16.3 billion in claims. $16 billion Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria National Flood Insurance Program: 14 12 Total premiums collected 10 Flood loss claims paid 8 Hurricane Sandy 6 Hurricane Katrina 4 2 0 ’78 ’80 ’85 ’90 ’95 ’00 ’05 ’12 ’17 billion $16 National Flood Insurance Program: 14 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria Total premiums collected 12 Hurricane Katrina Flood loss claims paid 10 8 Hurricane Sandy 6 4 2 0 ’78 ’80 ’85 ’90 ’95 ’00 ’05 ’12 ’17

“Put plainly, the N.F.I.P. is not designed to handle catastrophic losses like those caused by Harvey, Irma and Maria,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in a letter to members of Congress after the three huge hurricanes barreled into the United States this season.

Mr. Mulvaney called on Congress to forgive $16 billion of the program’s debt, which both houses agreed to do.

The program, however, needs more than a financial lifeline: Without major, long-term changes, it will just burn through the $16 billion in savings and be back for more.

The White House is hoping to lure companies back into the market, letting them try to turn a profit on underwriting flood policies instead of simply processing claims for the government.

One measure proposed by the Trump administration is for the government to stop writing coverage on newly built houses on floodplains, starting in 2021. New construction there is supposed to be flood-resistant, and if the government retreats, private insurers may step in. Or so the theory goes.

“The private market is anxious, willing and completely able to take everything except the severe repetitive-loss properties,” said Craig Poulton, chief executive of Poulton Associates, which underwrites American risks for Lloyd’s of London, the big international insurance marketplace.

“Severe repetitive-loss properties” is FEMA’s term for houses that are flooded again and again. There are tens of thousands of them. While they account for fewer than 1 percent of the government’s policies, they make up more than 10 percent of the insurance claims, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, which sued FEMA to get the data.

The Trump administration has also proposed creating a new category of properties that are at extreme risk of repeat flooding and that could have their insurance cut off the next time they flooded.

That might sound harsh. Environmental groups, though, argue it’s worse to repeatedly repair doomed houses on flood-prone sites as oceans warm and sea levels rise. The Natural Resources Defense Council argues that the flood-insurance program should buy such properties so the owners can move somewhere safer.

The program, however, has only limited authority to make such purchases; homeowners need to line up funding through other government agencies. As a result, such buyouts are rare.

“I have mounds and mounds of paper, and I’m still waiting,” said Olga McKissic of Louisville, Ky., who applied for a buyout in 2015 after her house flooded for the fifth time. “I want them to tear it down.”

Ms. McKissic even had her house classified as a severe repetitive-loss property, thinking FEMA would give it higher priority. But FEMA has not responded to her application. Instead, it doubled her premiums.","A Broke, and Broken, Flood Insurance Program",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/a-broke-and-broken-flood-insurance-program.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Competitors picking up their race materials on Thursday chatted excitedly about the course and the doughnuts, beer, pizza and other rewards they would treat themselves to after they crossed the finish line.

There, guided by English-speaking teachers and surrounded by toddlers babbling in loose English, I adopted the new language quickly.

Young bats may not be so different.

Wild fruit bats, living in crowded roosts, are exposed to calls from hundreds of fellow bats from birth. Most often these calls are made in response to unsolicited physical contact, and essentially amount to a crabby “move out of my way.” In a study published Wednesday in PLOS Biology, a team of Israeli researchers found that bat pups match their vocalizations to the group sounds they are immersed in, even if this “dialect” differs from that of their mothers.

Human babies and toddlers pick up the utterances around them effortlessly. The ability, called vocal learning, is considered critical for our spoken language.

But vocal learning has rarely been proven to exist in animals other than humans or songbirds, said Yossi Yovel, a neuroecologist at Tel Aviv University who led the study with graduate students Yosef Prat and Lindsay Azoulay.

In nonhuman mammals, much of the evidence for vocal learning “comes from animals that imitate human speech or other artificial sounds,” such as a zoo elephant emulating the Korean spoken by his keepers, Mr. Prat said. What he and his colleagues wanted to know was how an animal learns the sounds of its own species.

About 12 strikes were heard hitting the defense ministry downtown and other targets mostly on the city outskirts. The exchange of fire took place on a day when the region was on edge over the growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Earlier, the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, resigned from a unity government that includes Iran’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah. Speaking from Riyadh, he blamed Iran for interfering in Arab affairs. Iran and Hezbollah read the move as pressure from Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hariri’s patron, to isolate them as part of a campaign to curb Iranian influence.

The Yemeni defense ministry has claimed several times to have fired a Burqan 2 missile at Saudi Arabia, which has acknowledged at least one previous strike.

Residents and travelers in Riyadh reported a loud explosion on Saturday. The Twitter account of King Khalid International Airport issued a message saying airport operations had not been affected.

Videos from the scene showed people rushing to airport windows, smoke and what appeared to be flashes or fires on the ground.

One showed red flares rising toward the sky.

Military analysts at IHS Jane’s have written that the Houthis’ emerging use of ballistic missiles offers some support for American, Saudi and Israeli allegations that Iran is aiding them with parts or technology, but add that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen. Another possibility, the analysts say, is that the missiles were acquired by Yemen from North Korea before the current conflict.

In Sana, jets were heard overhead and residents reported airstrikes. Ali Hassan, a taxi driver, said that roads leading to the defense ministry downtown were closed by the police.

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

Among individual solvers, Japan’s Ken Endo was first, scoring 7,655 points, far ahead of Germany’s Ulrich Voigt (previous 11-time W.P.C. champion), in second place, with 6,782; and Kota Morinishi, also of Japan, in third, with 6,724. Each puzzle was worth 5 to 250 points depending on difficulty.

Ed Broadbent, the chairman of the progressive Broadbent Institute, called Mr. Sanders the most important social democrat in North America — even though Mr. Sanders is not a Canadian social democrat, and is not even a particularly powerful member of the Senate.

Lesson 2: Doctors like the system as much as patients do

Many developed countries have achieved universal health coverage, but Canada is relatively distinct in its insistence that individuals should not have to pay any money at the point of care. When Canadians go to the doctor or hospital, they just show their Canadian “Medicare” card.

At Women’s College Hospital, executives showed Mr. Sanders an empty billing window. The hospital, they told him, has one employee who manages bills. “For the entire hospital?” Mr. Sanders said, in mock disbelief.

Several patients told him about the comfort that comes from not having to pay for their care directly. And doctors, too, said they felt more comfortable recommending their patients get an operation or see a specialist than they might if those treatments weren’t free.

“I didn’t have to fill out any forms; I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to pay for the simple job of staying alive,” said Lilac Chow, a kidney transplant patient at Toronto General Hospital, who had been brought in to share her experience with the senator.

Whenever Mr. Sanders was asked what he learned about the Canadian system, the value of free care came up.

“What I think stuck out to me was from both the patients and the physicians, the importance of not having to worry about money in terms of the doctor-patient relationship,” he said in an interview after his trip on Tuesday.

His Medicare-for-All bill includes free care as a central feature. If the legislation became law, no American would pay directly for a doctor, dentist or hospital visit, and co-payments for prescription drugs would be limited. (Taxpayers would, of course, finance the system.)

Lesson 3: Sometimes, you have to wait

At a round-table discussion at Women’s College Hospital, the chief of surgery noted that Canadian patients can’t always get all the care they want right away. “Wait times, you could argue are a problem for certain procedures,” said Dr. David Urbach, before discussing the ways the province and hospital were working to shorten the lines. Mr. Sanders quickly turned to the glass-half-full interpretation. “What you are arguing — correct me if I’m wrong — is that waiting times are not a problem, and it’s an issue you are dealing with,” he said.

In Canada, where government finances health insurance and the private sector delivers a lot of the care, patients with life-threatening emergencies are treated right away. But patients with cataracts or arthritis often have to wait for operations the Canadian system considers elective. A governmental review of the Ontario system recently found that wait times were getting worse in some cases, like knee replacements.

The Canadian system puts hospitals on a budget and limits the number of specialists it trains, both factors that can lead to lines for complex care that’s not life-threatening. The system also limits access to services, like M.R.I. scans, that are much more abundant south of the border.

On his weekend tour, Mr. Sanders didn’t see the places where patients might wait. Hospital executives instead showed him a refugee primary care clinic, a neonatal intensive care unit and a cardiac surgery unit.

But he points out that many Americans who are uninsured — or who have limited savings and insurance with high deductibles — may wait even longer than Canadians for elective, or even urgent, care.

“If you’re very, very rich, you’ll get the highest-quality care immediately in the United States,” Mr. Sanders said, in the interview. “If you’re working class, if you’re middle class, it is a very, very different story.”

The Commonwealth Fund, a health research group, ranked the United States health system at the bottom of its most recent 11-country rankings, published in July. But Canada did only a little better, at No. 9. Of all the measures in the study, Canada ranked the worst on the “timeliness” of care. (A team of Upshot experts eliminated Canada in the first round in an eight-country virtual bracket tournament of international health system performance.)

Any single-payer system will need to grapple with how much it should spend over all, and where it will save money. Mr. Sanders’s Medicare-for-All bill currently includes few details about how the government would set budgets and allocate resources once all Americans were brought into the government system.

Lesson 4: Even Canada’s system has holes

Mr. Sanders wants to bring big, sweeping change to the American health care system. Unlike the Affordable Care Act, which filled in holes in an existing system, his Medicare-for-All plan would take away the health coverage that most Americans hold now, replacing it with a single, very generous government system. It would do away with the premiums, deductibles and co-payments that individuals and businesses pay for health care, and instead impose large tax increases.

That is not the kind of change that would be politically trivial. In his speech, he noted that the creation of a single-payer system in Canada and Britain followed grass-roots movements, and political landslides by the parties that favored the change. “Real change always happens from the bottom up,” he said, to big applause. “You’ve got to struggle for it. You’ve got to fight for it. You’ve got to take it. And that is the history of all real change in this world.”

Yet even in Canada, he learned, changes to the health care system have been difficult. The Canadian system, with insurance run at the province level, covers doctors and hospitals. But decades after the 1984 Canada Health Act, many Canadians pay for supplemental private insurance through their jobs for prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry — despite a growing recognition that medications are essential to care.

“Any one of us around the table is just a job loss away from having access to prescription medications, and that’s a problem,” said Danielle Martin, a vice president at Women’s College Hospital and policy researcher, who helped organize the trip, at a round-table discussion.

“I’m on my own going to the dentist,” said Naomi Duguid, a patient, sitting across the table. “It’s the only time I get to experience what it must be like to be an uninsured American.”

Ontario has recently started a program that will provide coverage for medications to residents under 25. And there is a patchwork of drug coverage programs for older people, the poor and those who get insurance from work. But even in Canada, it’s tough to find the resources to expand coverage.

“We have to find the money to fund the program up front,” said Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who helped establish the youth drug coverage program.

Lesson 5: Canadians seem to value fairness more than Americans do

Equity. Fairness. Throughout the weekend, Mr. Sanders kept asking Canadians what they thought about the higher taxes they’d paid to finance their system. Every one among the patients and doctors selected to meet him said the trade-off was worth it because it made the system fair.

“I think it’s a really fair way to do it,” said Frederick Brownridge, 67, of Etobicoke, Ontario, as he sat by the window in his Toronto General Hospital room, with IV lines in his arms. Mr. Brownridge had had two heart valves repaired and a double bypass three days earlier. “It also means if you’re in a lower economic status or higher economic status, you’ll get the treatment you need.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said the uniformity of this message really stuck out to him: “There really is, I think, a deep-seated belief in Canada that health care is a right, and whether you’re rich or whether you’re poor or whether you’re middle class, you are entitled to health care.”

In the United States, though, Republicans control the presidency and the Congress, and many candidates last year ran on a promise to roll back government support for health care coverage.

Several recent public opinion surveys show majority support for a government guarantee of health coverage, but support declines substantially when pollsters mention that government coverage would mean higher taxes.

Mr. Sanders said he knows his bill isn’t going to become law anytime soon, but he thinks discussing the idea will help make its underlying values more broadly acceptable.

“When you talk about health care, you’re not just talking about health care,” he said in his Toronto speech. “You’re talking about values, because how a society deals with health care is more than medicine. It’s more than technology. It is about the values that those societies hold dear.”",What Did Bernie Sanders Learn in His Weekend in Canada?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/upshot/bernie-sanders-went-to-canada-and-learned-a-few-things.html

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Everyone have a glass of milk ready? Thanks to Herre Schouwerwou, we have a tasty snack in our puzzle today. We’re just going to have to find it.

Today’s Theme

This isn’t going to be as simple as taking your snack out of a cardboard box. It’s midweek, so you’re going to have to do a little detective work.

As it happens, our snack today is on both sides of a black square, as the revealer clues at 54- and 56A say. We are told that the lunchbox items we are looking for are ANIMAL CRACKERS, and the four that we are given are “cracked” by that black square.

Still don’t see them? Here’s one: 17A is MCGREGOR and 18A is I’LL ASK, and the two entries are separated by a single black square. If you look closely and even scratch and sniff the entries, which have been scented to smell like the aforementioned ANIMAL CRACKERS so you can easily track them down [Don’t listen to her. And for the love of all that is holy, do not scratch your screens. Or your newspapers. — Ed.], the last letters of MCGREGOR and the first letters of I’LL ASK spell out the cracked GORILLA:

MCGREGOR / I’LL ASK

Now you find the other CRACKERS, and don’t forget to drink your milk.

Tricky Clues

24D: I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that this is more of a West Coast thing, but the portmanteau of “smoke” and “haze” is SMAZE.

35D: BOATS take you from riverbank to riverbank, so they are the “Connection between banks?”

Constructor Notes

DISCLAIMER: No animals were harmed in the making of this puzzle. I don’t recall the exact inspiration for this puzzle, but I was probably hungry and noticed an animal split between two entries in another crossword. To limit the theme choices, I decided to use only animals in the current Barnum’s box (according to Wikipedia) that were five letters or longer. The other decision was where to place the revealer. I’m not a fan of center placement and that would mean changing the grid to 14 or 16 squares wide or just having ANIMAL CRACKER, which wasn’t great. You can’t eat just one! So I went with the “cracked” revealer that fortunately echoed the theme. Will liked the concept, but asked to remove some iffy fill and to replace HIPPO, which was the only shortened entry. Of two revised submissions, the one that had the longest split entries was chosen over the one that had VEGANS crossing ANIMAL. Kudos to Will and Joel for the double “parked” clues for 49- and 50-Across. Hope this satisfies your crossword snacking pleasure!

His ascent and brash approach have angered some members of the royal family.

Prince Alwaleed, with his Omar Sharif mustache, ubiquitous sunshades and penchant for publicity, is a relatively flamboyant figure for the royal family and is one of the most high-profile Saudis internationally. His arrest seems particularly aimed at demonstrating that no one is beyond the reach of the committee and the crown prince.

Prince Talal’s style was on display during a trip to the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh in August. In a Putin-esque turn, a promotional video from the trip shows the prince, bare-chested and in a pair of shorts, leading an entourage of men around the resort — cycling, playing beach volleyball, doing the backstroke, water-skiing, and hiking up a mountain, pumping his arms above his head triumphantly while clutching a cell phone in one hand.

Set to action-movie music, much of the action unfolds against the backdrop of his 86-meter yacht, the Kingdom 5KR.

During the trip Prince Talal, who already owns several dozen hotels in Egypt, announced a further $800 million investment in Egypt’s tourism industry. He drew criticism from some conservative Egyptians for a video that shows him meeting with Egypt’s female minister of investment and international cooperation, Sahar Nasr, aboard his yacht while he was again wearing shorts. It was unusual protocol in a public meeting for a member of the family that rules a hyperconservative Islamic kingdom.

The arrests also come as Crown Prince Mohammed has forged a close relationship with President Trump, who shares his aggressive approach to Saudi’s regional rival, Iran, and a penchant for bold decisions.

Prince Alwaleed sparred with Mr. Trump on Twitter during the American presidential election, referring to him as a “disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.” Mr. Trump fired back, also on Twitter, that he was a “dopey prince” trying to “control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money.”

It could also shake investor confidence in Saudi Arabia as the kingdom tries to shed its image as an oil-dependent petrostate. The move comes just days after Saudi Arabia held a major investment conference to drum up interest in that effort.

Prince Alwaleed made early bets on some of the technology world’s biggest stars, also including Snap, riding a boom that catapulted many young entrepreneurs to top the rich lists, and earned him handsome returns. Prince Alwaleed also made an early bet on JD.com, a Chinese online retailer, anticipating that country’s emergence as a vast e-commerce market.

In moments of corporate crises, Prince Alwaleed has stepped in to tip the balance.

When the phone hacking scandal rocked a London tabloid owned by the Murdochs, the prince went on the BBC to say that Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive officer of the British unit of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation, should resign. “You bet she has to go,” he said in July 2011. She resigned the next day.

At the time, Prince Alwaleed was the second-biggest shareholder in News Corporation, with a more than 6 percent stake. He later sold most of his stake in the company.

In the darkest hours of the 2008 financial crisis, Prince Alwaleed said he would increase his stake in Citigroup, in a move of solidarity with the then-embattled bank’s chief executive officer, Vikram S. Pandit.

Later, when Mr. Pandit faced a rebuke from angry shareholders over a 2012 pay package that totaled $15 million, the prince said he voted for it, according to a recent interview in Vanity Fair.

Prince Alwaleed has worked closely with some of Wall Street’s biggest and best known banks and investors.

Just a month ago, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs, sat across from Prince Alwaleed at a meeting in Riyadh. The two talked about investments and economic developments in the Middle East. A longtime banker for Kingdom Holding, Goldman Sachs recently helped Prince Alwaleed’s company acquire a 16 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi, the Saudi bank.

When he traveled to New York in 2016, Prince Alwaleed met with Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Bloomberg. After a meeting, Mr. Bloomberg agreed to support news programming on the Alarab News Channel, a venture that Prince Alwaleed owns privately.

Kingdom Holdings has played a role in top leadership at AccorHotels, in which it has a 5.8 percent stake. A recent news release showed pictures of Prince Alwaleed laughing with a former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who was asked to join the board of the French hotel chain earlier this year.

The arrest could shake confidence in Saudi Arabia as it tries to diversify its economy. The kingdom is planning to list the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco next year in what is expected to be the biggest initial public offering in history.

President Trump on Saturday publicly called for Saudi Arabia to list the company in the United States.
